["Shame Is any of you acutely ashamed of your illness? I shudder at the thought of people discovering it. How did you manage to overcome such feelings and tell somebody you were interested in romantically you have this issue? Or do you prefer to be single because dating would be a total embarrassment? It is for me, Iam also gay (anyone?) and not in a too gay-friendly country so it only makes things worse; iam glad I discovered this subreddit its interesting to read :) No\n\nHey by the way i have this thing and if i complain about chest pains take me to the ER. Oh and here are a few articles to read on it if you want to know.\n\nI get winded easily and should not get into fights for fear of being punched in the chest.\n\nDated multiple girls in middle school and high school who knew i had it. Than married my wife who gets on my case more about my heart than i do. Been mulling over responding to this and I agree with the poster in a previous thread - have you been consulting with a therapist? \n\nTreading lightly, your two posts on here have indicated to me your attitude relating to your outlook on life, especially suicidal idealization is dangerous. I do not expect Marfans is the direct cause of this mindset - rather simply a contributing factor. \n\nI expect most everyone in this subreddit will echo a resounding 'no' to your question - there is absolutely nothing to be ashamed of for having an illness you cannot help. I try to understand the cultural differences - as I said, I believe there is more going on here.  \n\nTo respond directly - no. Marfans has little to no role in my romantic and platonic relationships. Having kids, this will become a discussion. But Marfans is by no means a 'deal-breaker'. Yeah Ive been seeing various psychiatrist. Thanks for your thoughtful answer", "Is marfanoid habitus associated with heart issues? Is marfanoid habitus (as an Orthopedic Surgeon would observe) associated with heart issues or is that more limited to full level of Marfan Syndrome/related disorders? The marfan foundation website has more information about associated conditions. Did a doctor tell you that? I never heard that before personally, and my guess is probably not. Lots of people with hEDS have marfanoid habitus and do not have heart issues No. It is got some of the skeletal features but none of the serious heart/eye/neurological issues.", "Annoying hand flexibility? I am a healthy 20 yr old male and I have been reading around online regarding my abnormal hand and foot flexibility. Marfans lined up with a few other symptoms I have (compressed vertebrae and minor bone structure issues) but it only bothers me in my hands. My fingers/joints become more flexible and bendy every day. It is extremely annoying and is very hard for me (a person with adhd) to ignore as i fidget a lot as it is. My fingers are extremely long and the joints keep growing in flexibility. The top of my hands are completely flat. The skin between my fingers are sort of webbed? My hand muscles are diminishing as well. Is this something people with marfans experience? Should I get tested? And what kind of specialists handle this kind of thing? Thanks  That has not been my experience with Marfans. The degenerating muscles seems worrisome. I would keep trying to see different docs til one figures it out!", "I need help guys, asap. Been stuck in the bed, un able to move since Friday. I cannot extend or move my left arm or left leg without shooting, burning, ripping pain down my tricep and hamstring. Went to my GP today, the one that caught the Marfans, she is awesome. But, she is know expert in marfans. They gave my multiple cortisone and lidocaine shots in my back and sent me home. I took a nap to shake the pain and woke up sweating and the entire left side of my body on fire. This is starting to ease up after 4 hrs and a few hydrocodone I got from a friend. \n\n\nI went to the marfans foundation and did some research on pain in marfans patients. \n\n\nHe states in this video people with marfans do not do well with lidocaine and that steroids make marfans symptoms worst. My GP has also had me on prednisone steroid for two weeks leading up to not being able to move. My question is that is there anyone here who has marfans and has been given steroids at point and what was the outcome. I know the cortisone injections in my back take a few days to kick in, which means if they are what is causing this inability to move after the prednisone the last two weeks, I basically have a time bomb of cortisone in my back right now. \n\nSo, if there is anyone out there at all, please. I am begging at this point for any answers or directions of what I can possibly do. Get a cat scan, of your torso, may find a surprise What kind of surprise? I have a backwards curve of my neck with stage 4 degeneration and two s curve in my spine already at 29. There is also heavy arthritis in those areas already.  Also, outta 9 doctors in GA I cannot get a referral to pain management. I have asked them all, and they will not do it till it progresses due my age and all the junkies in this state. I am pretty sure I have MCAS aswell with marfans, because I have all the symptoms of mcas aswell. I am not sure my GP even know what mcas is. I have had a steroid injection in my hip with no issues. That does not mean I had the same thing you had. If I were you I would engage your doctor and keep communicating that you are having issues. If they cannot figure it out they need to refer you to a specialist that can. Or find a new GP, preferably one that does specialize in Marfan Syndrome. Also, you should definitely stop taking other people's narcotics. You need medical attention, not the opinion of a subreddit. I will leave this up for the moment, but will lock it if people start trying to give medical advice. Well I am my case it was a tear in my descending aorta that lead to a Hemotoba (sp?) pressing against my spine causing all types of pain Please I am begging you to not do that. I have called my doctor and left multiple messages. No call back and they are now close for the day. I am aware of the risk and aware that this is not the advice of medical professionals. Just sharing information. Please.  You would also be stopping nothing. Just cutting me off from the only form of support I have and displaying the God complexes of reddit moderators. Ahhhhhh, well I am weeks out of my echo. Having major heart issues aswell. High heart rate, BP, arrhythmias, ect.   Just got a marfans diagnosis a week ago.  Take a breath. Pause for a few mins. Reach out to your GP as soon as you can. Things will be made better with meds or just talking with someone. All of these things are manageable. Do not take meds from anyone else that is not you. I know this intimately as someone that lives with Marfan's. Thank you. Made it home from the things I had to do, hot shower and know that I know it is in the shoulder, I have got things easing up. \n\n\nWould you happen to know for the sake of anxiety and knowledge if steroids and marfans is a combo or a no go. No experience of steroids here. All I know is that they are a short term fix. Consult your GP. \u2764\ufe0f I have had steroid injections before, they relieved the inflammation and eased the pain. I do not think it is the steroids causing your situation, but I am not a doctor. I wish you well and hope it is nothing serious, but if it gets worse you better go to the ER. I have never had steroid injections and cannot speak to that. My doctors have given me prednisone steroid several times (to help clear my pneumonia and also pre surgery to boost my immune system) and i personally never had an issue. I actually always felt great on them. \n\nWe cannot really help you much other than say refer to your GP. If you have pains in your chest, arrhythmias, shortness of breath, etc you should consider going to an ACC/urgent care. If it were me, i definitely would want some scans to be done like CT &amp; X-rays. Unfortunately, my doctor and the town urgent care were closed at the time and this was basically my only souce of information besides the ever impending doom of an WebMD search. Lol. \n\n\n\nThank you all to those who replied and the information given, you guys are amazing and helped with the anxiety of what could possibly happen. I am the only one in my town and the first to even have the genetic test done so understanding and information is extremely low or what I can research alone. \n\n\nAlso, to update everyone I woke up at 4am this morning, my general time for work, I actually feel better today than I have in a month, first day this week I could even actually go to work physically. Pain and nausea is down tremendously and mobility is up, so I would say it is been the first effective treatment I have recieved in a year now. Going to pace myself through my normal 12 hr work day and go from there. if you go on the marfan foundation website and click contact us, they can help you with finding resources in your area! I also once participated in a clinical study that I found through them and the treatment was free, so it is worth reaching out to them. Hey, I know you are pretty new to the sub and community, so definitely no hate here from me, but evil Schwinn has put the work in, as a community member and a mod. He is telling you this because there is a very real danger with Marfan's of misdiagnosis of issues. His involvement in this community had been anything but \"god complex\"\n\nEven in this community, there is a whole lot of misinformation flying around regarding supplements, exercise and treatments. Accessibility is, as you have mentioned, difficult in even the best circumstance, and pretty much impossible in the worst.\n\nAnxiety and this disease are hand and hand, that is for sure! I have looked into that, I unfortunately live in GA and the only one hospital is the Emory located in Atlanta. I am in a very small rural town, and just got my diagnosis two weeks ago after a year around the state with different doctors. Thank you and I understand. I definitely dont mean anything personal at all by any of the post made yesterday and apologize for any offenses. I hopefully will never have to use this sub with the amount of anxiety and pain I was in yesterday. Not an excuse, not justification, just a lesson learned looking back on it this morning. No problem, we have all been there. It is really sucky. I would be down to talk outside of the sub if you want I live in Atlanta! Most of my cardio care is done at Emory however, once you identify specific problems that have manifested because of marfans, you can see local doctors by you. For example, i have eye issues so I see a local optometrist. Its started last year with a pitched nerve, 3 bouts with pneumoni, every doctor wanted to throw more and more PT at me and then come back for possible treatment. That turned into my current situation of marfans diagnosis and not being able to walk or more from working and all the PT for the last year. Yesterdays steroid shot was the first and only actually treatment a doctors been willing to give me in a year of constant pain and that was only because I had to be carted in the doctor's office and wheeled out. Looking back on my entire life I have all the physical traits and symptoms of marfans. If you did not know what marfans was, you would never be able to tell by looking at me. My weight has always made me self conscious and I spent years training in the gym and eating outrageously until last year when this started. That is the really mind messing thing for me, going 29 years with no issues and then just going completely downhill the last year till I was bedridden the last week.", "Is it possible to have an height of 184 cm and to have marfan? (male) ", "At an ultimatum Hey guys, I am 21 year old guy who suffers from thee lowest self-esteem ever.  \nI have a marfanoid body, meaning I have a constellation of symptoms such as: arachnodactyly, mild pectus carinatum, tons of skin striae, long arms/legs, and very skinny (6'0, 130b).\n\nI have never been officially diagnosed with Marfan syndrome, but being a health science student who reads a lot, I highly suspect it. No family history, though.  \n\n\n5 years ago I had an echo done and my measurements were 2.9cm. Skip ahead to january 2020 and my aorta is at 3.0cm. This means that my Z-score is -0.76 (given my BSA). So, up to this point in my life, my heart is in mint condition.   \n\n\nHere is where the problem lies, though. I really want to go to the gym and start lifting weights to attempt to gain some weight and muscle. My cardiologist said it was fine. However, I am very scared that what could happen is, going to the gym would commence my aorta to dilate given the changes in blood pressure and, that at the end of the day, I do not gain any weight/muscle.  \n\n\nI do not have to resources to get a genetical test done, so as far as it goes, choosing to engage in this, is in my hands.  \n\n\nThe purpose of this post is to read on the thoughts of you guys regarding my situation. I am tempted to remove this post because it is effectively asking for medical advice. We are not doctors and are not in a position to make recommendations to you that could affect your health. Please do not ask. Only you and your doctor can make this call. I get it, you want to improve your self-esteem and confidence. You feel like that would come from working out. Perhaps there are other ways to get the confidence you seek. You are making the assumption that the gym would do that for you, but is it the only thing? Is that really the right solution? The only solution? Uh, dude? Your cardiologist gave you their informed opinion and you are asking *Reddit* for confirmation.  Think about that.  \n\nGaining weight is largely about increasing calories.  Use an online TDEE calculator to find your ~maintenance level.  Start keeping a rough log of how many calories you actually consume.  500 calories over maintenance should result in a  pound of gain per week.  \n\nShould you decide to start exercising,  ease into it.  Small weights,  easy exercises, maybe something relatively low impact like swimming  or yoga.  No need to start trying to deadlift your bodyweight.  \n\nEven assuming you have Marfans,  you should remember that our symptoms exist on a  spectrum.  I have dislocated lenses,  other people have great vision.  Some have terrible cardiac issues,  others have none.  \n\nIt is also important to consider why you feel you need to gain weight.  Health? Work? Looks? Honestly if it is because you want to pick up chicks,  you may as well skip it (unless you literally want to pick them up). Women care more about what kind of person we are than how buff our bodies look. \n\n**TLDR: this is Reddit,  talk to your doctor** Hey! I am looking for opinions rather than a confirmation. Like I said, my cardiologist said I was fine given my measurements, but since I have these physical characteristics of marfan\u2019s, then that puts me in this grey area where no one really knows.\n\nIt is really unfortunate in that regards, but thanks for your extensive and truthful response, it is given me a good insight. Hey! Sorry, I am not looking for a medical confirmation, sorry if it came out to sound that way. \n\nI was looking for opinions, especially from those who have gone out to the gym and to hear about their results, given that I am fearful I might not get any.\n\nI could edit the post though? Let me know. Lmao the previous comments rlly went at u eh, I totally get ur Q and personally I think it is worth a shot. Like one of the others mentioned, ease into it. Since it is fitness theres rlly not much to lose (with ur circumstances as ur heart is fine according to ur cardiologist). Up ur cals and do weights and even if u dont get huge, it will ultimately give u better endurance (I think lmao idk enough sciencey stuff to confirm that  - but I have found better endurance with consistent exercise n just overall better energy) I am a 21 y/o f so I cant chat too much on progress with getting huge but gym has deff helped with muscle imbalances and toning up (super therapeutic too). Hello, \nI work for the Marfan Foundation and would be happy to speak with you or to put you in touch with doctors in the community who can answer your questions. There are two ways to diagnose Marfan - either a genetic test or a clinical diagnosis - this is based on what is called Ghent Criteria and included in this is the size of your aorta. On our website at marfan.org there is a physical activity guide which addresses the question of weight lifting.  For what it is worth I am in my thirties,  work a physical job,  and successfully did a bulk with no ill effects.  My dad will be sixty this year, has always done heavy lifting,  and is still clear of heart issues.  Like i said,  our symptoms exist on a spectrum,  and each case is different.  \n\nGood health,  bud. Hey, Lolita, thanks for your response, I will keep you updated. \\^\\^ &gt;Canadairy\n\nThanks man, motivating words, I will keep you updated on how I do regarding all of this.   \nAnd yeah, it is like you say, it is a marina's is like a spectrum and sometimes it is not exactly clear where you are located within said spectrum Hey, so, I had previously checked the marfan.org 's website and also read the physical activity guidelines. Mostly, it states that, the extent to which a person can engage in these activities depends on the status of their aorta mostly. However, in my case, it is really vague in the sense that, my heart is fine, but you never really know as problem could arise in your late 20's.  \n\n\nSo ultimately, I am at this point where no one can really tell for sure. Is your doctor who did the echo an expert on Marfan and also on doing and measuring the size in the correct way. Hey! No, he is not an expert in marfan's, but he is familiar with it.\n\nHe paid keen attention to the sinuses of valsalva where the measurements were taken (3.0cm).\n\nThis was followed by an CT-angiography with contrast where he ordered the radiologist to measure the ascending portion just above the sinuses of valsalva (the aortic arch) and the descending portion. All measurements were within normal limit range. According to the marfan association this gives me a Z-score of -0.76 (you need a 2cm to be diagnosed with dilation). \n\nA previous echo was done in 2014 where the measurements were 2.9cm at the sinuses. From 2014 to 2020, my BSA increased so my cardiologist stated that thee 0.1cm growth (2.9 in 2014 to 3.0cm in 2020) was normal growth. Do you have doctor references for in Toronto Canada", "14 months since aortic dissection AMA!  Hi folks! First time post here. Would love to make some marfan friends. Grab a snack, because this will be a little winded.\n\nCurrently 30 year old (gay af) male living in San Francisco\n\nI was born in a blizzard in a charming little port town in Maine in 1990, and was diagnosed with marfan's at birth. I have very typical and severe presentation: very long fingers (12 key reach on piano!) terrible vision due to dislocating lenses (anyone have any successful surgeries?), and of course the heart. My mother always jokes about how it is too big, and from a diameter perspective, she is right.\n\nI had a relatively normal childhood, learned how to be vulnerable and share about my differences really early on and I think I have always had an empathetic edge because of that. When I was 12, my parents cobbled together every penny they could find so I could get my valves repaired at Johns Hopkins by the best cardiac surgeon they could find. My heart breaks (again) knowing how much it must have cost. My first surgery was very involved and I remember all the details, but it was pretty uneventful and successful otherwise.\n\nI remember being wheeled towards the operating room at 12, and being absolutely certain that death was waiting for me on the operating table. I physically tried to fight my way out of there. I do not remember seeing, but I remember screaming and hearing. My poor mother tried to sooth me, but it took a tranquilizer in the back of my neck to put me down. I was sure this was the end.\n\nBut it was not. I woke up with a tube in my throat and immediately wanted to pull it out. I still remember the sensation of wanting to breathe, but not having to (because machines) for the first time. My parents were there. Before long the tubes were out. Within 15 days I was discharged from the hospital.\n\nThe experience changed me. Two years later, when I was 14 I read fight club. I felt edgey and raw, and like I knew things about the world other kids did not know about. I was arrogant. I was depressive. I felt like I had cheated death and I did not understand why I was still here. So I kept going.\n\nI have always felt pretty unattractive. The years of 18-22 were the hardest. I was chubby. I had a pronounced lazy eye, and I dreaded taking my shirt off (my chest is quite sunken) but all I wanted was love. Eventually I found it, many times. People liked my willingness to share about myself. I found kinship in strangers brave enough to share what they were afraid of with me. I was in love with all my straight guy friends. I was envious of all my female friends because they got the boys that I could not.\n\nIn college I came into my own, by this time my health issues had largely faded into the background. I went to the ER about once a year for panic attacks (always certain I was having a dissection) but somehow (with the help of the most amazing friends I could have ever hoped for) I graduated and got a degree.\n\nI saved up enough money to buy a one way ticket to san francisco, and I left. I stumbled around retail stores with my terrible vision and clumsiness for about a year and eventually started landing interviews for customer support in tech.  One thing lead to another and I started getting pretty good jobs! Mad Men was always my favorite show in the world, and I just wanted some purpose in my work. My health problems rarely got in the way. I get nosebleeds because of warfarin, and a cunt of a boss thought that I was a cokehead once, but that was about the only time my health got in the way of my journey.\n\nFast forward to 2018. I am in the best shape of my life and have the most loving and wonderful relationship I have ever had. One day, I come home, hop on the treadmill, and all of a sudden I feel an explosion just behind my adams apple. My vision blurs and I check my pulse obsessively. My boyfriend asks if I am OK, and I tell him \"no\" but my heart rate is very even and steady, so I ignore the dull pain for a few hours.\n\nI lay in bed trying to sleep and I know something is wrong. Eventually, after I feel a big lump in the center of my throat. The lump (I would later learn) was blood pooling in the membrane between the inner lining of my aorta and the outer. Within hours, that would have burst open and I would have hemorrhaged to death in seconds.\n\nI tell my partner to go back to sleep, that it is probably nothing, but I have to go get this checked out. My BP was different in both arms (a telltale sign of dissection) and I hopped in a CT scan on tons of pain pills.  They found a massive tear, and I was surrounded by doctors in bed 1 (critical) for a couple hours while I was prepped for surgery. My partner came and we filled each other up with as much love as we possibly could. I told him later that this time with him was the best hours of my life. I knew that if this was how it was going to end, it would be OK. I lived a wonderful life, and I was at peace.\n\nAs the wheeled me towards the operating room for the second time in my 30 years, I had a much different outlook than I did when i was 12. Back then I was all teeth and combat and defiance. This time, 18 years later I was at peace. I surrendered. As Lana said this year, 'The culture was lit, and if this is it, I had a ball.' I high-fived the surgeon before they put me under.\n\nAnd then I woke up. The same breathing tube, the same grueling but ultimately wonderful recovery. I am so blessed that my complications are minimal (I do have several that I will get into if anyone is curious).\n\nThree weeks after I got out of the hospital, my partner left me &amp; moved out. This has been the most challenging year of my life. It feels like the best parts of it are over, and I do not know how it could possibly be as good as it was for the three years I spent with J.\n\nBut the best thing about feelings is that they do not last very long. I am finding new things to live for every day, and though i do not know what the future holds, I am hopeful. Thanks for reading my story. Wow, thanks for sharing! \n\nIt is nice, in a somewhat twisted way, to hear what someone going through a dissection experiences.  It is always something that I sort of fear because I am afraid I will not notice it.\n\nIs the scar from the dissection operation?  Or is it from pectus?\n\nWhat is it like exercising for you?  Especially now that you have had a dissection and since you were exercising when it happened. No problem! I am a career over-sharer, so there is more where that came from.\n\nScar is from dissection. Had a really similar zipper from my surgery when I was 12, but the new dissection scar goes significantly higher (basically to my throat).\n\nDissection pain is different for everyone, but just listen to your body. If you want to be on the safe side, get yourself a blood-pressure cuff and monitor for differences on the left and right side. That is a great way to diagnose dissection early since your blood flow + BP is not normal.\n\nOne thing I did notice was that my voice was pretty hoarse for the year leading up to the dissection. I kept intending to check it out, but never did. Suspect the weakness in my aortic wall began near my vocal chords (I have been a singer my whole life).\n\nExercise is scary! Tbh I uber to work a lot more often than I should, because I worry about pushing myself too hard. Since I had the valves replaces so early, the dissection was a big surprise to my doctors. I am trying to get into better habits about it. I tire out a lot more easily now, but that is just the way it is. Thanks for sharing your story. \n\nIt is almost freaky how much we look alike / we could be siblings! I appreciate you sharing your story. It has taught me a lot of things from what to look for and that I am not alone in feeling certain ways that I see you expressed. I am glad you are alive and I hope things get better. Nothin heart related but I have cheated death also. So I understand your acceptance feeling, but to get through to the other side must be something I have never felt. I am sorry to hear about your partner but you seem very smart and open about yourself and you should not have much trouble in Sf. I am from SoCal so I cannot do much but I hope our paths cross one day (; let me know if you need anything man because life seems to be hard for everyone right now and we all need just a little push to make it to the next chapter. You are not alone . Much love from Cali, be safe Wow. Thanks for sharing. \n\nI have not had surgery yet, but the fear of it keeps me awake sometimes. \n\nHow large was your aorta when you had the second surgery? Do you mind if I ask how much you weigh/ how tall you are? \n\nWhat exercise do you do? My doc said not to get snow 120 bpm heart rate, so that pretty much means walking only. \n\nI was diagnosed when I was 21.  \n\nThanks Wow, thanks for sharing! That is crazy how the only pain you felt was that far up your throat behind the atoms apple. Was the pain constant or did it leave off at any time? Did you constantly monitor the size of your aorta? Interesting about the hosts was in the voice cause mine just started getting hoarse almost two years ago. Thanks for sharing! It is always helpful to hear these stories for those of use who have never experienced it and are at such a risk for it. I am so glad you were able to catch it and are doing well now. \n\nWere you getting regular check ups before? And if so what was your size at the last check up before it happened? Nice to hear from someone with a similar life experience &lt;3\n\nReach out whenever. Hope you are doing well. Pain was kind of pulsating, but felt like a rip. It was very sudden and then dull. If you feel the soft tissue right above your collarbone, kind of right below your adam's apple, that is where I felt the bulging. I was kind of like \"oh. That is new and bad. time to go.\"\n\nHave been monitored closely my whole life. Aorta and mitral replaced with st. jude valves at 12. NO indication that I was about to dissect (apparently that does not usually happen). My caridologists were shocked.\n\nI really lucked out living .5 miles away from UCSF, one of the most advanced cardiac facilities in the US! DM Show urself. I want to know! Hi!\n\nAorta was 2.6 cms -- nowhere near an indicator that it was about to burst. It is worth saying that it seems like the tear began in my throat, so that is likely why my awesome medical team never suspected anything. Had MRIs once a year. No indications.\n\nI am 6'3, 160lbs (I would love to be 150!)\n\nI will say that I felt pretty lousy for maybe six months before it happened. Do not think that anyone could have caught anything early, but it is possible.\n\nCurrently, I just walk to and from work. Walk around. Use the elliptical a little when I am feeling chubby. Docs have recommended swimming, as it kind of works out your whole body.\n\nHope life is good for you! Feel free to reach out any time &lt;3 Echos twice a year, MRIs once a year. No early warnings. :/ Wish this was a comfort to you.\n\n2.5cms. Nowhere near an indicator that I was about to tear. 2.5 cm where if tore or at the root? My limited knowledge makes me wonder what was going on up higher where it sounds like it tore. ... ummm I emailed you also just a side note. Wow that is frightening because I only go once a year and mine is slightly above \u2018normal\u2019 at the moment (some cardiologists have told it IS normal but my cardiologist that I have seen since 18 seems more familiar with Marfan\u2019s and understands otherwise). \n\nOnce it has been fixed are the risks of it happening again higher, lower, or the same do you know? Thank you. This is helpful to note. My aorta is between 42-45 atm so I think surgery is within a few years time. \n\nDo you take medications now? Are you able to be any more active post surgery? \n\nThanks again. Sorry to hear about your SO leaving. Thanks for sharing your story. I (23m) am diagnosed with marfans and my heart surgeon wants to do a replacement aortic valve and root surgery due to the dilation of my aorta. I am very nervous about the surgery but it is a preventive measure to try to prevent a dissection from happening. \n\nMy question for you is how is life on warfarin? One of my biggest worries is the lifestyle change that comes with being on a blood thinner. What are the biggest problems you face being on that medication? Holy shit that was a roller coaster. Thank you for sharing that with us. I am happy that you are here and part of the community now. And happy that you are back on your feet and ready to take on another day.\n\nI know what it feels like to have an entire life go away and figure out moving on to another one. But I can tell you from having gone through that, you will end up in a better place, I promise. Hang in there. And be kind to yourself. Treat yourself gently. Unfortunately with us, physical life only gets harder as we get older, and you will want to give yourself every advantage. Much love, brother. Maybe the year started  in the carotid artery and worked it is way down to the aorta? It is definitely odd. Perhaps just referred pain from the aorta too. &gt;Usually when you have valve replacement surgery, the aorta does not dissect. I was living a pretty active and whimsical lifestyle and I was drinking a LOT. I think those things contributed to my risk factors.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;So, basically my entire thoracic aorta has been replaced with a dacron graft, which is a fancy polyester tube that my body's immune system has learned to be nice to.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This is separate from my two prosthetic valves, mitral and aortic. The danger with all three of these foreign bodies lie in the suture lines at the top and bottom of the devices.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;With excellent blood-pressure control and a relatively stress-free lifestyle, the odds of a tear are low. Things that make BP spike (like lifting weights) should be avoided, as they make your blood pump more forcefully through all these tubes, and puts more stress on the suture lines which are the weak points.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The other thing that could happen is I could have a dissection in a previously uninvolved segment of my aorta. Since the thoracic is nearly always the segment that is involved, that is fairly unlikely too. 2.5 at the root. We did not have a measure of where it tore. This guy gets it. Carotid involvement was present &amp; I still have a small tear there.\n\nAre you a doc? Checking out your other posts, medicine seems like a hobby. I have been on it since I was 12, so do not really remember a time without it. The biggest nuisance is just needing pills with me all days.

I am just worried because I have been told going on blood thinners is very life changing. Thanks for info! I was also curious about your lifestyle before it happened. I am always hyper sensitive to not doing things that will raise my bp, though unfortunately hypertension runs on my dads side and of course I got the worst of each of my parents genes. The toughest part is that I also have adhd and taking medication for that which I highly need is an interesting balance to make sure it does not affect my bp. It definitely makes school a lot tougher for me but I could not get through without it. \n\nThanks again for answering all my questions! Best of luck to you Most cuts are easy to manage. You need close monitoring for surgery (have to go off warfarin for procedures)\nMy biggest bleeding issue has been my nose LDS was suspected after dissection. Ruled out via genetic testing. Thank you. I am so glad I found this sub \u2764\ufe0f\nSharing that story really helped me. So they are still saying it is marfans or are you getting genetics on other possibilities !

Anyone else dealing with this, and maybe found some way to feel a bit more human again? Oh the struggles of trying to live a normal life on beta blockers. Been on them for over ten years. What beta blocker is it? Some beta blockers you may respond to more than others, but unfortunately sometimes the one that is most beneficial to use, also can cause the most difficulty for a normal life. How long ha w you been raining them? Normally I would say with time you will adjust and figure it out from there but was curious about your time frame so far.

I have been taking Metoprolol (Selozok) for the last 7 years, and it has not cause me depression or anything, but, I still have some psychiatric stuff, and then I take medicine.\nIf you are feeling depressed and down, go to a psychiatrist, that may give you some medication to help with this depression.\nIt is a little annoying, cuz it has to be a doctor who knows how to handle heart medicine with psychiatric medicine, but that is what I recommend. Go to a doctor.\n\nIf you have a broken leg, do you try alternative things, or just go to a doctor?\nSame thing, if you are depressed, go to a doctor, do not try alternative things. I have taken metroprolol for over 3 years now amd I do not have chronic depression it might happen on a few occasions, I wake up without energy or motivation but it is very rare. I am not trying to gaslight you or anything, I know it is an observed side effect in some people. But I have had some psychology appointments after my aortic surgery and it is gone a long way. I recommend you try that first since it will help you tackle depression on a personal level without altering your medication. Been there.

I take Carvedilol (Coreg) and when I was on a higher dose it made me suuuuuper tired, but my doctor and I lowered my dose and increased my losartan and it seems to have gotten better. I do otherwise have depression and trauma and so on, but I found that the added help of not being tired 24/7, plus the anti-depressant I went on have been incredibly helpful in getting me to feel better and less depressed. \n\nBest of luck, remember there is always a support system nearby. to kind of highjack this comment, what are you supposed to feel when on beta blockers?

I have been on atenolol, losartan, and now bisoprolol as well and have never had ED with any of the above, in my own case. I know you were looking for something more helpful, but IIRC all beta blockers have the \\*potential\\* to cause this issue, and it is a bit of a crapshoot to find the right one for you. Def consult with your doctor and be open and honest about it. hey thanks for the reply, how did you change from atenolol to the others, how low did you have to drop the dosage? did you stop for a little while or just start taking the other types? No problem!   \n\n\nSo right now I am on a mix of 10mg Bisoprolol and 25mg Losartan in combination - before that it was 100mg Atenolol and 25mg Losartan in combination. I was personally switched off atenolol due to it being metabolized in the kidneys, which my doctors were concerned were adding undue stress as I have some other kidney issues.   \n\n\nThe Losartan was kept constant during the switch and the Bisoprolol was just substituted for the Atenolol - no weaning period or anything off the Atenolol was needed. No noticeable side effects, in fact I dare say I felt better. Just luck of the draw that the Bisoprolol seemed to 'jive' with my body more. very well explained, happy to hear that Bisoprolol worked better for you I had the same problem with atenolol. Now I am on losartan and metoprolol and no longer have ED. Definitely talk to your doctor about switching meds. Were you on Losartan aswell on atenolol or only when you switched to metoprolol, do you remember how long it took for the side effects to wear off?\n\nif Metoprolol is a reasonable option i could switch over to that too maybe They first changed atenolol to metoprolol, later added the losartan and reduced the metoprolol dose. Yeah i had the same issue with atenolol too. I switched to bisoprolol and losartan, and things improved may i ask what dosages you were on before/after? I was on 25mg atenolol for a a few years before the symptoms surfaced. Then I switched to bisoprolol 1.25mg and losartan 50mg for the last 2 years.

I am a marfoid on the autistic spectrum, and (you guessed it) a virgin.\nI have never put too much thought into what I can and cannot do. I am one of those who just wants to live and be lively. \nAs an autistic, I obviously have had a great deal of social short comings. Some claim I am straight oblivious, but I simply breath reality and the reality is that I have been depressingly alone for so long that I cannot believe that any of these situations are truly what they claim they are. I am used to being pittied, being a charity case, toyed with, etc. I have always had the sense of being less of a being.\n\nAlso, I am one of those \"proper\" autistics, I cannot force myself into a non-picture perfect situations. For example, I cannot employ a prostitute due to the lack of desire AND lack of a legitimate relationship. Even though I am a virgin, I cannot enter into acts without commitments. I have to be polite at all times and I am very reserved when I do have naughty things to say; it makes me uncomfortable.\n\nI have recently been 'sweet-talked' by a girl I have know for 3+ years. Shes understanding of my quirks and alot of her flirting is straight forward so I am able to understand her just fine. \nWe talked about alot of different aspects of what a relationship might look like and the things we could do together. All of the things we could do with each other.\nI am ready for this, to be treated the way I want to be and to finally be let inside societies best kept secret.\n\nI am not concerned, myself, over my physical marfoid structure; like I said, I am going to live.

She is afraid my hips will break, back will snap, I will dis-joint something, or my aorta will go pop, etc. \n\nHow can I reassure her that I am going to be fine? And if I am not going to be fine, what recommendations would you guys have to make things a little safer as far as Marfan's goes during such events?  Hmm, perhaps if she had more knowledge about Marfan Syndrome (the wide variety of signs and symptoms and how they vary from person to person), and you explained to her what symptoms/signs you have.  \n\n\nPerhaps she has some misconception that because it is a \"connective tissue disorder\" that your body is just going to break apart like an elastic band that is stretched too far? I do not know.  \n\n\nSex is a healthy exercise for Marfan patients as it is Aerobic. \n\nJust maybe do not bench press her while having sex, ha Hi, 39m, married, lots of sex both pre and post heart surgery. My only complaint was with the beta-blocker I used to be on(atenolol) made it difficult to climax during sex, it was changed to metoprolol years ago and I have been good since. \n\nAre you seeing your doctor regularly?  If so, and they have not made any crazy restrictions based on aorta size, then you should not worry. Sex is a great workout as far as I am concerned. \n\nBe safe and have fun. 33 AFAB here.

I do not have dislocation problems, but that is me. \n\nUnless your aorta is out of range or you are post-surgery, you ought to be fine. You can live a (mostly) normal life, including the sexual side of things. Try and give her some information, show her the marfan foundation website and explain that you follow up with your doctors as needed. Also, this is when communication will be key, and I am not talking like \"need to be a people person\" type of thing, but \"Hey, I am out of breath and feel like I am going to pass out can we take a minute\" or \"When we do things  it hurts , lets figure something else out.\" And this applies to her, too. If she is uncomfortable doing  with you, she should say so, and you can take it a little slower/work up to it. If you have the ability, you could probably schedule an appointment with your general practitioner or a phone call with your specialist and (if you are comfortable with it) allow her to sit in with you or sit in on the phone call so that she can ask and get answers from your doctors.\n\nAs always, beyond just staying safe heart wise, practice safe sex, consent is essential for both parties, communicate - do not assume that you both know what the other person wants, do not rush, and most of all. Have fun and enjoy yourselves. Its not about orgasm, though it IS nice, but rather it is about the physical connection and the affection. I will stop the lecture now.\n\nGood luck!

I guess I am writing this because I feel lost. After my most recent surgery (abdominal aneurysm) in September I have struggled to look at life the same as before.\nI was diagnosed with marfans when i was 13 (29 now), and I had open heart surgery to fix my aortic root at 16. But I bounced back quick and went right back to playing competitive sports and living life.\nEvery day of my life has always been painful (joint pain and what not), and recovery from the most recent procedure was not a big deal. As many of you know, what is you do it once then you know what to expect. Pain isnt the problem.\nBut now I just feel like I have no drive. I rather sit and do nothing. Things just dont produce the same excitement and I feel I get caught up more and more thinking about how marfans is going to affect me more down the line. \nI guess im just wondering if anyone has felt the same? And if so, I would live to know what you did to jump start life again and shake off the feeling of always looking over your shoulder for the next marfans punch. Being ok with something and coming to terms with something are 2 Completely different things.   I was around 28 when I realized that myself. I suggest going to see a counsellor who has experience with people with chronic illness. It is helped me. I just try and be thankful for what I have. I say \"fuck it, I have Marfans, but it could always be worse.\" \n\nWe cannot control our future either. We can do our best to live healthy but you never know what is going to happen.  Dwelling on the fact that I have Marfans is not going to help. Yeah it sucks, but shit happens. I try to live in the moment as that is all I have. \n\nThere are so many positive things and people in life. Either I enjoy them and participate, or I can watch others enjoy them as they just pass me by. Find those positive things in your life and love them. \n\nMarfans has done so much damage to my family; death, surgery, and depression. I will be damned if I am going down the same route.

You have had the two aortic surgeries, hopefully now, you will never need another one! Hopefully it is all uphill from here brother! Good luck my friend! I just had my surgery 4 months ago (26M - aortic root + valve replacement). I too felt flat and unmotivated for a good two months. I really feel like these past two months ive bounced back and got back into the groove of things.\n\nMy biggest suggestion would be to concentrate on what you are in control of. Worrying about what is out of your control is useless.\n\nI do the physical activities I can get away with (walking, swimming, playing badminton, do stretches). I take up hobbies and learn new skills. I keep an active social life. I try to always be mindful of posture so I reduce injury in the long term. I just do what I can. When my mind starts to worry (about anything, not just marfans :)) I just concentrate on what is happening now and what I am in control of. \n\nSure - Marfans can strike again and devistate you. But you just need to get back up and keep living your life. This is advice for people with/without marfans. If people with terminal cancer can come to this conclusion, so can you. Think about what has just happened to Kobe - a healthy guy living a great life and suddenly he is dead. It is sad, but this is a reality of life. You just need to concentrate on what you are in control of and live your life to the best of your ability.\n\nI know it is all cliche, but you really do have to always look on the brighter side of life. The minute I stopped feeling sorry for myself and just \"got on with it\" - the better I got.\n\nSorry for the text wall.

For me it happen when I woke up from my dissection surgery. I had no idea what Marfan was (but I have all the signs to be recognized as one).\n\nTwo weeks before I got to the surgery room at 2.00 AM where the doctor told me that I have zero chances to survive without surgery and 50% with a surgery, and my chances are dropping two percent per hour. I had to decide what do I want to do. It was the easiest decision I had to make in my life. \n\nI woke up only two weeks later after one extra surgery. In the first one they tried to save my aortic valve, but it was not working properly, so they had to open me a second time to replace it. This was 21 years ago. When I was 10 yo, I was watching some sensacionalist show at history that talked about egypt, priamids and probably alians. One of the pharaos they were talking about died from a sudden dissection and the narrator said \"It is believed that he had marfans syndrome, a deadly syndrome that have discret signs like those in his sculptures\" and then it showed a sculpture of this pharaos doing the flexible thumb sign. I tested myself and I was capable of doing that. Also, I researched online and found some other symptoms that I had.\n\nAs a 10 yo of course I could not handle that much information (it was a bit harder cus I did not tell my parents about it) and started to develop some psychological problems :P . \n\nAfter some years, I was ok with the psychological stuff and was no longer believing I have marfan until I was diagnosed with a dilated root at a routine checkup and the doc said \"oh have you heard of marfans? Problaby should check it out\". So yes, my inner little 10 yo said a loud fuck it and as years passed by I have had to do the root correction at 19 and was genetic confirmed at 20. \nI consider it being 10 because I correctly believed it for some time.\n\n*edit: suuuper rusty english hope it is comprehensible It runs in my family, so I was diagnosed very young. I have essentially always known. I was diagnosed when I was 6 but I did not understand. I found out and understood what it was around 10 years old I think I was diagnosed at 3, I am the only one in my family who has marfan, my parents noticed that when I was watching tv I was always so close at the device, I could not see well. I am not sure, but I think my eye doctor, being the best doctor ever, told my parents to check for marfan with some cardiologist, just in case. After that, the cardiologist suggested a genetic test, also my parents and brother were tested too, but they do not have it.\n\nI did not know until I was 7. When I was 6, I wanted to play soccer but they, my parents and doctors, would not let me, and suggested that I could go swimming instead. One year later it turned out that I was a really good swimmer, the team's coach who was watching me since the beginners lessons asked my mother if I could be interested in competing, but my mother did not allow it, I was angry about it, and they told me why I could not do it My little one was clinically diagnosed around 18/20 months, genetically confirmed around 3 (it took multiple tries to get testing approved by insurance). At his 18 month checkup, his pediatrician sent us to a geneticist. This geneticist was actually the doctor who taught connective tissue disorders to med students at our large university. She sent us for a dilated eye exam\u2026then cardiology\u2026then the rest is history. He is a spontaneous mutation. I was diagnosed in sixth grade. I was chronically underweight, and a lot of the adults in my life were convinced I was anorexic. Sixth grade was when I was diagnosed with ectopia lentis, which is rare enough it automatically triggered a Marfan\u2019s evaluation. I did not have any of the genetic markers they were testing for at the time, but I hit literally every phenotypic marker (facial features, hand signs, kyphosis, funny-looking family member on my mom\u2019s side, ectopia lentis, kyphosis, enlarged aorta, body type), which is enough for Marfan\u2019s to be diagnosed. A family member who has diagnosed Marfan\u2019s is another diagnostic criteria, so my diagnosis also helped my sister, who has slightly fewer phenotypic markers, get diagnosed.\n\nOnce we had an official diagnosis we were able to enroll in the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (since we still did not know what gene was causing our symptoms) and recently they found an intronic mutation in my family\u2019s FNB1 gene! My eyes were what got me diagnosed, too! It was discussed my whole life but genetic testing was done at 41, 9 months before my aortic valve replacement. When I was 1 yo, my parents took me to my normal pediatrician, that is when the pediatrician saw that I was different, my heart had the famous Marfan murmur, and  my hands were significantly longer then most 1 year olds, then they had me do some dna testing, and the results said that I was a full Marfan.

Had he gotten an echo a year prior, it would have saved his life.", "Is there any possibility for eye Surgery? Hello guys,\n\nI have marfan syndrome since birth with almost possible abnormalities. \nHowever I am managing almost everything. Except for the eye sight (myopia). I have been facing issues lately while working at office. I have consulted three super speciality eye hospitals. All the doctors have the same response that they cannot operate on my eyes as the lens are shaky, pupils do not dilate and I have a weak retina. They suggested to have a yearly retinal checkup. I am feeling hopeless. \n\nWhat do I do ?? \nDoes anyone have a solution?\n\nNote: I am from India Whenever I am faced with a situation where I am not able to fix the problem, I try instead to fix the environment around the problem such that there is less of an impact. \n\nFor example, I used to work in the film industry. However this is a physically demanding career, and as someone with Marfan syndrome, I simply could not keep up. I cannot not have Marian syndrome, so I did the only other thing I could do: I went back to school and got a degree in computer science, and now I am a scientist. Turns out, this was a WAY better career for me. \n\nNow, failing eyesight is a whole other matter, and I do not mean to say that a career change is necessarily helpful or even possible for you, but I tell you this to suggest thinking about this problem in different ways, if fixing your eyes is not possible. I wish you the best, and hope you find the solution you need. I had intraocular lens replacement,  however I had to have my retinas examined beforehand to ensure they could handle it.  How well do glasses and contact lenses address your myopia? You should ask to see a specialist. I was lucky to find one, after being refused surgery by two other local surgeons. This whiz kid doctor just shrugged and said \"No problem.\" He did mine, and it went very well.  I did need a custom-made lens though, and the surgery took longer. My mother had similar surgery on both her eyes from him as well, and it also went very well. Could you please tell me the name of the surgery? I wear glasses. They help me see the world. But, having myopia destroyed relationships too as people mistook me being arrogant when I could not see them at a distance and greet them. I feel bad that I am being misunderstood and ignored at times. Also working on computers is not as easy as people may think. This is great advice! Not only for marfans but living life in general! There are different types of eye surgeries. What type are you seeking? \n\nIf you are seeking laser surgery to correct the myopia, my understanding is that this is not recommended for Marfans patients as the failure rate is high and often results in total loss of sight.  A relative had dislocated lenses (both eyes) and the surgery for that was very successful.  Another had a retinal tear and a detachment and both surgeries were successful.  But I have been consistently and repeatedly warned against laser surgery for myopia. It was an Intraocular Cataract Lenses (IOLs) surgery with an Artisan lens.

Just hoping to get some advice/guidance.\n\nSo I came across info on Marfan's Syndrome about 6 years ago when looking up stretches for a shoulder injury (related to my joint problems) and was taken aback by how many of the signs/symptoms I have.\n\nI have never brought it up to a doctor because my family basically chuckled and said that I am being a hypochondriac. Something made me think of it again recently so I thought I would post here and get some advice on whether it is something I should approach a doctor about? I do not have any super obvious symptoms looks-wise but there are quite a few things that I do have.\n\nSo to start I am a 25 year old female. I would say average height: 5'6\" to 5'7\" depending on the doctor lol and about 120lbs. This is going to be a long post probably sorry.\n\nGeneral Things:\n\nI was very thin, doctors always pegged me as underweight, growing up and into my early 20s but have filled out more the last few years. \n\nI have long and somewhat \"knobby\" limbs - elbows kind of stick out, knock-kneed, etc. I have very small wrists and ankles and can wrap my thumb and middle finger around my wrist and overlap.\n\nMore specific things:\n\nI have a \"joint disorder.\" They never put an exact name on it other than hyper-mobility. Basically my ligaments are looser or extra stretchy. I am not flexible persay, but my joints extend farther than they should. My knees sit farther back than they should and I have no idea how to explain this but have you seen people put their palms down on the table and turn their elbows in and out? I can do that - things like that. I have a lot of joint pain.\n\nI have fairly large hands with long fingers and small wrists. \n\nNothing abnormal has ever been found at the eye doctor but I am nearsighted with astigmatism in both eyes.\n\nI do not think I have \"concave\" chest, but I do have an uneven one. One side of my chest is sticks out considerably farther than the other (left side for anyone curious lol).\n\nI have a small jaw, crowded teeth, and a very high arch in my mouth.\n\nI am not flat footed, but I have \"abnormal arches\" and had to wear special shoe inserts for sports when I was younger.\n\nI have a narrow face but not strangely long or anything.\n\nI know this is not necessarily related, I have heard there can be a correlation, but I have ADHD as well.\n\nThat said, I have a perfectly straight spine and no heart or lung defects or issues that I know of. Other than an umbilical hernia surgery when I was one years old, I have never had surgeries or any major illnesses.\n\nI do not have breathing problems really but I had an inhaler for \"sports induced asthma\" when I was in high school. I was a long distance runner (cross country) so it was mainly for that. Nowadays I get out of breath easy but I attribute that to being 25, out of shape, and a smoker lol.\n\nThe thing is, I know I inherited a lot of this from my dad. My dad and I look a lot alike and have a lot of things in common. My dad is tall and thin (about 6'3\"-6'4\" and 225lbs - he is a little heavier now in his 50s lol but he was very thin when I was a kid). He also has large hands, small wrists, and long limbs. He also has a narrow face, crowded teeth, high palette, and the same uneven upper chest - his is visibly noticeable. Then again, mine probably would be too if I was not a female - luckily breasts hide it pretty well.\n\nMy dad has heart problems though and lung problems. Nothing too serious just a fairly mild arrhythmia which he takes medication for and then high blood pressure. The lung thing was more serious but is okay now. When I was 7 (so he was about 38) his lung collapsed. I do not remember the details but it was not from pneumonia or anything like that. They ended up having to remove it and he has one lung now.\n\nAnyways, please forgive the novel! Do you think this is something I should see a doctor about or just leave well enough alone and forget about it?\n\nEDIT: Added a couple details :)\n\n\n \n\n  ", "Do my hands exhibit positive signs of Marfan?  I would say that you do,but not a Dr. By the way, I apologise for this type of post. I am in the UK, and the NHS is sometimes hard to go to with queries like this without feeling like you are wasting their time. I actually called today, but the nearest appointment I can get (as it is non urgent) is over 2 weeks away and will be a phone call. I feel I would like to build a case, so wanted to know if my hands align with someone with Marfan.\n\nI am mid 30's, but I have been curious as to whether I have Marfan since early 20s (tall, thin, odd looking fingers, never gain weight). Never spoke to anyone about it thought. As I get older, I feel I am falling apart a lot sooner than all of my friends. I have had an inguinal hernia repair a couple of years back, often having issues with tendons, varicose veins etc. I also had an ECG a few years back due to an unrelated issue but that seemed OK. I believe these kinds of posts are not allowed, but the photo definitely shows positive thumb sign in my non-medical opinion. But keep in mind that the main symptoms of Marfan Syndrome include Eye + Heart complications as well as tall stature, so the hand and wrist signs are not a major criteria. You can get a geneticist do have a DNA test done to confirm your diagnosis and a cardiologist to check whether or not you have an aortic aneurysm. Eye doctors can confirm if you have eye problems or not. Thanks for your reply, and again sorry for posting this (I know they are discouraged). That is good to know, I am not well informed about it but those points you have mentioned will give me focus for my research into it Thanks for your input. It is good to know I am not imagining things and will give me more justification for exploring this with my Dr. Your hands and wrist look EXACTLY like mine bro.", "Are there any bodybuilders, athletes, or healthy muscular people here or elsewhere with marfans who are not deceased? I am wanting to discover just how muscular people with marfans can be. I desire to be \u201cbig\u201d and have the courage to attempt to get there while healthy. Before I fell sick I was on a journey of physical activity to bulk and was quite surprised about how big I was getting but despite this I was not a long-term lifter. Now I am concerned and curious as I recover of what the realistic possibilities are for us when it comes to muscle size. If you are any of the types listed in the title, or know of any with marfans, tell me so I may know how big you / they are. Thank you. One I know of is ( who played two years for Baylor University, and was a first-round prospect in 2014, but was diagnosed with a mild form of Marfan's, and committed to learning more about it to safely continue his basketball career. He started playing professionally again in 2016 overseas, since I am pretty sure he would never be medically cleared in the NBA.\n\nAside from that, I cannot think of any off the top of my head since I am not much of a sports guy. I think that it is possible to get big but it will require you to be more strict in the way you work out.   \nI play soccer casually every weekend and workout about 4 times a week but I never ever strain during my exercises, progress is slow and I am not big, but I have defined muscles. My main obstacle is actually not my heart but my scoliosis which makes it difficult as hell for me to work out in a balanced manner. Got a ton of muscle imbalances I am trying to sort out.  \n\n\nAt the end of the day if you plan on taking this road you got to talk to your doctor and also have checkups more often if possible. If you have a very very thin frame you will never be muscular. Which is the case of most marfans. Also, if you manage to stop your heart from exploding from the constant straining of heavyweight lifting (needed if you truly want to be muscular and not just \u201cfit\u201d or normal looking), the shitty joints that come with marfans will prevent you from continuously working out without pain. So yeah, it is better if you try to assume earlier that we will never be muscular.  I have never been able to compete in a body building competition but I am a former athlete. I am now 56. I played college basketball and was a high jumper and long jumper. In my prime I was 6\u2019 155 which was pretty thin but I had very strong legs. I would encourage you to read up on carb cycling, it was the only way I could keep on weight when I was younger. When I played basketball I enjoyed a bowl of ice cream after practice. I needed it to maintain. \n\nGood luck!  Btw take care of your joints!

Depends on what you mean by \"mild\" symptoms. If you mean you do not have any real significant heart problems but you are still tall, gangly and gaunt, yeah, you can hit the middle of your medically healthy weight and still look thin and get negative comments from others. This is exaggerated in a lot of places (particularly anglo places) because being overweight is \"normal.\"\n\nIf you are tall, gangly and gaunt, you would probably have to be overweight or so to fill in your frame, but no doctor will support a marf being overweight with our risk for heart and joint issues.  if you can find ways to safely build muscle, I have found success with resistance training cruel world ): I had success with archery.

Gaining weight has been hard from me even on 10,000 calories a day (and that was a massively unhealthy diet while I did martial arts I should not have.)\n\nCaveat emptor, I do not have a mild case.  I have a severe one.  I may not be the best person to ask.  But i will be completely honest with you.  I always look odd.  I am just disproportionate.  My armspan is 7'4\".

I gained like 20lbs in this period and went from 117lbs to 137lbs. I had a little fat on my stomach but my legs, arms, shoulders and chest were all still skeleton like. I posted on this sub and people told me you cannot gain weight all over your body unless you also do exercise as well, which is obviously a problem considering we have Marfans. I then got irritated because CLEARLY there are millions of people around the world who are overweight and have fat all over their entire body by sitting around eating junk food, so why do I have to exercise to fill out my limbs and torso? Why cannot I just put meat on my bones by eating a ton?\n\nI ended up giving up because it felt so pointless. I was getting towards a healthy weight but my body still looked extremely skinny and Marfan like. I want to wear a t-shirt and have my arms fill out the sleeves, I want to put a hoodie on and not have it slide down my boney shoulders and chest area, I want to wear shorts and not have people comment on how stick thin my legs are. If I cannot do that then what is the point in gaining weight at all? Maybe that is because 137lbs is still pretty underweight.\n\nI am at 132lb/6\u20190 and still look skinny af, but again, 137 is STILL underweight.\n\nMaybe until you hit 145-150 that is where you will start seeing more fatty distribution?\n\nAlso, the workout part, this is very case by case dependent. Things like cycling consistently and properly can really tone your legs alongside a healthy diet. True. Maybe you are right. I think because it took so long  and was costing me so much money (constantly buying food) plus being more and more difficult to find time to clear the calories and not noticing the slightest improvement I just gave up in frustration. Looking back I wish I kept going but I would already gained 20lbs and figured that would have done something for me, even if a minor improvement. 20lb is a-lot of body weight gained.

I find putting pillows in an L shape helps. Muscle relaxers during the day and cannabis (I am in Canada) at night helps me when the pain is most acute.  You could check out KT tape and thin shoulder slings to help with subluxation. This can help with the slipping and dislocating. Also, CBD oil can help with pain and other products that are topical like red hot really relax the muscles. Hope that helps.", "How do I gain weight I have been eating loads of junk food drinking soda and high protein fat milk even fast food but I have not gained a single pound and any weight I do barely gain goes to my stomach how can I make it go to my arms and legs I do not think it is going to work out for you with this plan. When I was young I could not put on any weight. My doctor put me on the Adkins diet. Strange as it seems I gained weight. I went from 125-145 in 6 weeks. I played basketball daily so it mostly went to my legs I hope it works for you, but for me, gaining weight just was not in the cards for me. I am a guy, but ironically food just went straight to my hips, but arms and legs close to nothing. I just needed to make my peace with it. Be healthy. It is far more important. And like someone else said, just do your best with muscle tone. But for me even with that I hit the forearms weights and plier grips training workouts and all I did was torture myself for years lol I got stronger, but it amounted to looking the same in terms of my forearms and at the time that is what I cared about changing. Whatever your sitch is just try and make peace with whatever it is if possible.\n\nMy first job I was a server at a retirement home and I hated how all the old ladies would always comment how skinny I was and needed to eat more, even grabbing my arms and pointing it out lol. And so I did eat more, but all I did was become overweight and still got people saying that I needed to eat more- I did not need to eat more lol. The biggest tormenter was inside myself and drove me to worry about whether or not someone could ever love me like I was. Just nonsense though. I found a beautiful woman who did love me very deeply, but I realized physical appearance is not the biggest issue for anyone in a relationship. Much more important things. I wish you well pal\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d You could try beer, and keep it up with the junk food and fatty foods, but sometimes it is with age for some people... our bodies slowly change as we get older obviously and sometimes weight for us can take time too. I am a girl and was stick and bone until I was 22/23 when I was drinking a lot of beer, stress eating all the time and now at 30 it is all at my hips, stomach and thighs. Guys gain their weight in different places than girls though. Hopefully yours comes soon! If you lift weights make sure you eat enough as well to build that muscle instead of losing weight.", "Aortic Root Surgery Done Mar 31 Hi all, I posted back on Mar 24.  Here is the update!  Went into surgery for aortic root and valve replacement on Mar 31 to correct a 9cm aneurysm and malfunctioning valve.

The surgeries all have a very high success rate.  \n\n\nWe are only getting better and better at treating Marfan syndrome, and it is even better when it is detected early on in life (even in your 20s) since monitoring can begin.   \nIn general aerobic exercise is recommended for those who have Marfan Syndrome and to avoid heavy weight lifting and to avoid high risk of physical contact sports. But your cardiologist may have different advice. Source: (  \n\n\nIt is very good that you are getting tested for Marfan Syndrome. Does it show what the measurement of your aortic root/sinus is?

In the end, sometimes your insecurities can sabotage things, but sometimes even if you do not let them, you are still in a relationship with another human being, and even if they do not have marfans, and are relatively perfect, they are still a person... a whole package of there own issues that can, despite your best efforts, still end in divorce, break ups, tragedy etc. - then for people who believe in God or spiritual things, throw in all those factors and you realize your insecurities *can* play a big role, but in the end, if you have them under control or have a correct perspective on them, they are truly still just one small factor in the end in the greater scheme of things.

Would just being plain skinny give a false positive?)\n\nThumb test: negative, unless I really, REALLY stretch my thumb.\n\nMy elbows are a little bit more flexible than one would expect. \n\nMy feet are fine, and all of my limbs seem properly proportioned.\n\nI have have an EKG because I was having heart palpitations due to GERD.

It manifest itself differently in different people. And they are still finding out new things. Do you have other symptoms or why do you ask in particular?  Thank you for your answer. I have a bunch of symptoms but the only thing that is unclear is why my grandfather died. He surely died of a heart disease but I do not know if it was an aneurysm. My symptoms are increased height (exceed my target height with 10+ cm), skinny build, long limbs, family members with myopia, mildly high arched palate, stretch marks on lower back, positive thumb test (slight arachnodactyly), cutanous syndactyly and generalized hypermobility. I have contacted my GP and she wants to learn more about Marfan's before she refers me It should not matter if it is invasive if it could protect your health and life. I would ask for sure and glean any information you can about that incident. I had a similar situation with my family actually. And i kept prying and found out that my last name is not \"allegedly\" my true last name because my grandfather was a bastard in the truest sense of the word. So that made it essentially impossible to trace my history on that side which is where I get most of my Marfanoid features. But please let me know how it goes, you already exhibit more markers than I do because my eyesight is perfect and I am not hyper-mobile so I am really fortunate in that respect. But even if you cannot find the history or pass the genetic test you could still be passed with a clinical diagnosis. Good luck, with the results.  You are right. My mom was shocked about my stretch marks. I have an appointment with my GP (Monday). I have 2 GP's, and unfortunately, the \"good\" GP (W.) has discussed this with her collegue (K.) who wants to have me at a rheumatologist instead and told \"some people are just hypermobile\".

My son had his eye lens removed, and I have been trying to figure out what he sees. If your lens has been removed, what do you see? Can you see anything? Can you see far/near? How focused is your vision? Did it affect your depth perception? I am just curious. \n\nHis lens was removed on one eye and now there is talk of removing the other eye's lens.  Was it removed, or replaced? I had detached retinas, both eyes, and had surgery to fix them. Which caused cataracts, so I had my lenses replaced. I see WAY better now. Because he is only four (2.5 at the time), they do not replace the lens since his eyes will grow. He can choose to have a lens put in when he is older. So, I am curious what he sees without a lens. You do make a good point...in adults they replace the lens.  Wow, that is rough.\n\nI did a little research, and it leads me to believe that he will not be able to focus properly :/ some serious corrective lenses will be required. \n\nThe plus side? Whenever he can get them replaced, they can do amazing things. I went from being ridiculously nearsighted to only needing a pair of readers. I also read that he can see ultraviolet rays because there is no lens to stop them.  Everything is equally out of focus, but if I squint really hard I can read! I have no depth perception but that is because I have look out of one eye at a time - one has a prescription that allows me to see far, and the other a prescription to see near. That also means I cannot see 3D movies. I had a little trouble learning to drive, but my dad took me out in a really slow residential neighborhood and when I overshot how much room to leave a parked car on the side of the road, he made me stop, get out of the car, and  see how far away I was. That helped a lot. I do not really have much trouble with judging depth beyond that. \n\nGetting my lenses taken out actually helped. Light used to reflect off them strangely at night and I would see extra glare. My vision is corrected perfectly fine through glasses and contact lenses. Later, I had a retinal detachment, and somehow my surgeon was able to reshape that eye so that I technically have 20/20 distance vision. It is amazing how much eye care has advanced! \n\nTl,dr: I do not know if anybody has a similar experience, but it is just blurry :) I have read that too, and I think that is fascinating! I have read some people with artificial lenses can too, but I am not sure how to check if I can or not. Had both lenses removed 20 years ago. Still have not had replacements put in. I can see ok without glasses or contacts I guess. I can get around and avoid tripping over stuff. I routinely take the trash out and go get the mail without glasses/lenses. My vision is corrected with contacts or the super thick glasses to around 20/20. Everything is out of focus without, but I can still see stuff. Biggest drawback of the glasses is not having peripheral vision. The other kids bugged me about the glasses growing up, but it was always more of an oddity that they were curious about. It never really has restricted me much. I am aphakic - I have no lenses in my eyes.\nI can see GREAT with contact lenses (multi-focals), but my prescription is +15.\n\nWithout contact lenses I have very limited vision - I can walk around my house and stuff but I would not be able to recognize someones face or read anything.\n Thank you so much for this. Now I understand why he is sensitive in the sunlight. Do you wear contacts 24 hours a day? Do you have glasses for when you do not have contacts on? I always think about what would happen if there is an emergency at night and we lose track of each other and he is not wearing contacts or glasses.  Thank you for your reply. I am glad to hear that with contacts and glasses you almost have 20/20 vision. I worry about this for my son. I really want him to see his world in focus. Do you ever consider having your lenses replaced? Thank you for your reply. I did not know they made multi focal contacts. Are they only for adults? I wonder why his doctors have not told us about it?! I read an article that showed pictures of how they thought ultraviolet colors were perceived by people without lenses. Apparently, while people with lenses see black, without a lens the color looks purple and they showed a flower that appeared all yellow, but without a lens, the tips were white.  How old is your son ? Yes a lot of eye doctors do not even know about proclear multifocal XR contact lenses unfortunately\n\nI am 27 now but I have had my lenses out since I was about 20 and they still did not want to do an implanted lens back then because I was too young and wanted to wait until I was at least 25\n\nHowever I can almost see 20-20 with these multifocal contact lenses so no implanted lens was necessary \n\nSmall children should be able to wear contact lenses - probably not babies \n\nReading up it says 10 year olds can wear them no problem \n\nIf your son needs glasses it is going to be OK but kind of suck because they will be thick.  I do not have glasses because of this \n\nAlso one note - the eyes lens blocks out UV light - black lights are very bright to me and hurt my eyes, so I do not recommend taking your son \"glo bowling\" or anywhere with black lights because they do hurt\nMy eyes a bit\n He is 4 now and he wears a contact. Thanks for the tip about black lights.  I used to wear contacts all day, but after several surgeries for a retinal detachment, my eyes cannot tolerate them anymore, so I wear glasses. I am still able to navigate in the dark without any visual aids, though.\n\nYou are wise to be concerned about night vision, because it is harder to see at night. But I can still see large objects and shapes. So from his perspective, he would probably use larger objects as a guide rather than smaller signs or paths, even if they are more logical. \n\nThe issue that affected my night vision though was my retina, whereas having my lenses removed did not make a difference beyond removing the extra light that was refracting off of them, so I imagine he would be able to see as well as he usually does at night! \n\nIt is so hard to figure out how another person sees, because even people with the same physical issue see things differently. It is so great that you are taking the time to learn everything about what your son is experiencing. He is in good hands!!! \n\n I plan to someday. It is just a matter of being in a place where I can with insurance. I do not want to pay out of pocket to do it.  Thank you so much for your comment. I would assumed that once the lens was removed he could not see anything out of that eye.  Oh yes, definitely! Oh no! Think of the lens just like the lens in a pair of glasses. I do not know if you have ever needed glasses, but a glasses lens filters light and clarifies the images you are seeing so you can see clearly and sharply. The lens in the eye does exactly the same thing. Without it, you are still seeing all those images, just blurry. Like when your eyes water. It is very blurry. I had mine removed when I was 5-6 back in the early 90's. Everything is a blur and I would say almost like it is pixelated.  Oh wow. You were little like my son.  I can tell you that it was scary. Slowly losing your sight and now really old enough to grasp why. I thought it was happening because I had stared at the sun.  Yes I wear contacts because my vision is really bad, so now I understand his vision is like mine but probably worse. I cannot function without my contacts or glasses. \n\nJeez, my poor boy walking around like that. It is interesting because he can get around just fine: watched TV, plays...its like it does not bother him.  I bet it was scary. Did you tell anyone about it? How did they discovered it was a lens dislocation? Because my grandmother, mother and older sister all have marfans it was very likely for me to have it as well. I got diagnosed at the age of 4. I ended up having my lens taken out because they were doing my sister's and just figured they should go ahead and do a two for one type of situation. ", "Anyone else also have ADHD?

It has not really changed since I was \u2018officially diagnosed\u2019 at 13. Because I also have ADHD (and am in grad school - in my 30s btw) I do take adderall, though I only take IR 20mg max.

I try to take it incrementally instead of a whole dose (and my Dr is okay with this) but knowing that the body also becomes used to the drug and a higher dose is needed also makes it difficult. I try not to take it unless I absolutely have to in order to prevent this. \n\nDoes anyone else have to deal with this? Just wondering if anyone else can relate to this issue of having to balance these two things. I have got OCD and I take zalasta as needed. \nMy doctors told me it is fine in my case. \nBut I think you should ask your doctors. If they say it is fine, do not worry too much. I am 29 with ADHD innatentive but am currently unmedicated because of concerns with my heart. It is tough, especially right now, I am grateful to be able to be working from home, but it is definitely making my ADHD worse Me. I actually got diagnosed with ADHD first. I did not get diagnosed with Marfans and EDS until I was 25 *raises hand* exercise and microdoses are what I use to help with ADHD and depression.

I have come to the conclusion that sooner or later I will need to have heart surgery because of my aorta. I wanted to ask this community: How was your experience after a heart surgery? I am not sure how do they fix the aorta, but I have always wondered how does it change ones lifestyle. if if its replaced, does that mean the heart will not be affected by marfans? Idk. Not trying to get into medical field here, just wanting to hear your experiences. Thank you and stay safe. I have an artificial heart valve and a Dacron sheath over my remaining ascending aorta.  The post surgery experiance was a fairly long recovery. I had an infection in the hospital and a collapsed lung but it finally inflated.  During recovery I actually coded but I do not remember that. My lifestyle is mostly unchanged.  I am not supposed to lift heavy things or exert myself too much but I do not do that much anyway. I will take blood thinners for the rest of my life, but with the valve I have, I have to take less of them. I also take beta blockers but so do the majority (right?) of people with Marfan's.  Otherwise nothing too out of the ordinary. It did take a lot time to get used to the ticking, and it still freaks some people out but I think I have gotten mostly used to it and also I think it ticks less loudly over time.  Of course there is a good chance you will not need a valve.  FWIW I was 44 (I think) when I had mine done.  I would be happy to answer any other questions. Nope, you have still got Marfan. Do not expect to start running marathons or scuba diving any time soon.\n\nIt is mainly an intangible benefit: you will be able to live the life recommended for people with Marfan without worrying about dying due to a dissection etc. Thanks for the reply. Dang, it would be a dream if you could play sports again post surgery. Still, not having to worry about dissection is huge. Thanks for sharing. I would like to ask, when did you began to have to worry about surgery? I mean, when did your echo's started to show worrying readings? I did not start worrying about surgery until I went into the ER.  I do not really exhibit any physical symptoms and more than one doctor told me I did not have it. I somehow convinced myself that I was the only person on my mother's side of the family (10 people) that did not have it.  I went to a clinic with palpitations and they tried to send me home with allergy medicine. I insisted on an EKG and it turns out I was in afib (and had been for a long time).  I went immediately to the ER and they saw the aneurism and they scheduled the surgery for as soon as the blood thinners they had just given me would wear off (a couple of days). My brother goes like every year to have his dialation checked, which I believe is the norm. I am glad you went to that ER. Cheers Doctors replaced my ascending aorta with Dacron, from the valve to the carotid arteries. It was kind of a big deal stopping the heart etc.. Fortunately, my valve was spared so I do not need blood thinners.\n\nRecently, I was talking to someone who mentioned PEARS, it is a less invasive procedure where they 3D model your aorta and create a wrap that goes around it, like a stent that goes on the outside. Prevents your aorta from getting larger.\n\nPost surgery was painful but manageable with otc medications acetaminophen and ibuprofen.\n\nIt has been 7 years and I suffer from major depression now. Not really outcome I would hoped for but it is what it is. Thanks for sharing. If I may ask; how old were you when you had this procedure done? Also, I am sorry about your depression, I know its hard. Stay strong.  How big was your aorta do you know? No, I would have to look that up. But they said I would not have lasted more than a few more days. It would have dissected. Which is exactly what happened to my mother and both of her sisters. I am very sorry to hear that. Glad you recovered well. God bless. Thanks.  Take care of your body. You only got one! :)", "Can a doctor diagnose you on your first visit? I wanted to ask. If I may have some symptoms and want to go to the doctor. Can he/ she diagnose me right away. Or will she say that we cannot see anything now but maybe later in life. If you know what I am saying? Because if my only symptoms is skinny and not that you all. Also I have big hands/ fingers and thin wrists. How will she test me for that? Theres a lot u have to ask ur dr. No one can rlly tell u off the bat sadly, just be patient and schedule a call or visit with your doctor - unless u feel really unwell maybe wait for hospitals to cool down from Coronavirus before you pay a visit. Ultimately if ur Dr is unsure and u have no family history of marfans they may want to preform a gene test which will give u a definitive answer:) Went to a geneticist for my diagnosis. You essentially have to meet certain criteria to be diagnosed as having Marfan Syndrome, or any connective tissue disorder for that matter. They will ask you to do a series of things and examine your body. Each attribute they observe is given a \u201cscore.\u201d For example, being able to touch your thumb to your wrist is given a number towards the overall score, along with things such as having flat feet or an inward/outward chest. \n\nAfter they have completed the exam, they can more or less tell whether or not you have the syndrome but they may ask you to do an additional blood test for genetic testing as well :) id definitely recommend getting checked out if you are worried. Sorry for my English. My dad is not with me anymore. The gene test will it be taken only from me. And will it tell if I have this disease Alright. Well is it sure that I have the disease. Because I can actually touch my thumb with wrist. And some parts on my hand is kind of hyper mobile The genetic test will first start with you but based on their findings they may suggest other members of your family get genetic testing done to see if they have the syndrome. Yes they will be able to tell you if you have the disorder once the results are in There are soooo many requirements you have to meet. Like the other person commented- you will not know until you are seen by a professional Yeah but none in my family has it. Cannot they just do the test on my. And how is the genetic test going on? The doctor could make a clinical diagnosis, based on tests and evaluation, or take a DNA sample which could take weeks or longer. I grew up with the clinical diagnosis and when I went in for surgery on my aorta they took a tissue sample and confirmed that it was Marfan\u2019s... which was not exactly shocking news by that point. To answer your question they will likely want an Echocardiogram, CT, or MRI done before they make a diagnosis. And will they after those tests be 100% sure. I mean I have Pectus. I have long hands and thin wrists. That kind of it. Can all that be detected with what you are saying? Without doing genetic testing they cannot say that you 100% definitely have this, but I would trust the educated opinion of your doctor over anything else. I spent a lot of my teen years pretending I did not have it and maybe they were wrong, but they were not. Thank you. Last question. It is not that much related with this. My dad was really skinny and had really skinny wrists at my age. Could I get the genetics from him. And that could be the reason that I am so skinny? Yes of course. But if you think you might have it then you need to see a doctor, Marfan\u2019s is deadly left untreated. I lost my father to it, he was 25. I am sorry for that man. Thank you for your help. I have never seen my dad irl either. Take care It is really important that they do segregation analysis on your family member\u2019s DNA too because they might not find any mutations that confirm Marian\u2019s for you, or they might find multiple possible mutations, and this helps to narrow it down. If they also have DNA from your family members then they can see if the mutation has occurred before and you inherited it recessively or dominantly. The genetic mutation is really important for them to confirm because it will make you eligible for specific clinical trials or future treatment once you have this result. They will also measure your aortic valve, your limbs, wingspan, curvature of your spine, sometimes look at your teeth, eyes etc. Some people have one or two or even more of those attributes without having Marfan\u2019s, but aortic valve enlargement is a big one. I have had at least 3 doctors immediately recognize that I have Marfan syndrome by having a simple glance at me. I believe it is possible, but they would test you mainly to be on the safe side.", "How to cope with the dehumanization of yourself by others due to your appearance? (Advice / venting) hi guys, I have come a long way in 2021 towards self-acceptance and love, I do not mind my own appearance when it relates to marfans anymore, however, I absolutely HATE the regular dehumanization that I face by others as a result of how I look. I overhear random people call me slang words for thin people, discuss my weight, and treat me unfairly when compared to the way they treat others. I am only a human and like each other animal in the world I did not ask to be born much less to be born with a rare condition outside of my control but yet I am being treated like it was all a conscious choice of mine? I feel like I have a lot to give to the world that will never be taken seriously because even at my fittest I am small and if I am not fit I am super skinny. I feel rlly lost and do not know what to do. I also strongly feel thar I deserve basic human respect rather than active disrespect. thank you \ud83e\udd72  That is so horrible that people say comments to you. I am sorry. There is nothing really anyone can say to make it right. But I guess I have similar experiences I will share what works for me. Because I am also really skinny (and tall). I got comments when I was younger. That is what kids do, they say what they see. (Adults should know better!!)\n\nEven so, I still hear those teasing words haunting me forever... and every time someone comments on my super long fingers or something, I automatically flinch inside and feel gross all over again, no matter how much work I have been doing on myself to be confident!! Beauty is in your confidence everyone says, blah blah... but it all goes out the window when someone else defines you and you realize that objectively, yes, we are DIFFERENT.\n\nBut over time I have realized that EVERYONE has their own issues. Some people struggle with obesity, others stuttering, learning disabilities, acne, mental illness, family situations, etc. and everyone thinks they have it worst.\n\nSo I have adopted a new mindset. Instead of wishing I looked different or pretending to myself that others do not see my flaws (and then getting reality check when people do notice my flaws), I tell myself \"If this is my package, I will take it!\" \n\nBecause in life, we do not get to choose a lot of things. We cannot choose our genetics, we cannot choose the parents we are born to, I mean, we were not even offered a choice of if we wanted to be born at all! \n\nWhat we do have it we each have a unique mission to fulfill in this world, along with lots of blessings and gifts, and the packaging we come in is simply part of the deal. So instead, we should choose to focus on what we CAN control, like, for example, being kind to others, utilizing our talents, and surrounding ourselves with people who love us for who we are. (And if we cannot find those people, then we can be those people for others.) And lastly, accepting ourselves and being grateful for our challenges -- because, even when painful, it is all part of the gift of life.\n\nHope this helps somewhat. going to gym really help me gain weight , i gained 60 pounds so i am million more times confident, of course gym will naver change your bones and you will have to deal with people that dont know about the condition, you simply have to explain them , this is something that you will have to deal for the rest of your life, HOWEVER , you can workout and gain some muscles and look better over all  and that is going to feel more confident and better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\njust go to a proper gym and get a routine, dont be afraid to ask the instructors how to use the gear , you may want to take to whey proteine, but you absolutely will not need steriods or anything of such , because you are super thin you are going to gain muscle mass super fast if you train everyday, eat healthy, and get enough rest, do it correctly. do you have someone to talk about it?  talk to me in the chat\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nsended you a hi I just got to a point where I was like screw other people, my existence is not for them and I owe them nothing.

Join an interest group or club or take a class or something maybe Yeah, you are right. People very often call me a \"stick\" and it is very annoying! It is like calling someone who is fat a \"ball\"! It is not going to help you at all, but know that every human being suffers prejudice for something.\nEither if you are too skinny, fat, perfect...

I have read and seen that energy drinks can cause people with connective tissue disorders aorta's to rupture: awesome right?? Want to know everyones experience with energy drinks/caffeine. \n\nI also think its worth noting that ive tolerated caffeine well my whole life until recently. Caffeine and energy drinks especially can definitely increase BP, which can be lead to other heart issues like aortic dissection.  \nBest to see your doctor to get their opinion.\nI drink four cups of coffee a day. I had an aortic dissection in 2010, but I do not think it was related. And FYI four cups of coffee a day is going to be at least 5x the amount of caffeine in an energy drink. Yes, but not at the same time. Energy drinks also have other stimulants and a ton of sugar Bro, how did you survive that...\n\nI thought at least an aortic aneurysm would show on scans, before it completely ruptures. Its horrific to think just an increase in blood pressure can end you. \n\nIn any case, the TXNB variant I have is not that well researched, but from what I can tell it does not affect blood vessels heart. It falls into the \"classical-like\" category of EDS. The rupture folded back on itself and formed enough of a seal for me to survive it. It was torn in a zig zag direction that my cardiac specialist had never seen before.  Nothing showed on scans until it suddenly tore. I was getting scans yearly and taking meds for my blood pressure. That is so unreal. I assume you only got ultrasounds/echocardiograms of your aorta which is why they missed it. \n\nI had a cardiac MRI w/ contrast 2 years ago, and a CT scan w/ contrast about a month ago, so I think I am good more or less lol. I know this is all an inquiry that would be better to talk to my doctor about, but I do like to get some anecdotal stuff occasionally. Thank you for sharing. Yes, was only getting getting ultrasounds and echos yearly back then. Took 12 hours to have dissection diagnosed in ER. I kind of want to hear the story of why and how.  Were you not in excruciating pain? I assuming you told them your risk factors.  Did your specialist do the repair or another surgeon?  Did they try and tell you you were okay and discharge you at any point? &gt; The rupture folded back on itself and formed enough of a seal for me to survive it. \n\nWas it a chronic old dissection they missed on scans or did that happen sometime in the 12 hours you were in the emergency room? It happened at night and, there was a lot of pain. The dissection tore in multiple places, so I lost most blood flow to my right arm and both legs, so I had to drag myself down the stairs as I could not walk. It took about 20 minutes of rolling around on the floor (as I could not find a comfortable spot) before it started to pass.\n\nThe pain morphed into a stabbing pain in my back which slowly moved to my front, but at least my legs were working again. I was able to drive to the hospital (just 2 min. away). It took two hours just to get a few shots of morphine, which barely took an edge of the pain.\n\nThey knew of my Marfans, but were initially dismissing the idea of a dissection because of my age (40 at the time). And this was a major hospital in a med. sized city with a specialized cardiac centre. They did not do any surgery because of the complexity of the tear, and the fact that it folded back over and seemed to be holding fine, and it is held ever since.\n\nThey did not try to discharge me from the ER. I was finally given a bed and was monitored for two days and released. From the tests they did later, they guessed some of the tear had happened before and had partially healed, and the rest had torn at home that night. They were probably missed as the tests they did were not that useful for finding them, and they were not looking for dissections as I was asymptomatic at the time. That is an intense story.  How are you doing now?  Did you get all the blood flow back to your legs? I am doing fine, thanks. It took about 6 months to recover, but I have been fully back to normal ever since. My blood flow was the last issue to resolve. Until then I was getting a lower BP in my left arm than my right.", "My dad might have it, then I do as well ", "I hate my teeth I hate that my teeth are crooked bc of marfans and I do not want to go through a year+ of braces to fix them. Does anybody else understand?", "Has someone looked at you and guessed you had marfans? It happened to me thrice. Two times when I was in the operation theater, the surgeon / anesthesiologist took a look at me, said, \"She looks like she has marfan,\" \"Does she have marfan?\" and I affirmed their suspicions. An ophthalmologist had apparently guessed I had it just by looking at me when I walked in. I am not taller than the average man (I am female), but my fingers, limbs and especially my back are a good indicator apparently. \n\nI live in a third world country where the average person does not even know it though. I suspect it is more common for taller men in first world countries to be guessed in public. Eh you would be surprised I get nurses and even doctors sometimes that do not even now what it is  but yeah it is happened to me about 5 times now. And I am almost 31 We have a look. It is true. I randomly see people who I suspect have Marfans. I am always torn on whether or not I should say something to them. I could be saving their life but then again, it is not my business. Tough call for me in a public situation. Nope.  Mine is mild enough that it is unnoticeable unless you are looking for it. I had a young woman ask me at a bus stop whether I had Marfan or not.\n\nShe could apparently recognise the traits from her father (who, to his credit, was not her biological father). Nope. I *am* taller than the average man as a female and I have a very lithe build but I do not have the uh... face.\n\nOf course, for any operations the professionals I was working with knew my history. I was diagnosed after my brother. What does the marfan face look like? Do you figure Ann Ward has it? To be honest, I had no clue who she was. I googled her and she might. She is long and skinny with long fingers but I did not get the overwhelming feeling from her that she is a marf. I could be wrong though. Some of her pics are more convincing than others. \n\nNot sure about any other celebs. I am sure there are plenty of undetected athletes across the world though. No, people just always comment on my height as a female. One time in middle school, we were learning about genetic disorders in school and Marfans was one of them. Someone was commenting on how long my arms were and my friend offhandedly said \u201cdamn you might have marfans syndrome!\u201d As a kid who was still very embarrassed about having marfans and had not told anyone about it, my blood ran fucking COLD.\n\nwe had a good laugh about it a couple years later when I finally told her, so it is all good! It was only for my height, long limbs and skinniness that my parents and I wanted to find out what I had. Now that I am very familiar with the syndrome I recognize some slight Marfan traits in my face (small jaw etc because of the narrow palate), but the average person would never tell. Same here! I think what throws them of in my case is that I am not tall at all...\nBut my fingers can still give me away, never happend though People usually assume I have an eating disorder way before Marfan\u2019s haha. Even a lot of doctors and nurses do not know about Marfan\u2019s. I will never forget riding to the hospital in an ambulance for a spontaneous pneumothorax and the EMT googling Marfans \ud83d\ude02", "Please help, newly diagnosed. For context im 29yrs old, male, 6'3\" and 185lbs. Been around 150lbs my entire life until weight lifting 3 years ago. A year ago I hurt my back and have not been able to turn my neck or move my arms and its steadily progressed the last year. Yesterday after a year of orthos, chiros, rheumatologists, ect just throwing pills at me with no relief and horrible side effect my GP finally diagnosed me with Marfan Sydrome, due to high blood pressure and heart murmers, that i thought were muscle spasms. \n\n\nNow, my GP, my friends, my family, my gf are all freaking the hell out over this diagnosis, and I just want my back to stop hurting constantly and to be able to work out again. Is this going to be possible with Marfans? What Is realistically the deal here? I am sorry about your pain and about the new diagnosis is, which is alarming at any point in life, as you start to read more about possible effects. There is a big variety in how it shows up in different people, even within families, and we all get out own unique serving of issues. \n\nIt sounds like you are asking about two different things:  1. pain prognosis and 2. ability to work out.  Regarding pain, having Marfan syndrome does not doom you to a life of chronic severe intractable back pain. Some people may have it, just as many adults without Marfan do, and your treatment and recovery are going to depend on the nature of your particular injury. This is best managed by the back specialists you are already seeing. I wish your strength and luck, back pain sucks, but many people do recover without surgery. \n\nRegarding ability to work out, once your pain is managed, this will depend on whether your aorta is involved, as shown on your echo. Your cardiologist will advise on this. If it is abnormal, weight lifting is typically restricted, but there are other options for exercise that put less strain on your vessels. None of the back specialist or cardiologist or rheumatologist ive already been to in the last year caught it. My GP caught it yesterday after a year, gave me some prednisone to take and said she would call asap for an echo. Ran two EKGs yesterday and confirmed Marfans with all my other symptoms and medical and family history. \n\n\nI cant move, I work 14hrs a day and it hurts to breathe. I really could careless about my heart, it would be a relief from the pain and the nausea from the pain if it stopped. Why is not anyone doing anything for the pain? Which is why I went to the Doctors to begin with. Do not freak out.  People with Marfan's usually live normal lives if they watch for a few important issues.  The heart and aorta is number one.   Controlling your blood pressure is key to keeping your aorta intact.   People with FBN1 and FBN2 mutations have a problem recycling (   That causes inflammation and high blood pressure.   Your doctor will give you pills for that.  I have found that a common supplement called ( works like magic for me.  It is anti-inflamatory, and it binds to Homocysteine (a similar protein), allowing your kidneys to clear it from your blood.  (   Makes my BP perfectly normal.\n\nI used to go to Chiropractor for back pain too.  Then I went for physical therapy and learned some simple exercises to strengthen the muscles in my lower back.  Those have worked very well for me too.  Good luck!  Check in here once in a while and let us know how your doing ;) Marfan is confirmed with a genetic test, not with an ekg. Without the genetic test, an abnormal echo can suggest the diagnosis, along with supportive findings from spinal mri and eye exam.  The clinical diagnostic criteria are a little complicated, and a geneticist can make the diagnosis more definitively than most GPs. \n\nThere are 4 things that i know of that may help with pain:  surgery, pain medications, PT/chiropractor (lumping these as noninvasive movement/mechanical approaches with stronger evidence for PT), and time. Time and narcotics work against each other. It sounds like all of these have been offered or considered.  Again, back pain is tough, I do not have an answer for it, and if I did you should not trust me as an online stranger. Keep working with the experts you know irl, or find others if you prefer.  I hope you feel better soon. Totally not freaked out btw, blessed to finally have an answer. Just done with the constant pain, nausea and tightness and nothing seems to help. Do you have a reccomend dosage of nac? I actually have a surplus supply Sorry about the delay.  Not a simple answer. \n\nI was taking 500mg every morning.   Then I doubled that when it was thought to help with COVID (2x daily).   Then I noticed a change in my taste perception.  On a hunch, I quit NAC and other supplements.  My taste normalized.   My BP got higher.   Not sure if it was NAC.  I am bringing it back on slowly \u2014 500mg twice a week.\n\nNAC has lots of detractors, but most of the criticisms are stupid or just wrong.   Some people were taking huge doses (2-5 grams) that are probably bad.

Im curious does it somehow put our metabolism into hyper drive or is there another reason.  The reason is not fully understood, but a common theory is that it is related to the underdeveloped muscles associated with Marfan's. As for metabolism, according to a study done between Marfans and Non-Marfans participants, at rest metabolism was the same between groups, but during physical activity, our metabolism is seemingly less efficient due to said reduced muscle mass, making us burn more energy to perform the same actions, thus the common muscle pains and fatigue among Marfans patients. (\n\nThere are quite a few cases of obesity in Marfan's patients, but it is usually the older demographic since adults overall have a harder time maintaining a healthy bodyweight since lipid turnover (basically the rate that fat cells are stored/removed) in fat tissue decreases as you age, which means it is easier to gain weight even if you do not eat more or work out less than when you were younger, and is often exacerbated by other health conditions people develop as adults. Well I learned something today. Thanks for that detailed explanation! I would hoped I could find more recent studies to be more detailed, but Marfan's is so niche that not a lot of research gets done, unfortunately. C_Morrow gave an excellent explanation. To that, I will add that tall people simply need more calories than average height people, so a tall Marfan eating an average diet is going to be skinnier than an average person eating that same diet. I do not know but I was super skinny as a child but then when I became a teenager I was overweight, and have been ever since until recently when I went on Keto. I have never had any issue building muscle though. I have always had problems being overweight, never super skinny except for as a kid.. and I also put on muscle fairly easily. I did a lot of strength sports for 10 years, then got into CrossFit and Olympic weightlifting and that is where my problems really started. I also have the theory that that is actually what made my aorta distend, because I did not have that as an issue prior to that. But all the stopping and starting and all the intense weight that you are moving has a bad affect. But I was not diagnosed until very recently so I could not have known. \nThe problem is that I also injure myself very quickly and if I do not exercise, my muscles feel like they clench up and my entire body hurts. I have been overweight most of my life, but on a thin frame Brief reminder that there is a lot of documented cases of obesity also being a problem in the Marfans community (hi, oops.) The \"everyone is hyper skinny\" thing does not always apply.  \n\n\nEDIT: that said, genetic tests show that I can build muscle normally (may actually have some sort of genetic advantage, idk, I was not very interested in it), so that is maybe why I have never had the Marfans-super-skinny problem. I do LOOK thinner than I am, though, and that is because of the extremely long limbs/tiny wrists and ankles. what kind of genetic testing was able to identify that you can build muscle normally? and how do you go about doing that, like which type of doctor ordered those tests for you what type of genetic testing did you have that was able to identify you can build muscle normally? and how do you go about getting that, like what kind of doctor ordered that for you?  It was just the 23andMe advanced test, which I chose to believe at face value since its consistent with my results from strength training (e.g. relatively normal results) and that I have never had the classical Marfans-super-skinny issue. It also did not matter much to me, so I did not look into it any deeper or put much weight on that result. If it matters to you for some reason (idk, to support clinical efforts to gain muscle or something?) then I would for sure do it \"for real\" and just ask a doctor what genetic tests you might need (you could start by googling whatever it is that 23andMe looks at to show that result) and go from there.

I have also had chest x-rays and they have come back perfectly normal.\n\n\nMy stats are as follows:\n\nI am rather thin, 5ft 9 and weigh 62kg.\n\nWrist Sign : Positive\n\nThumb Sign : False (however if I forcefully stretch my thumb and curl my fingers, I can get my thumb to protrude past my hand but it seems more hypermobile than the length of my thumb.)\n\nUpper / Lower Segment Ratio: Normal\n\nArm Span / Height Ratio : 1.05 (exactly)\n\nI do not have flat feet, but my ankles definitely overpronate - also my knees in particular click a lot when I walk and feel loose.\n\nMy fingers are hypermobile, as is the majority of the rest of my body, so it is pretty much everywhere.\n\nI have mild myopia (have done since I was about 13 it is less than around -1.75/-2.0 in each eye so it is very mild) but no other eye issues.\n\nI also have a very mild chest protrusion in the centre of my chest, but nothing elsewhere, it is a small bone that slightly protrudes outward but looks nothing like the other carinatum images I have seen.\n\nNever been diagnosed with scoliosis even after being assessed but I have a mild hip tilt I can notice if I take a picture in the mirror.\n\nI have very stretchy skin on my neck and face and also suffer from Raynauds (mild) which usually causes very cold hands and feet when any cold weather sets in or sometimes due to stress?\n\nNobody in my family exhibits the Marfanoid traits, my sisters are both relatively tall 5ft6 and 5ft8 ish both similar / taller than my parents but do not have any of the other features, they are also relatively thin but not like me. I am also taller than my parents. We do not really have any history of significant heart disease in the family (grandparents / dads uncles have had triple bypass surgery at 80+ years old after being lifetime smokers, but nothing too out of the ordinary.)\n\nMy question is: is there anyone else on here who exhibited the Marfan skeletal features only to be assessed and confirmed they do not have Marfans? I.e. diagnosed with some form of EDS I.e. hEDS or Joint Hypermobility Syndrome without cardiac / ocular feature?\n\nNow I know I cannot get a diagnosis online without seeing a healthcare professional and I am not expecting / asking for one. I will be following up with my GP and potentially asking for a referral to alleviate my fears but I just want to know if anyone else has been in a similar situation where they have exhibited skeletal features but not ended up having Marfans. \n\nThanks all x I have all the positive hand signs and ratio for marfans and awaiting genetic test results-  but I suspect perhaps I have loeys dietz or EDS. I have some pretty translucent skin to go along with it tho- which is why I lm leaning toward them.  I have a marfanoid medical mystery like you. I am trying to figure it out. Marfan syndrome was ruled out, other similar disorders have not been ruled out HOWEVER, just reading up on them makes me not relate to them, so it might be something new in my case.", "Covid Vaccine! Did you take it? If not, will/can you?\nWhere are you from? Was it by age or medical history?\nWhich vaccine did you take?\nDid you have any reaction?\n\nI took Pfizer yesterday, because I had a Kidney self-transplant (yes, because of marfs!)\nUnfortunately, in Brazil, not everybody can take it, even with medical history.\nI have a light headache and the arm I took the vaccine is a little sore, but form what I heard from Moderna and Oxford reactions, this is fine. Many of marfs, including myself have had it. There is side effects, but nothing in particular to Marfans. Best of luck. Cheers In Brazil most people cannot\nI only could cause I had a Kidney transplant, but I think most marfs here will only be able by August or so Ok. You will be good. I had a headache and body ache afterwards but was good after 24 hours. Best of luck my friend! Just got my second shot of the moderna vaccine was told to get it by my doctors finished my second shot of the pfizer dose a couple of weeks ago, no symptoms. brother with marfans took moderna way back in january and had a minor flu like reaction My dad and I both took it. We both have Marfans and both got Moderna. No issues except a sore arm. Got my second pfizer a week ago - just felt slightly achy the next day, but that was all. I also got the Pfizer. I think it is REALLY IMPORTANT for people with Marfan or EDS to get it, considering covid is a cardiovascular disease that is killing perfectly healthy people with strokes and blood clots. We really cannot fuck around with something like that. I got AZ and just had fever/aches for a day. I am in Canada. Second dose will be in a couple of months or so. I had it a week ago, all good so far. Uk: got my vaccine early due to underlying health conditions (felt a bit awkward when people were discussing it at work as I had mine at the same time as the 65+)\n\nWe are having 12 weeks between vaccines so my 2nd dose is in 2 weeks\n\nI just felt unwell the next day, and had a sore arm for 3 days. Exactly what I would expect from any vaccine.", "Marfans and the military My son (18) may have Marfan syndrome, and I had some questions.\n\nBrief background: he is tall and thin (just under 6'1\", ~140 lbs), but a lot of his family are tall and thin. A couple of years ago he was diagnosed with scoliosis, and the pain has been getting a little worse these past couple of months so we went to his doctor today for that.\n\nThe nurse-practitioner we saw brought up the idea of Marfan's.\n\nAs I said, he is tall and thin, does have spine curvature, and has some stretch marks on his back either side of his spine. From looking on marfan.org he does not have some other symptoms, like a high/crowded palate, sunken or sticking out chest, or really any of the others. She said if it is Marfan's it is not an extreme case right now.\n\nShe is going to get us an appointment with a cardiologist to follow up, since he is now too old to go back to Cook's Medical Centre in Fort Worth, due to him being 18.\n\nThe thing is, my son is a high school senior and was planning on going into the USAF at the end of this year, sticking around for the GI bill, then having that pay to get the real job he wants which is to work at Boeing on aeronautical systems.\n\nIs a Marfan's diagnosis going to disqualify him from the Air Force? Googling around is a mixed bag, and they are mostly posts from 10+ years ago. Just really wondering how much this is going to impact his daily life, and his future plans.\n\nI would also add she did listen to his heart and said it sounded normal. He had a heart murmur as a child but it went away on its own, and was simply monitored by his doctor. They were going to do an EKG in the office but decided against it after making the decision to send him to a cardiologist. He will not be able to go into the military with Marfan. It is not safe anyway.  He should get an echocardiogram done. An EKG would not have helped with diagnosis anyway. Is he seeing the cardiologist soon and does that person have knowledge of Marfan?  They tried to get a hold of the cardiologist but it was a Friday afternoon and they were not answering the phone. They said they would try again on Monday and let me know.\n\nThe nurse-practitioner said she had prior experience with the cardiologist she was trying to get us into. No idea if he has experienced with Marfan.\n\nI think she mentioned that the cardiologist would likely do an echo there, which is why she scrapped the EKG. Highly doubtful that he will be able to enlist; my husband has Marfan, and he tried when he was 18. As soon as they did the echo, it was a no-go. Thanks.\n\nHoping it is not Marfan.  If he does in fact test positive his doctor would even allow him to go through basic training because there are physical activity limitations that are life saving if one does have Marfan. Physical activity should be limited and any impact sports avoided completely due to danger of aortic dissection.  Will an echo be conclusive? i.e. They will be able to tell us definitively whether he has it or not after they do that?  An echo is a must if you suspect Marfan. But that alone will not be enough for a definitive diagnosis. You should really seek out a geneticist and have a full connective tissue genetic test done. That is the only way to get a definitive diagnosis.  Thank you. Ask your cardiologist to do a z-score on him. It is kind of a 1-10 measure of how close you are to having Marfan. I think 7 and up is considered Marfan or possibly another connective tissue disorder like EDS. Thanks, we will do that. A z score greater than 2 indicates enlargement of the aorta. Diagnosis is made through the Ghent criteria which you can view here  I thought scoliosis alone was disqualifying? For severe cases when it interferes with normal activities, as I understand it (which in his case it does not).  Makes sense, scoliosis is pretty common and it is not always bad, but if it is causing him pain they might balk at that. Even if he hides it at enlistment he will not be able to hide it forever. \n\nI hope kiddo ends up in the clear. With no family history he probably will- him being 6'1\" and skinny with scoliosis as your only indicators is not very strong. It is pretty common for active young adult men to be thin because they are not eating enough. Better safe than sorry though!  Hope so! ", "Can anyone describe what the chest pain feels like? So I am getting close to being in range to getting my aortic surgery but the past couple day I have been getting some weird chest pains like where my actual heart is. But I am not sure if I should be worried or if it is like acid reflux or something cause I thought if it was a heart issue the pain would be in the center of the chest. \n\nDo not know if anyone can shed some insight on this. Does it feel like it is your chest bone that hurts, or your actual heart? I get chest pains that feel like something pushing down on my sternum, but I do not know what causes it or if that is what you are talking about Sometimes, I feel some kind of \"electric\" pain in my chest. As if some kind of electricity runs through my chest and hurts as I move, no matter how slow.\n\nI have also experienced pressure on my chest, right where the heart is. It makes me kind of need to breathe deep to reduce the pain, but does not actually work. It feels like my actual heart but then some time there is like a very pinpoint pain like something is poking it Oh well I have never felt that, sorry I could not help I feel something similar. From my knowledge 2.5 is normal , 5.0 is when you need surgery, I am at a 4.3 and I am 21. I get these sharp needle pains the prick and cause me to hold my breath. And when I breath in it hurts so I have to breath little by little until it allows me to breath. I have heard marfans makes you prone to lung collapse so it might be something like that. But I have heard my doctor that I am okay heart wise but those are the pains I feel What do you mean with 2.5 or 5.0? It is either millimeter or centimeters I do not remember , and it is either the diameter or the circumference, both I am not sure but they are measurements and I know for sure 2.5mm or cm is normal and 5 you need surgery. It is the measurement of the aorta. And mines at a 4.3 I accidentally did not reply but made another comment Centimeters. My husband\u2019s was 4.4 cm and dissected a year later at 5 cm. I was told 4.5 to 5 is surgery, it depends on the rate of growth. \n\nI have been at 4.7 for 5 years, so they are cautious but satisfied. how big your aorta is in cm.", "Sia announces she has a neurological disease (Ehlers-Danlos syndrome)  Maybe it is just Baader-Meinhof kicking in, but I have seen more celebs announce they have EDS recently. Jameela Jamil (The Good Place) also has EDS, Yvie Oddly from RuPaul's Drag Race just did an interview and disclosed that they have it; it just feels like it is popping up everywhere lately. In a weird way, that makes me hopeful, because I think it is an indicator that aware of Marfan and related syndromes is increasing.", "I think I may have Marfans? I am 31 years old, white, 145lbs skinny 6\u20193\u201d tall, it is really difficult for me to gain weight.\n\nI have an indent in my chest, my fingers are long, I was born premature, I almost died at birth, and was almost blind at birth (retinal detachment). \n\nSomeone who I was working around one day noticed that i May have Marfans, her husband had Marfans he passed at around 40-50\u2019s a few years ago.\n\nI do not really have a doctor also do not have health insurance yet. I really want to visit a cardiologist, I have been feeling small pains in my chest for a bit.\n\nI know no one here is a trained professional but, what have doctors said to you guys?\nWhat should I eliminate from my habits, I drink coffee all the damn time ;(\nAnd I smoke/dab Marijuana daily\n\nThank you lol Where are you located? Chest pain is pretty serious and should not be ignored. I do not have any information for you but to encourage you to be seen for your chest pains. Riverside, California You should be eligible for CA\u2019s health plan. They have several options. I would encourage you to look into it. I really hope and pray that you do not have a serious issue. I would have no idea where to start for that, but I will google it lol I do not either. In Oregon we have a division for children and families. That is what it is called. CoveredCA.com \n\nYou need to be open and honest when you see a primary care physician. He may not be knowledgeable about all your symptoms but the first step in any diagnosis is getting a full account of everything going on.\n\nLike others have said.... do not disregard any chest pains.  \n\nPlease do not delay getting insurance.  It takes a bit of effort but regret takes a bigger toll.  Set aside time this weekend.  Get all your paperwork ready and sign up.  You can do this. $$ is the only issue at the moment, just working 1 part-time job it is not enough.  So I will try to find a primary Carr physician local in my area There are other markers (they do not always present) that you can look for. Your wingspan may be longer than your height, or feet without arches. But do not mess around when it comes to your heart/chest!!!! Even if you have to open a credit card to cover medical expenses. Best of luck and good health. I do not have Marfan syndrome but your symptoms are very serious. Retinal detachment is not that common in young people. Do you also have long limbs, other symptoms? You should really find yourself a cardiologist as soon as possible. Yeah I am going to be doing that in May I wish you luck!", "What med are you taking? Personally I am taking Atenolol I am wondering what you guys are taking for your Heart.\n\n(Proscribed by a doctor) Losartan 25MG once a day. Helps my blood pressure I think Yep I think losartan is a beta blocker, that is what I take once a day. I take Atenolol twice a day as well. Atenolol, Perindopril and Warfarin Atenolol and ferrous fumerate medtorporla, diltiazem and valsartan Losartan for blood pressure 50mgs and Metoprolol for my arrhythmia 50mgs. The metoprolol gets along fine with my aorta. I take Losartan, 50mg in morning and 50mg in evening.  \nThere is some evidence according to studies that Losartan is more effective in some types of mutations and Beta Blockers are more effective in other types of mutations. Bisoprolol 10mg a day I am supposed to be on something as well but the stuff they prescribed is also an anti depressant. I went trough depression alone and came out the other end, and I do not want meds that alter my real mood.", "Caffeine I have an fairly average-sized aorta, but I take beta blockers to keep it from growing anymore. My doctor gave me the green light to take Adderall, which I take 30 mgs of daily for ADHD. Recently I started drinking coffee for the first time. I have never had a problem with caffeine before, but after drinking one of those Starbucks frappuccinos my heart rate got really irregular. It was not a fun experience and I am definitely not trying that again, but should I avoid caffeine altogether? Why are not amphetamines a problem? I cannot answer your second question, but for the first..\n\nListen to your body.  If caffeine makes your heart race or blood pressure go up significantly, do not drink it.\n\nIf you really love coffee and caffeine, try drinking half-caff and see how that affects you.  That is what I do now, not only does the caffeine barely effect my heart, it has also forced me to appreciate a more gentle caffeine boost. Do you eat something when you have caffeine?  A caffeine crash can make your heart all sorts of buggy.   I ate a candy bar and I had dinner before my heartbeat got weird. It was around when I was due to crash though I do not know if it will help, but I always eat something with the caffeine to head off the crash.  Have not really had any issues with it and I have coffee and excedrin every day.   Take care.", "Should I be worried? ", "My life story so far..... Hi, I am a marfan sufferer and i want to share my story. Im 39 this year. I use to despise myself for having this disease, and i try to ignore it thinking it wont affect me at all and hope that it will just go away somehow. Im always feeling hopeless, depress, unmotivated, and hope that the world will end ASAP cause I am tired and done with this life. That was the biggest mistake I have made and I have wasted the last 20 years of my life doing nothing, but having depression everyday. I failed my studies and achieve nothing impressive out of my career.  I have all the major hallmark of marfan syndrome. Tall and lanky, thick eye glasses, cant gain muscles, pectus, etc . I have completed countless of surgeries. I have done open heart surgery with a mechanical valve to fix my bulging aorta (On-x heart valve) and undertook 4 surgeries to fix both my eyes. 1 time on left eye, 3 times on the right eye. The reason for 3 times surgery to my right eye was because of the lousy and inexperience doctor. I was lucky it was finally fix back by a more qualified doctor. Before eye surgery, I am not much different to a blindman. I cannot see distance object clearly, i cant drive at night.....my glasses was thick as hell and still doesnt help much. But after the surgery, boy.......was i in for a big surprise....I never thought i will have a chance to see with such clarity in my lifetime(even without wearing glasses!!) the first thing i noticed, after my eye surgery, was when looking at the sky and noticing how the clouds was so much different and beautiful this time......with all the detail, colour and contrast as the sun light bouncing off it......before this.... clouds look just like a few lump of wool to me. I wish I have done this surgery earlier, if i know how much of a big difference it can make....... if you can see clearly, even after wearing thick glasses, I recommend everyone to do eye surgery. I am on 2 medication daily. Warfarin for my mechanical valve, and irbesartan to lower my blood pressure. I recommended everyone to take \u201c arb\u201d medication because it did help me to gain weight. This is not a medical advice, but i do hope you guys can explore this and try it out and see whether it help u guys to gain weight or not.\nThat Is all for now, if you guys have any question, feel free to ask away and i will try to answer them Thank you for sharing your story. I am glad to hear you are on irbesartan. It is a type of Sartan like Losartan, which have been shown to be very beneficial for Marfan patients because it lowers something called Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2), which has been shown to be very high in Marfan patients, and also   likely causes heart issues.  \n\n\nWith your eye surgery, did they implant a lens? Do you wear contact lenses or glasses still?  Yes. They implant artificial lens into both my eyes. Artisan Iris claw iol on my right eye. Sclera fixation on my left eye. I recommend the Artisan (Ophtec) iris claw iol. The surgery was easy and fast. Outcome was very good. The only drawback is its somehow affect your endothelium cells of your cornea. Need to do yearly checkup to monitor the endothelium cells. I still wear glasses to fix my astigmatism, and for reading. But its way lot better than last time cause the glasses are not thick at all. I dont wear contact lenses. Your story is a lot like mine, we are even the same age, I just turned 39 this month. We found out my father and I both had Marfan's  shortly after his death at 25, I was 2. I grew up depressed and convinced I would not see 25 either. Took me a long long time to get my shit together. \n\nFortunately, they were able to spare my aortic valve when I had that surgery, so I do not take warfarin. My eyes have not needed surgery yet either, but I am basically blind without my glasses. I am on an arb and beta blocker, I think my doc might have completely taken me off the beta blocker but I have tachycardia (rapid heart rate) and the arb does nothing to slow it. So when I started talking the arb they cut the beta blocker dose in half but said it was still necessary. I suspect it is because I have been on beta blockers most of my life. \n\nAnyway, feel free to hit me up sometime if you ever want to chat. Go do the eye surgery. It really make a big difference Is there a reason to choose one of those meds over the other? Thanks Sorry to hear about the severity of your condition. As a fellow marfan I wanted to reach out and let you know you are not alone. I have not had all the surgeries but understand what you go through. For me, just going the the grocery store is an uphill task with all the scrutiny and general disrespect I face for simply being born. People would say\u201d If I was him, I would kill myself\u201d. It was to the point I actually thought about it. But then I had the realization, regardless of what society and social norms might dictate, I have the right to a meaningful and happy life because I am here, I made through labor and all the bs life has thrown at me. I am sorry to rant on your thread, but I just wanted you to know that you are not alone and if you ever need to talk or just vent I am here.", "14 M, I look like this, I have sudden pains in my heart about 3-5 times a day, and I have vision problems. I do not want to risk a doctor\u2019s visit, and I am scared that I have marfans. (Yes I know, I will cut my fingernails) ", "22 and lanky af. Will I die lanky? Hello everyone. I have heard that some marfans managed to increase their weight as they got older. Wanted to ask you all if someone here remained skinny and lanky? Or everybody is supposed to get a little heavier. Also did the only part of your body that filled out was your stomach? Or also your arms and legs. Thanks for reading Nah, you can totally get fat. \n\nI managed to put on 20some lbs of muscle. I am  a healthy BMI, but still lanky. Also note that my Marfans is relatively mild and does not inhibit my ability to lift or run. When I was 22 I was 175lbs at 6\u20192. I am now 32 and 225lbs. Some is muscle, some is fat. Most of my fat accumulates in my stomach area and my man boobs. My arms and legs are definitely less thin than they used to be, but the small wrists still make my forearms seem pretty thin. So your heart is not affected? That is dope bro I have actually been developing a theory on the lankyness. Due to the long limb to torso ratio that most of us face we will always portray as \"lanky\". For instance,  look at Jon Jones a high level athlete that fights at 205lbs and is still considered \"lanky\" due to his very long leg and arm length compared to his body. Embrace it op it is hard, but it is the only way. I have went on an intense weight gain diet multiple times and it did nothing for me besides give me a fat stomach. I was clearing 3500 calories for six months, eating all sorts of proteins and working out with resistance bands and small weights and by the end of it my arms and legs and shoulders were as skeleton like as ever. As I type this I can feel my pyjama shirt hanging from my shoulder blades.\n\nI just do not fucking get it. Perhaps, my grandad put a lot of weight on after 40 but my dad who is 6 ft 2 is now 55 and weighs roughly 175lbs where as im only 27 and am 6 ft 4 and only weigh 144 lbs with roughly 93% muscle but am super skinny and have never put on any weight despite many super calorie diets", "Hip problems? Hi, I have suspected Marfan's, waiting to see a specialist soon.\n\nMy biggest problem is my hips. They hurt pretty much continuously, click and crunch whenever I move and sometimes give way when I walk. In certain positions (rolling over when I sleep sometimes) they \"fall out\", lock in place and are extremely painful until I physically push my leg back \"into place\". \n\nI was wondering if anyone else experienced these kinds of hip/leg problems and, if so, any kind of treatment you have had for it?\n\nThanks! ", "Finally get help with the pain after 26 years. For years I had doctors who would either tell me that the pain was not enough to justify long term medicine, that \"they do not do pain\" (my previous PCP who I dropped and filed a complaint with Medicaid about just last year), or outright belief that my pain could not be that bad. As a teenager I had doctors who straight up told me that they do not really believe/agree with the standards suggested for patient treatment of Marfans. (Fuck you Dr. Erickson). The children's hospital in Denver told me to manage my pain with over the counter pain pills and that I was outta luck despite a recommendation from my Marfan specialist. \n\nAll that changed last week when on the referral of the surgeon who did my heart surgery in August sent me to a pain clinic in my city. My PCP literally told me that if I even pursued pain management I \"would need to find a new provider\" despite the pain doctor being in network. Fuck her, I went anyways. I had a talk with the pain doctor who did a blood and urine test and in office told me he was sorry I had waited so long to see him. I do back in 2 weeks for my first rx. We are starting on low dose methadone for chronic pain with an additional prescription for breakthrough pain. Steroid shots to my SI nerves as well and if they do not work we will be doing nerve ablation. \n\nI wanted to post this to tell everyone not to give up. The right doctor who is respectful of the pain we face is out there. Do not give up. I think this might be the start of a new chapter of my life and I could not have gotten here without a few great doctors Hopefully this is not too personal of a question:  what kind of pain are you experiencing?  My daughter has \u2018almost Marfans\u2019... in that she has all the boxes checked except for the genetic marker (mitral valve prolapse, spine, eyes, jaw, flexibility, height, weight, everything.) She has had chronic leg pain since birth.  He doctors have only recommended Advil as needed.  But I was curious if we should expect addition pain-related issue as she grows up.   For me it got gradually worse and spread. I know your daughters leg pain intimately- for me it has gotten gradually worse as my knees and quads have worn. It gets worse as you get heavier. \n\nOther places are my lower spine and SI nerves. This can cause pain into the back of the legs that is hard to diagnose.  My shoulders also get sore and it can radiate into the sides and chest. If she has heart surgery for the valve or dilation it will likely be more noticeable. Watch out for growth spurts: I got them at like ten and fifteen and they are beyond agonizing. Mine were so bad they left purple stretch marks on my shoulders and thighs. What worked for me for a long time was mixing otc stuff. Two Advil, two Tylenol. But if it gets bad enough you are going to need a pain specialist. \n\nMy suggestion would be to try to be understanding. We are not ourselves when we see everything through the lens of pain and can get irritable. I am late to this party but good for you. I have been on pain management for about a year now and it is still scary to me, but I am glad to be on it. It is made a world of difference.", "On-X Valve, Warfarin, and Tattoos Confirmed marfans, had aortic root and valve replacement a little under two years ago.  Up until then, I had been in the hunt for artwork to get a tattoo, but since then, I was told it was too dangerous because of the bleed risk.\n\nHowever, my INR monitoring has been perfect, no nose bleeds, no odd bruising, or any of the side effects I was told to watch for.\n\nIs it safe to get a small tattoo(real, not temporary/henna) somewhere with less bleed risk, like my forearm, and my doctor's are just being super cautious?  Does anyone else here share this desire/lifestyle and has advice for the situation? I absolutely have the desire, but have not gone through with it yet. My advice, taken with however much salt you want, is to be upfront with the artists. See if you can find someone who is worked on someone taking blood thinners. Or at the very least, someone willing to try, as I believe many shops will turn you away.\n\nMy hope is to get something small and see how it goes. If you are ambitious maybe work with artist on a modular design so you can get it done in smaller pieces and have it still look good after each session in case you decide not to continue.\n\nLike I said, I have not done it, so I cannot be of much help. But if you get something done I would be interested to hear an update. My husband has one that runs the length of his forearm, and had no bleeding issues; he also had an aortic root and valve replacement, so I am guessing your INR is supposed to be in the same range as his - 2.5 to 3.5 They are actually keeping mine lower(higher? I do not actually know if lower or higher numbers are better.) My range since surgery has been 1.5 to 2.5, so I do not know if that is thinner than his or not. It is thicker, the higher index means longer time for coagulation, mine's between 2.0 and 3.0. Also I have a doctor who specializes in coagulation (cannot recall name of specialization) so I guess I will ask her about tattoos before I get one I just have a standard Family Practice doctor, and a Cardiologist, the labs send my blood somewhere for the testing and I get a phone call a few days later for doseage for the month.\n\nI know a few of the local tattoo artists as friends from high school, maybe I will stop in and explain the situation and see if they have experience or know what to do with a client like me. Then I would suggest you ask your cardiologist probably The On-X valves have a lower therapeutic INR. My wife had the same surgery as you from the sounds of it about 2.5 years ago, and her heart surgeon / anti coag doc keep her between 1.5 and 2.0. I agree with the rest, worth asking a cardiac specialist just to be safe :). I am not a doctor! I also have the on x valve and my range is 1.5 to 2.

Given our larger hands, we require more hand sanitizer than the average person. Once again, Marfan Syndrome is expensive. The only confirmed risk at this time! I think my question would be whether we are at a higher risk due to our limited lung capacity and it (corona) being a respiratory syndrome. There was a space on the event registration form where you could fill in any questions you had, and that is basically what I asked. I saw my doctor on Tuesday for an unrelated issue and asked him about it. He seemed to think that there was no current indication that we are at any greater risk. The people with existing respiratory problems that exhibit the most risk are people with chronic illnesses that obstruct breathing. Like Asthma, Emphysema or COPD. I would love to hear what the experts say, but based on the foundation's press statement, I do not imagine it will be much different. I submitted the same question! More people that ask the samw thing the better.  Thanks. does anyone mind posting a general summary/overview of what is said in this webinar? i unfortunately will not be able to make it because my school is still having us take exams. I am a FBN2 mutant, so technically not a Marf (think Marfan\u2019s lite ;)\n\nOne very important thing coming out of the Chinese experience is that ACE inhibitors (for blood pressure control) seem to be a major risk factor.  A large percentage of fatalities are people being treated with ACE inhibitors:\n\n( \n\n( \n\nARB inhibitors work just as well, and might even prevent the infection:\n\n( \n\nYou might want to talk to your doctor and switch to Losartan.  I already use Losartsan.\n\nThe explanation is that the virus actually uses these receptors to infect cells:\n\n( What if we are on a beta blocker (atanelol) and ARB inhibitor (irbisartan)? You should ask your doctor.  Some ARB inhibitors (like losartan) seem to be good.  Others (like Valsartan) are not.  The length of time that you took it probably has a big effect, because it changes the way the receptors are \u201cexpressed\u201d.  They do not completely understand it yet.  It now seems that the higher mortality only affects people taking ACE inhibitors.\n\nDo not change anything without talking to doctor.  Doctor probably will not know what to do yet.  If it is a reasonable think to do, they may decide to change your meds.  Look for some sort of official statement about this issue.\n\nActually, this is very good news for the rest of the world.  It means the virus has a control point that can be manipulated with existing drugs.  HIV went on for a long time because they had to invent and test a whole new class of drugs for it. &gt;Use of angiotensin receptor blockers such as Telmisartan, Losartsan in nCoV Wuhan Corona Virus infections \u2013 Novel mode of treatment\n\nWow!!! So the fact that I take Losartan (albeit a very low dose) could be advantageous in this context?? Yes. I am happy to hear that too, but do not go out thinking you are immune ;).\n\nThe protection in only theoretical, backed up with some anecdotal reports from China that infected people taking Losartan do better.\n\nI am more worried about people taking ACE inhibitors, those seem to swing the door open to the virus.\n\nWe should consider ourselves guinea pigs ;) New info on this, looks like it might help:\n\n( Do you remember what the answer was? I am only just now seeing the post. Wish they could have recorded it and kept it up honestly. Actually they did record it. ( and the link to the recording is at the bottom. The TL;DR is that most of the pulmonary issues we have put us in the high risk category. So... definitely hunker down.

I have been evaluated twice now for Marfan and both times the decision was null.  My heart is normal and I have just enough traits to starts to consider it. So the doctors say to not worry about it and just continue to watch my heart. \n\nSome background, I am 31 years old, 6\u20195\u201d and 185lbs. I was evaluated in 2002 and 2014. I have flexible joints (both hand and wrist signs), crowded teeth, longer arms, maybe a concave chest, flat feet, maybe facial features, diverticulitis (some say it is, some says it is not a sign), and near sighted with an astigmatism, not sure if I missed anything else.  \n\nMy most recent echo showed a 3.4 cm aortic root, and mitral valve flattening with no regurgitation or stenosis, but not prolapse (my bother has MVP but no signs of Marfan what so ever so this might not be related). The summary of the echo was: \u201c1) Normal transthoracic echocardiogram. 2) No echo findings diagnostic of or consistent with Marfan syndrome.\u201d I have had EKGs and full blood work over the years with no findings.\n\nThe doctors have said if I wanted I could have genetic testing, but I am not sure if it is worth it, will it change anything. I plan to keep up with echos every 3-4 years per doctor\u2019s order to make sure nothing changes heart wise, but is there anything else I need to do or know if I may have Marfans. Also I run casually (half marathons and such). Since I have no heart issues should I be concerned, should I back off. I asked my doctors and they would not give me a straight answer. \n\nOverall I am just looking for some guidance on living with potential Marfan and what I should be aware of. Most of what I read centers around heart issues (which I understand is present in 90% of cases) but I find little information on other areas. Should I see a specialist, if so who/why? Most resources point to cardiologist, but do I need another one if there were no findings on my echo?\n", "Anyone here has Aspergers ? Anyone here has Aspergers and struggle with social skills Yep. Do not think I would say I really struggle with it too much anymore, but I also do not think my case is too severe.\n\nI am, however, loving the irony of asking people with social troubles to stand up and socialize about. Not to rag on you, just finding it amusing. Yes. See my TEDxTalk. I do not mention Marfan, but I have long contemplated the link between syndromes.  I have aspergers too, though I can mask it pretty well. I have a stutter though, which definitely does not help. I have not been officially diagnosed with Marfan syndrome yet, though mainly because I have not told anyone I might have it. To be honest, I have known for about three months now that I might have it, but I have not gotten the balls to finally tell my parents. I keep telling myself that this weekend will be when I tell them, so I can get tested and have my aorta checked etc, but I keep pushing it off, because there would be both major changes to my life in the short and long term. I also would not want to have to put them through the emotional burden, especially with my sister. Also, my worrying/anxiety regarding the potential of me likely having this disorder has contributed to what I guess could be called depression, that I can mask that pretty well since from the outside I guess I just look bored. I know this might be a bit much, but I kind of wanted to vent, even if it is with people I do not even know, because I have not told anyone I know any of this. hey there i have got marfans and you are absolutely capable of living a wonderful life with it even with its drawbacks. i would say the anxiety of all the what ifs is often times much more mentally taxing than what comes after taking that first step to see a doctor. whatever route you take i know you will be alright, best of luck! Probably, but I do not actually have a solid diagnosis of 'Marfans' either.   Anyway, there is r/socialanxiety and r/relationships.    BTW I think they call it 'Autism Spectrum Disorder' now in some of the official manuals. Waiting to be genetically tested right now. I dont have Asburgers but I do have dyslexia/ discalcula, disgraphia and an auditory Perception disorder ( aka auditory dislexia).\n\nBut my dad also has learning disabilities like me and my mom does not. (My mom has Marfan's) Quite possibly (or maybe something else that has some similar symptoms), though I have not been diagnosed with either yet (and I will not be pursuing an Aspergers diagnosis since it is untreatable), in any case I have literally zero social skills and basically cannot make eye contact with people for more than a couple of seconds unless I know them pretty well. I do not have Marfans but I am too autistic. I notice though that many with Aspergers and high functioning autism are skinny and can eat whatever they want and not gain weight.

I have been told on several occasions during dr checkups that I have an audible heart murmur. Last time I had an XRay for a digestive issue, I was told that I have scoliosis. Ive had persistent episodes of tachycardia since adolescence that have always been chalked up to anxiety (I wore a holter monitor that showed up palpitations but didnt seem to be of concern). I cant squat down or extend my shoulders without them loudly cracking and popping. I wear glasses, im not sure exactly what is wrong with my vision but I have multifocal lenses because my long and short distance vision are slightly screwy. I also have pretty severe PCOS but have always maintained a low end of normal BMI.\n\n\nLike, to me, I feel kind of stupid just showing upbto the dr and saying \"Can you check me out for this thing I read on the Internet\" but then again I would also feel super stupid if I did have it and did not do something about it!

I just wanted to say I am going through a similar situation (at 28 years old). I have no symptoms as of yet, no relatives with marfan, but have some of the features. My aorta is not dilated, yet the doctor thinks i have it, and Im waiting for the genetic test. I think it\u00b4s normal to be shocked (I am at least) but with treatment nowadays the life expectancy is near normal, so you should not be terrified.  \nGood luck! I have gone in twice for heart surgery but both times had to have two procedures on different days due to complications so really 4 surgeries. \n\nJoint pain comes and goes but it is there Thanks wish you the best. Yeah I am not scared, if it is marfan I will be fine. I have been avid weightlifter and now at 29 falling apart it seems for no reason.

(No Marfans symptoms).\n\nSince then I enlisted in the military, got discharged, started working out and put on about 20 lbs and the dislocations are much less frequent. \n\nHowever, I am still worried. Is it possible that it is a simple coincidence and that I am just a tall, skinny man with flexible joints? Should I get more tests done to check if I suffer from Marfans? You could easily be just tall and slim. If you want to be certain have a genetic test done. if you got ok'd by a cardiologist you are probably set. generally diagnosis is done by echo-cardiogram or genetics test. if you have that sweet tricare you could try and go through them which would be the best way to do that. i have literally never had anything denied by them when i was working in a doctors office.

I wonder if it is a hormone (or possibly intersex thing) because I HAVE been proven to have Marfan Syndrome, but due to lack of body hair, an androgynous voice, and feminine facial features, I wonder if it is just my genetics/just because or if I am comorbid intersex (as rare to be intersex AND Marfan's as it is.) \\ Anyways, let me know if you lack body hair, whether on your chest, stomach, or other places. huh, interesting thought, never thought about like that but yeah i do not have much body hair either.

In fact even if two of four uncles got the Aortic Valve operation my father at 67 stopped at 4,5 cm for the last seven years, never had a problem in life (diagnosed at 61, 165cm height) plus he lived at 4k mts altitude multiple years, if he had an heavier case probably he would be already dead.\n\nWhat im curious, empathic, is how do you manage the diagnosis in a non welfare state country.\n\nIf you have the diagnosis, let us say at mid twenties like me, can the insurance increase the cost? Can they refuse to renew the contract? Do you need to heavy save money for the operation? What it is like to be a mid income marfanoid in the USA? I have health insurance through school. 90-95% of Americans have health insurance, and most of the things related to marfans are covered. For example, the co-pay for my surgery was $100. The surgery itself cost around $85,000, which is really the problem with the U.S. health care system. My medications are all generics and cost $15/3 month supply. I pay $20 every year for copay for my echocardiogram. That is my experience. I thought that an operation of marfan/ Loeys dietz level would cost way more than that. \nThanks for the info i thought that for you (US citizens) a life with marfan would be way economically harder than for us in Europe.\n\nGood to know ! :) \n yeah world bank has a lot of good data on out of pocket costs:  also Kaiser Family Foundation has a lot of good info on U.S. costs ", "People who have been lifting weights for some time now following the 10-20 lb max limit, did you make any noticeable changes? ", "Any one else short? I am only 5'3 due to being on medication when I was a kid that stunted my growth, and whenever I tell a new doctor I have marfans they just look at me and roll their eyes.  I got diagnosed a while ago, but yet I have had doctors tell me there is no way I can have marfans despite being positive and ugh, it is just infuriating.\n\nJust wondering if anyone else has to deal with this?

", "Do not worry about bodybuilding. There are other ways to be masculine, baggy clothing, a deep voice, I know a lot of guys with marfans who want muscle and to be masculine, looks are not everything when it comes to muscle, however, if anything, if you must be masculine, there is always the attitude, and the clothing, you guys still have hope, and this is coming from the most effeminate marfan male here. I DO NOT have a deep voice for a 24 year old male, I have soft feminine facial features, I lack body hair, I have a curvy waist and wide hips, some people think I am transgender or intersex. I am just naturally like this. Trust me. Lifting weights is not worth it. I was at a point to where I thought it could benefit me, now, I think, \"If people are not into my body, they can find someone else\". Because looks are not everything, you do not need to impress people with muscles, but if you must, I think clothing is the best option to impress girls or whatever. Also do not let society force you to workout when you do not want to, because I was peer pressured a lot in my life to lift weights and be someone I was not. I think, as long as you eat healthy, that is all that matters. I think eating a healthy amount of food to survive is the best option. I remember just trying to lift weights just to see what it could do for me, all it did was give me a fast heart rate, pain in my chest, and one time there was an abdominal pulse, I never found out if it affected my aorta or not, I never bothered to check, but I guess it was a warning sign to just \"Quit it\". I know this will either get a lot of likes, or a lot of dislikes, not sure, it depends on people's personalities and their opinions, I am not saying totally give up being masculine, unless you want to, but for me it is like, that stuff, that society alpha male stuff, never really interested me. I think, do not worry about how your skinny body looks, just as long as you eat healthy and your organs are all fine. You can still be attractive or strong in other ways. According to my doctor, when she tested my strength and pushed against my body and I had to push back, I was, according to her \"Very strong\", at least, with pushing stuff. You can be WHOEVER you want, you can have WHATEVER dream you want, just, if it costs your health, do not risk it, please. Sometimes I just get so mad and I throw stuff and sometimes I fear that might not be good for my health either, so please, take it easy. You only get this one life in this one body with this one brain. Make it last long. The way you act and present yourself is more attractive than being a macho man.\n\nJust as a side note, is it not possible for Marfan people to do light lifting/body exercises?  Marfans exists on a spectrum,  at the mild end we can be very active,  at the severe end we need to be extremely careful with even light activity.  Determine with your doctor where you fall. Strange post. Also, formatting dude. Use paragraphs. \\*Strong post.\n\nToo many times have I died from doing activities. Honestly, there is other ways to find love. I am just sick of this incel alpha male crap. The fact that people see this as a strange is either, my mental health is declining and I just cannot see it, or, you people are wrong, because I am trying to warn these alpha males that working out are not going to work because you will die from your aorta and it is adios for you. I want to warn you alphas that muscles are not shit. Some women do not care about that stuff, you can still be strong without muscles, before knowing I had a physical disorder, I could lift kind of good, even though I was and still am bones. Again, this is not a \"strange\" post, you just have not seen a social justice/warning people of health dangers post yet I guess.", "Question about long term beta blocker use A little background: Hi I am a mid20s female with a mild variant of Marfan\u2019s that my cardiologist describes as \u201cMarfanoid.\u201d I am short for marfans at 5\u20197 but I am about a foot taller than every female in my family. The main diagnostic criteria I met after seeing a cardiologist and genetic specialist were hyper mobility, arachnodactylity, mild pectus excavatum, severe myopia,  flat feet, mitral regurgitation, mitral valve prolapse, and mild-borderline aortic root dilation. \n\nMy cardiologist advised me to cut out contact sports, running,  and caffeine mainly to keep my heart rate low since I tend to get tachycardia with chest pain and palpitations several times a day and because he warned me about sudden dissection since I do have mild aortic root dilation. I switched to yoga and green tea that helped some but as a med student there are days when a run and/or coffee are very necessary. I get anxious a lot and my primary care doctor recommended propanalol to help keep my heart rate down and it worked great. \n\nI used propanalol for the past year but I stopped using it a month ago after I took boards and hearing about how it is not good for long term use. However I have started experiencing the tachycardia and frequent chest pain again. Last week during a certain pose in yoga I felt a slight tear in my chest but I think it is just in my head and was probably more muscular than cardiac in origin. I have been dizzy and tachycardic off and on since around then so I am considering propanalol again. \n\nHas anyone on this sub used beta blockers long term or have any feasible recommendations that do not involve completely cutting out some form of caffeine and exercise?  I have been on beta blockers since i was about 10 years old (27 now).  Took atenolol at first, now have switched to nadalol.  My doctor had me switch because atenolol was making me feel groggy/depressed.\n\nThe only caffeine I drink is in tea, usually only one cup a day in the morning.\n\nMy recommendation is play around with your electrolyte balance.  Try cutting your salt intake (no processed foods, meats, canned soups, do not add salt to anything, etc.).  If that does not help, try upping your potassium intake (potatoes and bananas).\n\nAs a med student you probably know more than I do but potassium and salt exist in a balance in your body, potassium sort of counter-acts salt.  Too much or two little of either can mess up your BP and heart rhythm. I have been on bisoprolol for nearly 9 years (34 now) and it has not given me any problem. I have a daily cup of black tea every morning, I do an hour of lap swimming twice, sometimes three times a week.  \n\n\nBe honest with your doctor so together you can find a safe middle ground. I was told I cannot do contact sports or lift weights, I said I do not care about those but I have to swim. He said you can exercise but try not to push too hard. I said I am too old to start as an Olympic swimmer now anyways so we are good. We never spoke about coffee but I reckon it is only right I gave my heart a chance after my root/valve replacement so I made the switch to tea willingly, still some caffeine but healthier. I did completely stop with energy drinks (Red Bull) post op cos I cannot imagine that helps the heart or BP at all.", "I just canceled a ski trip. Feeling disappointment &amp; relief. A group of really active friends invited me on a ski trip. (All Covid safety measures have been taken not the focus of this post).\nI signed up for a beginner lesson. One friend on the trip would also sign up as a beginner. I was so excited. Pushing back on my body felt exhilarating. Like the time I went  backpacking alone or completed a 6 week bootcamp. I used to push my body all the time. I drove a car for years even if I could hardly see the road. I smoked ciggeretts!\n\nBut I have never been skiing. \nAs I creep out of my 20s and into my 30s I have become... responsible? I want to learn how to ski so badly but my vision is terrible. My aorta is edging toward the danger zone and my joints are creeky from my shelter in place lifestyle. \n\nI canceled the lesson because the last thing I need is an injury. But I am sad.  I want to be able to take risks. Maybe I could have been just fine in a beginner ski class...\n\nMost of the time I am grateful for hiking, yoga and all the things my body has stamina for but hanging with my friends who bike 40 miles in a day and can skii just has me feeling like I cannot keep up. Like my body is not as \"good\". \n\nI am trying to be proud of myself for protecting my body for doing what is healthy but I am just frustrated.\n\nOk going to go write 30 things I am grateful for. I know this is not a problem but feelings happen. Okay Bye! I know how you feel! It kills me that i cant do heavy weight lifting at the gym to grow more muscle, and I am always baffled by how my friends with \"normal\" bodies waste away without getting into training. But like your alluded to at the end of your post, its all about being greatful for what you do have :) we have got it way better than millions out there, so it is just a matter of working with what we have got and appreciating it! Hi! I do not have Marfan, but my little one does. We have gone skiing twice in the last month, and I will say that while he is only 7, he is struggling! He says he is having fun and wants to go, so we continue to take him, but it is very difficult for him. Just walking in heavy, hard ski boots makes his legs and feet hurt. He does great on bunny slopes, but his endurance is lacking and by the end of the day, he is SPENT. It takes him several days to recover\u2014from both leg pain and fatigue. I think that whatever you decide is the best choice! I understand wanting to \u201ckeep up,\u201d but this can be mentally and emotionally exhausting.

He appeared typical a few years ago, but with puberty, his arms and hands/fingers elongated and he is nearly 5 ft. 10 in. having grown rapidly. He is skinny (on ADHD medication for nearly two years) and his body type is \"lanky\" for lack of a better word--long arms, legs, big feet, etc. His pediatrician noted all of this and is referring us to a genetic counselor. I has assumed my child just looked a little \"goofy\" until he grows into his height/ frame. \n\nI do not believe that my husband or I have Marfan Syndrome. My husband is barely 5 ft. 11, and I am 5 ft 3, although I have features (long fingers, toes, some hypermobility, and fit some individual criteria)...but again, I am small, and no known significant issues/effects by age 50. \n\nI am just nervous and could use advice or even just a \"good luck.\" About you having some similarities with marfan syndrome, not all people manifest the same problems, and not in the same magnitude, Also, marfan can skip 1 generation If I recall.\n\nYou can live with Marfan pretty good, it is a pain in the ass tho depending on the severity you have.The most important thing to take in mind is the heart. (An aorta aneurysm can be a mayor problem and what can kill you). But if you monitor all the problems that start appearing, the life expectancy of marfan is like 60-70 years old, so that is plenty of time if you ask me :).\n\nA recommendation: I will encourage an IT education (programming, engineering, etc). Since normally marfan\u00b4s tend to avoid intense physical jobs. \n\nGood luck! I hope he don\u00b4t have it, but if he does, it is not that bad, maybe at first, but do not worry too much, it is a pain in the ass, it can entitle a lot of visits to the doctor, medications, mayor surgeries and planning, but you can have a really good life if you overcome that hardships :) it probably seems a little scary to find this out now but everything is going to be okay. Medicine has come a long way and us marfanoids seem to be doing good for the most part. Plus, if he does have the syndrome, it is good that doctors have found it while he is still young so that tracking can be done effectively :)) Hi just want to correct a thing, as we currently know marfan cannot skip generations as it is a dominant trait, if you have it your spawn will have 50%-50% chances of having the affected gene or not having it. It is also possible to have genetic mosaicism with a congenital mutation and present a less severe phenotype (presentation), what may be the case of the mother but it is only possible to be sure with genetic testing. Seconding this correction. Marfans, at present knowledge of the syndrome, does not skip generations. However, roughly one in every four people diagnosed with Marfan have a spontaneous mutation that is caused it.\n\nI am one of those people, both my parents are tall and my mom is lanky, but when they tested my parents they did not have it. Hi, being lanky does not necessarily mean someone has Marfan syndrome.  \nThere are more major signs such as dislocated lenses (ectopia lentis), Aortic Aneurysms (dilatation of the aortic root), etc in Marfan syndrome   \n\n\nOften Marfan patients also have a lot more stretch marks than normal, so the doctor will also check for this. Source: ( \"About 3 out of 4 people with Marfan syndrome inherit it, meaning they get the genetic mutation from a parent who has it. But some people with Marfan syndrome are the first in their family to have it; when this happens it is called a spontaneous mutation. \" Hi, my advice is do not worry yourself too much. I just went through this with my 15 year old and worried myself sick. My son had some signs of possible Marfans noted by the pediatric surgeon we took him to for his pectus excavatum. Besides the pectus he had the stretch marks, height and thin build etc. He referred us to one of the top Cardiologists and Marfans specialists in Chicago who ordered an ECG. His heart was fine and other diagnostics performed showed he did not meet the criteria for Marfans. He diagnosed my son as \u201ca tall and skinny teenager\u201d.  We were extremely relieved. I felt a little humbled by the worry I and stress my wife and I put ourselves through before an actual diagnosis. Bottom line, pray for the best and wait until he is actually seen and has his heart checked out. He will probably be fine especially since Marfans is such a rare condition. Do not worry yourself sick. Good luck to you and your family. My 15 year old is 6\u20191. She had mild scoliosis with a 10% curvature and had to have braces and a palate expander for crowded teeth. She had a normal ekg within the last year. She does not have the positive wrist sign or flat feet. She does wear glasses but I have never been told anything about dislocated lenses just nearsightedness. To my knowledge no one in our family has it. I do worry because she is so tall and she has purple stretch marks in the middle of her back. She is heavy based on the bmi scale but does not appear overweight when you look at her.", "Do I look like I have Marfan?I can also do that hand tests with thumb and wrist. ", "Speech problems? I suffer from speech problems due to my marfans. Anyone else? :/ I theorize that some odd speech sounds are the result of a mouth shaped at least slightly differently than \"normal\" - most notably the high arched palate, and the often crowded teeth. \n\nI myself have odd sounds, sometimes lispy, often muddled a bit. Not a LOT, just more than \"normal\". Incidentally, whilst watching the last Olympics, I was super intrigued by the interviews with Michael Phelps. While it is been officially stated that he does not have Marfans, he certainly has a lot of the features of it. And listening to him speak was incredibly familiar, very similar to hearing myself speak. Nope. I lisp slightly, but that is an effect of the bridge that replaced my front teeth. I have a hard time with \"g\" sounds, Google is one of my least liked words to say out loud, and it is one I have to say quite often due to my profession (ISP tech support for customers...) I also have troubles with \"s\" as well, but i assume that is because of my high palate. I work very hard to correct it constantly but it still happens. I had a stroke 7 years ago and went through speech therapy and that helped quite a bit, even though that was more or less just to get me back to my normal.", "Can you get genetic testing done online (without a doctor)?  Not reliably yet. Genetic testing for Marfan is done with blood and you would generally want a full TAAD panel\ndone by a geneticist. Unless you have a parent who has been previously tested.

Which is much cheaper.", "Aortic Root size Hello all, \n\nI have been referred to a specialist that I will be visiting next Monday to help determine a diagnosis for Marfan Syndrome.  I was curious as to different members Aortic Root diameter and heights respectively.  I am 192 cm tall and my most recent Aortic Root diameter was 3.7 cm. I am 180cm tall, 4cm aorta. My team basically has me get an annual MRI to check my aorta. My last visit he started pushing beta blockers. I have not started those yet but I probably will be soon. You have not yet? What age are you? My kid (14) has those (Atenolol) since he was like 5.\n\nI would jump on it to at least try, my child has 0 side effects of them, sports 4 times a week and is doing great (besides some cosmetic issues and recent lower back pain (possibly not related to Marfan)) With a 4cm aorta, no beta blockers is horrifically dangerous. Did they give you a reason for not putting you on them? They are low risk high reward for us. I have a 4.6 and I am 5'11\"/180cm. This measurement is typically in surgery threshold. No movement on it for around 8 years, though, so while we watch it the surgery is still considered more risky. Oooh, can I win this contest?

Listen to world experts share the latest on all things Marfan ", "Harm reduction info regarding substances and marfans. Hi! I am 19 years old with marfans syndrome. I was wondering, mainly in the class of psychedelic substances used infrequently, if that is a danger. I know it raises blood pressure and bp, but surely a raise once every couple months cannot be significant? or could it?\n\nAlso posting this as im sure many others use drugs themselves and most likely use substances like heavy stimulants unaware of the dangers using those poses on the heart ESPECIALLY for us. Cocaine causes aortic dissection in HEALTHY people so with marfans i cannot imagine the dangers on the heart from abusing drugs like strong stimulants (Amphetamines, Cocaine, etc). \n\nAlso mainly asking, because NOTHING else works for me. i have tried everything the psychiatric system has to offer for my PTSD I got diagnosed with from my emergency open heart surgery plus diagnosis at the same time when I was only 15. Having a strong spiritual psychedelic experience once every couple months is what keeps me going and feeling creative, and \"alive\" :). Please do not judge me, im not a drug addict or anything at all. Quite the opposite. I am against people using these drugs how I do even twice in a whole month. you need to space it out. \n\nAnyways, any harm reduction info for us marfanoid's would be amazing, not restricted to substances i mentioned. Sorry to hear you are having a rough go of it.  Post OP, even if not an emergency, can have a very real mental toll.  I am glad you are being open.\n\nHowever, this is not the kind of advice I think most people would feel comfortable giving here.  For instance, I agree with what you are saying about stimulants being extra dangerous, but I do not know all the effects of other drugs.  For instance, I personally avoid weed because I have found that sometimes it makes my blood pressure drop to the point I cannot see well.  Not always, but sometimes.  The point is that unless someone is trained medical professional evaluating you as a PT, this is NOT one of those areas that someone can give casual advice.\n\nThat being said, it sounds like you have found benefit in a \"clean out\" every few months.  I do not know a ton about it, but I know that is a growing method of treatment specifically for some cases of PTSD.  Rather than a once a day pill folks will see a doctor every few months for something that intense for an afternoon with the after effects being the therapeutic benefit.\n\nI think ketamine is used this way.  There are doctors familiar with it (although not all are), and those doctors would be able to evaluate the specific risks.  Again though: do NOT just go get some ketamine.  It is a substance that you CAN find a doctor to work with you around.  It will be far safer, and provide a much better outcome for you, with a professional evaluating your specific situation. Idk what others think, and I am ***NOT*** a doctor. BUT. I used to trip a ton of LSD and smoke a lottttt of weed. I am still alive at 28. Take that how you will. I am 6'7, 185 lbs, and I do very physically active work 4 nights a week for my occupation. Feeling great. I drank, smoked, everything else, and partied my way from 15-24. You will PROBABLY be okay. Again. Not a doctor though. It is not because you are okay that others will be. Each case is different. Yeah, it sucks because I feel anxious mentioning anything about psychedelic use to my doctors. Only doc who knows is my psychotherapist, and she is very pro-psych. she hinted that psychedelic treatment as you described with the real medicines that have been used for thousands of years, is coming. I also find this a beautiful way to handle the covid isolation, since I have not been anywhere or seen any friends since this whole circus started. It is kind of like a \"trip\" somewhere else. But yeah, for instance, I asked my cardiologist who specializes in marfans cardiovascular health, and he said that stimulants like even Adderall should be fine for me, as long as I use therapeutic doses. That being said, Adderall and the related drugs are all crap. Within one month of therapeutic use, my mind feels like scrambled eggs. I stopped taking it and only use it when I REALLY need to focus.\n\nI wish there was more scientific literature on substances for people with marfans, as these days, way way too many people are abusing drugs like cocaine or speed, and people with marfans could be unaware of these risks if they cannot put 2 and 2 together. You would be surprised how many people use the most dangerous substances without doing any research, even in the \"popular\" setting. I have completely changed as a person, but I used to be that guy. Thank fuck I got diagnosed before everyone around me at partys started doing coke with drinking. No one seems to know this combo creates an entire different substance in their body, that is way more cardiotoxic and neurotoxic then either cocaine or alcohol alone, called Cocaethylene. Hey, also experimented with psychedelics, smoke weed etc.\n\nThere is a lot to unpack, because there really is a very pro legalization agenda that pushes some very unproven health benefits to marijuana.\n\nIt seems like there is starting to be some similar similar stuff going on in the psychedelic field, but not quite as much.\n\nSo I think it is pretty self evident that folks with Marfan's should stay away from amphetamines, cocaine, etc.\nThe other thing that you want to keep an eye on is interactions with other medications that you are taking.  I cannot think of it immediately, but I do think that there is a sub that deals with this issue. \n\nAnd finally, at least with psychedelics, there are two things- a recent study showed that microdosing had about the same effect as placebo- which I do not think should be discounted- and that in terms of mental health guided intense trips were more effective to reset major depressive disorder folks. Ketemine is also being explored for this option.\nKeep in mind, this was the original research that was being conducted in the 50s before it was coopted by multiple groups. \nThe primary issue with psychedelics is probably going to be how the trip affects you and what you are dealing with during the session. Things to avoid are going to be increased heart rate and pressure. \n\nThat is really the issue with weed as well- it can drastically affect your blood pressure and interact with medications. Some studies have shown that it can increase inter-ocular pressure, which is one reason why it is no longer recommended for folks with glaucoma, unless as a pain med. Depending on how much you are using, it can also increase your heart rate and blood pressure. \n\nBut I am not a doctor, and this is mostly from my personal \"research\" through paper abstracts.\n\n(I put that in quotations because I in no way know how to do research other than googling and checking against multiple sources. Still better than youtube though!) Yeah man. Not saying this to be a dick or anything at all lol, but I actually know all this haha. I am also extremely interested in the science behind these substances. And yeah I also think I read a study how chronic micro dosing can effect the heart valves, I forget the exact issue but as soon as I heard that I decided microdosing frequently was not for me. As for microdosing being the same as placebo, the therapeutic benefits require a lot of work from yourself as well. Also the whole point of microdosing is that you do not notice a shift in consciousness, but you take just enough to add a little excitement to your life, for example, you might end up having more appreciation for nature, etc. But lots of spiritual work is required along with microdosing for it to be beneficial, and it takes awhile for the full benefits to work. \n\nBut you are right, doing \u201cheroic doses\u201d infrequently, in my experience, is MUCH more significant in terms of benefits. You just have to make sure you research everything that can happen, like feeling like your dying lol, ego death, etc. Lots of people have \u201cbad tripe\u201d because they do not know what to expect, start getting freaked out, then end up in negative thought loops and end up tweaking the fuck out. But when done properly, I am convinced these are the holy grail for treatment in lots of mental health issues. This is something that should be taken very seriously, and only done infrequently, for anyone. But he is the Mayor of Titty City so at least he is somewhat of an expert. :] &gt; Yeah, it sucks because I feel anxious mentioning anything about psychedelic use to my doctors. Only doc who knows is my psychotherapist, and she is very pro-psych. she hinted that psychedelic treatment as you described with the real medicines that have been used for thousands of years, is coming\n\nThere are colleges that are starting to be allowed to run clinical MDMA/psychoactive drug therapy for severe traumas. I know there are a few in the US (California has a few colleges, I think there is a place in Colorado that is starting to train their grad students and others about how to safely administer such methods). So it is coming around. Slowly but hopefully surely.\n\nFrom a strictly personal opinion: If you can manage to do the psychoactive drugs and not get hurt - your heart does not start doing backflips, your breathing does not go sideways, etc - I see no harm in it. Be smart about what you are putting in your body and listen to it, it sounds super cheesey but your body will tell you when you need to make adjustments and/or stop. take ketamine, it lowers the heart rate - this is my party drug of choice.", "What is the best way to get diagnosed? Hi. \n\nI am getting checked for Marfans in 5 days. Since I have some symptoms that can be related to Marfans. My doctor said that she would measure my arms span. But it is my GP. Can she diagnose/ help me getting diagnosed? What is the best tests you can do? Read rule number two my guy. I did not asked. I asked what specialt should I go to, to check if I might have it?", "Has anyone had multiple symptoms of Marfan Syndrome but been proven to not have the disorder? I will be the first to admit I am highly cardiophobic. The idea of having any illness affecting the heart terrifies me.\n\nI recently went to A&amp;e for an attack of sorts, one of many I have had for 6 years. To my surprise, the consultant did all sorts of unorthodox checks like my arm length, body type, previous tests and so on. At first I was relieved because all other doctors simply wrote me off with anxiety. Others diagnosed things like LPR Reflux and Asthma, but we never found anything to control my symptoms. \n\nAs soon as I heard the words Marfan Syndrome, I had to look it up for my own sanity. Turns out it did more harm than good. I am 27 years old, and one if the first things I read was how people left untreated do not make it past 35.\n\nI did my best to have a CT Scan but I was so symptomatic and anxious the test did not have concrete results. A Chest XRay showed nothing, however 5 years ago I had Echocardiagram proving mild Mitral Valve Prolapse.\n\nSome of my symptoms match Marfan's. I am extremely tall, unusually skinny with long arms, crowded teeth and have poor eyes, trouble sleeping and a weird ribcage suggesting scoliosis. Other things do not match. I have nornal sized legs, no deformity in chest shape otherwise, poor flexibility, normal sized fingers and toes and from what we have seen so far, no damage internally. I also have Raynauds which is not associated with Marfan's but strikes with my symptoms.\n\nI will be honest. At this stage I pray for a miracle. Anxiety is plastered all over my records for years, so even if I prove I have Marfan's, it will be near impossible for me to get surgery for it. My only hope is that my consultant was wrong and that, despite so many matching symptoms, I do not have Marfan's at all.\n\nFor the sake of helping me hold onto what little hope I have left, please let me know if anyone here has had many symptoms of the disease, but did not end up having the Syndrome. Thank you for any help you may offer.  So I was tested for Marfan\u2019s recently. The first test showed nothing, they sent away for a second test which also showed nothing. \n\nI am 5\u201d10, skinny, difficulty gaining and maintaining any weight that I put on, poor vision, crowded teeth, sunken chest, long fingers and toes, slightly flexible, enlarged Aorta. On top of that I have Mitral Regurgitation, go into Atrial Fibrilation and have PVC beats. \n\nThe doctor I saw is sure I have it but they cannot find the issue with the defective gene in my body. I am the first in my family too. \n\nRight now, I have to wait 5 years for any changes in science to help diagnose me properly and get reviewed. \n\nIt is being described as Fibrilin 1-Negative Marfans. I have had all the anxiety and worry etc because of the heart issues, but they describe it all as mild, so I have come to terms with it all now. \n\nI do not know if it will ever be diagnosed. It might just be that I also have lots of symptoms that match. I try my best not to think about that side of it. I think more about my heart issues than anything else though. That is the biggest worry I have too.  I am the tallest person in my family(6'1 with a 6'4 wingspan), crowded teeth, narrow/thin face, slightly recessed chin, slightly recessed jaw, flat cheekbones, slightly down turned eyes, very thin and lanky in general, high palate, and maybe a few other minor symptoms. Nothing too alarming.\n\nWhile I do not have anything like MVP, I did become a hypochondriac this past year, and one of my main fears was Marfan's. I went to a cardiologist first because I was having crazy palpitations and random high blood pressure. It turns out months later, it was all just anxiety. After having an ECG and stress test, everything came back perfect. However, I was not satisfied. Just a few weeks ago I got the genetic sequencing results which proved me to be Marfan free(no Marfan's Syndrome).\n\nYou said you had an ECG done a few years ago and now you are 27. So 25ish? Well, it is on the rare side for someone with Marfan's to not present aortic dilatation by the age of 19. 66%(2/3rds) of Marfan's patients present aortic dilatation by the age of 19. It is still very possible to have it and not have aortic dilation by your age, but it makes having Marfan's less likely in your case. Tbqh, you are going to need a new ECG to see where you are at as far as aortic health. \n\nIs it possible to appear to have Marfan's Syndrome and not have it. Yes, very. Marfan's Syndrome's physical features are so common, that if you do not have aortic dilatation or Ectopis Lentis, they often will not even consider you clinically having Marfan's, unless it is overbearingly obvious. Is it possible you have it? Yes, it is. MVP is also a symptom of Marfan's Syndrome as you may know by now. \n\nI am not a medical professional by any means, but if I had to guess if you had it or not based off of your symptoms, I would say it is a possibility. But hell, it is a possibility for anyone who is very tall and skinny. Go get another ECG and see if you can get a referral to a medical geneticist. Express your concern to your cardiologist. The only way us hypochondriacs can be at ease is if we are proven wrong or right with facts. \n\nBest of luck! Yes.  I have a friend from college who looks like a typical marf but has no issues. My aunt has MVP as well. She is short though, probably 158cm but with long limbs, she looks like she is got scoliosis as well, I have never asked her. She cannot put weight just like you but her aorta size was in the normal range when checked and she is 45 years old without any other problems. The doctor told her MVP is genetic and is more common among thin people and she should avoid high-intensity workouts. Cold hands and feet as well. There was another syndrome that shares the same symptoms with Marfan but without the enlargement of the aorta, forgot its name, maybe someone can help here. I doubt it you have Marfan, good luck and do not stress out. Height, thinness, poor eyes, mitral valve prolapse and scoliosis are all exceedingly common in the general population. \n\nIt is why you cannot get a diagnosis *from* those symptoms alone, but you can from certain other symptoms. Physical markers can cause doctors to look at you more closely, that is all. This person only has a few very common general physical markers and severe anxiety. Encouraging their hypochondriac tendencies is harmful.  Never attempted a diagnosis. Nor would I. If he wants peace, the only way he will find it is by getting hard evidence. He probably does not have it, but it is also possible.  They already have hard evidence, you are encouraging them to get unnecessary testing  to feed their mental illness based on common factors. \n\nThey would be better served seeking treatment (or more/specialized treatment) for their admitted severe anxiety. That or they will be another one back here after paying for a genetics test that came up negative, still denying the results because they are mentally ill.  I agree that he should get help as far as his mental state, but I disagree that he will deny a genetic sequencing that proves he is Marfan negative. You are making an assumption that he will deny it. You do not know that to be true. A genetic sequencing could be the very thing that would put his mind at rest. I am just letting him know that it is an option, instead of saying: \"you probably do not have it. Who knows?\". Why not find out for sure if it is bothering him THAT much? It is something that we have already seen a handful of times here. In fact, the post right below this one is a hypochondriac denying genetic results.\n\nNot every mentally ill person reacts the same in any case, of course, but you still told this person to deny evidence in favor of pursuing more rather than pursuing treatment for the problem at hand.  The ECG he had done is pretty hard evidence and I acknowledged that by referring to statistics in the most prominent meta analysis on Marfan's Syndrome. However, his ECG results do not guarantee that he is Marfan free. I agree that it is unlikely he has it, but if it helps him out, then why would not he pursue genetic sequencing which would potentially put his worry to rest. You yourself just said not everyone is the same as far as being comfortable with sequencing results. So it is very possible that it could help him. That is all I am saying. Yes, I was ruled out on Marfans but am being tested for loeys dietz syndrome and then ehlers danlos syndrome.\n\nReynauds and a mitral valve prolapse lean closer into Ehlers danlos territory than marfan\u2019s or loeys dietz and anxiety is a common complaint for them. Have they considered a differential diagnosis with other connective tissue disorders that share multiple common features with marfan\u2019s? Okay boys that is a negative on marfan\u2019s syndrome let us call it a horse and beat it to death?\n\nOr, since we are a support group, we can inform them that Marfan\u2019s shares common features with other connective tissue disorders and guide them over to one of those.\n\nThe reason why the ehlers danlos society made their mascot a zebra is because doctors are told in school when you hear hoofs think horses not zebras, which is great unless you are a zebra and they treat you like a horse. You are being utterly ridiculous. But of course, think you are taking the high road and being supportive by offering to feed into a person's mental illness. \n\nConstantly seeing posts of \"I am tall and thin and wear glasses DAE think I am going to die\" does not promote a supportive atmosphere for people actually diagnosed with the disorders. It is exhausting. Thanks for the link! Still very new to understanding everything happening so this will be an interesting read for me. \n\nNothing else has been discussed actually. The doctor I saw said he believes it is Marfans and left it at that. He just wants it monitored. Not regular though...next appointment for tests would be in five years. \n\nI did not even know there were related disorders to be honest so I would not have thought to ask myself. \n\nThanks again. I will be reading up :) ECG is not a diagnostic test that would pick up aortic enlargement - for that you need an ultrasound; ecg shows the electric functioning of your heart muscle. I believe you are confusing EKG with ECG. An ECG is an ultrasound. No, ECG stands for electrocardiography (EKG is only rarely used in the English language). Echocardiogram is the ultrasound of the heart - if tou look it up on wikipedia it spexifically says not to use the ECG abbreviation because it stands for electrocardiography). Alright, I will let my cardiologist know he is wrong for calling it an ECG if I ever see him again. I will let him know some random person on Reddit is more knowledgeable than him. Thanks! It appears you are right. For whatever reason I always abbreviated Echocardiogram (ECG), instead of it is formal abbreviation (Echo). Do not know why I did that. Thanks for clarifying. When I said ECG I meant an Echo. Go get a genetics test to test for the disorder (and/or related disorders). That is the only way to definitively tell you what you may or may not have.", "About Aorta rupture Good morning everyone, I have already read in this forum about cases of aortic rupture, but I do not remember that person, if it is not too much discomfort could you tell me What are your symptoms before the breakup? Lately I have not been feeling well and I am scared :,(, This information would help me to seek medical advice, since 2 months ago I had an Echocardiogram, according to everything is fine, but I do not feel well, Sometimes I feel slight stitches in my heart, although other doctors say they are caused by anxiety. Help me. Do you have an aneurysm? I occasionally have random chest pains, palpitations, etc.  They do not help with anxiety but I have been living with an aneurysm for 10+ years and have gotten more or less used to it.  But if I felt something weird or new, I would not hesitate to contact my doctor.  (Or go to the ER if it was bad.)\n\nMy impression of dissection that is if you were experiencing one, you would not have finished typing that post.  Ask your doctor though. I have 3.5cm aorta, is it aneurysm? 3.5cm is fine and not an aneurysm. An aortic dissection feels like being stabbed in the back. Once it happens, most people *know* it and feel absolutely awful. \n\nSlight pain in your torso are not an indication of an aortic aneurysm, and unless it gets ridiculously big, most people do not have any symptoms before it burst. Thx, This relaxes me a little, I will suppose that the stitches I feel is anxiety. I had a type b dissection in March. It was the worst pain I have ever felt in my life. It felt like having the muscles on the back of my ribs were being torn from my spine. I am a wuss with meds, low doses of painkillers knock me out, but the ER gave me morphine while they were trying stabilize me and it did nothing. I told the doctors that I would rather give birth to my children again than feel that pain again. That sounds painful, did you have symptoms before the dissection or was it sudden, how big was your aorta? Sorry if you uncomfortable, but I am scared and this information would relax me. it was sudden, my aorta was measuring at like a 1 at my last scan. I was at work and my back hurt right below my shoulders. I though is was just slouching to much and stood up to stretch and go on my break. the pain started and got to shaking level bad within minutes. Your aorta measured 1 inch on your last scan, how long did it take from your last scan to your aorta dissection? it was 1 cm out side normal parameters, and it was 8 months since my last scan. As of my last scan I was told you could not tell I was a marfans patient by just looking at my heart. My dissection was out of the blue Mine is around 4.8cm been hovering just below 5cm for as long as we have been monitoring it the last \\~6 years.    \n\n\nMy surgeon has had MANY people with Marfans or other connective tissue disorders come in younger than me with 7-8cm aorta's without symptoms and successful surgeries.  \n\n3.5cm sounds like the normal range, but while it would be wise to perhaps track and monitor it-- it is counterproductive to cause your healthy heart insane amounts of stress about this (even those that do).  \n\nI think you are okay and it sounds like you have doctors on this issue and are literally far and away in the 'safe' area regarding this issue. that relaxes me, thank you for answering my questions Truly glad to help and talk to others that can relate to me in so many different ways or 'parts of life' we have gone through as well!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor more assurance, all these years since the first echocardiogram then CT scan that I FORCED the Dr's for... I have long been going to one of the best surgeons and facilities in the world for this stuff.  He is intimately familiar with me and with the gamut of connective tissue disorders (because any Dr with half a brain refers people even like me to drive 6 hours+ there).\n\nannnd the point:  I am nowhere near yet to where in his very professional opinion we need to be that concerned.  I CAN ACTUALLY feel it, often a few times a week or a day it feels almost exactly like something ripping in there and wakes me from sleep.  It passes and I have never once worried about it oddly, just know if it was the complete dissection I would be dead and if it was the blood reroute in between layers kind I would not get better.  I always get better, it is just me 'feeling' it or something.. But I digress, neither he nor I are worried because it is not growing or changing quickly, or seemingly noticeably ever (beyond equipment changes) over these years since the first images.  I used to want to 'get it over with' it is inevitable for someone like me he and I would imagine--- but he understands more than I how many MORE YEARS that may be, before NECESSARY-- let alone efficiently timed or even NEEDED to have surgery however young I still am at said time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe thing is, while some studies suggest specific centimeters, (it is been awhile so I may not be exact) but I think vascular EDS \\~4, then Marfans \\~4.5?, then most connective tissues around 5cm, and normal people he is seen with well over 6+ to 10cm without symptoms sometimes.  Anyway, the deal is, he does specifically this for a lot of his career heading the department and the risk for me around 5 cm just is NOT anywhere near the risk of surgery yet.  Honestly, with my genetics / etc... we will do it once it is past 5 cm I imagine, but that is when the risk for me increases.  And it is been YEARS since.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo like, really good doctors are very passionate about this stuff and spent careers on it, I know Marfan's specifically is a little earlier than my own personal version of weird connective tissue genetics-- but I suggest monitoring it and not worried beyond keeping that up and your knowledge and meetings with a really good upper thoracic surgeon.  If you are around 3.5 then you are well well within the threshold at the moment of safety (and any intervention would be INFINITELY more risky and long term loss of quality of life than just-- monitoring).  Those doctors know it is not just size but genetics / conditions and of course how quickly it is changing!  I am at risk if I do certain breathing or athletics, and I stopped riding my motorcycle as blunt chest trauma can hasten the risks.... but with very basic sense I have no more to worry about than most people day to day at close to 5cm.  If growing faster or too big, we deal with it.  That is why we monitor it, why they study it statistically and clinically, and why it is so important to find and then trust GOOD doctors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShoutout to the chief surgeon at UAB Sorry to intrude. Have you had a pneumothorax before? Or a slipped rib in the back? Because the pain you are describing reminds me of that same (excruciatingly sharp) pain where you cannot even stand up straight and since I have a history of both I am now concerned I may mix up a dissection for either. I have never had that, but it sounds like something I would go to the ER for anyway That is the thing, I have had a slipped rib so many times I am used to now just laying in bed for a day or two until it works itself out, but if I move the pain is awful. I differentiate it from a pneumothorax because it does not get worse when I breathe but very similar sharp pain. I could not lay down when I first went to the hospital and I would have waves of pain. the entire time my BP was going crazy, reading 175/ 100 + before they started heavy duty painkillers and IV BP medications. You will know the difference Thanks. That does help. I do hope I know that difference, just so used to all the random pains that come along with this syndrome. Had type A in February. I blacked out from the pain about 10 minutes after the initial twinge. My wife says I was awake &amp; coherent for the 4 hours it took then to get me into surgery. The last thing I remember is getting out of the car at the emergency room. Then I woke up the next day in the icu. I had an aortic disection on May 14th. This has been the craziest summer ever.

My brother was adopted by my family when he was 2 months old. We do not have a history of marfans in our family at all but very recently my husband who is a doctor felt we should get him tested for Marfans and Ellers Danlos. He is 14 years old and probably grew over half a foot in the last 6 months. He is now 5ft 6inches but still growing. Very tall and very skinny. Underweight although he eats well. Has a longer arm span than height. He is flat footed and slightly bow legged. Has flexible joints in all his fingers. He has struggled with sports because of all this (he hates sports). I am not sure if this is just puberty and we should wait it out, or if we should get him to a doctor now. Also do I take him to a paediatrician? What did all of you do to start? We are in India and Marfans is extremely rare here and I am not sure if local hospitals will be equipped to do the tests to confirm the diagnosis. Or if the doctors locally will even know what it is :/ \n\nThank you for all your help and advise! Have his heart scanned for ballooning of the aorta and sorry to say but at 14 being 5 6 is not tall at all.  Most marfans patients are usually 6 foot plus at that point in life. I wish you the best in this and while average height from region will differ most marfans patients are above average height. Thank you, I will check with the doctor when I take him. He is definitely above average for his height here (tallest in his class at school) and he is outgrown pretty much most men in my family. Average for an adult male in India would be about 5 ft 4 inches! None of those symptoms = Marfans. It is still possible, but those are very common and benign symptoms. If you really want to know, you should have him get an echocardiogram with the intent to see if his aorta or aortic root is larger than it should be, but at his age, it is unlikely they would find that, even if he did have Marfans. Does he have any issues with sight or his eyes? Ask a medical geneticist whk specializes in connective tissue disorders what they think, and ask if you can get the gene sequencing required to identify Marfans and EDS. He wears glasses for short sightedness. He also has small eyelids and ends up having dry eyes because he cannot close them fully when he sleeps. No clue if that is relevant! \n\nI am taking him to a paediatrician later this week. Hopefully we have a geneticist in my city! Good parenting. Good luck as well.  Just get checked man I would have his heart scanned,the lenses in his eyes checked and some xrays done of his spine. \n\nGenetic testing can take a while and there are several connective tissue disorders that present like marfan syndrome. (Loey-Dietz, Ehlers danlos, beals syndrome, mass phenotype. \n\nThe important thing is to get his heart and eyes evaluated, especially before any big growth spurts. \n\nAlso, marfan syndrome does not effect one ethnic group more than the other so unfortunately having an Idian nationality would not make it more unlikely :/\n\nBest of luck.", "This is my 7 year old baby, my pride and joy.

I am 6'1\" with a thin frame (much thinner-looking back then), but I would not say I look dramatically like I have Marfan.  My dad had had an aortic dissection and was saved in emergency surgery.\n\nA couple of years later, I got an MRI (or some type of radiology) done on part of my spine, I believe to check for dural ectasia, at the advice of the geneticist.  At that time my diagnosis was reversed--the geneticist advised me that the radiology results told us conclusively that I did not have Marfan.\n\nSome years later, my father had new aortic aneurysms and elected to have surgery to prevent another dissection and hopefully prolong his life.  He died as a result of complications of the surgery.  \n\nShortly thereafter, someone suggested to me that it made sense for me (and other family members) to be screened for Marfan again.  When I called the office I had years earlier worked with, I spoke with a genetic counselor who advised that I would better make sure I have life insurance before proceeding to get re-screened.\n\nI have delayed the process for years because I am easily overwhelmed and do not know where to get started with the life insurance.

Maybe I should be posting this question to a finance forum, but I am interested in Marfan-specific experiences--have people been successful getting life insurance post-diagnosis? are the premiums punitive at that point? do you need to have the insurance for a certain number of years before getting the diagnosis to avoid the policy being rescinded?\n\nThanks for reading!", "I am newly diagnosed and not sure what to do next.

I wanted to share my full story with you since I have had a lot of people asking me.\n\nA few years ago I posted a GIF of my eyes on Reddit that went viral - I still see the GIF floating around on social media:  ( \n\nI was born premature at 31 weeks (just a little over 2 months early). I was a very long baby and only weighed 4lbs. At 3 years old my parents were told I had dislocated lenses in my eyes which caused me to be severely nearsighted and that I probably had Marfan Syndrome. Though through childhood echos on my heart did not show any major abnormalities, I was never able to fit the clinical criteria until recently. I was always told that I had \"Suspected Marfan Syndrome\", but now finally the clinical diagnosis is there. I have taken a genetic test for Marfan Syndrome and related disorder, but am still waiting to hear back from CHEO Genetics Clinic in Ottawa. \n\nNobody in my family besides me, is exceptionally tall or has had Marfan Syndrome or Aortic disease or any connective tissue disorder. I was tested and do not have Homocystinuria.\n\nI did not previously fit the clinical diagnosis because I did not have enough of the signs according to the geneticists that I have seen to have a high enough systemic score according to the Ghent criteria, which is one of the ways how Marfan Syndrome can be diagnosed.\n\nI am tall (6'8\") and was always lanky as a kid and teenager, but now have put on a good amount of muscle and weight and weigh around 230lbs. I do have a little bit of a high arched palate in my mouth. I have disproportionately long arms (about 7ft span). I have stretch marks all over my body, especially shoulders, belly and back. I was just this year diagnosed with a very mild obstructive sleep Apnea because of poor nose breathing (due to Nasal Valve Collapse and Deviated Septum). My family doctor had a hard time believing me that I thought I had Sleep Apnea, but they did not know that tall people or those with Marfan Syndrome are at a much higher risk for this. I finally went to a Sleep Apnea clinic in Winnipeg and it was confirmed.\n\nI never really showed having the thumb or wrist sign of Marfan Syndrome (maybe if I push really hard my thumb can stick out just barely). I do not have flat feet, no chest deformities. No obvious facial features. No overcrowded teeth. I only found out in my mid 20s that I had very mild scoliosis, so we are not sure if it was present at birth. My elbows do have slightly reduced extension. I do not have joint dislocation problems (hyper-mobility) or stretchy skin. I have never had chronic back or joint pain.\n\nI do have some Eustachian Tube Dysfunction, especially in my left ear, it is impossible for me to pop my ears and has always been this way, and it results in occasional Tinnitus and pressure/full feeling in my ear. This is one of those things that is common in Marfan Syndrome but is not well known.\n\nIn 2011, an echo of my heart showed that my Aortic root was still within the upper normal range. An official diagnosis could still not be given, though I was treated as though I had Marfan Syndrome and had an echo mostly every year, though I did go some periods with not having one for 2 or 3 years.\n\nGrowing up for me was especially difficult, not physically, but emotionally, as some of my earliest memories are how I had flown to Toronto to see Cardiologists and Geneticists. At this time in the early 1990s, the outlook for Marfan patients was not nearly as good as it is today, and I had mistakenly believed as a child that I would not live past 30 years old. This was of course, an incorrect belief on my behalf, because the data around that time had shown that if Marfan Syndrome was left untreated, patients would have a shorter life span. As a young child, I was always aware of the horrifying reality that I could possibly die at a young age.\n\nI was always the tallest person, not just in my class but in my entire schools (except for maybe my first few elementary school years), and it was always demanded of me that I played sports. But I did not. I was never on a single team in high school, although I did bowling as a kid. This was partly because of a mistaken belief that I had that people with Marfan Syndrome could not play any sports, which is really not true, though it varies on patient by patient basis and generally high risk full contact sports should be avoided, and partly because I just did not really have an interest in many sports. I still meet people nearly every day who ask me why I am not a pro basketball or volleyball player. \n\nDuring my teens I started to randomly develop strange panic attacks. They would begin with me feeling very cold, and then my entire body would start to vibrate and then shake uncontrollably. I was hospitalized multiple times and given Benadryl and Oxygen to calm me down. I had never heard of panic attacks and had no idea what they were. I became quite depressed, and was prescribed SSRIs (Celexa), they seemed to help a bit and I was on them for years.\n\nI have read a book on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy called *Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy*, which has definitely helped with depression and anxiety. I highly recommend CBT if there are people struggling with depression, anxiety or unrealistic thought patterns.\n\nI seem to have mostly outgrown my panic attacks, though still occasionally can get one. I did eventually notice a semi-pattern with them, they would always start with me feeling cold, even if I was having a very good day and had absolutely no anxious or depressive thoughts. I would notice my veins on my hands and arms would always disappear and I would test my blood pressure in these times, my blood pressure would be higher than normal. Moderate intake of caffeine or other stimulants seem to have a stronger vaso-constricting effect on me than in other people. Avoiding high amounts of caffeine and eating healthy foods and engaging in light aerobic exercise such as jogging or riding a bicycle seem to combat this and combat my anxiety effectively. I always feel my best after some light exercise and notice that the veins on my hands and arms appear much larger and my anxiety and depression seemingly non-existent in these times after some exercise.\n\nThough I never had any obvious intellectual disabilities, growing up I always struggled in social situations. I struggled to maintain eye contact and small talk was a bit difficult and annoying. I was always overly shy in elementary school. In high school I excelled at several subjects (anything to do with computers or technology), even more so than my teachers. I was also musically talented, but if there was one subject I was terrible at, it was math. I failed math multiple times throughout high school and ended up graduating a year late. Though I do not think this was because of any learning disability, but a lack of motivation and having low self-esteem. I also completely failed my first two years of college, but this was because I had not gone into something that interested me. I finally ended up going to college for Information Technology (IT), and today I am working successfully as a Web Developer and can code expertly in multiple programming languages. My anxiety and depression are finally under control without the need of SSRIs and I am finally more comfortable in social settings. \n\nI include this because Neurodevelopmental delay is very commonly overlooked in Marfan Syndrome, in one study of 30 children with Marfan Syndrome, 50% had some sort of minor Neurologic Deficit such as learning disability, attention deficit disorder or neuromaturational immaturity. ( \n\nI have seem to have finally outgrown most of my neuromaturational immaturity, though I still sometimes say the wrong thing at the wrong time, and my sense of humor can get me in trouble. In college I won a student council award that said \"Oops did I say that out loud\", and although I had often had top grades in most of my classes, looking back, I see how socially immature I was at times and how I have continued to mature, even now that I enter my 30s.\n\nI always wore glasses a child, and then moved to contact lenses when I was about 12. In my late teens, my vision was barely good enough with contact lenses to drive a car.\n\nBut then suddenly, something interesting happened to my right eye. One day while working at a summer camp when I was 20 years old, my vision in my right eye became blurry. I noticed when I tilted my head, I could get a bit of the vision back for a short time, but then it stayed blurry. So I went to the nearest optometrist and told her that I had dislocated lenses in my eyes due to likely Marfan Syndrome. She looked into my eye and exclaimed \"I do not see your lens.\" There was no lens. My eyes natural lens had completely dislocated and fallen into the bottom of my eye. She immediately rushed me to the ophthalmologist, who was absolutely amazed. He looked at my eye, there was no inflammation and my retina and corneas were perfect. I then directly went back to the optometrist, and she happened to have some sample contact lenses, which was very unusual because she had one in such a high power that I needed. She had me put a plain +15 contact lens in my right eye and had me read the charts. \"Have you ever been able to read 20/20 before for distance?\" She asked. I told her no I had not. \"Well guess what, you just read 20/20. I was shocked, as my vision with contact lenses previously was barely good enough for me to hold a drivers' license.\n\nI walked out of the doctors office and I looked around and looked at the sky. I started to cry. I could see birds flying high up in the sky, I had never been able to see things at such a distance before. I will remember this day for the rest of my life.\n\nI eventually had eye surgery (Lensectomy + Vitrectomy) a few months later to remove the lens that was sitting in the bottom of my eye. It worked so well that I asked the doctor to please also schedule a second surgery, to remove the dislocated lens in my other eye. I have been aphakic (without lens) ever since. My first time glow-bowling after this was quite the experience... Why was everything so bright? It was brighter than the noon day sun in there. Peoples faces glowed. My hands seemed to be a different color, and the lights which used to be dark purple were now a blindingly bright violet light. Even some flowers seemed to have different colors. I would later find out that this was because your eyes natural lens effectively filters out UV light, and since I did not have my eyes natural lens, I could see UV light. To this day this has not seemed to have damaged my eyes at all, although I must take extra care in wearing sunglasses on bright days.\n\nBut I had one problem with my vision. Since my contact lenses were plain, and though I had perfect distance vision, I had now had *horrible* near vision. I was told that for this, I had to wear reading glasses. But I *knew* there had to be another option. I hated glasses and still do. They gave me headaches. I researched every brand of contact lens available and I found one online myself called *Proclear Multifocal XR*. But, my eye doctor had never heard the word *Multifocal* before, let alone *Multifocal XR contact lenses*.\n\nI knew my base contact lens prescription, and knew what power of reading glasses I needed, so I ordered Proclear Multifocal XR online myself and guessed for the add power. Almost miraculously, the exact prescription I ordered was what I needed and would later be prescribed. I wear Proclear Multifocal XR with a power of +15 and an add power of +2.5N in both eyes. (Generally you should wear a D in one eye and an N in the other eye, but my optometrist ordered dozens of samples and for some reason the D never would work).\n\nI found it absolutely amazing that even though I had previously worn completely different prescription contact lenses in each eye, after having the lenses removed from both my eyes, my prescription for both eyes is about the same.\n\nI have met Opthamologists over the years who are absolutely amazed. They have told me that they would never recommend implanting lenses in my eyes at this stage because they could not guarantee I would have the same vision that I have now with my contact lenses. The only downfall is that I cannot wear prescription glasses because the prescription is simply too magnifying, and if I for some reason cannot wear my contact lenses, I barely would have enough vision to walk around and not walk into things. To this day I have never had any issues that have prevented me from wearing contact lenses, and I wear them 16 hours a day, and my eye doctor recently remarked \"your corneas are immaculate\".\n\nIn 2011, my Aortic root was 38mm, not high enough to have a Z score of &gt;2 (for a Marfan Diagnosis), but in 2016 that changed, when my Aortic root was 43mm. Though my cardiologist never informed me of this and I did not know until last week.\n\nI became fed up with the system in Canada, I was told that I had to wait 1-2 *years* for my next echo, and it was already over a year since my last one. This was giving me major anxiety. I felt like my doctors had abandoned on following up with me.\n\nAfter my diagnosis of Sleep Apnea, I finally convinced my family physician to refer me to an ENT. I went to the ENT and told him \"I think I have Nasal Valve Collapse due to Marfan Syndrome, is there anything we can do\". The short answer he gave was *not really.* But I began looking online, I thought maybe if I fix my nose breathing it would improve my sleep apnea, and I found a solution! LATERA nasal valve implants. But the only problem? *They do not exist in Canada*. My ENT said he has a waiting list for people who want them to fix nasal valve collapse, and he was trained on LATERA implants but the company had actually *gave up* on getting Health Canada to approve them. What were my options? The ENT said I could have a major surgery on my nose that moved cartilage around and would make my nose wider, now obviously I did not want this. He said that LATERA implants would not cost more than 3500 USD in the USA.\n\nSo, in the middle of a pandemic, the next week, I flew to Minnesota and had the procedure done.    \nWhat I did not know, was that I also had a deviated septum, but she had only scheduled me for the LATERA implants, so I could not be put to sleep (which is normal for most Septoplasty procedures to fix deviated septums), so she performed the Septoplasty, reduction of inferior turbinates in my nose, and the LATERA implants all at once with me awake the whole time. The process gave me some anxiety but I handled it no problem. The most nerve-wracking part is when she injected my nose with Lidocaine numbing solution that was mixed with Epinephrine (which is a vasoconstrictor), she used such a small amount of Epinephrine because my heart was racing so fast, in fact one of the smallest amounts of Epinephrine she had ever used while doing the surgery - and to her surprise, my nose barely bled at all during the procedure. \"You are not a bleeder\" she said.\n\nSo while I was in Minneapolis to get my nose breathing fixed, I thought, well why do not I see a doctor who is knowledgeable on Marfan Syndrome? I felt like my doctors in Canada were basically ignoring me. I scheduled an appointment at one of the top clinics in the country. Mayo Clinic. All within the matter of 2-3 days I had COVID-19 testing and antibody testing, full blood lab, echo-cardiogram, ECG and X-ray, and met with a Cardiologist and Geneticist. They were able to find my records from 2016 as well from the cardiologist in Canada. But all of these tests and appointments came at a high price tag, of about $5000 - which was all of my savings, and then some.\n\n*Finally*, a confirmed diagnosis. My Aortic Root was 43-44mm, (which it was 43mm in 2016 but I was never told this), so this alone with the feature of being tall and having had dislocated lenses satisfies one of the ways that Marfan Syndrome is officially clinically diagnosed.\n\nI now have a plan with my doctors moving forward. I feel like I am now taking control of my life. My anxiety and stress have been reduced substantially. I am going to be followed up with a geneticist and cardiologist in Canada. I expect to ask them about going on Losartan, or low dose of Beta Blockers with Losartan. I have a ENT doctor for any follow up on breathing issues, and a Sleep Apnea Doctor who will help me if my Sleep Apnea has not improved (though I suspect it will improve, because I already feel that I am sleeping better).\n\nI should get my genetic results back in a few weeks, and if they find something, my brother, mother and father will be tested for the same genes and have echos to check on their hearts.\n\nI finally have a more clear idea of what exercise I should be doing, how I can get involved with the Marfan community, how I will be able to ensure that I get my yearly echos, and ensure on-going follow ups from doctors from various specialties who are knowledgeable about Marfan Syndrome. \n\nMy 5 pieces of non-medical advice for patients with Marfan Syndrome are:\n\n1. Find your **doctors**. Insist your family doctor refers you to appropriate ones. You probably do not have to travel to the USA like I did in order to find a good doctor, you just have to find ones that know Marfan Syndrome and have Marfan patients. You need to have a cardiologist and geneticist and family doctor at minimum, with regular follow ups.\n2. Be aware of ***all*** of the signs and symptoms of Marfan Syndrome. The Ghent criteria does *not* contain a full list. See  ( for additional proven features.\n3. Keep a history of your records, especially reports of Aortic Root dilation from echos. This will come in handy if you ever have to see a different doctor.\n4. **Do not worry.** Most patients today with Marfan Syndrome are living longer and healthier lives and there are more and more treatments for various things that can come from having Marfan Syndrome.\n5. Try and educate yourself as much as possible about Marfan Syndrome and why it happens. Be eager to learn about it. Research the new advances in medicine and new studies into Marfan Syndrome in humans and mice - but always consult your doctor before  starting a new treatment, medication or supplement. Thank you for writing this. A lot of my story overlaps yours and gives me hope. I have known about my marfan\u2019s since I was 6 but it is good to have so much positive outlook and additional information. My childhood was also filled with flights to and from many hospitals and a predicted life span turned average after participating in the losartan trials (separately and not in the double blind study because my moms a tough cookie and prodded dr. Dietz about it). I really do appreciate the information about all the eye stuff and am glad to hear it worked out for you. I had a retinal detachment in my right eye a few years ago and have 20/100 vision in my right eye, 20/25 in my left. And my vision has worsened years ago and is now stable but near sighted as you say. It terrifies me the thought of a lens dislocation in my left eye or anything similar so it helps a lot to know everything went so well for you. Thank you. Your story will help a lot of people.", "Do I have the facial features of marfan? Receding jaw , recessing eyeball and undeveloped cheekbones  They are not distinct enough to tell, have you had a meeting with a rheumatologist, or cardiologist yet?  There is a series of tests they will need to do, as well as genetic testing for a full diagnosis.  It is borderline impossible to tell from facial features alone, unless they are extreme, and even then it could be confused for something else.  Not distinctly, no. I would probably give you a 2/10 for stereotypical marfan's features. What other symptoms do you have? What is your height and your wingspan?  Yes cardiologist says heart is fine, are the facial features there present  normal or perhaps Marfan's? I have been told my cheek bones are normal , but I do have an overbite Skin strech marks mid back, but probably growth spurt, and hindfoot deformity. Height is 195 and wingspan 196cm , I failed both hand tests since hands are big but no aranodacthly  Then I would not worry about it, man. You probably do not have it if you fail too many of the tests! Facial features do not really look Marfanoid at all to me.  overbites are not usually indicative, it is more crowding of the teeth, as well as a cleft or high arch palette.  Mine is just a high arch, not cleft.", "Hibiscus Water Extract Demonstrates Significant Antioxidant Effects in Patients with Marfan Syndrome ", "Marfan and other health conditions (PCOS ) Hi everyone,\n\nI am 25 F from Europe, I have been diagnosed with Marfan syndrome when my Dad had to go through an emergency surgery, I was about 9 or 10. My Dad also has marfan and had to go through two surgeries as the first one did not go well and it worsened his health... He almost died and this completely changed my family life as a kid. My Mum went through a serious depression and I was traumatized by the whole experience. My Dad's health is stable but not the best and he is getting older.\n\nI guess my case of Marfan is not too bad, I have a leak at my mitrale valve which apparently does not need surgery. However I often experience palpitations. I talked about it to my cardiologist a month ago and did not seem concerned... It can really worry me though, it prevents me from sleeping as I keep worrying that there is something wrong with my heart and get really anxious. Sometimes I am not sure if there are palpitations or I am just feeling my pulse and my breast is fluttering. \n\nMy eyesight is pretty bad and I had to get laser done in one of my eye because of cracks in my retina if I recall correctly.\n\nIn general, I get tired easily and feel most of the time really lethargic. I am also obviously really tall. \n\nMy chest is not symmetrical and I have a mild scoliosis, one side of my chest is out, the other one in, it is noticeable if I am topless but it is not a huge deformity. However it causes me random uncomfortable chest pains.\n\nSo, adding to Marfan syndrome, I have PCOS, which is a condition affecting my ovaries. It causes hormonal issues, really painful periods, mood swings, difficulty to conceive a child, depression, weight gain and hirsutism.\n\nHaving marfan and pcos can really make me feel depressed. As a female I hope to one day have my own family. However, conceiving seems to be a real struggle. First due to Marfan, I have been warned that being pregnant puts your heart at risks. Adding pcos to that, the difficulty to conceive makes it seem a real battle with so many risks.\n\nI was wondering if any of you had these two conditions? \n\nOr if anyone wanted to talk about their pregnancy experience ? \n\nOr just anxiety associated with Marfan or other conditions. \n\nSorry if there is a lot in my post, I never talk about my conditions to anyone and vented a bit too. Hi! I have Marfan with related depression and anxiety. I had my 1st heart surgery at 32 to replace my aortic root and spare a valve. I had a lot of complications post-op and nearly died. I also have anxiety when I have palpitations or chest pain and it keeps me awake at night.\n\nAlthough I do not have PCOS, I did decide to try to get pregnant a year after my 1st surgery. The pregnancy ended up being twin girls. It was really hard on my heart and I am now facing my 2nd surgery to repair my tricuspid valve. My cardiologist recommended that this be the only pregnancy as it was \u201cnot successful\u201d according to him. \n\nOne of the twins has Marfan. As it is a 50/50 chance of passing it on to each child. The girls are 2 1/2 now and I struggle to keep up or take them places. Being a mom is much harder than I ever could have anticipated. I would recommend doing it younger than I did. Just be prepared that it will probably effect your heart in some way and you may need surgery to fix it. \n\nI wish you the best of luck!! Let me know if you have any questions or just need to chat! Sending love. Hi! Thanks for posting and sharing your experience. I do not have PCOS, and I am male so obviously do not have the pregnancy issues you are facing. However my daughter has Marfan Syndrome and I am worried about what her struggle will be when she gets older.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I hope to tell her, and I guess I will use you as a guinea pig, is that there are others paths to having children. In fact, my wife and I talked and decided that if we were to ever have more children, we would adopt. There are so many children that need a good home, that even if you were a totally healthy person, I would encourage you to adopt instead. I have friends who took this path, and they are so happy that they did. And there is no risk of passing on the Marfans! And having passed it on to both of my children, that has placed a huge psychological burden on me, that I probably did not fully think through. My rationale was: my life has been great despite it, so of course theirs will be too. What I forgot was that not everyone experiences Marfans in the same way. Just because mine was relatively manageable, does not mean theirs would be. And sure enough, my son is having way more issues than I did. That is on me, cause I was selfish and I wanted my own children, their considerations be damned.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut we will not have more children anyway because I am genuinely struggling to keep up with the two that we have. My wife does not have Marfan Syndrome, and my health has deteriorated so much since they were born that she takes on much of the work because I cannot keep up. That is the real challenge to having children that we all face. You might feel like you can take the challenge, but it does not take long, a mere couple of years, for that to change.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not very cheery advise, and I am sorry for that. I do not want to discourage you from having a family. It is a wonderful, incredible, fulfilling, and often horrifying (haha) experience. But if I were really being honest with myself, I wonder if, as people with Marfan Syndrome, that the right thing to do, the responsible thing, is to adopt if we really want kids at the minimum. And even avoid it altogether if our health is bad enough. To do otherwise is placing an unfair burden on both the children and your partner. Hi I am 27F from the US. I have all the men symptoms. I have had 3 aneurysms and 3 related surgeries. There is too much medical history to share even in the summed up version. My case is a little more advanced. I was told to not have children. The Marfans gene makes your tissues soft and susceptible to aneurysms. When you are pregnant your body makes more hormones that do the same thing, softening your tissues making it easier to give birth but also making you MORE susceptible to aneurysms. \n\nRecently I have noticed issues having ovarie pain when I am not on my period. And hormonal changes, mood swings, changes in appetite. I have wondered if I have pcos or something similar. What symptoms did you have? I also have Marfans. Our fertility story is somewhat long but if you are curious...\n\n\nWhen we started trying for children I talked to my cardiologist and he was not too concerned, confirmed with a scan that my aorta was still stable and he did not see any reasons for extra concern. At that point I assumed I would get pregnant easily.\n\nAfter about a year is trying, we decided to use IVF with PGD since I still was not pregnant and that would also allow us to confirm our child did not have Marfans. At this point I still assumed I do not have any major fertility issues and it is just taking a while, but why not... The first round of IVF failed. We were pretty shocked and discouraged and questioned if we really cared if our child had Marfans and decided to continue doing IVF but without PGD. The second round of IVF also failed. We then did one more round which ended in a chemical pregnancy and some frozen embryos. After that failure they did a laparoscopy and diagnosed me with endometriosis. They had also treated me as if I had PCOS at times during the entire process but I do not think they ever actually diagnosed me with PCOS. That was around 2011 and we took a break from fertility treatments in hope that the laparoscopy may have fixed something. The doctors all agreed that Marfans was not a likely cause for the infertility issues.\n\nIn the next few years my sister who also has Marfans had a child and her aortic root did grow during pregnancy. She had surgery later and went on to have a second with no issues. This scared me and it was not until 2016 that between the emotional toll of the fertility treatment and the increased fear from watching my sister that we were ready to go back to fertility treatment.\n\nIn early 2017, we went to a different doctor and had a frozen embryo transfer and had a son! The high risk OB (MFM) nearly convinced us this was the worst decision of our lives...my cardiologist on the other hand continued to watch me closely and reassured us that I was doing great. My aorta was stable throughout the pregnancy. I did have gestational diabetes which was a bit annoying.\n\nAt the end of the pregnancy, I ended up with gallbladder issues (which was not actually diagnosed until a week after birth) so in extreme precaution because they did not know what was causing my pain they monitored me on the cardiac floor for 24 hours after birth meaning I did not get to spend much time with my son until the next day. \n\nThey left it somewhat up to me but I did have a c-section. The options were basically c-section or vacuum assisted birth (because and though I was stable they did not really want me pushing) which I was told was not a good plan.\n\nMy recovery was not too bad although a week after he was born I had my gallbladder removed and the recovery from that was pretty miserable. Apparently gallbladder issues after pregnancy is very common from all the hormones! (I never knew)\n\nOh also he was a little small (right under 5 lbs) which I think is likely based on the blood pressure medicine plus maybe the gestational diabetes diet (?) but he caught up quickly!\n\nHe is almost two now and he is the best! \n\nMy aorta is still stable and my cardiologist has no concerns with us trying again. We are currently debating the finances of going back to the fertility doctor for a second (although hoping it went be a necessary). If we do have another, I do plan to ask my cardiologist if we can make plans if they want to monitor me after birth so I do not have to be away from baby #2.\n\n\nThe reactions from different doctors I saw varied greatly from \"you are very likely to die\" to \"you will be fine\". Having a cardiologist I trusted, made all the difference!\n\n\nSorry that is so long, but that is been my experience with Marfans and infertility! There were many days I did not think we would end up with children but I am so thankful we kept on trying. I am 26F and have Marfans and PCOS. I am lucky that my marfans are milder compared to a lot of people here.I have had dural ectasia and had to correct that a few years ago. I also had lens dislocation corrected, thankfully the high myopia is corrected with it\n\nPCOS is a bitch and does cause a lot of anxiety and mood-swings. Personally I do not want any kids for myself so I am not worried about my ability to conceive or carry full term without complications. \n\nMy heart has been bothering me for a few weeks now. I have been seeing quite a lot of palpitations and sleepless nights. My physician got me worried about my night sweats so I have been trying to get checked with a cardiologist. Meanwhile propranolol has been helping me tolerate the symptoms. Hopefully I get an appointment next week \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb I too wonder about pregnancy issues. I will follow this post Have you heard of gene therapy and screening? It is interesting because my parents did not know one of them carried mitigation\u2019s in their fibrillin 1 gene. Did you know you had Marfan syndrome and still take the risk ? Thanks for your message,\n\nI do not know if I would have the courage to go through a pregnancy. \n\nHow did you feel during the 9 months? And how was the delivery did you chose a c-section?\n\nGood luck for the upcoming surgery and all the best to you and your daughters. Thanks for your message, I have considered adoption but although probably selfish I always thought about having children myself.\n\nAlso as a woman, I have always thought and \"dreamt\" about being pregnant and giving birth.\n\nI really do not see my life without building a family. I think it would be really painful for me and create a tons of regrets to decide not having any children because of potential health issues which could develop in the future. Also, medical advances are literally a daily occurrence and I would not be surprise to see huge improvement in the management of our condition in the next 10 or 20 years. So the main concern would be the pregnancy itself.\n\nWhen it comes to passing marfan, I know that some gene testing is available, I would have to conceive with ivf.\n\nI understand the psychological burdon you are facing. As my Dad passed it to me, he many times expressed some guilt when talking to me about marfan. Two of my aunts have it too and it is a big taboo in my family. But yourself did not decide to have it and at the time you just did not know all the potential consequences. As human beings we have very little control of our lives (much less than we think we do). Hello,\nThanks for your comment,\n\nDo you have the desire to have kids? Are you considering adoption for the future?\n\nI got diagnosed with PCOS when I was 13 or 14. I forgot the main symptom for me was irregular period. I could not have my period for 6 months. Another symptom as I mentioned is really really painful period. Think painful as you cannot stand up and do anything, and if you do the pain can make you faint - happened to me once. Another symptom is hirsutism which probably is the worst symptom in my opinion because it affects your appearance. Consider visiting a gynecologist though. Hey,\n\nThanks for your reply, never thought I would find someone who has both.\n\nPCOS is awful, do you also have hirsutism? I know not all women with pcos have it but for me it developed over the years...\n\nWhen it comes to the palpitations I do experience a lot of them lately too and it worries me quite a lot. I am hesitating calling my cardiologist although I have seen him just about 2 months ago.\n\nI am wondering if the hormonal changes we experience due to PCOS may provoke the palpitations.\n\nAlso, how do you manage your pcos?\n\nFrom what I have read diet and exercise are a good way to deal with it but I am so bad with keeping a good diet. Also, when it comes to exercise I am not sure what would be the best with Marfan... Hirsutism is related to body hair right? I do have some body hair issues but it is a lot manageable. I do not think it is a problem per se \n\nI am sorry to sound irresponsible, I have given up on managing my PCOS. I am way too depressed to hold a good diet and exercise regimen. My cycle is messed up big time. \n\nI have been having palpitations for a few months now. I did think those were due to anxiety issues but I have been having night sweats and breathlessness lately which is concerning so I will be checking that out soon. Might be worth a check if palpitations worsen or new symptoms get added on \n\nI would consider walks/jogs to keep up with exercise. Especially that I have had dural ectasia, I would not strain my spine in any way. I felt great during the pregnancy. A little miserable towards the end but surprisingly I enjoyed it! I did have a c-section by choice. Some of my doctors tried to push for a vaginal delivery but I did not budge. It was no big deal! After heart surgery a c-section was a walk in the park. Good luck to you too! Mine is mostly manageable, but it is getting worse with time unfortunately.\n\nI get you, I have been there and although I have noticed that eating a healthy strict diet (low carb) makes me feel better. When I am really depressed : I do not have the energy to cook and unhealthy food comforts me.\n\nLet me know how your visit to the cardiologist goes when you get the chance to see them.\n\nAnyways, if you want to chat more about those issues or anything else. Feel free to message me in private, I think we can both relate to each other's struggles. Yeah I can imagine that it was not much after the heart surgery.\n\nMay I ask how was your recovery after the heart surgery? It was horrible. I hallucinated for 72 hours straight. I thought my nurse was trying to kill me. Thought I was being gassed in a nazi gas chamber. That I had tuberculosis and I was on display in a mall for school children to come see. That I went home with my nurse to her husbands meth lab. Turns out, I was having a severe and often deadly allergic reaction to the heparin called H.I.T. I developed painful blood clots in my lungs and legs. My lungs filled with fluid and had to be drained. It was 11 days post-op before anyone realized I was dying from the allergy. The worst part is that my surgeon released me 5 days post-op and I made the 4 hour track home only to be hospitalized again the next day needing a blood transfusion. It was traumatizing to say the least. But no worries, this is extremely rare! Most people have a normal recovery. Wow, I am really sorry that you had to go through that. This sounds absolutely traumatizing. How were the next few months? Once I was released from the second hospital, I came home and slept for 2 weeks straight. I am in the US and here we have something called home healthcare. It is a program where you can have a nurse come to your home after a hospital stay to check on you. My nurse was awesome and she would help me bath and get out of bed. With her help and the help of my physical therapist I was back to normal 3 months post-op. At that point, I knew I wanted kids very soon, so I started hitting the gym and got in the best shape I possibly could for the pregnancy.  A year later we got pregnant with the girls. I do not have PCOS but my mom does. The best info I can share is about how she had me and my brother despite having that and one ovary (due to a tumor needing to be removed along with the other ovary). If you do have kids (which I hope you do someday like you want), they can be tested for PCOS after puberty (I am 17 and was tested a month ago). So hopefully when you have kids, if you have a daughter, they can be treated before experiencing hirsutism.\n\nYou also mentioned your chest. It may be a side effect of the scoliosis or it is possible that it is Pectus Carinatum, something my brother has, which sounds like what you have. It can be corrected with a brace, but unless it is particularly extreme then I think it is more cosmetic to fix it.\n\nAnd about your mitral valve, it sounds like you have Mitral Valve Prolapse. A fancy way of saying the valve closes too far back and leaks backwards. I have a minor case of that. \n\nI know I am 17 but I would like to talk more about this with you if you would like. Maybe I could tell you about my family's experiences and ease your anxiety a bit? You do not have to if you do not want to, I have just always wanted to talk about it with someone that is not family.\n\nEither way, hope this helped a bit.", "This seems interesting. Seems like they may have figured out how to use crispr on Marfans  I know crispr is controversial but I am all for this.  I feel like I have suffered my entire life. I do not want any other human to deal with the BS I have dealt with. This is a good thing. My medical grade English is apparently not up-to-par ;)\n\nCould somebody explain what it does? So could it cure Marfans and allow the body to regenerate or could it remove the genes from our body so the likelihood of congenital marfans is removed? Someone ELI5 please \ud83d\ude02 The way I understand it, it cannot treat Marfans. As far as I know after a person is born you cannot alter their DNA. This would prevent people from passing Marfans to their children tho. I do not have Marfan, my kid has and he keeps saying he does not want kids for the same reasons your think it is a good thing. He is 15. Maybe he is lucky if this actually might be something that could work.", "Recreational activities - Loey Dietz Hey so i have recently been diagnosed with loeys dietz syndrome and there is a whole bunch of things i am not allowed to do anymore like long distance running, strenuous labor, heavy lifting,moshpitting. Basically anything I used to enjoy I can no longer do or should stay away from.  What do you guy do for fun/staying healthy (as healthy as you can get with a chronic illness lmao) also has anyone done recreational drugs and lived?? I use MJ daily without issue, but that is the most \"recreational\" drug I have ever used.\n\nI was never much into sports and never had much energy to do anything super strenuous.\n\nHiking within your limits, rock climbing (talk to doc first, the straining from pulling/lifting your body weight might not be good for you), swimming, dancing. Bowling and golf are also popular hobbies amongst my friends with Marfan. \n\nIt might be time to find a new hobby, but there is all kinds of cool stuff to do out there. Also, concerts are fun even if you cannot mosh! thanks so much!! this was really helpful and will for sure look into it  I know it can be hard to be faced with having to let go of things you like doing. I was \"lucky\" in that I was diagnosed pretty much at birth, so I have never known any other way of living.\n\nIn addition to the physical activities I mentioned, there are SO many other types of activities to keep you engaged and entertained. Crafting, sewing, painting, music, games, writing, sculpting, tinkering - The possibilities are endless! I try out a new hobby every few months just for fun. I was diagnosed with Loeys Dietz last summer and had my aortic root replacement surgery last November. I used to love lifting weights and working out pretty hard, which is a bummer I cannot do that anymore.\n\nWhen I was younger, I used to party and rave a lot and used the drugs that compliment those events. I feel lucky now to have never had anything happen to my heart during those times. I stopped taking those drugs well before I was diagnosed.\n\nI do casual bike rides throughout the week now. I try to go out on long walks and chill hikes as well. It is tough not being able to do what you like anymore and I am still trying to figure out new ways to stay active, but there are so many options for us, it is just a matter of me getting off my lazy ass :D Best of luck! How old were you when you did the drugs and what were they if you do not mind me asking? Plus how old were you when you were diagnosed? \n\nHonestly so true lol, I just need to get myself out there", "CONFIDENCE W/ MARFAN SYNDROME (my first video I am really nervous)  Not my post but my best friends and I just felt like this would be a good place for it and give some inspiration! You are beautiful, I love your voice. what an incredibly strong and wonderful person. I have EDS, but my doctor thought it was marfan syndrome for the longest time. the mental health affects can really be suffocating, so to see someone in our boat put themselves out there with a smile and lead with kindness is beautiful. truly inspirational wish her nothing but the best! Thank you so much- we are on the verge of confirming Marfan Syndrome for my fourteen year old son. He struggles with his confidence too. I am going to show him this video, it will help  him know that he is not the only one. You are brave and wonderful to put yourself out there, and try to help others. Oh my gosh YOU ARE AWESOME AND BEAUTIFUL!  Kids can be ugly and hateful but that is their problem and THEY have to live with that.  At least you know who the good people are.  You are an inspiration to others keep it up \ud83d\udc4d Amazing! Great confidence and Beautiful heart!\u2764\ufe0f What a beautiful soul! Tell your friend they are amazing! I think she can be a great advocate for people struggling w these issues. \n\nI have some form of connective tissue disorder, never specifically diagnosed, but I have all the usual traits.

We do it when walking briskly/jogging/running...", "Back pain post epidural; dural ectasia Hi all,\n\nWondering if there are any marfan ladies here who started having back pain only after having an epidural? I had my first baby 2.5 years ago and had an epidural; did not know I had dural ectasia at the time and the epidural did not work well. About a month later, low back pain started and has not gone away. Had an MRI recently showing dural ectasia. I have not been diagnosed with marfan yet (it is possible); ankylosing spondylitis is also possible considering I have the HLA-B27 gene. Thanks! I am not sure if I have dural ectasia but I gave birth almost 6 weeks ago and still have residual back pain. My epidural was attempted 4 times because of a spinal fusion I had awhile ago.", "Experiencing heart palpitations/flutters but my heart scans seem to be normal Just to preface I must admit I have terrible anxiety. Diagnosed marfans, POTS, PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome I.e. my hormones are messed up).\n\nI think I have entered a paradox of noticing my heart beat, and I do not know if I have anything to actually worry about. I have yearly heart scans which have shown my heart is OK. However, when I over-indulge on alcohol, exercise too much etc, I have noticed heart flutters/palpitations. Occasionally when I am laying down I will experience a flutter. This is not new, I remember noticing heart flutters and palpitations on hangovers years ago (since then have had heart scans which were fine).\n\nAnyhow, I am kind of freaking out about it and I do not know whether I should be worrying or speaking to a doctor. My POTS diagnosis is making me feel unsure as to whether I should ignore it or not, seen as my POTS can also give me heart palpitations.\n\nI am also unsure as to whether I need to change parts of my lifestyle to ease strain on my heart. I am 21, I overindulge once every few weeks or so. Occasionally take recreational drugs, but I am considering giving it all up to ease my anxiety over this. Does anyone else here do recreational drugs? Would you recommend I stop binge-drinking when I go out, and steering clear of other substances?\n\nThanks for reading. I am feeling really fed up with my body right now, wishing I could trade I have cardiac spasms.  Act very similar, can cause a heart attack if untreated.  You need to see a doctor. Thank you for your input. I will arrange to see my doctor soon I am 26 and have Marfans. I have everything you described. I think you should mention it to your doctor for sure because everyone is marfan experience is different. I have flutters that are due to anxiety, but also my blood pressure and whether I had enough to eat that day. I just recently found out that alcohol can raise your blood pressure. (Which in hindsight explains a lot) I smoke recreationally. It is frowned upon but it is my life and my vice of choice. You are still young the best thing is to get in tune with your body. I have a lot of chest pains but I have to learn what is my bones and muscles vs something else otherwise I would live at the hospital. You are anxious because you do not feel good, and you do not feel good because you are anxious. It is a vicious cycle. If you have a murmur your heart already does not beat right so it is easier for it to fall out of rhythm when you are stressed.  Check with your Dr, check your meds, but most of all work on your head space.  Do see a doctor.  In the mean time cut down on the booze.\n\nIf you are on any meds that alter K+ levels, like beta blockers, they can get funny with drinking (I imagine even more so with POTS).  I have also noticed dehydration affects me more now that my meds are stronger (which drinking will also obviously affect).  You will likley be fine, but you should discuss this with your doctor.\n\nAs for recreational substances, I definitely feel strange sometimes partaking, so I do not.  Not sure if it is perception or otherwise.  Also, anything \"harder\" should be a hard no go.  Youve got risk factors most people do not. Not currently on any meds. I was not given betablockers when I was younger because my blood pressure was already really low. I have dabbled with harder substances, but like I say, never gone too crazy. There is no point taking these silly chances anymore, it is really not worth it. Thank you for being blunt about that.\n\nI do think my anxiety is a factor as well. It is incredibly difficult having a bunch of health conditions, sprinkled with some good ole\u2019 health anxiety on top. I do have troubles with my blood pressure due to POTS, which I suppose coupled with alcohol or substances that raise blood pressure might make my heart flutter a bit. That makes sense.\n\nI think you are right in that my anxiety is probably the driving force of my worry rather than there actually being a huge need for concern. I am going to discuss it with my doctor for a bit of clarity and might ask for medications (I never started taking any because my blood pressure was too low when I was younger). There seems to be a link between what I have been doing and whether or not I feel palpitations (I.e exercise, alcohol etc), whether that is normal or not I need to discuss further. I have palpitations occasionally, used to have them a lot off meds. My heart is stable otherwise. I do not drink anymore, but they would get worse, especially if I went overboard. They get bad when I am sick at all, though. \n\nI have never done recreational drugs, though, because I am ridiculously sensitive to everything.  Beta blockers can help with that. You may need to try a few different once until you get the right one that works. Those are most likely not going to be compatible with drinking or hard drugs so you might want to consider sorting out your health as a priority. Good luck!! The only times I have had palpitations is if I go overboard or had too much on accident. I am quite sensitive also.\n\nWill discuss with a doc about starting medications. I am not on any because as a teenager my blood pressure was really low.   \nThis is a friendly reminder         that it is \"by accident\" and not \"on accident\".  \n***** \n^(Downvote to 0 to delete this comment.) Thank you! I will discuss my options with my doctor. I will be bummed out if beta blockers make my POTS flare up or impact my ability to work out at the gym.. as for drinking/drugs I will get over it.  A scan is a snap shot of what your heart is doing in that particular moment. To capture flutters and arrythmia they need to order a holter monitor which would measure the electrical output (rhythm) of your heart. Keep in mind that people with mfs are more prone than the general population to certain benign arrhythmias (ie pvc's, sinus node tachy etc) because of our leaky valves we can sometimes experience them more frequently. There are certain things that will definitely aggravate any arrythmia, (alcohol for sure! I have more than a sip of wine and blast off!) but also fatigue, rapid temperature changes, illness, dehydration etc. Everyone is different. It is important they stick a holter monitor on you (monitors your heart for a few days) to identify what is happening when your heart goes bonkers. Sometimes those arrythmia are dangerous (I have had 4 ablations to control dangerous arrhythmia) Thank you for your response. I have been avoiding triggers and have not experienced any heart flutters since then. I am probably worrying too much about it but a monitor would be a good idea :)  It would at least tell you the type of arrhythmia you are experiencing and you are cardiologist can go through that with you. Sometimes they will use beta blockers to control/help.  Good luck!", "16 year old, should i be worried? Hi, I am a 16 year old Australian, worrying about marfans. \n\nA while ago (maybe 2 yrs) I had a panic attack and went to a hospital, where the nurse suggested I may have marfans. My GP never tested me though, saying that nobody in my family has it, though my mom has a few symptoms (crowded teeth long finger scoliosis). \n\nI am: \n6 ft, very thin \n\nI honestly cant tell if my chest caves in, I think it does a little bit, but that is normal is not it?\n\nOne of my ribs isnt stuck out like my other (as in the other is normal, this one is it bit inwards)\n\nMy eyesight is pretty bad, my right eye is almost unusable \n\nI have been noticing stretch marks on my back lately, but I assumed a growth spurt causes those \n\nMildly crowded teeth \n\nI do not have: \n\nFlat feet \n\nI do not think I have scoliosis, I cannot really tell\n\nNot flexible, I can grab my hand behind my back but I cannot to any of the finger stuff \n\nI had an ultrasound to test for an aortic aneurysm awhile ago and the tester did not find anything abnormal (did not mention if the aorta was enlarged or not). \n\nI do not really know where to go in Western Australia, or how to ask my doctor about it, since my parents usually take my concerns with a grain of salt due to my hypochondria. \n\nApologies if I typed this pretty poorly  You should check with a cardiologist. Book an appointment and he will do the tests. Funny enough anxiety attacks are what led to my diagnosis around the same age (11 years ago now).\n\nLike the previous response I would definitely recommend seeing a cardiologist, it is very non invasive and can tell you a lot. \n\nThere is also genetic testing (I do not know how common or accessible it is in AUS, but it is worth considering).", "Is there a test to be diagnosed? Hi I have some of the symptoms but not all of them. Aside from heart exams and physical traits, is there any exam that diagnoses a person as positive or negative for the syndrome? Thanks Yeah genetics testing will say. Genetics but if your heart is messed in any way, that is a reason to be looked at periodically anyway Talk to your doctor, if there is suspicion for Marfans your doctor will refer you to a cardiologist and geneticist who will apply the diagnostic criteria.", "New as marfan's girlfriend. I want to know more Hi people! This year I met a wonderful boy with whom we recently managed. As an atypical girl (I have tlp) I am not going to ask you anything \"uncomfortable\" about your condition, but I want to know about this important part of your life. What should I consider? Or, what do you consider important to know, being his partner? \nI would appreciate your answers, thank you !! Marfan can affect people differently. But overall, he probably has physical limitations on what he can do. His health may be unpredictable - good days and bad days. He should be having annual check on his heart plus other doctors visits as needed. \n\nIf he gets you pregnant, your child will have a 50/50 chance of getting Marfan. On top of that, the child could be more or less affected than what the dad has. I was much more affected than my father. You can get basic marfan information on the internet. As for how the syndrome specifically affects him? Wait for him to open up would be my best advice. Some of us have deeply traumatic  experiences  from being  in and out of the  medical  system  since early childhood.  That can be very hard to talk about. So can your fears and struggles. We often have doctors/family/friends,  people in positions of trust minimize  our struggles  because  it is  not a well known syndrome.  Let him come to you. He will when he feels  ready. Avoid buying salty food. A little us fine, but too much can raise his blood pressure. I once ate an entire pizza and went to the hospital for it. This is the kind of answers I am looking for! I am a cook and I love to cook for the people I love, so it is very important to know this, although I usually cook with little salt. Thanks!! Different for different people, but generally I do not mind sharing with partners at all.\n\nA few things:\n1) Managing a chronic health condition is a PITA.  Doctors need to be managed, not just seen (ie: you need to play an active role in your care), and this can really weigh on you.  It is just financially and logistically draining.\n\n2) It is not talked about much but many of the heart meds include sexual side effects.  He may not even know this (I did not).\n\n3) If he is had surgery, there may be certain sleeping positions he finds uncomfortable.  I have to have my partners head rest on a specific spot.\n\n4) chronic fatigue can sometimes be a thing and it SUCKS\n\n5) chronic illnesses in general tend to be associated with depression, 40% of people with Marfan's also are clinically depressed.\n\n6) If you ever get the point where you are discussing family planning, recognize he may have some baggage there.  I was the first in my family to have the disease, but if I pass it to my kid it would be something I did knowingly and willfully.  I do not know if I could wait in the hospital while they are in surgery knowing that.  That said, it is in practice that you can externally fertilize embryos, screen them, and implant only those who are not carriers.  It is not cheap, and may not be morally acceptable to you/him but it is possible. Sorry but what is TLP? Borderline personality Just a follow up, we can have salty foods, as long as we do not have a lot of alcohol with it. Avoid processed food, but a little is fine. Can I ask how you guys met?

", "\"Marfan Syndrome The Links to Copper Deficiency \" What do you all think about this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n( It looks a bit dubious.   I generally accept that Marfans comes from mutations in the fibrillin gene:  FBRN-1.   Copper is a part of chlorophyll ( instead of iron in a heme-like molecule ) and I think that most people get way more than they need.   I looked up  Lysl Oxidase, and  say only that it is involved in copper ion transport.  ( with link to details ) .   Other conditions lead me to believe that a set of symptoms can be the result of long metabolic chains, any link of which can break.   IMO 'copper' might be one of those links which seldom break. Looks like complete bullshit, to be honest. The website is full of junk science, and push for the same pseudo-scientific \"treatments\" you can find all over the Web for pretty much all conditions : making unproven dietary changes and fixing \"body alignment changes\" (whatever that is). \n\nIn fact, I would say that I find this kind of stuff offensive. It is trying to push the idea that our health is entirely dependent on our behaviors, and that if we just tried hard enough at fixing our diet/exposure to 5G/whatever or paid more money to quacks like chiropractors, we could fix all our problems. \n\nThing is, some stuff you are just born with, and Marfan is part of that. I have Marfan syndrome and can confirm I have had full vitamin and mineral blood tests - definitely not copper deficient. I hope we will see the treatment during the next 10 years.

Thanks. I appreciate that really do I will thanks There seems to be a misconception that Marfan is a wasting disease. It is not. People with Marfan tend to be skinny, but that is no where near universal. I am have Marfan and for most of my adult life was obese or overweight.\n\nWhether you gain weight, and whether that weight is muscle, depends on 1) energy consumed 2) energy expended 3) muscle stimulus and 4) protein intake. To gain weight, you will to consume more energy than you are expending (and to lose weight, you will need to expend more energy than you are consuming). For some of that weight to be muscle, you need to stimulate your muscles via exercise, likely intentional exercise unless you are a very active person or work an active job, and you will need to consume sufficient protein in order to build the muscle.\n\nTangent: I suspect most people with Marfan are skinny because 1) they are tall and spend more energy just being alive and 2) for whatever reason they have less appetite.\n\nTo gain muscle, consume more calories than you expend, make sure to get 0.8 grams of protein per pound of body weight, and stimulate your muscles via strength training. Strength training with Marfan is limited to low-weight, slow-pace training so as to avoid aortic dissection, etc. due to blood pressure spikes when lifting heavy weights. Since you cannot lift heavy but need to increase the amount of work down each workout (progressive overload), you will need to add more reps. It will be time consuming and boring, but worth it.\n\nTo consume more calories than you expend, buy a food scale from Amazon and download the MyFitnessPal app. Put in your current height and weight and your goal weight and the app will tell you how many calories to eat. Eat that many calories for a few weeks, making sure you are getting 0.8 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight. Use the food scale to accurately measure your caloric intake. If you are not gaining at the pace you would like to, add more calories; if you are gaining too much, dial back the calories.\n\nCheck:\n- r/fitness\n- r/gainit Hey I am 18 and I started working out and bulking early this year and so far I have gained 10 kg of muscle and a little bit of extra fat due to dirty bulking, based on my experience I recommend u to first condition your self with calisthenics (Calisteniapp is not a good app for that) but you need to always have in mind your limitations and do not let your ego to take over, start at the very bottom and slowly increase and also have in mind that it is a very slow process you have to be very persistent.

What I am curious right now is my face, I have known that my face is ugly since I was a teen, but I thought I just had shitty genes, but after reviewing some pictures of people with marfans I have seen similar facial traits: long face, very recessed facial bones, very narrow smiles, chubby and old looking face while having skinny body, very weak chin and jaw. I am not sure if the mutation that causes Marfan also causes this lack of attractive facial structure. \nAny opinions? I am sorry you are unhappy with your appearance. Just remember: even the most beautiful people you know have things about themselves they do not like. Focus on the good stuff. Heck, most people in America would kill to be thin like many Marfs. I have the joy of having Marfan and being obese. What a combo! it is ugly to other people, but to most normal people who think you are ugly usually have mental problems themselves that they mirror after you. Yep - this is a thing. Marfanoids have smaller pallettes - the typical gothic arch pallette - since birth. This makes it harder to nose-breathe / mew &gt; develop forward growth. Our faces are longer, cheeks chubbier, cheekbones flatter and lower. Really unflattering in some cases. \n\nIve noticed that western-culture is super beauty-obsessed. And ill just say beauty isnt really that relevant in the grand scenario of things because everybody becomes ugly after 30 (unless youre the type that thinks MeN pEaK after 40 lol). So whatever I am ugly and I get pussy some times it is ok.", "short Marfan ? is it possible to be short such as 5\u20192 and a half with Marfan syndrome I am convinced I have it .I have long legs ,long arms , weak fatigue and long fingers like somewhat cannot even point straight anybody mind telling me anything ? I also have pectus carinatum so if anybody is in the same boat please talk about to me I have not had good sleep lately just worrying about it We had a short Marf in our Alabama group.  It is completely possible. Yh deff possible, I am pretty short for a diagnosed Marf seeing as I am 5 foot 6 (female) strange thing is growing up I was towering every1 until I was about 10, then suddenly I stopped\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f no clue why and had nothing to do with my spinal fusion which was closer to when I was 15/16 yrs old so the reason you stopped growing was due to Marfan that is making me sad :( so that must have happen to me Having long limbs does not equal having marfans.\nWhen in doubt, go see a doctor. I also have crowded teeth I mean right now I am 16 and ima boy and my body is fine but I am stressing to much what will happen to me soon Stressing is useless, of you are convinced of it, go see a GP.\nAsk him/her for advice, as they are professionally trained to do do. No idk why I stopped, my parents are both kind of short 5 5 and 5 7. But my mom said that she thinks they may have given me a medication to slow my growth , this was ages ago so when I did ask her about it (coincidentally last month) she said she was unsure of why my height came to a halt, but she suspected that may have been a factor. -- when I was in hospital as a child I basically experienced every issue with marfans (mine is pretty severe), esp heart related so I was on god knows how many medications l -so her plausible guess that one of the drugs had something to do with it may be true, but again we will never know. awe I hope things workout with you and you have a good way of life do you have pics what you look like like how your body is doing I do not want to sound weird Thanks and dm I do not mind.", "Experience applying for disability (United States) I'(m35) considering filing for disability in the US based on my physician wife's advice and hip pain while working recently. Does anyone have any advice for going through the process in the US? As someone with chronic back pain, I am also interested in this... I am a 35F and have been disabled nearly ten years due to chronic pain and vision problems. You will probably be denied but do not be discouraged. Get a disability lawyer and appeal. My case went before a judge who approved me and I have had a handful of reevaluations over the years that just consisted of filling out paperwork and mailing it back in.\n\nI only had two appointments for my initial evaluation; one was with a doctor of their choice who just visually inspected my mobility and the other was with my primary doctor for a referral letter. The second was not covered by insurance but my lawyer covered the cost and I paid him back with part of my settlement. I am on disability. I applied by myself and was approved on the first try. Somewhere in the paperwork it was stated that my aortic dissection was counted as the day my disability began so it was not just the marfans diagnosis that got me approved. \nI had a friend with marfans who also got disability but had to go the appeal route with a lawyer. Documentation will be your best friend. If you have any other questions you can message me.", "Not looking for a diagnoses, but if you have had similar experiences and if you think I should get tested (Im going to pursue testing anyways but would like your input) Hi everyone. I have had a myriad of symptoms I have suffered from for most my life but in the last 3 years, these symptoms have worsened and my health has seen a general decline. In the last year and a half or so it has seen a pretty massive decline and I can hardly function as a normal human being anymore. I live a relatively healthy lifestyle, eat mostly FODMAP, GF and vegetarian diet, do light exercise, stretching and walking, and do not do any drugs or alchohol, just cannabis for helping with appetite, pain and nausea. \n\nI am 28 yrs old, transsexual woman, 5'10, and 112 lbs. I take estrogen, spironolactone, escitalopram, dronabinol and was on propranolol for a few weeks but just stopped due to severe side effects. I have been diagnosed with gastroparesis, gastritis, scoliosis, POTS and waiting on MCAS diagnoses which the doc is pretty certain I have. Recently my cardiologist (who I am seeing for the POTS diagnosis) asked if I had EDS of Marfans due to my appearance. I would never heard of those before, but being tall, skinny and my arms, legs and fingers being so long, he was suspicious. He measured my arm span and it was longer than my height. I can  wrap my thumbs around my wrist to overlap with my pinky and ring fingers, I can touch the ground with the palms of my hands and can make the prayer hands sign behind my back. He was thinking I could very well have eds or marfans. I would pursue testing for both these things from my primary doc, but am moving across country in a week so have to wait to get a new doctor in Pennsylvania. \n\nMy symptoms include - general malaise and soreness, severe underweight and unintended weight loss, always tired, sore joints, nausea and stomach upset, lack of appetite, Low BP (usually in the 80s/40s), very easily triggered motion sickness, slight tremors in hands, light headedness and dizziness, weakness, pain and difficulty walking upright due to my knees and back feeling too weak/hurting and feeling dizzy from blood rushing outta my head, much shortness of breath from even talking too fast or walking across the house (not like asthma/throat closing up, just cant seem to get enough oxygen), sometimes my knees and fingers get \"stuck\" and I have to \"unstick\" them or they wont move out of that position. For the past 3 or 4 months, Ive had the most insane night sweats, I will wake up 2 or 3 times totally drenched and have to sleep with towels in the bed. I also sweat pretty much constantly now, whether its hot or cold. My hands and feet can be like frozen ice, but sweat like crazy. I can also be freezing and shaking in the middle of the oregon winter, but sweating profusely. This was shocking as my whole life I have never sweated as much as I do now, even after living in the hot and humid south. I am completely and totally miserable. \n\nI am keeping hydrated and trying to eat more smaller meals, trying to keep up exercise and moving even though everything is hurting and I am pooped all the time. I have increased the salt in my cooking by quite a bit and also take salt tablets. I wear the tight stockings and get up slower after being seated or lying down. I am really trying everything the docs are recommending but I just seem to be getting worse and worse and loosing more weight. \n\nSo far, the docs have ruled out MS, Fibromyalgia, CFS, TB, anemia, diabetes and thyroid issues. I do not know what else to do or where else to turn other than eds or perhaps marfans at this point. Does any of this sound familiar to you? I just do not know why I am getting treated, following docs orders, but still continue to get worse to the point where i am seriously starting to ask myself if I am dying (of course we are all dying, but maybe I am just now on an accelerated path?). I cannot work, I can hardly eat or take care of myself, the dog or the house anymore. I am not even 30 yet and do not know why I am deteriorating so quickly :( Any advice or input would be greatly appreciated, thanks. As you are moving and looking for a new doctor I would recommend checking out the Marfan foundation online and seeing if they have doctors in that area since they specialize in that. I would definitely recommend genetic testing Thanks, I will look them up tomorrow first thing.", "Eyesight does anyone have any problems that like your eye doctors see like or does he always say your eyes are fine but you notice the change ", "Anyone else have problems with sharp teeth?

Hey, this is the first time I have heard about NO, so thanks for the info. \n\nI am on metaprolol now and tried to switch to lozartan few years back because I have read that sometimes it helps with aortic dilation.  But my cardiologist suggested to stay with the same medicine because I was planning to have a child in a few years. You cannot take lozartan while you are pregnant. But I will try again in a year. \n\nDid you talked with your doctors? Mine did not know much about lozartan.\n\nNot english native, I live in Eastern Europe. I also do not have access to knowledgeable doctors.

First off let me say that I know I should go to the doctor but I wanted you guy's view on this first. Thanks for the replies.\n\nSo some symptoms I have are:\n\n- Pain ; mostly in my legs (mostly my knee and below) but the pain has come to my arms, particularly my left arm but it has been in my right also. I also have back pain The leg pain used to be only like once a month for just ONE day. This time it is been more than a day.\n\n-My shoulders go forward .\n\n-I am double jointed everywhere, no really I am. \n\n-My arms look kind of long. My toes are long too and I have been told my fingers are long.\n\n- I am very thin (I am 95 lbs). ****important note, I am NOT tall. Actually I am shorter than average I am 5'3) but you do not HAVE to be tall to have Marfans, just a lot with it are.\n\n- I have flat feet.\n\n-My wrist are realllllly small.\n\nThe only thing I have had trouble with my heart is a benign arrithyma when I was younger. I am 16 now. As for my lungs I have been diagnosed with asthma. I am also a female.\n\nThat is all. Again thanks for reading and I hope you guys can give me some insight.\n Your best bet is to see a doctor. You can be tested clinically via defined criteria or via a DNA to check for mutations.

It is rough and each person is different - some are only mildly affected. How old are you?", "How should I approach this ? Hi ! I just discovered this syndrome, and I have got to say, it is pretty scary how much it reminds me of myself.\n\nThe shape of my hands is pretty weird, I have never seen anyone with similar looking hands ... until I discovered the Marfan Syndrome a few days ago.\n\nMe and a friend who works in a circus once compared just how flexible we both are, and I was actually doing more impressive stuff than her. I have never done anything that could explain why I am so flexible, while she obviously trained a lot to be able to perform as she does.\n\nI do not know if it matters or not, but I can crack my fingers very easily, I can crack the area around my neck by accident, just by leaning my head to the right and to the left, and it makes a ton of noise. I can crack my legs by lifting it from the back with my hand, to the point where I could almost kiss my feet if I wanted to. \n\nMy skin is SO elastic it is not even funny, I cannot count the number of times I have been nicknamed Luffy in conventions.\n\nFinally, my hands are ... not pretty, to say the least. All my fingers are sort of bigger in the middle. It is not really noticeable, except for the pinky of my left hand, which has gotten pretty huge. No one ever notices it, but when I put it next to the pinky of my right hand, it is insane how much bigger it is. I also realized that I do not feel much sensation at the tip of that finger. And at times, my fingers may hurt a bit. And my wrist is very, very thin. It is literally just skin over the bone. \n\nI pass extremely easily the whole \"wrist and thumb\" thing.\n\nOn the bright side, I am only 5'7, which is a below average height for a man. I am thin though. My chest does kind of sink but it does not look especially weird as I have never worked out in my life, I do not have much of a chest so I cannot really say.\nI did have a crowded teeth issue I had to care of with a dentist.\nAnd finally, I have stretch marks on my back, in the middle of it actually. It is been that way for years (I am 21).\n\nI do not have any of the other symptoms (such as myopia, if anything my vision has always been diagnosed as perfect), but I suppose that I should still get checked.\n\nThing is, I am kind of afraid to go to a doctor, and say \"Hi, do you think I have Marfan syndrome ? \".\n\nI do not want to be that guy that self-diagnoses himself conditions and then assume it just has to be the truth. How did you approached your doctor about it ? &gt;&lt; Is there a type of doctor that is specialized in this sort of condition ? Is the Marfan Syndrome actually well-known among doctors or is there a good chance that my doctor will be confused when I tell him about all this ? \n\nThank you for taking the time to read this !  Try searching for \"marfan clinics / specialists\" near your area. If you are lucky there maybe some specialists around. Normally cardiologists are likely to be aware of marfans and can do a decent job of looking out for the important (heart related) symptoms of the condition. The average GP may or may not have heard about it. It is best not to consult them other than to get a referral to a cardiologist. Also look into Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. It is a related condition with more pronounced skin and joint findings.  The elastic skin makes me think EDS (ehlers danlos syndrome) \nMarfan.org has info on several connective tissue disorders  that may be helpful.  Also lists clinics that specialize in CTDs. Sounds closer to Ehlers Danlos than Marfan to be honest, but it could just be regular hypermobility as well. ", "Doctor Suggested Marfan's After two years of quitely wondering to myself if I had this syndrome my doctor busted back into the room after my appointment was done, I go in consistently for chest, joint, and lung problems, and started asking if anyone else in my family was similar in stature to me. \n\nAfter I showed him my flexibility he said he was very suspicious and is ordering a genetic test/getting a second opinion from his colleagues. Hopefully it is nothing, but I am kind of relieved someone, especially a doctor, noticed my symptoms too. \n\nGreat community here by the way. Learned about this disease from Austin Carlile and looking to learn more about it as time goes on. Let us see what happens. Lots of times we suffer from birth. Are you ok? I am saying most Marfan syndrome patients have the disease from birth and it is diagnosed very early on in the patients life, usually. I see what you mean now. Never really went to the doctor as kid. Only for vaccines basically. As I have grown older I have been taking it upon myself to go and my medical history has been growing since I have turned 18 If you had Marfan syndrome you would know way before turning 18 or literally as you turned 18. You probably have scoliosis but I am not a doctor just a patient. God bless Mhm You should be greatful. It is not something you want to have. Are you from USA by chance Yeah, but was not really looking to get a check up from a stranger from the internet. That is what my appointment on Tuesday is for Then why the fuck are you on reddit ????

It is always a good first step to be proactive and get checked out. Thanks! I have been diagnosed this year, at 27. Got the aortic aneurysm with the genetic mutation and lots of other symptoms. Lots of people go undiagnosed for years if no one in their family has been diagnosed before, as most people will have some, but not all, of the symptoms. There is no reason to so hostile. Not necessarily. My husband is 46, and on the severe end of the spectrum for Marfan Syndrome. Because of his age (science did not even identify the genetic mutation which causes Marfan until 1991), and the fact that he grew up smaller towns in the South, he was not diagnosed until he was 21, 22, and only then because he had a medical emergency and happened to be seen by a doctor who had heard of Marfan's. Most had not. I mean, he is in the hospital a LOT, and we still have about a 50/50 chance of the doctor ever having heard of Marfan Syndrome.

As this was not an official rule until now, we would like to extend a warning to you: please do not berate others. We are all people looking for answers and support.   And support is what we need, not hostility. That said, thanks for participating in the conversation. Everyone is voice is important.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks,\n\nMods are you serious? what makes marfans deadly is that it is often asymptomatic and people may not realize anything is wrong with them until it is too late. its thought that a lot of people with it dont even know they have it. Actually a lot of people are misdiagnosed. If you have Marfan syndrome that means you are connective tissue is not connective. This can mean a lot of things for a lot of different people. But generally as I said people know they have it from birth. Yeah a huge risk is the aorta for all Marfan patients. This disease is rare. I have had it my entire life and I have only personally know one other person with it. I have been diagnosed since birth. 1997. I am on the very severe side of the spectrum as well. I have a very strong strain of this disease. At 6 I was diagnosed with scoliosis. As the years went on my bones and connective tissue deteriorated &amp; in 2016 I learned I had 9 Degenerating discs in my lower back due to Degenerating disc disease.

After the surgery I stopped giving a shits. I do what i want when I want. i see Marfan and the surgery as a gift a free pass to say: \"heck it\" in 3 years ill disembark on a world journey by boat. modern medicine made sure i did not die, so im \"dead\" already. live life to your fullest even if its short. fill every year as best as possible because as a human life can end before you know and as a Marfan diagnosed even quicker. \n\njust do what you want, even if others try to hold you back its your life, maybe a short one so make it count. My dad tried stopping me from moving to a new country 6 months after the surgery. I am now here for 2 years and further in life than he was at my age just because I want to make it count, i currently see life as a sprint knowing it can end soon. \n\nplease people, keep your heads up and your back straight we are taller than average so show that. middle fingers up and do what you want.\n\nEDit: some more: I had a collapsed lung in 2012, i know its unhealthy but i smoke, drink and smoke weed, go party hard and just because i know life is too short not to. \n\nPS: \n\n Sorry if this upsets someone, i made this to motivate. I know some people here feel depressed and hopeless with Marfans I got diagnosed at 3 years old so its easy talking for me because i dont know any better. but being diagnosed later should not mean slowing down.. my response would be dropping a gear so you can rev higher and speed up, life is vulnerable so search for the limits. this is my outlook on life. i hope this helps at least 1 person    For me it is about balance. I try to live my life to the fullest by making a positive impact first and foremost, and then by appreciating all of life's little moments. Drinking, smoking, and partying are fun to indulge in occasionally, but they are not fulfilling by themselves, and what is the point if you take years off your life and do not get to enjoy them?\n\nFor me, I live a healthy lifestyle overall, and just enjoy things like that in moderation. That way I do not miss out on having fun, but I am also minimizing the risk of an early grave.  I agree completely, and I am glad you said this. I have walked away from doctors and specialists twenty years ago, and apart from a dissection a decade ago, I have gone on living my life as I wish, choosing quality over quantity. In moderation, I still ride my bike hard, eat junk food, drink caffeinated drinks, and vape. I do take my BP meds, but that is about it. And I am still here at 49. Thabks for agreeing. I also cchose quality over quantity ", "when do you get first symptoms of marfans im 16 and my dad had it, my fingers are kind of long and part of my ribcage is slightly above the otherside, im not short sighted and my heart is healthy, im actually pretty short for my age and was wondering when yalls symptoms first showed up I have had -27 on both my eyes since I was born. I knew something was going on with my son as soon as he was delivered. The pediatrician who saw him for his 18 month check up sent us to a geneticist. The geneticist took one look at him and suggested Marfan...and then the testing began.  So, to answer your question, very young. does the severity of the parents case influence the severity of the childs case Puberty is when most mine showed up. Carinatum, terrible eyesight, shortness of breath, etc. Keep an eye on your heart, that is the one that matters Ummmm... this is complicated because genetics can be complicated. But, essentially, no. As it is a syndrome, expression of signs and symptoms can vary widely among impacted individuals. My little one is a spontaneous mutation, so neither my husband nor I have Marfan. If we have another child, there is a chance that s/he would have Marfan; however, the mutation is already there, so the child would have the exact same FBN1 mutation with very similar expression of symptoms. If a parent has Marfan, there is a 50% chance that offspring will have the mutation, but expression of symptoms can be entirely different\u2014so, someone with very mild symptoms could potentially have offspring with neonatal Marfan and very severe symptoms, or perhaps very mild symptoms like the parent. There is really no way of knowing, and genetic testing will not tell us severity or path of progression, though there is SOME research regarding where the mutation lies on the gene and how other patients have progressed. \n\nAlso, there is a very supportive Marfan community on Facebook (the only reason I still have Facebook!), and people discuss the genetics of the syndrome quite frequently. thank you A paediatrician realised that I had ocular dislocation at the age of three, and after that they worked from the hypothesis that I had Marfan\u2019s, though it was not formally diagnosed until years later.  My Marfan's is due to a mutation and not inherited. Can I PM you? My 19 month old daughter is going to see a geneticist in 3 weeks Of course! Sent :) thank you", "How are your parents doing? For those fortunate to have parents with Marfan syndrome survive to old age, I am curious how their strength is?  My mother is in her late 70s, mildly affected, has always been very active, but she has had progressive muscular weakness and wasting for at least a decade. She has been told that this is just normal aging, and EMG and muscle biopsy supported this, but it is way out of proportion to how her friends are doing. The same for her sister, who is a few years older. They both take a long time to stand up from a chair (once up they get around quickly and smoothly),  cannot carry more than 8-10 pounds, cannot open things, etc. Their older brother died in his 80s and was bedridden for a couple of years before this, also with no good explanation for his weakness.  (He was a competitive swimmer and nationally ranked in masters swimming in his 50s). There is a Marfan-related myopathy that has been described, but I have not found any information on how much it affects older adults, to know whether this is all just marfan-related, and if so, whether there is anything we could be doing to slow or reverse it, or anything we should be doing as younger adults to prevent it?  I am wondering if there is an age when the benefits of muscle-building exercise may outweigh the risks, if you have had no cardiovascular issues up to that point?  Has anyone else had similar symptoms and discussed with your doctor?  Thank you. My dad was much less affected than me - e.g., he had his heart surgery at 50 and I had mine at 20. He was in denial and did not take care of himself. He died at 59. He had no issues with strength and was quite active. My great grandfather had marfans, made it to 94. He too had progressive muscle wasting, but definitely not to that degree. Keeping weight on definitely got harder apparently My mom is in her late 50's and has a lot of spine issues (I do as well, mine began earlier in life than hers did), this affects her more than anything else. Apparently her heart is in decent shape which I am grateful for. I am sorry to hear this. So far no one in my family with Marfan's has lived past 55. Dad was 55, uncle was 48. Grandma was 29 (she was undiagnosed). We will see if I live longer than them or not. Dad is 65, very active. Open heart at 27, and then another anurism going to kidneys, ended up losing one, in his fifties That is great to hear, that he was still active into his 90s. Thanks. I certainly hope you do.  \ud83d\ude4f Good luck and please stay in top of all your preventive care. I love hearing this!! Mom is 70 now, few chronic conditions but no muscle wastage and still has not had any heart surgery. All her health issues are unrelated to the marfans", "Marfans and chronic pain? I am so tired of living in constant pain. My back to my hips to my knees to my elbows.. anyone else live with pain? I do not have full blown marfan\u2019s but my hips my knees my back. All my weight bearing joints hurt. My ankles are very unstable so they roll all the time and my feet hurt. My wife made me go to the doctor because of my pain. It was affecting my mood and I did not realize it; I was constantly yelling at the kids. We tried lots of ways to mitigate the issue but ultimately I started seeing a pain clinic to manage my pain. It is not a good solution and I do not advocate it unless absolutely nothing else works but it does improve my situation in some ways. All day, every day. Pretty much impossible to see a pain clinic where I live, and it is not like there is much they could do anyway. At least I got weed to help a bit. Go to physical therapy, I was dealing with constant back pain since my 20's; now in my 40's and it was getting progressively worse until I had a back spasm that put in bed for the better part of a week. My primary care doctor sent me to physical therapy and after around 6 months of weekly appointments my back is so much better; I have not had a spasm in around 5 months and a few weeks ago I was able to do a backpacking trip without any issues, something that would have been impossible before I started pt. I honestly have this all the time (mostly back pain). What I mainly do to help me get by the pain, is to walk outside or clean my bed, then lay down or sit down. If the pain get a little worse take Tylenol if that does not help talk to your cardiologist about the pain and see what they do to help you (most likely physically therapy).

It could be walking, swimming... Everything at your own pace and never ever forcing !\n\n\\- Drink plenty of water (obv not too much either). My joints pain used to be terrible. My physical therapist told me to drink more water ! Set up reminders on my phone, etc. I did not think the difference would be huge but it actually is !

I have a mild mitral valve prolapse but I have not had the ultrasound of my aorta yet for Marfans. I get attacks of very low blood pressure and I saw on one website that this could be due to Marfan\u2019s? How many of you have low BP occasionally or all the time? I also have a low resting heart rate (between 48 and 60, usually) and POTS (my heart rate often jumps more than 30 bpm when I stand up, and I black out momentarily). Are these symptoms or co-morbidities that any of you have? So I have not really experienced POTS,but it looks like it can be present sometimes (\n\nWhile I have not experienced POTS, before my surgery I would get tachi when I was doing something stupid (like if I was out drinking while camping and ran my body clean out of salt and fluid).\n\nThey will almost certainly put you on beta blockers, given that it is indicated for both Marf and POTS.\n\nGood luck!  Come on back as it develops! I have low blood pressure and used to pass out from standing up too fast all the time, After aortic aneurysm surgery, I was on blood pressure medication that lowered it even more, but it got so low that I was basically asleep all the time I have low blood pressure and a slow heart beat too", "Pregnancy/ delivery experiences Hi! I am pregnant - unplanned, still excited though we had hoped to go a more careful route - and doctors have begun to warn me of dangers of connective tissue disorders in regards to delivery options. I have loeys dietz syndrome, luckily it has been manageable my whole life without meds or surgeries. I am just very worried about choosing a safe delivery plan as they worry about how strong my uterus will be. Anyone have experience deciding and how did it go? Having a hard time finding mothers who can relate I would listen to your doctors 100%. Ignore other peoples advice, because no pregnancy is the same and connective tissue disorders affect people very differently. Case in point I was told to never get pregnant because my heart is not healthy enough to go thru a pregnancy.  Pregnancy hormones cause the body to soften up so the baby has room to grow and you have the ability to deliver the baby when the time comes.  If you have a connective tissue disorder those hormones make your already soft connective tissues even softer and puts you at risk for all sorts of things. Only you (and hopefully your doctor) know your body and the specifics of your condition, So I would listen to them. Good luck. I\u00b4m a guy but still curious, have your doctors said anything about how high the chance is for passing Marfans to children as a woman? I only know that for men it is 50/50 as in my case, maybe it is the same for women? Thing is doctors have given me the choice, they have said there is risks either way so whichever I am comfortable with they will have a plan. Great but also does not help the choice! Yes same for men and women, 50/50. I am one of three, two of us have it from one parent the third does not! Okay! Have you gone through IVF to select away marfans? I have discussed this with my girlfriend, we are doing some investigation inte this That was the plan! But we wound up pregnant before we could get started with that process \ud83d\ude05 so far healthy baby, all testing is clear and will learn more as it develops. We have not been given any reason to believe safety or quality of life for baby is at risk outside of increased delivery risks I had 2 successful births no problem. I did have epidurals which at the time I did not know that people with Marfans should not have epidurals. Every situation is different though, just make sure your doctor knows what they are doing and research and inform them if needed. Most doctors do not know much about Marfans which is why none of mine never told me about not getting an epidural. Wishing you the best!", "hEDS + Marfans?? I recently just began the diagnoses process for hypermobility Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Marfans and my doctor is nearly certain that I have both of them and we are planning on doing genetic testing soon. Does anyone else have the both of them or know how they interact with each other? I am planning on talking to my doctor about it a lot more but I was wondering if anyone had any insight. I am 14 and the first to be diagnosed in my family though we are finding they might have hEDS as well.\n\nthanks Part of the diagnosis checklist for hEDS is the exclusion of an alternative diagnosis that may also include joint hypermobility. \n\nhEDS is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning it is kind of a \"*fuck it, we do not know what you have that may cause this, so we will put you into the hEDS box*\". Having Marfan, which is *not* a diagnosis of exclusion, kind of prevents you from being diagnosed with hEDS as it is a diagnosis that can explain the hypermobility but can also be supported by better biological data (genetics and other symptoms).\n\nA doctor may choose to ignore those diagnoses and still proceed with an hEDS one, but he would need to have a good reason to do so.\n\nFrom the hEDS criteria checklist:\n&gt; Exclusion of alternative diagnoses that may also include joint hypermobility by means of hypotonia and/or connective tissue laxity. Alternative diagnoses and diagnostic categories include, but are not limited to, neuromuscular disorders (e.g. Bethlem myopathy),other hereditary disorders of the connective tissue (e.g. other types of EDS, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, **Marfan syndrome**), and skeletal dysplasias (e.g. osteogenesis imperfecta). Exclusion of these considerations may be based upon history, physical examination, and/or molecular genetic testing, as indicate that is why its so confusing. I have symptoms that are usually found only hEDS and not marfans and my family might have history of hEDS but i also have almost all of the marfans symptoms. we are looking to do genetic testing soon, even though its not the best method of diagnosing hEDS, but that will be take awhile due to it being very difficult to get where i live. To sum it up, except for extremely rare cases: if you have Marfan, you do not have hEDS, as Marfan already explains those symptoms. \n\nIf you *do not* have Marfan, then yeah, you could have hEDS. My family was described similarly to this, and genetic testing proved it was Loeys-Dietz.  My siblings had symptoms of Marfans, I had hypermobility, but no other Marfan symptoms.  Wait for your genetic testing to be complete and go from there. The good news is that we are starting to understand the genetic varients better, which theoretically can lead to better treatments based on your genetic profile.  Good Luck! hey i just came across this cuz i am probably going to look into the diagnosis for EDS too, i got diagnosed with marfan kind of right when I was born (i have got aracnodactilia, pectum carinatum, long limbs....). I looked into maybe having EDS because I tend to faint when temperatures change very drastically and because I get a lot of bruises (and the obvious hypermobility). I have only spoken about it to my cardiologist and she said that it was very possible, still need to properly go and get diagnosed though so idk", "Worried - abdominal aortic aneurysm 23F - not diagnozed but me and my brother think we may have it.\n\n2 months ago my POTS onset started and from then I keep feeling my pulse in my abdomen. When I stay still I feel it without touching it. If put my hand on my abdomen I feel it. I look at my abdomen and I can see it as well. When I get up my hr gets higher too (cuz of Pots) and I do not feel my pulse but if I put my hand on my stomach the pulse is so much stronger.\n\nI am really skinny so I know it can be normal to feel it but I started to worry even more because the pulse is near my belly button (on the right side mostly, weirdly enough) and I feel some neddle like stings sometimes around there too.\n\nWent to a cardiologist recently and said my heart is good, looked at my ascendent and descendant aorta and it looked good as well. I asked them to look at the abdominal aorta as well but they said they can look only on the upper part under the ribcage, which they said the aorta is small so I should not worry. They told me to go get an abdominal ultrasound to get my aorta checked if I want.\n\nSo until I get to do that, what do you guys think? Would apreciate some thoughts \ud83d\ude4f If you are worried, i would push for it. I will say, though, that I can feel my pulse in my abdomen as well. Im pretty sure its normal for people who are super skinny, especially if you havent eaten in a while They cannot check your abdominal aorta with an echo, you need an abdominal ultrasound and it sucks (complete fast required). I had one when I was first diagnosed because my heartbeat sounds and feels weird in there (called a bruit) but it ended up being because my aorta is very close to my abdominal wall. \n\nYou might be able to get a GP to refer you for an abdominal, that is how I got mine. DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT A DOCTOR!\n\nCouple of questions for you, if you would prefer to answer via dm, please feel free to do so.\n\nA) have you been sterilized or have you had an endometrial ablation longer than 5 years ago? If you have had an ablation longer than five years ago, your uterus could be backing up with blood, this is called post ablation syndrome, and it is because your endometrial tissue grew back and has no way to leave. Talk to gynecologist. If you have very sever pain, you could also have ovation torsion. This happened to me a year ago, the torsion caused am awful pain and you could feel it pulsing, it was not an aneurysm, thankfully, but the ER docs allllll thought it was. Boy were we all relieved\n\nB) Do you have any pain? If so, what is it like.\n\nC) Do you still have your appendix? If yes, when you push on the area that is pulsing, does it hurt when you remove the pressure? If so, you have got appendicitis and need to get into a doctor to start the next steps for removal. It can be bad, bad news if it is not taken care of.\n\nD) Do you have any other odd symptoms, bloating, bile burps, sore throat that is nearly swollen shut and hurts very much to swallow anything? You have possibly got mono, it is awful. I wish it on no-one. They will give you antibiotics and you are SOL for a month while you recourperate. I had it from around Thanksgiving to after Christmas several years back. Just awful.\n\nGood luck! I am sorry if you answered a bunch of these in the post. I am on mobile so I cannot switch back and forth between post/does not very easily. Thanks for putting time on writing this!\n\nA. No, I have not but I will go see a ginecologist next week anyway since I have always had heavy and painful periods. Lately my ovaries started to hurt so I have to check them out.\n\nB. I do have ocasional pain in the abdomen, in different places like where the liver, spleen is or some discomfort that goes like in a line from side to side. Sting like pain or simply just pain but it does not last long.\n\nC.I do still have it and it seems that it does not hurt when I push it or after. \n\nD. I get some bloating yes, but it is more like the bubbles that make noises. I used to get them when I lay down on my back after I drank some water but lately I gey them more often and I can also feel them pretty well. \n\nThe thing is, since this Pots thing started I got more and more symptoms and I cannot be sure if it is only cuz of Pots or it is something else so I have to check with so many types of doctors. My Gp still thinks my change in hr is because of anxiety and my thyroid (my thyroid is fine still). I swear everybody thinks I am a hypocondriac but whatever. I just do not want to get into more complications.", "Can acid reflux cause coughing up blood ? Can acid reflux cause coughing up blood ? Acid reflux can cause damage to the esophagus and stomach such as ulceration wich can lead to rupturing and with marfans that would increase the risk if a rupture has occurred.\n\nYou should probably see a doctor especially if it ongoing or a lot of blood. I cough up mucus all the time though I dunno if that helps. Seek help.\n\nI always taste blood but never cough it up. Please see a docter bro and be safe &lt;3 Check his post history. His other account u/stevatoo69 has already been banned from here. He also posts here on his other account u/Sholo31. He had another account that got suspended because of his trolling u/LastTurnip7858. Shit lol. Didnt see that, what an asshole", "Just got my first echocardiogram! Wow. They push pretty hard, do not they? I lol\u2019d. After my first EKG, the doc had me do a stress test (running on a treadmill while they monitor your heart rate). After about five minutes of mild running they tilted the belt higher and had me sprint uphill until I felt like I was \u201cabout to faint\u201d. A few minutes of that and my heart felt like it was strangling itself, so they told me to leap off the track and lie back on the exam table as immediately as possible. Interestingly, switching from a full stallion sprint to laying completely motionless was the most physically taxing part of all of this (body convulsing, I am choking on air and sweating profusely all over the poor nurse that is pressing cold jelly ultrasound gear down into my splitting ribcage). It felt like like the room was spinning and my heart was clawing its way out of my chest, trying to get back to hell. That experience was more wild than any drug. Woah, that is sounds intense. I can definitely feel my heart working out when I get excited or excersize but I have have not put myself anywhere near that state in years. I walked past the treadmill on my way to the echo room; hopefully they will not tell me to hop on during my next visit after treading that! Definitely was not expecting the smooth jazz they played in the background lol do you all go through exercise in your echos? i just lay down there and they do their thing Have not had one like that scheduled yet, will keep you updated if it happens though", "Do you see yourself as deformed? I grew up thinking that I was \u201cnormal\u201d looking like most people are because my family raised me to think that way but nowadays here and there as an adult I cannot help but to think I am deformed as I see my body, hands, etc.  High fives, signing papers, taking off my clothes around others, etc is super awkward because of it. Nothing seems quite right about myself, visually.  How do you view yourself? I view myself as deformed and I certainly get funny looks yeah, but I do not view myself as ugly or creepy. Nobody should. I used to feel ashamed of how tall and lanky I was, especially when people would call me names etc.  \n\n\nBut now I do not believe that I am 'deformed', yeah maybe I am tall and lanky but certainly not ugly. There are so many people who absolutely love being around very tall people and will find you good looking.  \n\n\nI remember running into a very tall woman when I was younger and she told me to keep my head high and be proud of my height, and I truly believe this now, even though at the time I was very shy and hated how tall I was. (I am 6'8\", male)   \n\n\nStand tall and remember that the most attractive thing you can wear is a smile.  \n\n\nMaybe when you look in the mirror you will see the marfanoid body type with it is lankiness and stretch marks and long arms and maybe flat feet or a weird chest shape - or maybe you hate your elbows because your arms do not seem to extend all the way - but when others look at you they might see a wonderful, radiant tall beacon of light that they just want to hug. Nope! I am pretty awesome. Sounds like you are too I have a pretty asymmetrical face and sometimes I feel like I have spider arms even if I have a little bit of tubs on me. I do not think I have ever felt like my body looked like other people. It was always embarrassing to take my shirt off even as a little kid, because it was how you could actually see how \"disproportional\" I looked. Still pretty uncomfortable about it today. But I do not think I am ugly or creepy. I think I just look a little off sometimes. Yes I feel deformed. Too skinny, too lanky, too tall, face too long, palate too narrow. Etc. I may be different but it is up to me to fit in\u2026 I am very asymmetric, with a severely damaged left shoulder and permanent limp from strokes.  My hands are clawed up from the strokes as well.  But my better half calls me beautiful.  Listen to the voices that build you up. No one in my immediate family has Marfan. Thus I am a mutant! A X-Man!\n\nThat is how I see myself! When I was younger I felt awkward due to my height and weight, but as I have gotten older I barely think of it anymore. So, currently I do not personally see myself as having a deformity, but as an adolescent or young adult I felt bummed about being really thin at times.\n\nIMHO, it is been helpful to think that the idea of a \"deformity\" or \"abnormality\" assumes that there is some baseline physical type, or genetic type that is normal, and most people have all of the qualities of this \"normal\" physical/genetic type in all ways.My guess is that if we were to look at the physical/genetic structure of the overwhelming amount of people, most of them would have \\*something about them that is mathematically abnormal when comparing them to the mean average of persons.  (Put differently, it would be super weird if someone was the person who is, like, totally average - in all categories - with respect to their physiology. Like, what would that even look like?)\n\nWith MFS, it is just that we tend to have certain qualities that are uncommon, and we have them in clusters that seem to correspond to certain gene expressions/mutations and so some doctors gave us a nickname.\n\nI have personally found that knowing about MFS has been helpful for me in monitoring my heart, and consider lifestyle choices that I make that relate to my overall well-being, but outside of that I tend to think of it as a mild limitation (just my experience - Others' may have had significantly different ones), and just do what I can do live my life and pursue the things that I enjoy.\n\nIf people want to impose a diagnoses on me that is fine, and good and all (and it is quite helpful at times), but I also feel that it is ultimately up to me how much of that I want to onboard and take on as a part of my identity.\n\nI hope this is helpful! (Not medical advice, btw). What do others think?", "Happy New Year /r/marfans! We are still a quiet little subreddit, but I want you all to know that I really appreciate all of you who post here and reply and comment. It is good to see the support happening. I hope you all have a very happy and healthy new year!", "How much of the general population can do the marfans wrist and hand signs but not have marfans? I feel like people must be able to do it and not have it I do not know the exact number but I would guess like any other of the single symptoms, hypermobility would be more common on its own than a good number of the symptoms combined.", "I have always wonder why I had long fingers and toes until one day I searched it up and marfan syndrome showed I have some physical signs.  I have dealt with chest pain since I turned 16 Ive been 6xs to hospital, gotten chest xrays, ct scan chest and everything came out well. But I feel it can be a underlying medical thing and one day something will happen to me . I dont know where to go get tested or what to do. ", "Got my surgery date! June 5th it is for the (valve sparing) root replacement. Way less worried than I thought I would be - mostly excited to move onto a new phase of life. Stay strong, friends :) Also: questions for those with some time to go regarding the process welcome, as always.  Jeebus. Yes, details please. Ascending, Descending, or Abdominal? Ofcourse! Root actually, so none of the above. Diagnosed at 12 and slowly growing. 23 at 5.0 now. Luckily I have the top rated Cardiac Surgeon in my country (Canada), so it is all good. He took half an hour with me and explained EVERYTHING, even took me into his private office to show me the CT scans. I feel extremely confident about it all. In good hands.  More detail: I have 'mid-range' Marfan's so the 'package' is not complete. I look 'normal' tbh (no insult to my self conscious Marfan friends), no Dural or any other issues. Aortic issues for sure though. Have contributed to a lot of depression problems, etc. But that is kind of why I am so ready for this to be done with.  Funny hands though, large pectus excavatum, hypermobility.  My surgery was June 5th also!!  Root replacement back in 2014.  Best of luck! It is a rough recovery but worth it.  Best wishes for a speedy recovery! Please update us after! Jeeeeeeebus, dude. Well good luck to you, and glad you are in such good hands!! My surgeon has been at this quite a long time, and has a reputation for being good at it. I hear nothing but praise coming his way when I mention his name. And I am further relieved, because I was expecting him to say something about further tests, or even the surgery itself - I showed up with two pages of questions to prepare myself!! I was super relieved when he said it is not necessary yet. \n\nI am very ignorant when it comes to the different locations, I apparently need to research that more. Does the root require your sternum to be cracked? My ascending does, and I am freaking terrified of that.\n\nWell good luck man, and definitely update when it comes around! I have got... I guess it would be further than \"mid-range\". I definitely do not look completely normal, but I am not as far out as some pics I have seen. I have got overly thin arms, and am quite gangly. \n\nHave the long face you read about to some degree, it tends to look \"off\" in a way that people cannot quite place. I am very thin overall (except in the middle the last few years lol). Have some pigeon toes going on, but do not even think about it anymore. And have some slight but definitely present pectus excavatum. \n\nAnd the arachnodactyly, for sure. I once saw a video of myself opening a present, and I was like, \"holy shit, is that how I always look??\" I tend to use only my fingertips for such things, and it makes my fingers look even longer and more spindly than they already are lol. \n\nAnd definitely with some hypermobility, especially with my legs. I have learned from yoga that my hamstrings are not as flexible as I would like. But other than that, I am good. I can, for instance, lay flat on my stomach, legs straight out behind me.... Bend my legs at the knee, so my feet are coming towards my butt... keep bending them, so they are almost resting on my butt... keep bending them, so they are now on either side of my hips... keep bending them and reach out with my hands, and I can just about place them sole-down on the floor next to my hips \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 And there is really no strain at all to that one. A woman on yoga saw that and commented on it, it was pretty funny. \n\nI can also do this thing that is hard to describe, where I am standing and I bend my leg at the knee, bringing it alongside my hip, then just a little further forward, and twist my ankle so my foot kind of latched onto my hip and then let go, and the leg stays there \ud83d\ude02 I may see if I can get my wife to video that sometime, and I will gif it and throw it up on /r/marfans or something lol. \n\nWhat else? I used to be able to put both legs behind my head, though I have lost a lot of that flexibility over the years. Ohhh! And I used to do this thing with my arms when I was laying on my back, to prop my head up! I will have to get a pic/gif of that, it is hard to visualize. I basically hold my arm up straight over my head (parallel with my body, not perpendicular), and then bend at the elbow so the hand rests palm up between my shoulder blades. Repeat with other arm, and it gives a slightly inclined surface on which to rest my head. Adjust positions of the arms to slightly adjust height. \n\nWow, what a weird and unexpected walk down an odd path this morning! Thanks for that, it was pretty interesting trying to describe these weird things! Root is the base of the ascending, so definitely similar! I am thinking I will take some pictures every day in hospital to document the process for you all... stay tuned!\n\nSounds like you are also in good hands though, so do not be too worried :) You can kiiiind of see the arachnodactyly in ( I am sure I could find other pics that show better, but these are recent, so easy to find lol.\n\nPer your other comment, yeah, I had a lot of depression when I was first diagnosed. I was... 13? 14? Yeah, I spent my late teens and 20's feeling like I would been handed a death sentence, so what did anything matter? The lung collapses at 14, 17, and 23 did not do anything to disabuse that notion. Throw some bipolar type 2 in the mix, and I was pretty self-destructive for my entire 20's. Felt like I was not going to live to see 30, so what is it matter? \n\n\nImagine my surprise when I hit 30 lol. I would spent my entire 20's completely wasted. It is a testament to the human body that my aorta did not get significantly worse, despite my attempts to fuck myself up. I am past the depression over my marfans now, but it will be nice to get to the point where an aneurysm is not a problem anymore. Even though the surgery is going to suck.\n Who is your surgeon? I am in Vancouver, btw.\n\nGood luck! Surgery will suck, but it is not as bad as you figure. As I have said, my father just went through it and he was on over-the-counter Tylenol straight out of a 5 day hospital stay. With a skilled surgeon, it is not as daunting as you may think! \n\nI have been the same in some ways. Depression, HEAVY (way more than my peers) drinking throughout a few years (despite being young). Better now, but it contributes to anxiety massively. \n Dr. Kassem Ashe. Kitchener Ontario! Absolutely fantastic man. He fixed my father right up 3 months ago, so I trust his hands completely.  I keep hearing that it will not be that bad, but that is hard to imagine right now lol. I am trying to be optimistic though. I will be looking forward to those pics and the documentation of the experience. It will be nice to have some idea of what to expect. Getting my surgery June 26th. Good luck! You as well! Sure we will both make it through better than before,  How old are you? just wondering Im new here. Have not been diagnosed with marfans yet but just set my surgery date for july 17th for a valve replacement in my aorta. I am a 23 year old male. im 20. did you have the choice between a mechanical valve or a tissue valve? (not sure if that question applies to your surgery or not) I did! I chose mechanical to reduce the risk of a re-op, as it is practically garuanteed within 10-15 years with a tissue valve.  so you take blood thinners now. how is that? Not bad at all, to be honest. I found any concerns I had read online to be very overblown. It has not disrupted my life in any significant way so far, in my own experience.  Do you workout, drink alchohol, or smoke/consume cannabis? Cannabis for sure. I do light cardio, but do not lift much. As for the alcohol I was something of a problem drinker before so I consider it kind of a blessing in disguise - not sure if I will take it up again! Binge drinking is HIGHLY discouraged, but the others are fine as per my cardiologist \ud83d\ude01 So you plan to never drink for the rest of your life? I might sound ridiculous but the only fun drinking is binge drinking. Im at a big university and i like to have fun often. Like i said, it sounds ridiculous, but i really am trying to lay out all of the affects it will have on my life, and my social life is very important to me.\n\nAlso do you have to take blood samples from ur finger and send them in? Yes I do! Once a week now and then it will be down to once a month eventually. \n\nAs for the drinking, I understand your position and that is okay! For me, I would rather transition to light drinking as I am past university now and my social life is not super dependent on it versus having another surgery garuanteed. That being said, I can get why it would be a big factor at the stage of life you are in.\n\nIt does not bother me, but it certainly may others.  When would eventually be? and just to reclarify, its prick your fingers once a day and send it in once a week? Prick once a week, send it once a week. And when my family doctor decides - this is typically when you have been stable for a few months. Keep in mind I am only 2 weeks post op at this point.", "Nosebleeds? I first discovered the likely probability that I have Marfan syndrome when I found what I now know as pectus excavatum. I realized it was not normal when I noticed no other kids had it. A few hours of research and doctor's appointments later, and I am fairly certain I have it.\n\nI have been thinking of getting the surgery, and have been putting it off of my mind, but recently I have been getting some SERIOUS nosebleeds. They have gotten bad enough that blocking one side makes it flood out the other. Keeping this in mind, my pectus excavatum is on the side of my heart. \n\nI am wondering, is it possible for my chest to be pushing on my heart, causing more blood than usual to pump out, thus causing my worse nosebleeds?\n\nThanks. I also have chronic nosebleeds. Some questions to consider: Is there a pattern to yours, such as certain seasons? Do you have other nasal/sinus problems as well, or allergies? A very common condition is a deviated septum (septum being the dividing wall between nasal passages) which can cause one to be much more dry than the other, which when compounded with seasonal dry weather/congestion (in my case) causes regular nosebleeds, always on the right side, but they stop after about 2-3 minutes depending. Can you describe your nosebleeds in a detailed cause-and-effect like this, or is there no pattern at all?\n\nI could not find anything linking pectus excavatum to nosebleeds, but if it were me and I did have PE or some other sternum/rib issues, I would definitely consult my doctor anyway so that they can advise on my exact circumstances, especially if you are still growing. No two cases of anything are exactly alike.\n\nIf that still leaves the nosebleeds unsolved, there are doctors called ENT's (Ear, Nose, and Throat) that I would look into, especially if it is interfering with you day-to-day, or God forbid, you ever feel dizzy, light-headed, anemic, etc. from your nosebleeds. But I would not inmediately jump to the worst case imaginable. Where there is one health condition, there can be and often is another health condition. They do not always compound or directly relate to each other, but any of us who have had heart concerns will understand the worry you described. Just try to separate the two in your mind, and communicate with your doctors the problems you are having as detailed as you can. If your doctor is worth their degree, they will be able to take care of you from there. I do not have allergies, but yes, they do start only on the right for me, but it usually takes me 5-10 minutes just to slow them down.\n\nThis was the first time I have felt slightly light headed afterwards. Hopefully its the last. Then I would say definitely see about finding an ENT to consult with for sure. It might be a bit annoying finding one near you depending on your area, but specialists are always worth it even if you never see them again since you will know everything about your health in their area of expertise by the end of it. The peace of mind it can give is also a nice bonus. Yep. I got them all the time when younger. I bleed so much that dentists and surgeons just cauterize me instead of just using medication or stitches. New docs (or dentists) ask if I am on anticoagulants. This would be unrelated to your chest, unless when you do your blood pressure or HR the number is off the charts. So I get horrible nosebleeds also, but found out mine are related to a platelet disorder. While they say bleeding problems are unrelated to marfan, I have met a huge number of people who have Marfan AND bleeding disorders, so it is definitely worth looking into that side of things.", "Stomach issues? Let us talk about stomach issues. Does anyone have dumping syndrome/rapid gastric emptying? What about gastroparesis? Anything else?\n\nI was diagnosed with the former and have had an increasingly difficult time eating. I have lost interest in pursuing food because food hurts. The type of food does not seem to matter, and I have been tested for celiac. Every time I eat I feel sick, bloated, tired and cold. Sometimes I vomit. However, when I do not eat, I get dizzy and hypoglycemic, and also have lost an unhealthy amount of weight. I was supposed to see a gastro doctor in Salt Lake, but she abruptly resigned and now I am back at square one and was just wondering if anyone has dealt with similar issues and had any tips and tricks. Yes, I have had significant stomach issues for years. Get into see a good GI and they can help you. There are meds to help slow digestion such as Trimebutine. I had some of those symptoms before I started minimizing dairy, I never really figured it was a marf thing but maybe?\n\nYou sound like you have really done your homework so I am guessing you investigated diet already, but if it helps, I do not think I am really \"lactose intolerant\" or have a dairy allergy, the only things that really get to me are things that are pure milk.  Ice cream, most alfredo sauces, etc, but nearly all cheeses are more or less fine.  Oh, and protein powders (both whey and pea).\n\nI found myself kind of gravitating towards a keto-ish diet before it was a thing, carbs just make me sluggish, so I tend to do a lot of meat and veggies.  Seems to help I have ulcerative colitis, it is nothing to do with marfan's. You might consider visiting a gastroenterologist. Wife of a diagnosed Marfan\u2019s person.

", "i got a personnal question for you and i need your advice Hello everyone,\n\nFor introducing myself, i'am a young marfan male of 21 years and i do biological study in brussels. As a Belgian, i have never met any other marfan besides my family. i am writing this for 2 reasons. \n\nThe first one is that i want to stay in tuch with marfan from everywhere  more specifically of my age ( ig golduunboy). \n\nThe second reason is a question. There is any marfan who is lifting weight and gain kilos ? if so, how do you train and  what is your training volume ? In November i started bodyweight exercise (less than my weight)  I used a rubber band to lighten myself up because i was unable of doing 3 push-up. In February i started bodyweight exercise with my bodyweight. Since April until now, i do weight lifting and i gain 13 kg ( i do now 70 kg for 190 cm ). I found my body really beautiful right now but i am a little bit worried about my heart condition. \n\nthank you for reading my poorly english post If you are concerned about the effect strength training might have on your heart,  then you need to talk to your cardiologist.  \n\nIn my family we have all been cleared to do heavy lifting - our symptoms manifest differently.  Other people are advised to not lift more than 5kg. Decisions about what you personally are able do to should be made in consultation with your doctor. Talk to your cardiologist. Oh wow! I have never heard of this being a thing but congrats :) I went through a period when I was 18-20 (22 now) of gym obsession - I am still going through the process of Marfan's diagnosis so do not take this as fact. \n\nI started with heavyweights to get stronger and then medium weights with more reps and overall time spent at the gym. I did gain lots of volume but being 6'4 it is difficult to fill out. \n\n**I HIGHLY recommend not lifting weights until you have checked if it is medically fatal first.** My cardiologist never said do not lift weight specifically, but did tell me to avoid contact sports. The thing is sijnce I was diagnosed at 32, I had already played a lot of contact sports and done some martial arts. I have mellowed out on those two fronts and have been going to the gym to lift weights, on and off, for about 5 years. I have gained a bit of muscle, which is surprising but I will know I will never look *ripped* per se, nor is it my intention.\n\nMy lifting technique is slow reps with slow weight increases. I always start ridiculously low and go up from there. \n\nFor every exercise I do, I perform 3 sets of 60 second reps. When I reach a level where I feel it has become easier I increase my weight 5 or 10 lbs on the last rep, and then see how well I can keep up with it.\n\n( is that it does not matter if I do 5 or 20 reps, I can take my time, **breathing in as I relax and breathing out as I am lifting.** This helps lower my stress levels of my system, and keeps me from possibly harming myself, passing out.\n\nThis of course, is not medical advice. You shluod talk to your doctor first, or see a Physical Therapist if you can afford who can prescribe you a workout. 10 lbs is 4.54 kg", "How do I get tested for Marfans? I am only 16, so I would have to have my parents take me for any tests, if that is even possible. I am almost convinced I have Marfans, many factors have led me to believe I could possibly have it (6'2 and 115 pounds at 16, chest pains after any physical activity, nearsighted, curved back and back pain, extremely long limbs, and previously diagnosed with hypotonia earlier in life). I am just not sure how to go about actually getting tested, since I am not sure if my parents have the money to even pay for a test, or if I would even qualify just because I think I have something. Kind of afraid that putting this off any longer could result in serious issues, especially considering the fact that I first started experiencing things such as chest and back pain last year.

Most people that comment on mine only do it once, and very few comment at all.

I self diagnosed initially (Iam in medschool I had to read a genetics textbook), measured my aorta and in the and its either marfan or mass syndrome (has anyone been diagnosed with mass syndrome/phenotype?) ; for know I have few issues - an annoying lateral hip pain which is not being diagnoes properly I have no luck with doctors and a similarily annoying shoulder pain; my main issue is how much depressed I feel - I have always been a depressive but now it kind of looks ridiculous to even consider go on living. Iam stuck in bed thinking about offing myself. And then I read this forum and others like it. Iam amazed how optimistic some of you are. Is that an american thing? If you are considering suicide you need to get help from a mental health professional.  Well yeah I theoretically know that - Iam a doctor in training and have a long history of mental issues :) there isnt really any major question in my post its a classic rant sorry to everybody. I really feel doown and I dont see any use in switching to yet another antidepressant I am not American but I do not consider marfans to be the be all and end all of my existence. It is shaped my life for sure just like other parameters like -for example - sociological forces have done so. But I still have things to look forward to and stuff to see/learn/do despite marfans and whatever it is going to throw at me in the future. Well said. Focusing your life around this condition is something I do see a lot of in the community, and it really is a defeatist outlook on things. No bueno. It is not an American thing, it is a badass thing.  It takes a lot of grit to stay positive after you learn you have a life-threatening illness.  That being said, grit is not something you have innately, it is something you cultivate over time.\n\nIt sounds like you should talk to a therapist, it is expected to feel down after realizing what your new normal is with marfans, but it does not need to be a permanent state of mind.\n\nI have known about my condition for almost all of my life, almost died to a sudden aortic dissection, and have 3 heart surgeries under my belt.  It is been a tough road, but I am doing just fine now, I love my life even though it is not perfect.\n\nYou will get through this, talk to your doctors about management, see a therapist, and focus on the things you love. Thanks; Ive been seeing various psychiatriats on and off for years. Iam familiar with the subject. I guess they dont really work for me", "Question for mothers with Marfan syndrome Hello all,\n\nI am a 21 year old female who was diagnosed with Marfan syndrome (non-hereditary) at age 5.  I am reaching out to ask if there are any other marfanoid women in this community who have had children after their diagnosis. I have a few questions for you!\n\n1) Did you go through genetic testing or systemic abortion of the fetus prior to birth?\n\n2) Did you use beta-blockers during pregnancy/breastfeeding?\n\n3) Were there any complications or abnormalities during your pregnancy, labor, delivery, or postpartum period which were directly attributable to your Marfan syndrome or use of beta-blockade?\n\nI would love to hear your stories if you have the time! Any input would be so very appreciated. I have done so much research but at the end of the day, I do not personally know any other women who have gone through pregnancy with a connective tissue disorder and I would love to know more. Thanks in advance! Male, here but wanted to chime in as no one else responded yet.  I dated a maternal fetal medicine specialist for a few years (ONLY deals with high risk pregnancy).  Marf is definitely something you want to do a pre-conception consultation on.  Pregnancy can be pretty tough on the heart.  Like a lot of marf things it will vary person to person but you definitely want to talk to a medical professional.\n\nHoping someone can chime in with some more experiential knowledge as you requested! Thanks for your reply, it means a lot to me. I fully expected nobody to answer - this is a bit of a niche question! Thank you for your advice, a pre-conception consultation with specialists is definitely on the to-do list. You bet!  I always am torn between \"you are a dude, do not jump in about things that a woman probably knows\" and \"I am a dude with marf (a biochemist at that) who was surprised to hear marf makes for complicated pregnancies\"\n\nBut yeah, my ex had plenty of patients with marf who did great.  It is just the kind of thing you want to check in on.  They will *definitely* be able to address the med issue, but I doubt heart meds will be a problem, and in any event they will have work arounds to make sure both mom and baby are ok.\n\nRe: Screening.  It is obviously a very personal issue.  What I will say is based on where you fall, be sure to pick a hospital/physician in line with your beliefs.  It is OK to ask \"have you recommended a termination before?\".  There are conditions that are hell on earth for the child, condemning it to a short, painful existence.  Med staff have to respect a patients wishes in those cases, and develop a bit of a \"shell\".  If you want a nuanced conversation about YOUR child, you will need to break through that. I had small heart issues during pregnancy. My main issue was the birth, i couldnt give birth naturally as my lungs collapse. But then during my csection, they had issue numbing one side (it took a while). Unfortunately, the anaesthetic moved again mid way though being open; so i had to be given an emergency general anaesthetic. That sounds like hell.  Thanks for sharing. Thank you so much for sharing. I am very sorry to hear of that traumatic experience, but I hope you and the baby are doing well today. Thank you for this more in-depth reply. \n\nSince I was diagnosed at such a young age and immediately put on beta-blockade, my aortic root stopped growing and it is now (thankfully) completely normal for my size and age; around 20 mm. So, when I consider pregnancy, I am not so worried about the detrimental effects on my own cardiovascular system. Instead, I am much more focused on ensuring I do not pass on the mutation (or negative fetal effects from my medication) to my future children.\n\nIt is a very difficult situation to be put in; I am absolutely by no means pro-abortion, and I would hate to play God,  but I am also absolutely by no means thrilled about knowingly bringing a child with my 'difficulties' into the world. I am doing my research and weighing my options now that I am young, so that I may make the best decision in a few years once I can start a family of my own. \n\nIf I may ask, what are your personal opinions on the subject? Based on your replies so far I am assuming you yourself do not yet have children; if you were going to start a family, would something like abortion of a fetus with known genetic defects be off the table?\n\nThank you so much for being so kind, informative, and non-judgmental. I would love to hear more from you. Happy to share, but I cannot say I have \"settled\" on an opinion.\n\nI was also a spontaneous mutation.  As I got older I realized all the work my parents put in to make sure I got the care I needed, and just how hard it had to be waiting in that OR waiting room.  Thing is, for them, it was dumb luck, for me if it is my kid in that situation, it will be \"my fault\".\n\nI go back and forth, and I have not had a partner yet that kids in any context made sense, so it is a bit of a wash.  But, despite all the the negatives, a lot of my experience with marf made me who I am today.  Especially in my adult life, a lot of the difficulties with marf made me a better partner, a better friend, and just all in all a better human.\n\nI think a lot about adopting, or fostering.  I would not rule out my own biological children but I have not found the right person yet.\n\nIt is a lot to take in, at 21 you are not in a huge rush.  I think you can actually screen fertilized embryos before implantation now, if you ever wanted to go the IVF route. Thank you for sharing. I know how you feel - we were spontaneous, but if we make the conscious decision to have children the implications of that will completely fall back on our own shoulders. I am glad you think about it, and that adoption and fostering is on your mind. In my opinion, having and raising children, regardless of if they are biologically yours, is a beautiful and rewarding practice which cannot be substituted. I hope you find a wonderful partner who you can spend your days with, and raise children with. Thank you for all of your time. Blessings. You bet, the only last thing I will say is you will find a TON of parents on here.  Marfan's has some big draw backs, but it is not like all of us have not lived full lives.  Like most other stuff we deal with, it is a bit more complicated of a decision than for most people, but not the end of the world.  Good luck :) Thank you for posting, I have loeys dietz syndrome (in the same family as Marfans) and came here after failing to find any community or firsthand experiences on pregnancy with connective tissue disorders. My major concern is delivery and rupture risk\n\nI am 15 wks pregnant - did genetic counseling pre covid and prepared a list for when we were \u201cready\u201d and it happened unexpectedly. So here I am! I have great docs but still feel nervous about risk factors of both c section and vaginal deliveries Thank you so much for your reply. I am wishing you all the best in your pregnancy and delivery, whichever option you choose.", "Ankle Pain It is currently almost 2 am and ever since yesterday evening my right ankle had started hurting. It felt like it needed a pop so I did what I usually do and rotated it, but when I got to it is usual popping point all I got back was resistance from the joint and pain. A lot of pain. \nSo I was wondering if this is Marfan related and if any of you have had something similar and what you all did about it. I am wearing an ankle brace and have been taking Motrin. Thanks for any advice that I get. Hey! I am a podiatrist and have marfans too!\nIt sounds like you must of damaged a ligament or a tendon. If the pain is tingly/numb it may be nerve related. This is related to marfans because we have a  connective tissue disorder - causing our soft tissue to become more likely to stretch. This results in flat feet and very pronated ankles.\n\nWearing the ankle brace is a good first step. Also make sure you have got good stiff shoes that fit both length and width (we tend to have narrow feet). Anything too flexible/loose will not take the pressure off your feet/ankles. Also orthotics help reduce the pain/risk of injury. Make sure you rest the ankle lots too for the next few days! I would been wearing lazy, soft shoes for years thinking I was doing my flat feet a favor, then started having a lot of problems with one of my ankles. One of my doctors said you should never be able to bend your shoes in half by the sole.\n\nI wear ankle boots now, it is been a lot better (it is also a lot harder to roll my ankles in these!). Hello! Completely unrelated to the post but since you said you were a podiatrist I was wondering if I could pick your brains a bit? I am 16, marfans, in the UK. I am extremely flat footed, on both feet. From the age I was diagnosed (2.5) till about age 9 I wore ankle high AFO\u2019s in my school shoes. Then I said they were hot and without question they moved to the splints where they only go up the inside of your foot. I wore those with regular appointments with the orthotics team up until about age 12. Then the orthotics and physio team moved building, I seem to have got completely lost in the system and have not had an appointment for over 2 years. My splints are about 4 years old, no longer do anything for my feet, and do not fit in the shoes I will be wearing in college next year (I previously had big boots, which I wore with school uniform, that were large enough to support the one-sided splints, but college is casual dress and none of my normal shoes can hold the splints, the splints just sort of capsize). Whenever I manually correct my flat feet I can do it for a bit, but both my feet turn inwards so my balance is off and I can trip over. We have decided to go private to get my splints updated, I personally think I need to return to the ankle high AFOs because I am getting problems in my other joints (knees especially) which I am pretty sure are because my feet are not getting the support they need, plus I find walking without support in my shoes is draining and leaves my feet sore, and I will be walking much more in college. I know you cannot internet-diagnose me, but by the time the services open back up it is not going to be long before college starts so it would be good to know what you think so I have an idea of what to go in asking for. Hello! No worries at all! And yes, it is abit hard to diagnose you over the internet, but I will still give it a shot.\n\nFirstly, the \"splints\" are they orthotics that are regular insoles that you do not need to strap at all?\n\nDid you feel more comfort when wearing the AFO? Or the splints? Or the same?\n\nWhat sort of shoes are you putting your devices in?\n\nHave you seen a podiatrist at all? The splints are the plastic, but you do not need to strap them because the idea is that you wear big boots that they lean against in order to stay in place, which was ok when I was at school but now I will be wearing casual dress it just is not an option. I felt a lot more comfortable in the AFO\u2019s because they were working for my feet and I felt more stable when walking, I did try to suggest going back to them on a number of occasions but was just brushed off and not really listened to. I am putting them in Adidas trainers mainly, pretty much the only shoes I wear. I have never seen a podiatrist, the people I used to see one just did orthotics and the other was a physical therapist. In my opinion, a pair of orthotics with an inverted heel and aggressive medial arch support would be best for you, along with a few pairs of good shoes (enough space, firm midsole and heel counter, not necessarily a boot/hightop). However, it is hard to tell exactly what your feet are like over the internet.\n\n If you feel more comfortable in the AFO however, then you need to communicate that to them and clearly tell them that you have tried both (splints and AFO) and that for you, you achieve more alleviation from the AFOs rather than the splints. There is no reason for them to just ignore that and still give you splints unless they have clinical reasoning. So it is really important that you clearly tell them how you feel about the treatment, or else they will think that you are happy with their decisions. \n\nMy question is, would not an AFO stick out more/be harder to accommodate for than a pair of splints/orthotics?", "Do I have marfan's? I am a hypochondriac. I have always been anxious about my health, and it is mostly heart and cardiovascular disease. I have had tests done by a cardiologist and he said I was fine. This was really helpful, since I did not have much anxiety for months since I have been there. My aunt died of a ruptured aorta a few years ago at a fairly young age (reason I was seeing a cardiologist), and yesterday I went on google again, and googled aortic aneurysms. I know, very stupid. I recalled my cardiologist telling me I had a diameter of 3cm's in my descending aorta and 3.3 in my thoracic arch. He told me that was common for tall and physically active people like me. I believed him but now I googled these diameters and it says that 3cm is the upper limit for a normal abdominal aorta. Above is considered an aneurysm! I am 20 y/o. the thought that it is still in the 'normal' range should calm me, but it does not. Why is it not more normal. Could it just be that I misunderstood him, and that he actually meant another part of my aorta? This is just another example of how crippling my hypochondria is. I had a cardiologist tell me I am fine but it is not enough. Reason's I believe it might be marfan's are: I am tall and I have scheuermann's (although a comorbidity with marfan's is excluded). I do not have hypermobility in any way. I have one lazy eye, the other one is in perfect condition. Well you get the point, looking up the symptoms of marfan's were a good scare. I know I cannot diagnose myself and I am going to talk this through with my gp soon. I was wondering if you guys knew some more about these aortic aneurysms, just to calm me from thinking I am going to die any moment. Respect for you guys!", "Marfan and anesthesia I understand that having Marfan makes it so anesthesia does not work properly, like in a dentist procedure, after giving local anesthesia it would still hurt. Is that the same for everyone? Not my experience, no. I am actually extremely sensitive to things like anesthetic While I usually do not opt for anaesthesia at the dentist, I *have* been anaesthetised without issue. Likewise, I have been operated upon numerous times with no problems. Marfan does not have any effect on anesthesia I had my wisdom tooth removed recently and the anesthesia did work just fine I think you are referring to anaesthesia associated with the spine/lower back /legs. Since we are predisposed to dural ectasias ( balloon of fluid in the spine) , the anaesthesia may not work well.\n\nI dont think it would affect the dentist much at all. The only issues I have had with anesthesia is collapsed lungs, and that is the fault of the ventilator not the anesthesia. I even have red hair. Red headed Marfan here and I have never had a problem with anesthesia (and I have had an open heart surgery, two stomach surgeries, and a blood patch). I have pretty significant DE and had a Lumbar Puncture + anesthetic and it was fine. Obviously YMMV but beyond the sting of the lidocane and the pressure from the LP I felt nothing. It is always worked perfectly fine for me. I am pretty sure I saw some folks with EDS talking about that, but I never saw it linked with Marfan. Some people may have read about that and mistakenly thought that affects everyone with connective tissue disorders, then repeated it elsewhere and you read it? I have marfan and local anesthesia never works for me. I felt everything when I had to go get some teeth removed, both times. It is always been this way for me, but that does not seem like the case for everyone here. it worked fine during my open heart. I have had some pretty bad problems, as far as it just seems that I process it very quickly? Dental anesthetic is never sufficient for a long enough time, and I experienced anesthetic awareness when I got my appendix out.\n\n(I really do not recommend that latter one. The dental stuff just *hurts*, but waking up under the knife? Wow do I not recommend it.) Thanks for the reply everyone! Seems like it is not so common to have this problem wth Marfan. Why do I keep reading stuff about red heads here? :s can someone please explain? Thank you :) I do not recall asking this question...

I am currently waiting to see a specialist in order to see if I have Marfans or not. In the meantime, as I have done 23andme and have the raw data (they do not mention Marfans in their auto reports) has anyone used this raw data to look for Marfans in their genes?  I have nooo idea, but I know you can use a service like Promethease (I think that is the name) and run your raw data through it and it should be able to tell you, from what I have heard. It is like $5. Good luck. Thanks for the reply. Actually I did just find promethease after posting and I am reading my report right now! It does have some marfan stuff, I will post with more info once I understand it. Aw, yay! I hope it is favorable news. Coulnd't really understand it (even though I know a bit about genetics), but it did not seem like it said I had marfan variants. May look more deeply into at another time. When you look more deeply, if it does show it, perhaps can you make a new FYI post on this Reddit. It will be good to archive that info clearly.  Obtruded this and did not find anything, using promethease. I do not think 23abdne covers enough DNA to do this.  I do not think those are accurate at all tbh.

Good luck!", "Anyone familiar with MASS Hello-\n\nI have a brother who was diagnosed with MASS which is a similar connective tissue disorder to Marfan's.  I have had some recent episodes with vasovagal syncope and other factors, such as hypermobility in my fingers, elbows, and knees, that lead me to believe that maybe I have it as well.  We are both tall (6'6\") he has more of the symptoms than I do including stretch marks, and a chest protrusion.  The strange part is our Father is 6'5\" and does not have a disorder, so it would not be abnormal for us to be tall without any genetic disorder.  I came here because I am reading that some doctors consider MASS to just be on the low end of the spectrum of marfans.  I am scheduled to visit my doctor next week, but I thought I would ask people who may have experienced some of the issues that led me to go to the doctor.\n\nDo any of you have issues with postural hypotension (drop in blood pressure when standing) or have near syncope (fainting) when under physical duress such as running etc? My rheumatologist thinks I am MASS phenotype Marfans (had to reschedule my aorta ultrasound though, due to the whole pandemic thing). I am a little under 5\u201910 but I am a woman. I have POTS (heart rate often drops over 30bpm when I stand, esp. from a crouching position, I get light headed and I black out). Also low resting heart rate, low blood pressure on &amp; off with symptoms, and a mild mitral valve prolapse. Severe scoliosis as a kid. And constant, EXCRUCIATING joint subluxations since I was a kid. Primary doctor referred me for Ehlers Danlos, but rheumatologist is thinking MASS because I have the wrist sign and \u201creverse namaste.\u201d Hope that helps! I do not have as much hypermobility as you do lol impressive.  Both my brother and I are not the traditional marfans body type, we are you all, but we are also very strong.  Both of us played division 1 college football (both were tight ends) so we have lifted weights are entire lives.  However they do give you a physical before each season and even though we both played at different colleges, the trainers would tell us the same thing, we have very \"loose joints\" specifically our knees and ankles.  Sometimes my knee pops out of its socket (very rarely) if my knee is bent a certain way.  We also both have hypermobility in our fingers.  I was never tested for it because again I do not have as many of the signs that my brother has.  His aorta root was large but not out of normal range for his size and upon follow up it had not grown.  My grandmother on my mother's side has Mitral Valve Prolapse, which I am thinking maybe I have and is what is causing my orthostatic intolerance and pre-syncope issues, perhaps the gene stems from her.  My resting heart rate when I wake up in the morning is in the low 40s, but once I get up and am more active it gets up to the high 50s and low 60s.  I am hoping that my doctor recommends an echo so I can find out exactly what is going on.\n\nMy brother is an idiot in some regards after having his aorta tested a couple times as a teenager they told him it was not growing but to go again when he turns 21.  He did not go because he said \"I would rather die than have them tell me I cannot do physical activity anymore\".  But hopefully if I get the echo I can at least tell him if my aorta is showing signs of aneurysm, but from what I understand MASS is not supposed to have that issue. I am new to this subreddit, and after researching Marfans obsessively I can say that every single symptom is affecting me. I cannot get a diagnosis until this corona pandemic ends, or diminishes a little.  \n\nBut I have always been an active person, lifting weights etc. I feel like its a mild form of Marfans or even MASS. I am sat here praying that it is actually MASS because, by the sounds of things, aortic valve enlargement does not take place, along with lens dislocation (Although I have weak shortsightedness &amp; stigmatism). To me that sounds like the restrictions on weightlifting are loosened. There really is not enough online documentation on MASS Syndrome out there... \n\nI have very low blood pressure, and I always found in life I feel much better eating lots of salt (which is not recommended).

I have seen a lot of pots patients and they use salt as a first line treatment so I would not worry too much unless you have a medical condition that would make it contraindicated (kidney disease, heart failure).  \nThere is genetic testing for Marfans.

Always struggled with weight but I have been 100lbs lighter than my heaviest for 20 years.  High palate, mild scoliosis, Marf-stretch marks, enlarged aorta, etc.  Mental health has always been my priority after making sure my aorta does not go kaboom.  My Dad is also atypical but never has been overweight.  My arm span is closer to normal but his is 6\u201d longer than he is tall. He is 6\u20198\u201d. I had my lenses removed at 15 as well. My left one nearly detached completely before they could get it out so that was fun. Good on you for taking care of your mental health. do you use contacts? I would like to have a surgery to have a lens replacement since I am just tired of contacts by now :/ I do and if it is possible for me to have a replacement I would LOVE that!

Yet... descriptions of the syndrome turn around and talk of how there is \"variable expression,\" meaning that different people with the disease have different effects. If that is the case, then that would mean that cases of Marfan's exist without the cardiac defects. So, why exactly do ALL patients with the disease have to give up strong physical activity?\n\nFurthermore, the condition does not look as limiting as it is said to be (at least, for quite a few cases).

Specifically, the skeletomuscular signs, such as wrist sign and thumb sign. Do I have to put force into trying to make these signs being a positive? Or should be very \"easy\" and natural to perform them to be equal to being positive? the markers or signs your talking about are used by doctors to give reason for genetic testing. Folding your thumb acrossed your whole palm with over hang would come easy with no pain so would wrapping your fingers around your wrist with overlapping. another sign is a wing span longer than your height. If you suspect Marfans, please go to the doctor. I neither have a low upper/lower-body segment ratio below 0,85 (around 0.90 here) nor an armspan greater than my height (Height is 185cm, my armspan is around 181-182cm). But I am soooo thin for being a guy and have always been the thin one, like extremely thin. I got myself on a strict diet 1,5-2 months ago and have for the first time gained a record weight of 60kg (I was 55). I am planning to begin a life with exercises (musclebuilding etc) but I stumbled upon this subreddit... And I am the BIGGEST hypechondriac there is. I was wondering, as my fingers (first and second joints from the fingertips) are extremely hypermobile, if I had Marfans. \n If I force my thumb (Which hurts slightly) by dragging it with my other hand, the finger protrudes my ulnar border but not the entire first phalanx. Then if I individually, when the thumb is folded, push each finger that embraces my thumb slightly to the side, more of the thumb becomes visible and protrudes. Some pictures on the net looks as if someone has tortured the poor souls to even get the sign positive, whereas some look as if it comes extremely natural without assistance to force the thumb beyond the ulnar border. That Is why I have become so confused. If I do it normally, my thumb barely peeks out beyond my little finger. My fingers are slender (Thin, but not longer than my peers. I can imagine if my fingers (And whole body lol) were slightly thicker they would look just like my friends). I have a thin, kind of long, face too with deep-set eyes but I wouldnt say they are big nor slanted but I have a slight overcrowding (I dont even know if it can be classed as overcrowding or just a misshapen tooth being turned sideways slightly) on my upper maxilla and a slightly small jaw. Much of these characteristics, except my long height, ive inhertied from my parents (Moms hypermobile in her fingers yet she is veeeery short. My dad has some misshapen teeth and a slightly small jaw but is \"normal\" in height, as in I am the tallest in the immediate family). I have a tall person on my moms side but he does not share these traits I am concerned about here. I know, this hypochondriac thing is making me go nuts but I was so happy to begin to see signs of gaining weight and start exercising for real.... And no, I am not looking for a diagnosis here, just hearing what you have to say. I feel fine, never had any breathing problems or signs of hear diseases. Nobody in my family has ever had problems with their heart as far as I know, only diabetes and GI issues, the \"most concerning\" being IBS.  If necessary, I will go to the doctors but yeah.

I recovered from all of it pretty quickly and got back on track with exercising and swimming, but everytime I was at a peak I had some major medical thing. Also, because I missed so much school I decided to redo the year on my own terms. My school was not really a big help, but they were kind enough to copy some grades to my current year so I do not have to do everything over.\n\nThen, this fall, I had a retinal detachment on my best eye and I went through surgery for that as well. To make it even worse, it was in the middle of a test week. Again, I was behind on school and I had to make the tests over the past couple weeks. I got pretty good grades so I was pleased to be able to focus on this term instead of the last. On top of that, I got a new swimming record which I am quite proud of.\n\nThen, I went to the back specialist(? I do not know if this is the right English term) and the results were pretty fucking dissapointing. My escoliosis is now critically bad and I am now scheduled to get surgery to put it in place with metal rods. I am a emotionally stable guy but it hurt to hear it nontheless. I do not want to have to go through all the bullshit with school again. I do not want to have to start from scratch with swimming again. And, I do not want my back to be permanently stuck in place. But these are all just things me and probably a lot of you have to deal with. It sucks, but it is also just \"shit happens\".\n\nAnyhoo, I am not looking forward to it. I will have the surgery in 2 to 5 months, or sooner. January 20th is my next appointment to take some more x-rays.\n\nBTW, I live in the Netherlands, so I have health insurance and therefore there is no money issue involved.\n\nThat was it, I just need(ed) to spill all of this bullshit that has been and is going to be bothering me. Really sorry to hear all that. DM if you ever want to chat. \ud83d\udc9c You have every right to be frustrated. The amount of stuff you have been through, especially for someone your age, is far more than most people will ever have to deal with. I am beyond impressed that you have dealt with what you have already and still managed to accomplish all that you have. Seriously, bravo.\n\nI wish I had stronger words of comfort for you. You seem like a remarkable person. You have already reached a very mature level of understanding of all of this. But you are right. Some people just get it worse than others. What I can tell you is that everything will be ok. I have been through the spinal fusion surgery, I had it back in 1990, and then again in 1991 (the first rod broke loose and started protruding from my back, it is actually a funny story, believe it or not, but I digress). It is rough, I will not lie, but once you are all healed you very quickly get used to it, and it feels 'normal' if that makes sense.\n\nThe one advice I would give is this: be kind to yourself. You sound like a very active person, and that is great, hold on to that, but please do not forget your condition. I did forget. I tried to live life like everyone else. And when a big, heavy load needed to be lifted, I jumped in with everyone else cause I wanted to do my part. And now I am paying for it dearly. I did serious and permanent damage to my back, and now all I can do is warn others. Please do not ever forget you do not have the same body as everyone else. Be kind to yourself, and everything will be ok. Best of luck to you on the procedure. We are here for you if you need us. I get you. Especially on the school deal. I am glad the school is so helpful. I have wasted a couple of years on being expelled, because of sick days. \n\nVenting is keen. It is bullshit and it sucks. But it sounds like your handling it very well. Just know that complaining in your case is healthy. Stay strong! Shit dude. I am really sorry. I have had my share of missed school but that is unreal. I hope everything goes well for you. Can you give us an update once everything is done? I am so sorry!  Some people have it worse than others, and your path sounds tough. Best wishes to you. Good luck, man.

I do not consider a dilation of 43mm to be mild at all (normal range for a male in their 20s is around 35mm).

Welp, mine was the whole lot of ascending + aortic root + aortic valve replacement so it directly affects the heart - my surgeon was very concerned about (blood?) infection from the ink that would go right to the heart and the survival rate of such an infection, with the kind of op I have had, on his table is 0%, so... when you hear such a stat, you basically do not gamble for lols :/ Wow I have 5 tattoos and never had a doc say anything to me.... Honestly never even thought about that being a concern!", "Pectus correction - any1 have the surgery done? For any1whos unaware of what pectus is, it is simply uneven chest bones - pretty common with severe marfans (so ive been told). \n\nI have pretty severe pectus carinatum (where your chest / sternum bones stick out), also referred to as pigeon chest. Unfortunately, and I really stress the *unfortunately* my parents decided not to correct it when I was a kid after a dr. pointed out that it could and should be corrected. My parents figured that since I am a female that eventually breast development would cover it all up, so no point in surgery. Although being a female deff aids with covering it up, which I can attest to; it is still a mess cause so much of half my chest is higher than the other. This goes beyond my sternums unevenness as most of my ribs are higher on 1 side. \n\nTo get to the point, I am back in my home city after being away for 3 years at Uni and I am going to see my GP this week. So ofc, now is the time to bring up any surgery queries. In seeing her I may just ask to have a referral sent ovr so that I can see a surgeon abt this in the near future - no rush cause of covid ofc. \n\nAnyway, I want to hear about any of your experiences and if you rlly think surgery for pectus is worth it? Since I have pectus carinatum and not pectus excavatum (which is when the chest is shaped inward*) its not interfering with my breathing and general health. \n\nI really dont mean to come off as superficial seeing as this is not a detriment to my current health, but for those of you who have had, or still have severe pectus you kno where I am coming from, and likely know how I feel.\n\n*this final point is more for the ladies, - I have figured the only other option to achieve an even chest would be getting a breast implant on the right side where there is not as much volume. If any of you ladies had done something like that, I am curious to know how that went and if you would recommend it? Feel free to private message me about it:) I am a male with Marfan had the Ravitch procedure done to correct pectus excavatum. I had the surgery mainly for impaired breathing, but the cosmetic aspect is totally understandable and something I struggle with too. The procedure was a pretty long process involving a 5 day hospital stay and months of recovery. For a few years after the procedure, my breathing was overall better but over the last 10 years, the chest wall has slowly sunken back to where it was before. Apparently recurrence is pretty common in Marfan, as the connective tissue often cannot support the new position the sternum is forced into. The recommendation is to keep the support bar in for longer than you would for a healthy person with pectus, to allow additional time for the connective tissue to stabilize. At the time neither I nor the doctors knew I had Marfan, so I had the bar in for the standard amount of time, which may have contributed to the recurrence.\n\nThe other issue you should be aware of is the potential strain of the surgery on your heart. If you have Marfan related heart complications, definitely make sure you discuss this with your doctor. Fortunately for me, the procedure did not seem to accelerate aortic root dilation.\n\nNot saying you should not have the surgery, and I certainly cannot speak to your experience as a woman with pectus, but just wanted share my experience and some of the added risks I wish I had known earlier. We had my son's done when he was 5 years old. I am sorry your parents did not do yours, the recovery for young children is so much easier than as an adult. \n\nHe had pectus excavatum as well as extra cartilage in his rib cage.  They did a modified version of the Ravitch procedure, Dr Fonkalsrud in UCLA modified it and had more success with less future collapsing of the ribcage. My son is now 19 and has not had any issues other than freaking out an occasional xray tech if they do an xray of his chest. Do not get on your parents to much, it is a difficult decision and a pretty big surgery especially when they are being told it is not medically necessary.\n\nRe: The ravitch procedure folks are mentioning.  I could be wrong but I do not think there is an equivalent for carinatum as it is essentially inserting a bar to guide growth.\n\nAs to your decision, it is likely well worth the consult and you can ask about non-cosmetic impacts as well.  With excavatum you can have a restricited lung capacity, I am less familiar with issues around carinatum.  Consider any drawbacks in addition to benefits though.  I had my excavatum repaired at 27.  It was a major benefit but because of how they repaired the chest wall my right lung shows paradoxical breathing (when I inhale it goes down) because there is effectively no chest wall there.  It is not great and I feel even 1ft of water on it very uncomfortably.\n\nIf there is no medical reason and you would like the surgery for cosmetic reasons (which you should not feel a need to apologize for) the recovery will likely be much, much smoother through breast augmentation.  That being said, you should do a LOT of research on the surgeon/facility to make sure it will achieve the result you want.  Shop around as much as you can.  Also keep in mind that insurance may not cover it (or at minimum it is going to take a lot of back and forth). Thanks so much for sharing, you definitely provided some key info which I will be glad to discuss with my GP. Really sorry to hear about the recurrence, I hope all else health related is well and in your favor. All the best! Thanks for sharing, I am really pleased to hear that it went well and that post OP he is doing well after all these years! Very true, aha. And yes for carinatum it is not quite the same, was reading into it and most people just get it corrected for aesthetic purposes. \n\nReally to sorry to hear about how your pectus took a negative impact on your health but I am glad it was well corrected and not as crazy an ailment on your lungs and health oppose to pre-op\n\nThanks so much for your insight and advice, I will definitely look around with plastic surgeons and certainty speak to my GP about it. All the best!! Thanks!  It is not that bad (and still a net positive!  they kind of had to fix it to get at my heart lol).\n\nYou bet, good luck with everything! Thanks champ, appreciate  it! I has pectus caranatum fixed when I was 12.  I am 44 now. My chest never became normal - I went from having a bump in the middle of my chest (kids made fun of me saying I had three boobs, even though my breasts had not grown yet) to having more of an excavatum-type situation.\n\nI also have sever scoliosis and have lost a couple inches in height over the years.  Some of that may have increased the effect of the \"cavity\" I sort of have now.  I also have a sort of ledge where it was stopped from growing outward. It is sort of weird - a ledge that dips into a cavity. I am sure I am over staying it. I never had any complaints during sex or anything...\n\nBut I have wondered who did my surgery, how skilled they were, and just how much they understood. We did not know back then that I am a marf, so the surgeon would not have known about skeletal complications I might have later.  I also have a large scar under my breasts now... Like an 8 in zipper line.\n\nI have often considered getting breast implants to help hide the whole deal, but have not prioritized it.\n\nBut.  The less than perfect result is still not something I would trade back.  At least this way it is covered by a shirt. Even a reasonably modest bikini covers the scar, etc.\n\nBut physically, health-wise, I recovered as expected and did not have any problems from it. Thank you for sharing your experience, I really appreciate it. I am glad things went okay post op, n after all these years that it is not cause any crazy havoc. I also worry about skeletal changes as I get older - and how my bones may shift back or in a diff direction. Just got to remain positive I guess\ud83d\ude02. Thanks again love, all the best!! One of the hardest things for me as a marf is how difficult aging has been. I was an excellent athlete in school, and stayed extremely active until age 26 or so.  Then after that I was just normal - healthy enough, not a work-out fiend, but healthy.\n\nAs I have aged, though, my back is extremely painful, my vision just gets worse and worse, and my joints cannot handle strain without causing substantial pain after. I am suppose to get a 13-level spinal fusion but I just keep putting it off. I think bc I am scared.\n\nI am now substantially physically limited.  I use a wheel chair from the store or bring my own walker if I am going to have to be on my feet for very long. It hurts so much just to get on my feet each morning, as the weight of my head and shoulders compresses my spine.\n\nBUT:  I believe with all my hear that you find joy in almost all situations if you carry that outlook with you. I spend a lot of time on the sofa.  :) But I read, knit, crochet... I have started cooking with my daughter, though that is always painful before the whole meal is prepared.  It is still worth it to hang with her.  I have found I can still do chores if I rest frequently and stretch my back each morning before getting out of bed.\n\nThe physical consequences of our marfan syndrome are very similar to each other. She passed away from complications from a marfan-related surgery a few years ago... But I never understood how brave she was and how extremely well she managed her pain!  She was an amazing woman.\n\nI guess what I am trying to say, is... If they are recommending surgery, do it sooner rather than later, bc this marfan shit just gets worse. Improve your baseline at every opportunity, because doctors get more tricky all the time and they can do amazing things for us.\n\nGo for it!  Be what you want to be and live how you want to.  Life is short, and marfan can sometimes be debilitating later. Just give yourself the best starting point you can.\n\nBleh!  I promise I am not trying to be negative, just realistic about things we did t understand when my mom was first diagnosed. That might have been when she was my exact age now. Anyway, you can handle anything that comes your way.\n\nNevermind. I sound like an old turd.\n\nJust - be blessed, I guess.  Lol. This is really important to hear, thank you. I am so sorry about all the ailments its caused you, I hope moving forward it is all manageable. I definatley agree with improving our baseline while we have the opportunity. Better now than never, thanks again for sharing your experience and wisdom. It is not always that we can get insight from people in our shoes who have been through the motions, so your words are very valued dear!! Xox Sorry to hear about your issues. I hope my kid (13) will not face the same issues as you do when he is my age (48). Stay strong!\n\nHe hates his pectus excavatum more and more each day, it freaks him out. In some ways, I think being a marf is harder for boys than for girls.  Men are expected to carry a certain amount of muscle mass, and may even prefer to carry a small amount of over weight than to be skinny. At least as a girl, once I got past my teen years, skinny was all good.\n\nI wish the very best for your son... Marfan syndrome is like a sliding scale, everybody who has it falls on the scale anywhere from \"easier\" to \"harder.\"  I am not sure where I fall, but a lot of people are worse off than me, and a lot of people are better off than me.  He has a long time yet before his body will probably start to give him grief.  I just hope he is able to be confident and ok with who he is. Youth can be so hard for kids. May he be blessed/happy and confident, and live a long life with few problems. That happens a lot, I think.", "Made it to 30 years old with no real issues, just had my first scare. Diagnosed at birth, birth mom had marfan and died giving birth to me. Had echos and check ups all my life, currently on 100 mg of Atenolol a day. Never paid the fact that I had the disease much mind, other than being tall and wearing glasses, I felt like everyone else. Two days ago I was lifting something at work and I suddenly felt like I could not finish a breath, it felt like someone was squeezing my heart. Like an idiot I waited until later that night to go to the ER after freaking myself out with web searches. Good news is everything is fine, no dissection or popped lung. But I am suddenly aware of my condition and mortality in a way I never thought before. I did martial arts for a year, was a volunteer EMT/Firefighter for the county, and did a lot of pushing myself at the gym, never thinking much about the risks. Now I am looking at switching jobs (I currently work in fiber construction) and waiting on a consult with my cardiologist. Sorry for the wall of text, just needed to vent. This condition is so sneaky and so vile. It can creep up on you. I am glad you listened to your body. \n\nMy mom died at age 68. She had a good run and would have gone longer had she not smoked. She followed all of the other guidelines, though. \n\nI worry too. I hate this thing. Just remember you are not alone. \n\nAnd update us all on your cardio appointment.\n\n (Major hugs!) Yeah. I had zero issues until 32 at which point everything went to crap. I have lost most of my eyesight, have major joint issues and have had 4 heart procedures. Hopefully you can prolong the number of good health years with a few lifestyle changes. So glad you did not dissect. \u2764 Thank you for sharing this. I was diagnosed a few years ago in my early twenties, and I have not yet had any scare whatsoever, but I know it is an ever present possibility. I had to give up a lot of very enjoyable recreational activities as a result, much like I am sure that you have had to limit or give up entirely much of what you enjoy. Definitely switch jobs, as all it takes is one bad experience and it is all over.  I am sure you enjoy your job, but there are many other jobs I am sure you would enjoy as well.\n\nStay safe!", "Do you think I have Marfans?   ", "Lasik and Marfans Does anyone have any experience with Lasik corrective vision surgery and whether Marfans limits my candidacy? Have not met with any optometrist yet. Just looking for some feedback from the community. Thanks. Having Marfans does not limit your candidacy for LASIK, though it will not do anything to solve a lens dislocation. That is a surgery - I have had both lenses successfully replaced after severe dislocation left me legally blind.  I am now 20/30 - life changing stuff.  &gt;life changing stuff\n\nI had retinal detachments - yes, that is plural, back to back - about... shit, 15ish years ago now. I was just recovering from the first surgery, when the other one came up detaching. More surgery. I was essentially blind for a little over a month. \n\nAnyway, the surgery to repair those has a weird potential side effect - cataracts. So in my mid-20's, I am rocking bilateral cataracts. We finally moved to do a lens replacement to fix that.\n\nLook, idk how bad my vision was, I wish I had the number. I could see clearly less than a foot in front of my face, and it went to extreme blur very quickly past that point. They told me before the surgery that, best case scenario, I might only need readers afterwards. Yeah, okay, whatever. \n\nThey were not fucking around. It was nothing short of miraculous. Needing readers for my lost close up vision? Totally worth it.  I am 28 and have not had any problems with my lenses so far. I am near sighted, and have a high astigmatism. Guess I am just worried about getting my vision corrected and having Marfans in general. It always seems to complicate things.  I developed cataracts at age 41. I had to have surgery for that (lens implants) and I got lasik while I was in there. The only issue I experienced was that they were limited on the type of lenses they could use due to the capsule or sac that holds the lens being a little \"floppier\" than someone without marfan's. And at some point, it might need surgery again.\n\nThe lasik part itself was not any issue at all. That part went beautifully. Fast healing. No complications. I have always wondered this too! I do, however, have a dislocated lens so I suppose that is something I should consider trying to get solved in the future. It is been that way since I was super young, though. My glasses are like a centimeter thick and magnify my eyes like crazy and had to be ordered from Japan since they did not make my prescription in the US so I have always had serious doubts that any type of corrective surgery would work but it is really nice hearing success stories from other folks here!", "Question Would it be possible for each region of the aorta to be repaired, thus leading to a \u201cnormal\u201d aorta that would never grow? Possible maybe. But any potential \u201crepair\u201d (really broad wording here?) is based on whatever damage is there. It is likely the mesh based surgical solution is going to keep pace with changing material sciences &amp; the growing wealth of our ability to create new / replacement tissues from the host. This should ultimately lead to a plausible spot repair for serious damage to an aortas wall. Ultimately the fundamental problem marfan sufferers (may) face is that the genetic issue is systemically in all connective tissues so even if you had say developed a large tear, had it noticed early on, had it repaired with scifi style mending tissue from your own stem cells or whatever you would still be at risk for another tear down the line. \n\nProper nutrition, exercise (compliant with your situation), &amp; regular checkups are basically the only path we have preventively.

I seem to not be extremely affected by my marfans as I am in quite good shape and have never actually had any ligament or joint or any other Marfan related Symptom despite being quite active for the majority of my life. That being said. I have received news I will have to have the operation in the next year or so and it is sent me into a spiral of depression. My whole life has been based around my active lifestyle and sports and such are the biggest source of happiness in my life. I am petrified of a future whwre that cannot be. I keep trying to find new hobbies but nothing interest me. I have no other passions and I do not know how I am going to live the rest of my life without it. It is been keeping me up every night. Anyone been/in a similar situation? The recommendations for exercise and activity for people with marfan's is changing. lots of studies are being done on the positive effects of exercise/activity on the aorta/connective tissue. I think you will find that you will still be able to do a lot of the activity and sports you were doing before the surgery. It helps to be a healthy/active person when it comes to surgery outcomes so you are ahead of the game. I am can only imagine how scary a time like this is for you but keep on trying new things. you never know what you might find a new passion for! \n\nalso nevin harris and Isaiah Austin are athletes who had to alter their path because of a diagnosis. I am sure there are more but maybe you will find some inspiration in their stories! All the best! I was diagnosed young, so I have never really been physically active, but I feel similar. Constantly feel like i want to run or climb mountains or whatever will make me feel alive. Driving fast on the highway and playing music loudly sometimes helps, but tbh I do not really have any real solutions, it just kind of sucks. Definitely look into seeing a therapist for the depression/anxiety tho Definitely, I have been in your position! Just like you, all my life sports was pretty much the only thing I thought about. I am now 21 and cannot really play anything... my knee is fucked and I also got tired of all the sprained joints and broken bones. \n\nHonestly I got used to the idea. I now play how I can and try to get the most pleasure when I do it. Unlike you, I always knew I had some clear problems so I had mentally prepared over time. I hope you can keep doing sports... and even if you cannot I hope you can get used to the idea like I did.\n\nBest of luck. May I ask what made your doctor test you for Marfan if you dont have any symptoms? My eye lenses. Or whatever that symptom is. It is also resolved now and my vision is fine lol. Also I am 6\u20196 and very lanky. Find a therapist you trust so you can talk to someone objective. Talk to your doctors (cardiologist, GP) about what they recommend and keep the conversation ongoing. I was diagnosed very young (10yo) and was made to believe I could not do almost any physical activity, but lo and behold I began physical therapy for scoliosis at 30 and discovered a whole world of physical activities and exercises I can do without fear of injury. You may have to alter some things or relearn how to do things safely, but there is always something you can do! And it is VERY IMPORTANT to always be talking to your doctors and asking questions. Never be afraid to ask them things! I felt completely helpless for most of my life.

Just sharing my experience for others to follow along!\n\nI have suspected Marfan for awhile now. But since it is such a rare disease, and I already have a lot of other conditions (I get poked fun at and called a \"hypochondriac\" even though I am formally diagnosed), I decided not to pursue seeing specialists. It is SO HARD to get doctors to listen to you, take you seriously, and put in the legwork to get you formally diagnosed. I thought, maybe I would better just let this one go...too much hassle and it likely will not amount to any closure. \n\nBUT THEN! My dad casually told me that my cousin was diagnosed with a rare disease, but that he forgot the name of it. I said, oh, what are the symptoms? I went cold as he described what I knew to be Marfan. When I asked if it was that, he said yep that is it! My parents - and nobody in my family - knows I have any illness whatsoever or that I suspect Marfan. I do not tell relatives about my health. \n\nNow that my cousin has it - confirmed - I decided to look into it, too. I have an appointment scheduled with a new primary care on 11/19.

Hey all, \n\nBeen lurking/posting occasionally on this sub a lot lately - it is really 'wholesome' to be linked up with others who really understand what I am going through. \n\nI have become kind of concerned with the amount of 'Do I have Marfans?\" posts on here lately. I am not sure if it is because the sidebar is not full enough or what - but I have noticed a definite spike recently to the point where it seems to constitute the majority of this sub. \n\nFor clarity - if you are reading this and wondering if you have Marfans, see a doctor. Period. The problem with this disorder is the whole 'lanky' look can be caused by a vast variety of factors, and I feel like too many people focus on this and worry incessantly that they have a genetic disorder. My father and I were both diagnosed by a genetic test - frankly this is the only way to be 'sure' of it all. \n\nIn other words, this is most definitely not a medical advice subreddit. I feel like I am straddling the line of being rude here, but frankly, we cannot diagnose you. No one can look at pictures and do so, including a trained doctor. You may in fact have Marfans, but please try not to whip yourself into a frenzy of worry, and instead reach out to a doctor and figure it out for good.  THANK YOU This post should be stickied to the top of the subreddit. What really gets me are the people who are convinced they have it even though their doctors have told them to do not have it  Finally someone fucking said it. I have damn near unsubbed because this place is 98% \"I am tall and thin, do I have Marfan so I can be le special like you?\"\n\nI know I have gotten snippy with a few people but it is getting ridiculous. I am about to save a post in word that says \"being tall and thin is common. Marfan is not, especially without a family history. If you are really that concerned, see a doctor.\" \n\nBut then, I could swear we had a person in here saying \"I think I have Marfan but my genetic test came back negative can I still have Marfan?\" Cannot seem to find the post, though.  I could swear there was a post where someone said they would gotten a negative genetic test but they still wanted to know if there was a way they could have it.  That basketball player that had to pass on joining the NBA a couple years ago gave it a boost in notoriety. Isaiah Austin, I think his name was.  I could not agree more! The answer is always \"Go See A Doctor\". Only a doctor can give a definitive answer based on test results. If you think you may have Marfans, please consult a medical professional as soon as possible.  I will play devil's advocate. Sometimes constraints stop you from seeing a doctor or from getting an answer which you feel you desperately need. People in these groups cant diagnose but connect you to a lot of information and tests to do while you wait so you have a clear understanding before going in which can be helpful. \n\nI read about Marfan's, then read posts and saw how my symptoms matched up perfectly. Then I made a symptom list and asked my doctor and when he saw the list, only then did Marfan's come into the picture. \n\nAfter 10 years of misdiagnosis from multiple specialists was I finally diagnosed with Marfan's. Without that, I would not have known to get my heart checked and potentially save my life. There is also factors of cost that prevent some from seeking specialist help, or timing where insurance makes them wait, or where it is free like I am, genetic testing has a 1 year wait even for an initial appointment.  Tl;dr. Reading posts like those you complain about got me enough info to take to my doctors and get diagnosed after 10 years where I have been misdiagnosed and my entire life fell apart.

I am tired of being so skinny! I have been trying so hard to gain weight but I have not had any success Weight gain is primarily a matter of calorie intake.  Google up a TDEE calculator to find how many calories you need daily to maintain your weight.  Then add 300-500 a day. A 500 calorie surplus equates to ~1 lb of gain every week,  however you will probably want to go slower. Talk to your cardiologist about the level of exercise that is safe for you. Yes, you will gain as you get older. Speaking to a lot of people with connective tissue disorders who have marfan syndrome or the marfanoid habitus, a lot have gained weight, but not all, so I am guessing it will creep up on me as I get older, how old? Well, not sure. I am guessing either 40's or 50's. I honestly would not mind being average skinny like 120 or 130, but I cannot even get to that! To be honest, I really want to be 150 pounds, but I cannot even get to that, even 130 would be nice or 120. What is marfanoid habitus? People who have traits of marfan syndrome. There is other conditions that have the body type of marfan syndrome such as some forms of Ehlers Danlos Syndrome. I am in a similar situation. I have managed to get to 120 by working out and eating like.. up to 3000 a day. But it is hard work and anybody else doing what I do would be way bigger by now.

Totally empathise I keep getting messages from people saying how attractive I am.  \nI have multiple messages saying I am hot.\n\nIt is mostly guys though who crave effeminate skinny bois.\n\nLmfao.\n\nI am 24.\n\nTo be honest, whether a boy or a girl, I just want to feel SOME kind of love over my body.\n\nI appreciate the comments and messages I get almost daily on my other social media accounts. Lol. Okay, cool. I am in a similar situation where I would just prefer to like my body more I do like my body. I learned to like it. I am pretty sure you can get love with it, and if not, I do not think dating or marrying 100% matters (in my opinion), as long as you have family and at least one good friend, or more than one friend, or a belief in SOMETHING. Or a hobby.", "What drugs are no-no\u2019s for us in terms of blood pressure spikes and or other cardiovascular effects? I do not mean medication. i am not looking for advice i am just curious.", "input needed i am 18 6\u20193 150 pounds. i was not very tall up until my freshman year when i hit a growth spurt. my parents are not very tall (mom is 5\u20199 and dad is 6\u20190) which confused me to as how i got so tall. my uncle was tall and skinny so i assumed i got his genes. he died at 42 of a heart attack but they declared it was from his drug use of stimulants but now i wonder if it could have been marfans. I do not pass the hand tests. i am near sighted in one eye and far sighted in the other. i have been having shortness of breathe since july which the doctor listened to my lungs and said he heard no tears. my chest slightly dips in. i have had bad teeth but never crowding just gaps. i am starting to worry i could have marfans and could drop dead at any point cause i am very active and skateboard everyday for multiple hours. i am worried this shortness of breathe is due to my heart being off and i am going to die soon. i had a ekg done last week at the er but i know that will not show my aorta. very worried i could be risking my life when i go do physical activity At your age you are unlikely to suddendly drop dead even if you are active and if it turns out you do have Marfan.\n\nThe aorta stretches over your lifetime increasing the risk. If you are only 18 it would be very rare for your aorta to rupture now.\n\nThat said, you should still see a doc about maybe having Marfan because it is better to have that information so you can keep tabs on your heart and have explanations for other quirks of your body.\n\nMost likely they will order an echocardiogram. I am 19 and I actually just had my first one. I was then referred to a cardiologist who I meet with next month.\n\nI feel you on the anxiety. The uncertainty really gets to you. But rest assured, with modern medicine and proper diagnosis, Marfan does not usually shorten lives. It just gives us weird bodies and we have to avoid some things. We learn how to live with it.\n\nHope this helps. Good luck\n\nEdit: oh, one more thing. Marfan is autosomal dominant so it does not go \"under the radar\" like some genes. So your uncle having it and you having it does not really check out unless your dad or mom (whoever your uncle's sibling is) also had it.\n\nThat said, it is totally possible for someone who is 6'0 to have Marfan so if it is your dad's brother, it could be Marfan. Does your dad have any symptoms? What exactly is your question? &gt;At your age you are unlikely to suddendly drop dead even if you are active and if it turns out you do have Marfan.\n&gt;\n&gt;The aorta stretches over your lifetime increasing the risk. If you are only 18 it would be very rare for your aorta to rupture now.\n\nThis may come off as shitty, and for that I am sorry it is not my intent, but... What? *Its unlikely you would drop dead at 18 because the aorta stretches over time *8 year old me is calling in from 1996 and would like to have a word with you, my aortic valve and whichever part of my aortic artery (ascending/descending) were replaced at that age. If you have Marfan you are at reasonably increased risk no matter your age. My mitral was replaced at 4. It is not unheard of, it is something to be wary of no matter what if there is suspicion a person may have it. \n\n&gt;Edit: oh, one more thing. Marfan is autosomal dominant so it does not go \"under the radar\" like some genes. So your uncle having it and you having it does not really check out unless your dad or mom (whoever your uncle's sibling is) also had it.\n\nOnce more, what? Marfan can absolutely fly under the radar, especially if there is no family history and/or if the symptoms someone has are 'minimal'. There are ***plenty*** of instances where having Marfan has gone un-noticed: Flo Hyman, Isaiah Austin, Johnathan Larson to name a few. If what OP meant is that it may have \"skipped a generation\", then no. That is not possible. You either have Marfan or you do not. And each singular child you have will have a 50/50 chance of catching the gene. However if by 'under the radar' OP meant that it has gone un-noticed until them and other family members also have similar physical symptoms, it would be wise to have both parents (genetically) tested as well and then depending on the results, go further along the family tree (e.g., OP's father's other siblings if any).\n\nTo add to that, while yes the gene mutation **is** autosomal dominant, it is possible for it to randomly show up in families. Both of my parents tested negative for Marfan, my brothers and sister as well. I, however, got the genetic jackpot and I have it. \n\nLastly, Marfan is a syndrome, (hence Marfan Syndrome) and as such, one person's experience with it can be vastly different from others and within the same family. Some folks know they have it their whole life but do not have any sort of severe problems until into their 50s, whereas in my case, the majority of my 'big' problems occured before I was 10, with only a few things here and there. Think of it like Autism, not everyone who has Autism is nonverbal with sensory issues. The physical symptoms of Marfan are just that: symptoms. I do not have joint dislocation problems, but I tick nearly every other box, and I am only 5'9\". There are folks with Marfan that are 5'2\" And 250 pounds. Marfan does not have a required appearance, the only way to know for sure is to have genetic testing done. You are also less likely to have knowledgeable doctors in smaller/rural areas as it is not THAT common of a problem \n\nOP if you are super worried about having Marfan, visit Marfan.org -&gt;  and go through the various steps/resources there and present it to your doctor. \n\nAs far as your troubles breathing, if you are currently in the Western US, nearly everything is on fire, everyone is having problems breathing. If you otherwise live in a metropolitan area or an area that has poor air quality that could also be affecting you. Or you may simply have allergies. There are a lot of reasons why it may be hard to breathe, and those reasons can appear at any time (for instance, I did not have allergies that affected my ability to breathe until I was into my early 20s).\n\nAs far as being concerned about skateboarding and being otherwise physically active? You are fine. Skateboarding will be tough on your joints but that is for anybody. the biggest concern is always to be careful with contact sports, but skateboarding and biking and swimming are likely fine, and even that is dependant on how severe your own case is.\n\nI know it is easier said than done, but try not to worry to much. It is good to be cautious and if you would like, you could try to keep track of symptoms/problems occur and present them to your doctor (say, \"I felt my heart flutter while sitting on the couch watching TV with my family, I had trouble breathing all day on October 12 but was inside and not being active all day). It also may be a good way to track your anxieties and try to help manage them. You never know!\n\nBest of luck! You say you tick nearly every other box, which symptoms do you have?\nOh yeah, that is also that thing, alot of people asking \"new\" questions here are actually anxious about their health (The likelyhood of them having Marfans is less than them being overly anxious in a mentally disordered way, statistically speaking). That Is really sad to see :(. There is a specific constellation of symptoms that need to be checked and ticked off before being able to thoroughly consider that you have Marfans/Loeyz dietz/Ehlers-Danlos etc. Checking marfan.org to see which skeletomusclar symptoms you tick off is a great start. However, checking the aorta, eyes and recollecting family history is well enough information to estimate. Then, WITH the genetic testing you are sure to get an answer whether or not. Therefore, I URGE people to actually visit a doctor and go through the symptom-checker/family history to get an admission to genetic testing (If the anxiety over health is to such an extent that genetics testing is the only way to rest). Else, living on suspicion is just folly OP. I really hope you get the help you need. I was not OP, I am guessing that you meant to reply to them. However for sake of the question, I tick every single box re: Marfan except for my height, and dislocation of joints. My joints are a bit more flexible than the average person, but I do not dislocate like (most) people do that have Marfan. Whenever I am seen by new doctors, they are always a bit surprised and tell me that I am a textbook case. I just happen to be a bit on the short side. (Which to be faiiiir, if my spine were straight like it should have been, I would easily be 6'3\" as that was my projected height when I was a young'n) 150 that is really lucky, I am 2'2 and weigh in at 139, I have weighed this much since I was 16.\n\nI need some tips on how to gain weight without taking weight gainer.", "Is my Life Expectancy lowered due to marfans?  i have been diagnosed with marfans for as long as i can remember, im 21 years old, 6'2 and 125 pounds, very tall and skinny with the normal indent on my chest. I go to the doctor 2 times a year and i take beta blockers everyday, my doctor has not told me anything about my life expectancy and not only till today did I discover that people with marfans have a lower life expectancy. If my doctor has not said anything should i be concerned? I read some peoples posts saying they only have till 35. ", "Hey. You. Get your echo. Stop putting it off. Just a friendly reminder in case you are a procrastinator like me. ... What is an echo? An echocardiogram. Basically an ultrasound of your heart that we typically get on a yearly basis to monitor the growth rate of the heart. If you are not getting one regularly, I would check with a proper Cardiologist about doing so. Also important to measure the growth of the aortic root. Oh I see, thank you for the explanation! Boy, I would if I had insurance and/or could afford it \ud83d\ude2d I am so overdue. I was preparing  for my nuss bars to be removed in December. I had to get the green light from a cardiologist for aurgery. So I had my first echo in 19 years 2 weeks ago, found out my aorta is at 4cm and I have a prolapsed mitral valve. And the surgery is now called off indefinitely.  MRI on Thursday. Hopefully the Nuss bars do not mess it up too bad.", "Warfarin Hey there!\nSo, I had my first surgery about 7 years ago, in which they replaced my mitral valve for a mechanic one, and as a \"iron heart\", I got to take Warfarin through all my life. I purchased coaguchek to check my coagulation, and all the stuff you need to do using this meds.\nBut I wanted to know, is there any other, not so restrictive, medication being tested - or that already exists, for mechanical hearts?\nI had a stroke for not having my INR checked correctly, and since I have been a vegan, I just love dark leaves, and all these, and I really wish I would not have to control this so much...\nI live in Brazil, by the way.\nThanks for the attention! To my knowledge there is not anything that replaces coumadin/warfarin, but that is a question better suited for a physician or even a pharmacist. I have been taking warfarin since I was 4 (and I will be 32 next week).\n\nIf you like dark greens/leaves due to being vegan (or that being something that you prefer) you should be fine to eat them, but what matters is consistency. So if you eat 3 times a day and one of those meals involves dark greens, so long as you stick somewhat to that meal plan, you should be fine.\n\nThere are so many things that can affect your coagulation rate, all you can really do is try to find what works best for you. I tend to not care what I eat as far as Vitamin K but i make sure to let my doctors know if I am eating more leafy greens or if I am exercising or have been more or less active in general.\n\nI have also had a stroke, and mine occurred even while having my coagulation checked regularly. Sometimes it is just luck of the draw.\n\nI hope this helps! Thanks! This helps me a lot\nJust asking cuz my own cardiologist says that some new medication is being tested, but since I live in Brazil, I know it may take some time to get here\nBalanced meals are necessary, but sometimes I do feel like eating a whole spinach quiche, for example xD (compulsive eater lol), but thanks, really! I do not think there is anything if you have a valve. \n\nThere was talk of a drug to replace warefein called rivaroxaban but from what i have seen it is more for the lower range. (So 2-3 rather than the 3-4.5 I am on)\n\nI also have the same coagacheck meter and made a php/mysql page to track it and I try and check every 2 weeks and rarely have any issues anymore. \n\nI also told the surgery who monitored me to get stuffed to because they were useless so moved to a surgery who seemed to know way more than the previous surgery and I can email them the results which took all the hassle out. I have the \"On X\" aortic valve which was a newer one that was placed in 2016 around Thanksgiving and I am also on warfarin. I was told they were testing drugs like Xarelto or whatever that following year and that it stopped because a couple people died so it was a no go. I have not heard anything on testing but my original surgeon and cardiologists since have all said that this valve is being studied because they believe you do not need to thin the blood for it beyond the initial first year, but to prove that they have to have someone go a long period without it and it just has not been long enough to know for sure. So there is a possibility people with this kind of valve can stop the warfarin at some point. Also side question, you said you bought an at home INR checker? Did you get it through insurance and if so how? I have been wanting to get one but have been told they are a hefty couple of thousand of dollars. Thanks! Hi!\nSo, I have bought it straight from the lab, lucky me my cardiologist knew some people from the lab company, Roche, and the lab is near my home, it was easy to get, but I may tell you, the little strips they use for the coagulation checking are pretty expensive.\nThe machine itself was about the same price as a diabetes checking machine, but the strips are about R$1000 for 48 strips (around  US$200)\nIf you take just a few tests a month, it is simple and economic (the expire date is around 1 or 1 \u00bdyear).\nI do not know which country you live, but if I paid this price in Brazil, probably it is cheaper there.\nTry checking on Roche website! You may want to inquire with your doctor about the INR machine. Your usual lab that you go to would probably also have more info too. My former cardiologist filled out paperwork for my insurance to basically demand my insurance company allow me one. I never ended up doing so, I have now been told by INR lab that after showing compliance (keeping numbers in range, getting checked on time, etc) that they will work with my insurance/me to obtain a meter for me to have for myself at home and report in that way. I am in the US, however. If you are elsewhere it may be different :) I am mostly plant-based, and I do try to to limit my leafy greens, but I am very inconsistent with this, meaning I do not have a routine of when I eat and when I do not at veggies. My approach has been that if I take some greens, perhaps more than usual, I will drink a cup of wine to kind of leverage this.\n\nMy INR has been pretty stable though, I do not often see spikes or drops; I am not sure if I am an exception to the rule.\n\nOP, if you see this. Do you mind if I PM you to ask a question. Thanks for your answer!\nI naturally have issues with my coagulation :/ that is why\nI even took lots of tests on my last surgery, cuz I was not eating at all (imagine green leaves), and my INR just was not increasing. They had lots of blood tests to see if I had some condition in which my system prevents me from changing my INR, but they found nothing, it is just that my organism is naturally like that, and that is why I got to take a large dose of Coumadin/Warfarin.\n\nI did not understand if you want to ask me a question or someone else, but if it is for me, help yourself! Feel free to PM me. I was going to ask you privately, but I think I would also like to see others here chime in and respond.\n\nDoes your INR remain fairly stable or do you have a lot of spikes and drops?\n\nI bought a coaguchek and I kind of gave up on it, My results usually returned error codes, and it just was not affordable for me to keep wasting money on the pricey strips. For the past five years I have gotten my INR checked randomly, but as I mentioned before mine appears to be pretty consistent. So, as I said my INR is naturally wrong xD I learned to balance it through medication, I take 7,5mg of Coumadin, but sometimes I know I got to take 10mg for a few days, go back to 5mg a couple of days, and then regular to 7,5mg\nCoaguchek, for me, I think it makes us a little paranoid, the result normally is correct (since a bunch of times my INR was like 7, I did not trust, took the test on a lab, and the result was the same), but I agree with you that sometimes it is a little frustrating.\n\n  1st of all: it hurts. It is not just a little spot that you barely feel like diabetes measure, the needle is bigger, the sting hurts more, and, I do not know if it is because of our condition, but many times the finger does not bleed enough, then you got to get another strip, hurt another finger... Even with years using, I know it is annoying, and I do not get happy when I have to take it.\n\nI actually got the machine cuz me and my mom had to get the INR checked periodically, and since she is an elder, it was better than taking her to the lab, but since she does not have metallic material in her heart, she changed to Xarelto and does not need the machine anymore, only I use it.\n\nI would not say it was a total waste of money, since it is pretty easy (but yeah, sometimes annoying) to use, and the strips ARE expensive, but it is pretty good for a quick check up for when, for example, my gum starts bleeding or so. I am in the US too.  My cardiologist is amazing and would do anything for me so I will start there. Thank you! I am in the US. I will look on the site. Thank you! Interesting my daily dose is 12.5mg, and I do not exhibit a lot of symptoms like bruising or bleeding gums easily. Excessive bleeding has only happened to twice due to a spike in my INR. Ask your drs about eliquis or xeralto My mom takes Xarelto, and since we have the same cardiologist, I know it is out of hand\nBut I will ask her about eliquis!

Warning before reading this. I am typing it on my phone and have issues with spelling/ formatting. \n\nWhen I was little I got diagnosed with sotos like syndrome. This was after seeing a whole team of suppose able specialist in the medical field. Growing up as a young kid my life was fairly normal until fourth grade. In fourth and fifth grade I had 3 fainting episodes. They hooked me up to a machine that I walked around with for a week after the third fainting spell. The test came back inconclusive. My team of doctors told my parents they could not explain it. Now while growing up in Nebraska from age 2 to 12 I always had friends and was socially accepted.  I did always have issues learning andy mind wondered easily.\n\n\nAround the summer of 2000 we moved to Idaho. Now this is when my life fell apart. I had issues making friends I was 6 2 and 80 pounds. This caused alot of people to claim I was anorexic. Luckily one of the girls on my block knew better. I was always eating my mom just simply left snacks out for me. Well one day I ate dinner at her house and whent home a hour later to eat my normal dinner. I was still at this point diagnosed wih sotos-like syndrome. When I was about 14 still tall amd lanky. I was running to our truck in a parking lot and slipped on some sand. My knee instantly swelled and the pain did not go away for a good hour. At this point we went to the ER to get it checked. The doctor was curious about my other knee, so they took an xray of it. At the point they determined both of my knees where fucked. During the start of moving to idaho I rode bmx bikes and dirt bikes to excape. While I was sitting in the er room a airmen came by. I was not aware of this since he talked with my dad. They start having a convo about my diagnosis and my dad tells him I had sotos-like. Well the airmen mentions to him to have a ekg to see if I have marfans. This airmens friend in high school had it and I looked like him. So I was not diagnosed with marfans until I was about 15 years old. At this point I learned about how important it was to protect my aorta.  This included wearimg a chest protector while having fun.\n\nI have had my heart scanned and my aorta has not changed within my three scans. It has always been like 2.4 or 3.4 I can find my records if needed. I do have a few openish questions that I will be asking my doctor in two weeks.\n\n* first: has anyone been given the ok to go scuba diving or jumping out of an airplane? Like high altitude high opening.\n\n* second: do you get tired-winded easily even say walking up hills with a 10 or more degree angle?  I am 6 6 and 200 pounds so I am not out of shape...", "Does high pitch voice sound louder ?? Does high pitch voice sound louder ?? yes, high pitched voices are generally perceived to be louder...but what does that have to do with this sub?

Were you diagnosed with marfans? Of course why would I be in this sub otherwise where did u get this idea? i can find 0 research showing a link between marfans &amp; FBN-1 mutations and vocal chord abnormalities Not everything is on the internet mate  so where did u get the idea? im genuinely curious! i like reading medical journals (most do publish results online nowadays) It is logic", "How likely is it that I have Marfan's syndrome?

Ten years later I had an uncle die at 55 from an aortic dissection.\n\nSometimes I get chest pain, irregular and/or rapid heartbeat. I have got high blood pressure.

What poses do you avoid? What are you mindful of while practicing?\n\nI have a Dural Ectasia. Utrasana (Camel pose) does not seem to agree with me and I have come to accept that I will probably never be able to do Chaturanga (yoga push up). I have had to be real careful of all things yoga and Pilates, I have torn my meniscus and popped a shoulder. I started yoga seriously last wk -did a couple sessions ages ago on a 1 time basis. Anyway with this recent engagement was getting into a routine with my brother (he obvs does not have marfans) and so far it is been okay - once I am at the point of doing tons of poses I will let u kno which ones I avoid/specifically cannot do but so far it is been fine - I am just restricted a bit with the rods in my spine otherwise it is been chill. I find the plus of doing it with some1 who does not have marfs (but is also a beginner with yoga) is the reassurance of what weird sensations and pains kick in with all the stretching involved.\nAlso to add ppl w marfans are generally more flexible (apparently) but I have yet to experience that benefit with yoga so far\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d So, I would be careful.  I think yoga in general is a great thing, low weight, meditative, etc.\n\nBUT certain motions are going to be very unique issues person to person.  I have had chest surgery and a double hernia, certain activities cause issues for both, and it is not the kind a thing a doctor can \"diagnose\".  No ones going to book each person for study where they do stress analysis like you would if you were engineering unless it was part of an academic study.  Be very mindful of strains you feel.  No one is going to be able to tell you when that strain is normal yoga or you putting a stress on a mesh.\n\nI have recently become aware of the issues with the cervical spine, and found out that most people do not lose vision in one eye when checking their blind spot driving.  Pair that with the climbing I used to do and I might be a little overly cautious, so take it with a grain of salt. Best advice I can give for yoga (coming from a certified yoga teacher w/marfans) is do not overdo it. Release any tension in your body and just move in a way that feels good. I have very lax vertebrae so I find it useful to look in the mirror and create the \"ideal\" standing posture so my body remembers what/where everything should be prior to the practice. No head/should stands, or backbends, and NEVER hold your breath. Easy, smooth, elegant, and strong is the idea. Hope this helps \ud83d\ude4f Interesting! I actually love doing shoulder stands, but definitely with you on the headstands and backbends. Whatever makes you feel good and is comfortable! Just guidelines, your body is without a doubt the best teacher :)", "Marijuana usage Hello!! \nSo question for everyone my boyfriend has Marfans and has never smoked and vaped from my thc pen once! And it helped relieve symptoms of the margins and mental health for him. I am scared for him to smoke anymore because his doctor (a conservative and just hates weed in general) said no because of the blood pressure dropping to low and he has not talked to any other doctors about it yet. It is been 2 months since he smoked that first time would it be bad for him to sit in a hotboxed car with me? Or just take a vape pen hit? He is otherwise in perfect health in concerns of the marfans and just takes blood pressure pills (losartan).  So summarize the question would it be that dangerous for him to smoke like once a month of every two? (Of course he is going to ask a doctor but in ny medical marijuana is still eh) also his marfans is \u201cnon defined\u201d From what I understand, Marijuana use can be bad for people with heart issues due to it affecting heart rate, dilation and blood pressure. \n\nHis cardiologist would be the best person to talk to for an accurate read though. My boyfriend is petrified of taking anything thc related since the last time he lost his vision in his right eye and never got it back. When I asked my cardiologist the only thing he said was that he advises against it. From what I have gathered there have not been enough studies specifically related to the heart and marijuana's effect on it to really know how bad it actually is. Holy shit that is terrifying. Yup he partakes occasionally but needless to say he stopped with good reason I would absolutely ask a doctor, and get a second opinion first. But I smoke a good amount and have never had anything bad happen. Its actually nice to smoke and get a break from all the joint pain. But again, that is just my opinion, which is in no way more important than a doctors, so check with them first I am in Canada and I am medically prescribed cannabis in addition to some other things to help with chronic pain. I also have very low bp. I vape dry flower often using a pax (which would minimize any lung damage) and use edibles to help sleep at night. I tend to counteract the low BP side effects by drinking a lot of fluid. Sports drinks (particularly g2 Gatorade) are really awesome if I am in a bad spot. Honestly with some of the daily pains I experience with tarlov cysts/dural ectasia, there are days when I would not eat/sleep without it. \n\nI am also a mom and loving wife. I was university educated before I was forced into a medical retirement. Nut to preconceived notions and prejudices. If your partner if uncomfortable on a daily basis, that is EXTREMELY bad for his cardiovascular health. If his cardiologist is to much of a dinosaur to lose his own prejudices and help his patient, maybe time for a second opinion. No defined? I have never heard of that. \n\nHas he had genetic testing? \n\nHave they looked at his eyes, aorta, etc? Yeah. My retina detached in my left eye and the vision is completely gone. I get it. \ud83d\udc96 My daughter is in that non-defined club.  They say that one day they may map the DNA responsible.  But for now she has every part of MARFANS except for the genetic marker and she passed the slit lamp test. Definitely ask for a second opinion, and I guess make sure whenever he gets high that there are people around him who know what to do in an emergency! Ah. That sucks :/ but it is good that they are monitoring her!\n\nDo you mean that her lense was jiggly through a slit lamp? Yeah. That is something to keep an eye on. My lenses detached early. I had both replaced on separate occasions. \n\nI was lucky that they were able to find my marfy mutation along my DNA so it made testing my children for the same mutation easy. Some thing!! Has all the marking and physical disabilities etc but it is \u201cundiscovered\u201d they said I am in that category too. I would say that I am probably more Marfanoid than full blown Marfans. I am tall, but not crazy tall. My arm span is longer than my height, but only just so. My feet are large, but not outside of the average size for my height. No pectus excavatum or carinatum. Only a slightly enlarged aortic root that is been stable for the last 20 years. No problems with my eyes.\n\nFWIW I smoke weed every day... but I have also had a couple episodes of atrial fibrilation. I was stoned the first time it happened but not the last. My cardiologist said it is probably safer than alcohol, which he says patients can have in moderation. But he still thinks that abstaining altogether is safer and therefore what he recommends. At the end of the day, I fault my weight, stress, blood pressure, poor diet and sleep for the a-fib more so than the cannabis. Especially considering that the second time it happened was when I had gained back a bit of weight and had to temporarily stop using my cpap. Since it was not involved in the second event, I started using cannabis again to alleviate pain and inflammation. It is been three years and so far so good. Actually going to see my cardio in three hours...", "Joint pain My daughter with marfan regularly complains that her joints are cracking and it hurts. Is it the same with you? what worries me is that she is only 10 years old!", "Do mild symptoms indicate a mild case? Hey, new to the sub here. I just turned 18 and I am tall and thin, but not to the point that people can tell I have Marfans. I was recently diagnosed after a ton of symptoms appeared all at once just after my 18th birthday; namely some pretty bad lower back and hip pain. As far as I can understand, the biggest risk of Marfans is an aortic aneurysm. If I do not have any heart problems and never have, as well as having had relatively minimal symptoms up until a few months ago, does it indicate that I have a mild case? Kind of? But not exactly? \n\nFor example, I was diagnosed at 14 through a fluke - spontaneous pneumothorax. I have learned since then, that those are one possible symptom. Now, I have not had problems enough with my aorta to warrant anything more than preventative care and observation, where other people will need surgery before they hit 20. \n\nUntil recently. Almost 30 years later, it is finally to a point where we need to talk about surgery in the foreseeable future. So that would seem a pretty mild case right?\n\nWell, while I have had no major issues with my heart, I have had more surgeries than I have fingers. Most having to do with Marfans, either directly or indirectly. Multiple thoracotomies, multiple tympanoplasties/canalplasties, bilateral detached retinas, bilateral lens replacement, recurring hernia... \n\nSo... is my case mild? Comparatively to some people with Marfans, absolutely yes. To a non-marfan person? Not hardly. The important thing is to monitor what needs to be monitored, so you can stay ahead of any issues. Maybe you do not have a whole lot. Maybe you do. It is kind of a crapshoot. Thanks for the reply. Sorry about your current situation, I wish you luck with your surgery!\n\nI got an EKG recently, but I am getting a more intense heart study done tomorrow (I am not exactly sure what it is called) to determine what my current risk is. Were your other external symptoms severe enough to warrant a diagnosis? (Like hyper mobility, back pain, eyesight, etc.) If my experience, EKGs always come back normal.  They need to do an echo cardiogram to look for aorta growth.  Aortic dissection is the biggie.   Ah my bad, I meant I got an echocardiogram recently, I did not realize there was a difference.  EKG they put the stickers on you and check electrical activity of heart.  That is really good your echo came back normal.  Hooray for that! Yeah I am pretty relieved, but they are still calling me back tomorrow for more tests...I will update you guys when I get the results back. My surgery, thankfully, is not to the point of being scheduled yet. But it is foreseeable enough that it was deemed prudent for me to meet with a cardiothoracic surgeon, make me a face and not a number.\n\nPretty much any heart test is more thorough than an EKG. Likely will be either an Echocardiogram (basically an ultrasound on your chest), or an MRI or CT scan. That will give them a measurement of your aorta, so they know where you stand.\n\nMy other symptoms were undiagnosed for a long time. The main visible one was simply my body type. I have always been very lanky, thin and long limbs. My wingspan is 3\" longer than I am tall. Have always had pectus excavatum to some degree (though not as bad as some people), and always had extreme flexibility in some ways. \n\nI was diagnosed because I had a lung collapse when I was 14. Had no idea what happened, and actually had one doc tell me I had pneumonia and gave me antibiotics. \n\nThankfully, we went for a second opinion. By that time, my lung had collapsed all the way down into a little ball and tucked itself behind my heart - it did not even show up on the xray. \n\nThat is a whole other fun story from there, but the pertinent part is that the 2nd opinion doctor had seen Marfans before, and recognized the traits in me. 20+ years ago, that was some serious luck to find a general practitioner that had a clue about it. \n\nIn any case, it has not been a smooth ride - lots of surgeries, as I said before. But each case is very individual, has different major and minor symptoms, and different ramifications. \n\n( to the National Marfans Foundation's Flickr page. I do not think it is active anymore, but this gallery is kind of amazing to me. Many of them have more pronounced traits than I do - as skinny as I am, that first kid is way more so. But you get a feel for the range of visible traits. And for me, it is a trip to see so many traits on other people that I have, that I never saw on other people before. \n\nOh yeah, the fingers. The arachnodactyly. I have definitely got that too, but I do not see it anymore, unless it is on video. ( not the best, but you can compare that to the NMF's photos to really see it. Wow it is lucky you guys decided to get a second opinion! I have always been pretty tall and lanky as well, as well as hyper mobile in all the ways indicative of Marfans. I am still hanging on to the hope that it is very mild, but my back--I think it is called Dural Ecstasia--gets worse everyday. \n\nThe second I read through the symptoms of Marfans though, I was honestly I little relieved just because it finally made sense. Yikes, I had not heard of dural ectasia before.  Looks like around 60% of marfans patients get it. I am in the 40% apparently, but that did not clear me of issues. I have had *three* lung collapses altogether, for instance. And all three resulted in hospital time and thoracic surgery. Not fun stuff.\n\nIt is nice to finally have a name to put to it. The best advice I can give you is just roll with it. Never lament you are not \"normal\". You are exactly who you are, nothing has changed aside from your understanding of your physiology. And that new awareness is good, as the life expectancy if an untreated Marfans patient is around 40 years. That is how old I am now. Without treatment, I would be at the end or likely already dead. \n\nIf you have pain, surgery, complications? Yeah, they suck ass man, I cannot lie. Again, just roll with it. It is what it is, and freaking out about it or getting depressed about it is not going to help. I have gotten to where I hide my stress behind humour. I have always got great humour before any major procedures, it just comes naturally now. I am just used to medical\u200b shit. \n\nI will admit I am scared to fucking death at the idea of having my sternum cracked sometime in my hopefully not too near future. But I will just cross that bridge when I get there, and roll with it. I have no doubt it will suck worse than anything else. But wounds heal, and pain disappears in our memory with the passage of time. \n\nAnd do not do not do not do what I did at first. I learned about Marfans and felt hopeless. I fucked off my entire 20's doing dumb bullshit and getting high on whatever I ran into, because what is it fucking matter, right? Imma be dead by 30 probably, especially the way I am going. Imagine my surprise when I turned 31. I have had to do a lot of catching up in my life over that wasted decade. \n\nJust live your life man. What happens will happen, just roll with it and it will become another memory, another time you got through some shit those \"normal\" people could not even imagine. I am sorry you have had to deal with all of that. Thanks for the advice, I have been trying to take on that same mindset lately; like as long as I am still able to be stay alive, I am still able to live a good life and live in the present. Maybe I will end up being thankful for it for allowing me the grow as a person. I guess I will find out soon. That is definitely the right attitude. I honestly thought I was not going to live to see 30, so I was reckless and self-destructive throughout my 20's. I partied too much, ignored the shit out of my potential health problems, and developed some pretty heavy drug addictions. At one point I was shooting speedballs (coke and heroin mixed) into my arm. It is like I was trying to hurry death along, yanno? \n\nI was truly surprised to see 29. And then 30. And then 31. So I was essentially homeless (living with other people, not paying my way anyway), and nearly unemployable entering my 30's. Since then, I have cleaned up, gone back to school, and now I have a comfortable middle class suburban life; home ownership, too expensive car payment, and a great wife. \n\nAnd I could have had all that 10 years sooner if I had not been a fucking idiot.\n\nThe being thankful is very hard. I will tell you it will not happen right away, and it certainly will not happen post-op. Immediately after surgery is the worst time in the world. At that point, you will just be thankful you woke back up again, lol. \n\nBut yes, man. Live a good life. Do not stress the marfan's at all, as long as you are following doctor's orders, taking prescribed meds, observing any restrictions, and following up with the doctor on time - usually once a year. If you do all that, you can absolutely live a pretty normal life, and only have to worry about issues in the moment they come up - instead of stressing them 24/7 like I did, letting it interfere in my life.\n\nI am not sorry I had to deal with all that, it made me a stronger person. Yeah, everyone wishes life could be easier. But it is its own type of fun, of strength, to have a life sprinkled with trials, and to see that you are still enjoying life just as much as the normies. They probably could not handle a tenth of some of the shit I have seen, and the shit you already see with the dural ectasia.\n\nWell shit, I am rambling. One of those days. I will shut up now, but feel free to hit me up if you have questions, concerns, whatever man. Good luck.  Thanks man, right back at you I do not think mild symptoms mean a mild case, no.\n\nYour heart is one example of something that could just give under certain circumstances. Sometimes with warning, sometimes without. \n\nMy family did not see any symptoms at all (except for characteristics like height) until their 40s. Then heart valve issues and lens dislocation.\n\nMy younger brother was not so fortunate. He passed at 32. No other symptoms. But he never got annual echos and died during emergency open heart surgery: had been brewing a 9.5 cm aneurysm.  I am sorry for your loss, that is really rough. I guess I will just have to wait and see what happens as long as I go to yearly checkups. The surgeon was convinced that yearly echos would have saved him. I am so glad you are being preventative! ( hugs ) Thanks :) Have you had a CT and echocardiogram? NEVER thought i would have any health problems and got checked because my mom had surgery...

Biggest risk our doctor mentioned was weight loss.  Keep an eye on your diet, you may need to eat a bit more than usual or eat when not hungry. I was just more concerned with it amplifies issues with my heart, my diet/weight has been pretty good while on adderall just scared of it causing heart issues long term Bro you should not be dependent on a drug to do your job.  Either that workplace is fucked up, or you are in the wrong career.\n\n\nIt is not advisable for someone with marfans to take it. I may have exaggerated a bit to that, my job is great I am just not as productive So do not be as productive dudeski!  Your health is way more important than some job.\n\nCoffee and green tea (L-Theanine) are my \"adderall\".  Caffeine fuels the mind and L-Theanine relaxes it, they go very nicely together as a biohack. I am aware of this, I wish more than anything I liked coffee sounds so nice to have a warm drink to wake you up in the morning, I do take Ltheanine though. I just miss effortlessly getting through my work day but I guess I will have to deal with it, thanks for the reply! I think you need to talk this with your cardiologist. No one here knows about the pharmacological effects of adderall on your metabolism with marfan syndrome. I have ADHD and I am very controlling about how much and how I take my Adderall and luckily my doctor understands this and helps me out with it. I do not like XR because I feel I do not have control of how much dosage to get at once and I get a headache every time I have taken an XR. I am on 10mg IR twice a day (though sometimes up to 3, always monitoring my vitals as I take them). I break down the pills and take half every 30 minutes or so as I feel I need it and does not affect me. If I start to feel anything in my chest or a headache I either slow down or stop altogether. It is not as ideal as taking a large dose at once but it affects me a lot better. I also try to take at least 1-2 breaks a week so as not to get used to the dosage too much. If you do not already have one I would definitely recommend a watch that can monitor your heart rate, I am often checking it as I take my dose to make sure I am doing okay. \n\nI have been on it about 3.5 years now and I always make sure to get regular cardiology checkups and so far nothing has changed. I do of course also try other techniques that can help me without at least needing as much, but yeah adhd is a bitch. Lol Adderall has never made me feel as sick as a cup of coffee has and it is also never been as helpful. For people with adhd coffee does not have the same effect. This is exactly what I was looking for thank you. Oddly I only ever felt pain in my chest on the come down NEVER at its peak, you have not had any surgery for your heart have you? No I have not needed to have any surgery yet and neither the slight (barely there) prolapse on my valve or my aorta have gotten worse since I started the medication which I too was very fearful of. Because of the medication, however, I do try to see my cardiologist much more regularly and my psychiatrist does send me to have EKGs occasionally (which some of the newest smart watches do as well!) Fair enough, I am just throwing it out there because it worked for me I have ADHD and take several meds to avoid potential cardiac issues with Marfan. I take Wellbutrin, buspirone, and Adderall XR 10mg. The others do not affect the heart as much as the prescription methamphetamine allowing for a lower dose. I work night shift as well so it helps keep me alert during these wee hours of the morning. IANAD\n\nIt is more common than you may think; I am a software engineer and at my last job I found myself taking small doses adderall on a semi regular basis to stay concentrated on the more monotonous bits. I do not think I could have finished my work on time without it. Caffeine just is not the same.\n\nThe increase in blood pressure and heart rate from amphetamines is modest and short lived. Unlikely to cause an acute aortic event at therapeutic doses, but probably detrimental if taken every day, would be my guess. I would use it sparingly at the lowest effective dose.\n\n(I do not have Marfans, after some testing turns out I just have Joint Hypermobility Syndrome.) sorry to bother but fun fact: methamphetamine is a prescription drug, under the brand name Desoxyn lol. Correct. Adderall and Desoxyn are both methamphetamine. Actually, Adderall is a mix of equal parts racemic amphetamine and dextroamphetamine salts, while Desoxyn is a brand name for racemic methamphetamine. I was pointing out that my other non-stimulant drugs allow me to take a lower dose of stimulant since the therapeutic threshold is reduced. \n\nWhat was the point of your comment, exactly? Wow, I did not mean to be rude what so ever. I apologize for whatever set you off? I just thought it was mind blowing when I heard myself that methamphetamine was prescribed under the name desoxyn, so I thought I would share that. \n\nPS: Amphetamine is not Methamphetamine. Methamphetamine is a separate, much more potent drug. Although, methamphetamine is a drug in the amphetamine group of drugs, but not literally amphetamine itself. Adderall is filled with two isomers of amphetamine itself, levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine. So you could essentially call it prescription speed. I read my original post, and yes, I did mistakenly call Adderall methamphetamine. My bad. I do not mind being corrected when I make a mistake, but your \"fun fact\" and \"lol\" were seen as rude. \n\nWe are all about helping each other in this sub, so I also apologize for being rude. Take care, brother, and good luck in all of your endeavors! I apologize. I literally thought it was a fun fact, and a funny thing because of drug stigmas tied to methamphetamine, as well as amphetamine. And cool. I am all for that, since we are essentially a group of people who all have similar genetics! (Idk exactly how genetics work, so if I made a mistake there please correct me) I am all for learning new things, especially when it comes to stuff that applies to us and our health!

Was not inherited from me or my wife. A spontaneous mutation. It scares me to death that his childhood may be dramatically impacted by the findings.

I was just told I have a slightly enlarged aorta 4.2cm and it seems like I have marfans.\n\nI had an echo in 2015 say it was 3.7cm\n\nI was told by my cardiologist that a lot of times aortas stay stable and surgery is not ever needed.

Mine as been around 4.3cm-4.6cm for a decade.   Depends on the accuracy/type of imaging, measured at the root of the aorta. Are doctors saying you need surgery? How careful do you have to be with exercise? Do doctors say it could stay the same and not grow? yes! my moms has stayed stable for most of her adult life. That is good to know. My mom has been 3.8 supposedly for at least ten years. She is 70 now. Mri now says I am at 3.7 or 3.8 still. Reassured me but then cardiologist also said contours if my aorta look like marfan.", "Echo was okay? Still hesitant to exercise? I recently had an echocardiogram done and my cardiologist said that the aorta was normal. He did say something about the electrical currents of my heart that he noticed from my ekg and I have a stress test scheduled with him in a week. I have a DNA test scheduled for next month. \n\nI was wondering if other people on here who have physical signs of Marian's, but had the \"ok\" from their cardiologist, have felt confident exercising and exerting themselves with strenuous activities (weightlifting, basketball, biking, running). Ever since learning about Marfans, and discovering I have the body type of someone with Marfans, I have been really nervous about going back to my normal level of high phycial activity. Just looking to hear what some of you may think.  If you have an off rhythm you may want to wait based on that, not so much for marfan paranoia. Of course, if your doctor thinks it will be okay then they will know best, but it does not hurt to take a couple weeks off to get your stress test results back. There are people who have had heart attacks and other forms of unexpected, fatal cardiac events due to abnormal rhythms during exercise, and there are all sorts of disorders that are *way* more common than marfan that could cause it.\n\nBetter safe than sorry, right?  So, welcome to the 'fun'.  While they are some things that are overtly difficult (chronic pain for some folks), a lot of Marfans's involves things that you should not worry about, but keep an eye on it, but do not worry, but it is important to watch... you get the idea.\n\nEvery case is different, and more the point, every person is different in the risks they are willing to expose themselves to.  You will have to work with your doctor to understand your limitations and when you feel they may be over cautious vs when things are incredibly important.  It is a strange process, and takes years (although I will add this kind of agency will serve you well for non-marf related health issues as well as make you a better advocate for loved ones).  It is always good to talk to people here.  You will find there is a wide breadth of what people can do, and what they do that maybe they should not but do anyway.\n\nTo the point, the \"big no's\":\nIsometric weight lifting is very bad.  Isometric excersizes are anything where you have to strain a lot for relatively little motion.  In human terms this means anything where the *point* is to strain yourself to lift.  When you do this your blood pressure skyrockets (you are pumping all that blood to those muscles).  This puts an enormous strain on your aorta, and if you do it as a matter of habit (like getting into a heavy lifting routine), it will kill you.  If you have been doing this, do not worry about any damage it may have done; you are being monitored now and this is one of those \"cumulative effect\" things.\n\nContact Sports:  This is another big 'no'.  What constitutes a contact sport is again going to be different for each case.  What I was told from my doctor is he did not want to see me trying out for a basketball team, but I playing with my friends was fine.  Again, its a cumulative thing.\n\nWith all this being said, I think it is enormously important to continue pushing your body, developing a sense of what it *can* do not just what it *cannot*.  Many outdoor activities serve you well in this department.  Hiking, kayaking, etc.  Backpacking is a mixed opinion, but I did plenty.  Climbing is excellent, but is again a mixed opinion.  Also shooting sports and/or hunting are a great way to get out and get some miles under your feet if that is your thing.\n\nAnd then there are the stupid things you may choose to do anyway.  Personally, I ride an on/off road motorcycle.  I occasionally have to hoist all 500lbs of it upright, and with three ribs that are not connected to anything after surgery, if I ever get in an accident my odds are not as good as other folks.\n\nThe point is, there are risks, but it is not good for ones physical or mental health to be a couch potato either.  Your body has limitations.  Everyone is does, yours are just different.  Pushing yourself physically is important, and you may have to do it differently than others, but, in my opinion, it makes it all the more rewarding.\n I greatly appreciate this post. If I have a good echo, and my DNA tests come back negative (appointment is next month), am I officially in the clear to do whatever I want? I still feel unsure if this is the case because I read that Marfans can develop later in life. I have nearly all physical characteristics (except dislocated lenses) and I am nervous that some doctor will.tell me everything is ok and then I wind up at the gym killing myself from trying to beat my personal best lifts.\n\nThe problem is... I like being active, going to the gym, playing sports with my freinds, etc. But I am also nervous to spontaneous die from a burst aorta. I also have gotten into lifting as it has helped me, for once in my life, feel a little bit better about my body image.  Was there something that prompted the initial look into marfans?\n\nFBN1 mutation or not, it may make sense to keep an eye on things.\n\nThe heavy weight lifting is going to be a conversation.  Like I said it is one of the big \"no gos\".  But do not give up on things to help with appreciating your body.  Swimming (although I always sucked at it) can help put on some bulk. 10 years ago my GP thought I had some of the Marfan's characteristics and sent me to a cardiologist. I was 19 at the time and could not be bothered with going to the doctors or generally giving an ounce of care to anything involving my health. The cardiologist said he thought I was fine, so I went on my way. I do not know why, but about a month ago the thought of Marfan's popped into my head. I am almost 30 now. I am very big on following my intuition and so I followed up with it by scheduling appointments with necessary doctors and reading a lot about Marfan's. Through reading and learning I found that I have every physical attribute other than dislocated eye lenses. I have long arms, a concave chest, long fingers, high pallet, unexplainable stretch marks (i am very skinny), collapsed lung, scoliosis. \n\nIs heavy-weightlifting a no-go only if the gene comes back positive - or just in general for people who exhibit Marfan's characteristics? \n\nIt seems like even if I am \"cleared\" I still have to be careful???? This is frustrating for me.  I have not gotten the genetic test.  Im about your age, and when I was diagnosed  (age 3), it just was not really a thing yet.\n\nYou are going to have to work with your doctor.  The other symptoms could be indicative of a connective tissue disorder.  If your aorta has shown signs of enlargement I would say that is a clear \"no\", but the tricky thing is it may not.  Mines never grown.\n\nAlso, probably a good idea to see your cardio for imaging once a year.  I had a valve repairs done a few years ago.  I was moving less than half the blood I was supposed to with each pump.  The crazy thing is I felt much, much better after surgery but if you had asked I would not have said I felt bad before surgery.\n\nBut specifically on the weights: if I were in your shoes I would not, but you are going to have to decide that for yourself.  I am not sure what one could look at for \"quality of connective tissue in their arota\", but a doctor might.\n\nAnd again, you can and should stay physically active.  Unfortunately it is the kind of weight lifting that helps you bulk up that is the one you should not do.  I know that sucks.  Being slim there is nothing cooler than seeing your body bulk up.  I was only able to replace that feeling with things that were \"acheivmentments\".  Big mountains.  Big climbs.  River crossing and long disntances on the bike.  Things I had to condition my body of and could be proud of.  It is not the same but it does help. I am in the same boat. Was advised to go outpatient to both a cardiologist and geneticist. I am not allowed to workout at all cause my heart goes crazy for hours. How old are you? \nWhat size was your aorta? \nDo you have Pectus? \nMy aorta stayed the same size from 19 till 32 and then it started to swell.  As someone going in for an echo on Monday (even without it, I think I have enough of the other manifestations for a diagnosis under the pre-2010 diagnosis criteria), I wanted to say your comment is both encouraging and a bit disappointing.\n\n  \n\n\nAfter years and years of trying to figure out the source of my chronic pain, inability to exercise, and other weird health stuff, it is encouraging to know I am not alone (assuming tests come back confirming Marfan's)... But it would be really nice if it was something with a clear and achievable resolution...\n\nOh well, diagnosis first then I am sure I will be digging farther through the archives here and asking questions to figure out what life looks like moving forward.", "Partner seeking advice Hi you all, I am a lurker my partner has marfans so I often find myself here. I am not sure if anyone\u2019s also experienced this but he is had a dissection of his descending aorta and a valve repair (able to spare his and did not have to have a replacement) so he has a scar on his chest (concaved also) from that and from the dissection it starts on his back left lower shoulder blade and curves around him to his side. Because of those scars anytime we are in a car he has a lot of discomfort especially on rough road and when we hit bumps. I try my best to keep it as smooth as possible but our city has god awful roads. Has anyone else experienced this after surgeries and have any recommendations? We try to have him hold a pillow and it helps a little bit but not much. He is a couple years out from surgery now but the discomfort in the car is still the same and I just want him to be as comfortable as possible. Appreciate any and all help thank you!", "Do I have marfans... ...is the new unofficial title for this subreddit. \nAs a side note, I am at 3.9 after last echo guys, wish me luck for my end of year echo. Is it just me or does everyone else get nervous towards year's end when it is been a while since last echo/MRI and you are basically riding that potentially rapid expanded aorta semi-blind. Will feel way better cone January.\n\nAlso, serious question; how much do you guys pay for your echos? With all the healthcare changes these last few years, I have had to change insurance provider and am scared about the bill... I am hoping for under 1000. Out of curiosity, how much is an echo with and without insurance? Thankfully for me in Europe, the echo is free :) good luck though in your echo, hope you have good news Echo is also 'free', so cannot comment on that - Canuck here. But I empathize with the other point hard. Always used to get sooo nervous in the week leading up to my echo, as mine did not want to stop growing on a yearly basis for whatever reason. Having surgery was actually more reassuring in some ways than watching it every year for the last decade! I usually pay $600-700 for my yearly echo and ekg if I have not met my deductible.  Wow, that is quite a lot.  It is, but piece of mind is worth it. I have hovered around 4.5cm dialation for years - just on the cusp of needing to have the aortic root replaced. It is beyond important to keep tabs on it regularly.  Since my dissection I have had pretty bad anxiety about the small part of my aorta that has not been replaced yet, especially around echo or CT time.  Luckily (using that term loosely), I have to have a CT and an echo every year, so I stagger them by 6 months, makes me feel safer.\n\nI pay about $1800 after insurance and everything. Surgery is very much worth not having to worry about it as much anymore. I was always a train wreck going in to my echos. The one time I was calm and not worried ended up being the appointment where I was told I needed heart surgery... \n\nWell, no more nerves now! Surgery sucked but at least I never have to worry about tearing again.  Pretty much everyone else joins this exclusive sad anxiety club. December marks the 9th year since my surgery and I do biannual CTs in July, which usually is enough to make me lose the plot a bit. This year though, in April, my brother (also marfans) suffered a dissection and they found a 10cm aneurysm in his abdominal aorta. Long story short, he died in May - longest two months of my life, that wait till my check-up in July. Everyday was a seesaw between \u201cI am ok, I feel ok\u201d and \u201csomething is going to burst, I am going to die too\u201d. But things are ok (welp, apart from brother still dead), so now it is back to the vicious anxiety cycle for next two years.  \n\n\nI am in Singapore tho, we have healthcare but it still is not cheap. I had to pay $650 for a full CT, and it is been rising every year too. Inflation is fun yay. You are right it is important. Puts things in perspective though, I have complained about paying for hospital parking fees before when my actual healthcare is free. Does not make much sense to worry about $10 when my visit could cost me hundreds elsewhere.  I definitely had a jump from 3.9ish to 4.5 and then showed up 5.5 on CT. I do not want to scare you but I am just saying I was totally fucking unprepared for it, I never had anxiety going in during the last ten years. I am 8 weeks post surgery and everyone on here was so reassuring that the surgery was going to be worth it. I am a little concerned about what damage being on the receiving end of a lightning strike has done to me. I feel alright, but... Agreed 100%. On the mental health side, I feel MUCH better than I did before surgery.  Bingo. Soon as I recovered from the surgery, the worry was gone. Looking back I almost wish I had done it sooner.  Hope you are doing well! 4 months post-op here. Notice any change in the worry about it all? Yeah I definitely feel better after... I know this was the right choice. I am about 8 weeks post surgery at this point so still healing but mostly back to normal.  That is is really unlucky. What were you doing at the time you got hit? Milking cows. It struck the pole in the yard and came surging into the barn. I have lost several cows to heart attacks since. \n\nOddly, I know another farmer that was struck in a very similar way a couple months later.  Do they ever let you lift weights or do normal activity again after surgery?\n\nOr is it just a permanent fact of your existence that you are not allowed to do any strenuous activity ever? Lifting weights is pretty much out of the picture, normal activities are fine though. :/ So there is no procedure to allow you to lift weights?  \n\nThat is disheartening.  Weightlifting is my true passion.  Went to the doc a couple months ago, said my aorta is minimally dilated and that i may have marfans. Unfortunately, no.  If you do have Marfans it is not only your aorta that can be at risk for dialation, especially if you are lifting heavy weight.\n\nI feel you, I used to lift 4 days a week and loved it, but it is not worth dying young for.", "I am getting really irked at all of the misinformation / ignorance about MFS that exists. On a recent, trending post about a famous actor with MFS there was comment after comment (with hundreds of upvotes) of people saying  things in the nature of our life spans being dastardly low, that we all look extremely skinny / tall, low quality of life, etc. and I was very bugged about it. These people likely do not even have the syndrome but yet are speaking in absolutes about us. \n\nIt ruined my mood because the syndrome is a spectrum yet because of places like google images people assume that we all look sickly and ill. This cannot continue. There is never been a better time for us, not a foundation, or cardiologists, to speak on MFS. Especially when certain foundations write articles that treat and give off impressions of MFS being an absolute syndrome with little variability of health and aesthetics. Use your voice to speak when you can, or else others will.  \n\nFight that fight. Beat the aesthetics, if possible. Do not let people treat you harshly or spread misinformation about you. Sorry for the rant, but it was on my chest, thx.", "Will you know when ur Arota has a dissection? Idk if I am just worrying too much but I have an enlarged aortic root how do you know when you have a dissection ? I had sharp back pains, profuse sweating  confusion and an inability to use my legs and one arm. Keep getting your regular checkups, and do as your doctor says. You do not want to get *to* a dissection. However, if it happens you will know because it hurts a lot. I have an enlarged aortic root, too. I used to worry about it a lot, but it actually taught me something really useful:\n\nWhen I worry, it stresses my body. Stressing my body can stress my aorta. If I want to take care of my aorta, I should relax. Am I ok right now? Yes. \n\nI was diagnosed when I was 11, and I recently turned 40. My aorta's still good. I do recently had my annual appointment not to the surgery point but they did have a meeting about it in the future with a surgeon their and I will have a chest ct with contrast in 6 months and then see them in clinic I have stomach problems and confusion and lots of stuff going on lately but today I had random stabbing pains at work idk I guess I have just been worried about it after reading something about not feeling any pain with a dissection Thank you! You should get it checked out, especially if your blood pressure is not low and controlled. It is low I think 120/70 usually or 110/75 and conntrolled I have had the stomach issues and confusion and all the other problems for 2 months it was before my check up too and nothing on my echo or chest ct that is why I have been worried with the back pain from my stomach and bloating and everything I have been having anxiety about if I have a dissection I will not know it The sharp back pains are always so confusing to me because I have had two spontaneous pneumothorax and it was the worst, sharpest back pain to the point I could barely breathe because it hurt to move my chest. I thought I was having a dissection the first time it happened because I could not imagine anything worse. Severe pain, either in the chest or back or both. Depending on where/how it dissects it can and does cause rapid death. My father had a dissection start at the root up through the arch which cut off flow to the carotid arteries, he lost consciousness and died very suddenly. Dissection pain was worse. Could not find a comfortable way to die or lie without agonizing pain. Morphine was barely touching it. Okay so it will be severe pain ? That is my biggest concern with my marfans always having back pain or shoulder pain and with my stomach bloating lately My concern is not being able to tell if it were too happen I will more then likely be having surgery within the next year for arotic root repair 4.7cm from recent echo I am 19 and have usually 120/70 or 80 in my arms but my legs are always really high bp I have just had a lot of symptoms lately bloating pain in my upper right lower back sweating brain fog feeling like I am always in a rocking boat even when just trying to walk and some random chest pain so I have been worried that i had one and did not know Dissections are typically have very severe symptoms, and come on suddenly. There is usually not much warning. You will know when it hits you. Mine started out as a really really sharp headache, then leaded to stomach and back pain. Temporary vision lost and difficulty breathing were other symptoms. Like I said you will know when you have it, it is like any other pain you will experience. I am probably just over worrying I will have my surgery  within the next year more then likely so I will not experience a dissection but with the all things going on like my stomach bloating cold hands and feet back pain in the same spot pain by my upper right under my rib feeling like I am in a rocking boat waking up covered in sweat I was worried about it thanks a lot Take care of yourself \u2764\ufe0f, might be just over anxious do not think about it too much it gets in your head Thanks\u2764\ufe0f I have always been told the pain is severe. Personally, I would not know, I was 2 when my dad passed. But from what was described and what the doctors I have asked have said, it hurts a lot. \n\n I had a lot of chest pains (mild to moderate) before my surgery, now I rarely have any, and the pains used to worry me as well. \n\nSince then I have come to think (and this is just my opinion and idk shit lol) that the pain was due to the aneurysm itself. Perhaps all that extra volume taken up by an artery with a diameter of 5cm, that is stretched way beyond what it should be, is pressed and squeezed in places it should not. I dunno, just my thoughts on it. My aorta is synthetic and has a diameter of 2.5cm now, so it takes up a lot less room in an already concave chest and the pains I used to have are gone. Granted, the surgery hurt and took awhile to heal, but since then life's been pretty normal. Yea I am a fighter and young glad we have the tech and doctors to diagnose and treat it early I was a spontaneous mutation with marfans everyone else in my family fine I started having racing heart in 7th grade and panic attacks for no reason and that is how they found it even tho it was unrelated to my heart but I do not know how my marfans was not diagnosed earlier for heck sake I look like slender man lols What size was yours time of surgery just curious I will probably have my surgery here soon in the near future my cardiologist said and my echo showed 4.7cm I had a dissection. Trust me. You will know. Appreciate it I am not going to stress it anymore I will have my surgery before my dilated arota root gets to that point where it is a huge risk Where your aortic root already dilated ar 11? My daughter has just been diagnosed at 10 and already has a z-score of 3! I did not know till 8th grade and it was 4.2cm when they found it thank you for your reply. I am sorry, my question was for Long_Tall_Downturkey. I put it at the wrong place.\nIn any case, it reassures me to see that my daughter is not the only one to have a significant dilation before adulthood and that the operation can still take place only at the (young) adult age. 5.2 I had the same issue with the pneumo where I could not lay down, but thankfully they were able to treat it quickly (once the ER finally realized that it was not just muscle pain at least but that is a whole other story). I cannot imagine the agony of a dissection and then having the pain of post surgery. Omg same here! I was having weird back pains for a little while until it suddenly got so much worse and I was crying so bad thinking the time had finally come\u2026 luckily it was easily fixable and *not* my worst nightmare \ud83d\ude05 I have had three pneumothoraxes total and now I know what it feels like so I do not panic as bad haha Indeed. In my case, they decided not to operate and just medically manage it, as the tears folded back on themselves and formed a loose seal which gradually healed. Also, the tears were so extensive and were in a bizarre zig zag formation which they considered too risky to repair surgically.", "Marfans??

But then Marfan\u2019s was not as known and no-one knew he had anything wrong back the and at least now it is better known.\n\nKind Of sad but his Mum blamed my mum for his death so it took like 10 years before she accepted things and started talking to us too. \n\nBut still, I now try to make the most of things, which is why I tend make jokes of a lot of health stuff since I prefer to be laughing than crying. We have a lot in common, unfortunately. My dad also passed from an aortic dissection when I was just 2, he was 25, and like you I thought I would not live past that either, but I turn 40 before the end of the year. Similarly, my last appointment was canceled for lockdown and I have not been seen since. Just keep yourself healthy and make regular appointments to get checked for heart issues and you will be fine. I did not need surgery until my mid 30's and I grew up with issues. I guess when you are so young and grow up never knowing him, it is slightly easier but I work part time in an events venue and people often come in, recognise me and start telling me what he was like. \ud83d\ude1e\n\nBut yeah, the lack of checkups is bugging me but at the same time I would rather stay away from hospitals right now. So it is one of those things you cannot win either way. \ud83d\ude21\n\nBut it is been stable for years so I figure so long as I do not do stupid stuff hopefully it stays as it is. I am single, no dependants, no-one will really miss me, so meh, whatever happens\u2026 so long as I do not die screaming like my passenger! \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude0f Sitting there like that it is not obvious at all Hey thanks a lot! Things like these feel really good to hear! Regardless of yes or no less than 1% of the population even knows what marfans is. As for appearance wise you look old for 18 but otherwise look like a normal dude. Keep ur chin up g No it is not obvious because most people do not know what Marfan Syndrome is- so it would not jump out to anyone that you have a genetic condition. You look tall and thin/slim-- until my teen son was referred for a genetic test, I thought he looked tall and slim too (a little too slim). There is a wide range of \"normal\" in the general population when it comes to all kinds of things, including body type. Bro, yes i would recognise you as \"one of us\" on the street but then again, who gives a fuck! I cannot tell brother!! Honestly man in the photo you just look regular thin It is not. You are a cool guy! (I look similar to you btw!) :-) dude you are hot Hey bro it is not obvious to me, you are a good lookin dude and I do not see anything about you that you should feel self conscious about. Good luck man Thank you so much my dude \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb", "How worried should I be? My 13 year old son has marfans. I am really getting worried... His aorta is 4.4 cm and he is still growing! I do not know if I am looking for help or just someone to comfort me.. Are we going to lose him?", "Should I ask for a cardiology referral? I am very concerned that my 17 yo son may have Marfan\u2019s. We are seeing his PCP this afternoon.\n\nShould I ask for a referral to see a cardiologist right away?  \n\nI am worried his MD will be quick to dismiss my concerns because he views me as an anxious mother. Try to address your concerns to your son\u2019s PCP. If PCP denies possible Marfan\u2019s, try to ask a second opinion from another PCP. If you would want assurance, you may try asking your son\u2019s PCP for a referral to a cardiologist. \n\nUsually, signs of Marfan\u2019s show from the auscultation of the doctor (a heart murmur, perhaps) to which the PCP may refer you to a cardiology or ask for further testing such as an echocardiogram. Thank you for your response. I am very worried. He has many of the physical characteristics and I just found a report from a Neurologist when he was 4.\n\nHe had hypotonia at that time, and the doctor said a connective tissue disorder could not be ruled out. He suggested genetic testing, but my son got stronger with physical therapy and he was a hard blood draw, so we never followed up. Insist instead of asking, an echocardiogram will give your family the peace of mind deserved... Great, I will ask for that. Thank you, this is exactly why I posted here, was not sure how/what I should ask for. \nOur appointment is at 12\ud83e\udd1e UPDATE:  So, his pediatrician said \"every mother of a tall, lanky teenage boy thinks their son has Marfan's, and in the 25 years that I have been practicing, I have never had one. It is extremely rare\u2019\n\nBUT\nhe agreed to measure his wing span, and it measured the exact same as his height (74 inches).  So, then he said he would refer us to a geneticist.\n\nI asked about a cardiac work up and he said he would let the geneticist decide if that is warranted.  \nIs this how most people are diagnosed, through a geneticist? There is a clinical diagnosis, which is typically based on physical traits, but the only way to know with 100% certainty is by genetic testing. \n\nI am unsure if you are in the US, but genetics take anywhere from 3-9 months to not only be tested, but then get in to see the doctor who will give you further information. My son's pediatrician said the exact same thing when he was 13. She is never had a Marfan patient and she would referred a few in her career.\n\nShe has one now.\n\nWe were referred to a cardiologist/geneticist appointment. Our local hospital does it all in one appointment. He met the criteria so they proceeded with the blood test. We found out 3 months later that he officially had it. Trust your gut. The geneticist will be your best bet. I got my test results within a couple of weeks. Also, as someone else mentioned, if the PCP will not order an echocardiogram, look into getting a second opinion. I would be looking for a new PCP, too. Thank you all for replying, I find your reposes very helpful:) I have one more question.\n\nThe PCP also seemed to minimize my concerns. For instance, when I asked about cardiac side effects/exercise, he said \"No, you should not worry. Michael Felps has it and he won the Olympics\"\n\nIs this true? I have read things online like 'shorter life expectancy' and 'annual heart monitoring'.  Parents of children who have it, do you just worry everyday?  or are these just extreme cases? We are monitored bi-yearly at this point but he is in heavy puberty/growth mode (16.5 now). My son does have aortic root enlargement and takes Losartan daily to try and slow the growth. We go bi-yearly because he is had small growth the past year and they are just keeping a very close eye on it. He does not play any sports (but hates them anyway) but has been unable to even take PE class since 7th grade. Just as a precaution.\n\nThe geneticists and cardiologists will determine if they even need to proceed with a blood test, generally in order to get to that point, there needs to be cardiac involvement or family history.\n\nMichael Phelps is often thrown out as having it. He denies it. His doctors deny it. He definitely looks as through he has a connective tissue disorder of some kind to me but I would take your PCP's advice with a grain of salt. I have taught his pediatrician some things because I have done research on my own since it affects my kid.\n\nAbout the worry. It is listed on all of this school information that if he ever comes into the office and complains of chest pains or having a hard time breathing (he is also had a spontaneous pneumothorax) they are to call an ambulance immediately and then call me. You cannot help but worry. I have relaxed in the 4 years since diagnosis but all it takes is him saying something feels weird and I am on edge.\n\nThere is a wonderful Facebook group that is way more active than Reddit is. They can answer all your questions. Thank you!", "Good retail stores for Male fashion? I have marfans and one of my biggest struggles is finding clothing that fits well. I have always been the guy who just wears t-shirts, but I am starting my career and I have been told that I have to dress in business casual/business attire.\n\nI am having a really hard time finding blazers and suit jackets that fit, and I am on a budget until my first paycheck comes in. \n\nThe only reason I am asking for retail is because I have moderate scoliosis and if the clothing is not well-fitted then it exaggerates the look of my scoliosis. I am not sure if they will have the level of formality that will suit you (pun totally intended), but I have found that Kohl\u2019s has longer length clothing which allows me to get smaller, and consequently better fitting, sizes. It would probably help to tell us your area/region. I will definitely check out Kohl's tomorrow! I am in North Carolina, USA Www . Americantall . Com when you can afford it. They design for 6.3 to 7.3 and for skinny as well as not skinny. Great quality but not cheap. Also for pants try ae.com as you can get smaller waist with long inseam and Nordstrom Rack has dressy shoes up to size 18. Good luck. Let me know how it works out for you! Thanks for letting me know about American Tall! I might form a slight shopping addiction when I can afford it lol We order online for pretty much everything because even chain stores that have tall sizes do not tend to keep a lot on hand.  Lands End and LL Bean have business casual tall clothes (Lands End has some long sleeve buttons ups now for $20 with size 37 sleeves).  ASOS has great clearance and they ship really fast (like 2 days arrival times).  Another option for an inexpensive blazer is to hit up a thrift shop/ebay for one that will mostly fit and just take it in to get the sleeves let out as much as possible.  Good luck!  It takes time but you will get there with a good wardrobe. Thanks for all the suggestions! I think I will probably get a blazer from a thrift store and get the sleeves altered, like you suggested. It seems to be one of the cheaper options I hope it works out!  I have not taken one for awhile but I feel like it was $20. It could have been 40, but I am going to be optimistic today. Being tall and skinny is definitely hard. With suits definitely go to a tailor for alterations when after you buy them. Always a must, but even more important for us.\n\nLevi's stopped selling their extreme skinny jeans and it is impossible to find my size (29x34) anywhere. Luckily I have a few pairs but they are fading :( I know how you feel. I found the perfect pair of Jean's at a Ross like 5 years ago, and I have yet to find another pair that fit so well. It can be so frustrating lol In the UK, ASOS have a very good tall section. Trousers up to 38\" leg and various skinny/slim ranges. You and my husband share measurements, and we have always had luck at JC Penney, of all places. He works in a business casual environment, and we have always been able to find suitable clothes for him there. Thanks for the input! I went to JC Penney and found some great pants for a good price I live in Europe I wanted a suit saved 1k to get a half decent suit, none fitted then someone suggested to go to Thailand and get it tailor made 1k down and I have had a wonderful week in Thailand and three quality tailor made suits. Can recommend it, really. I have started ordering DC pants from their website. I am about a 28/32. They fit well and I grab them on sale around 25.00 a pair.", "bleb removal lung surgery on my left lung and know 2 years down the road I have bleb on my right lung same spot they want to consider another surgery for it but my Arotic root has reached 4.7 cm and they are talking another chest ct scan in 6 months do I say yep let us do it get it removed Because of Arota root repair surgery in the near future they said I am not quite at the cut off but their going to have a meeting with a surgeon their and then let me know and also why did my ct with contrast show 5.3 cm but they said it looked more like 4.9cm but it was 4.7cm on my echocardiogram", "Those of you with Marfans that were once skinny and since gained weight, are you more happy with your body? Is it harder to notice your Marfan qualities? How hard was it to gain weight? Are your legs and arms still skinny or do they have mass on them? \n\nI am asking because I recently started going to the gym and eating tons, I also got the thumbs up from my cardiologist that I can keep working out with the same intensity as before I was diagnosed. I have gained and lost weight in the lasy 7 of so years, going from around 90pounds to about 165 at my heaviest. Gaining the weight was horrible for me, it put added stress on my hips, knees, and back, and was not good for my heart. I gained the most weight throughout my stomach, causing me to be asked if I was pregnant more often than I would like. My arms and legs filled out to a point where you could not see the separation in my bones and I did not look quite so gaunt.\n\nI am currently hovering around 120-135, depending. and I would say over all I probably look better than I have ever. Almost everyone I have run into over the last 3 or so years have all told me that I look \"absolutely amazing!\" so there must be something to it. Ah yes.. the same effects on me gaining weight as well.. I have gained in the last 4 years and I am unable to shed, partly because I am not able to exercise as much and I have an emotional eating problem \n\nThe stress on my back can be felt every time. The pain is now my motivation to lose weight.. Hope I could shed some pounds steadily over the next year or so I put on 25 lbs of muscle.  I went from very thin to thin.  The most difficult part was eating enough - make sure you are above you are TDEE by 300-500 calories a day.  The length of my arms and legs still make them look skinny even wth the additional weight.  \n\nWeight gain did not change how I felt about my body.  What changed my opinion was simply maturing and realising it did not matter what people thought.  I am  a healthy weight and as I get older my peers increasingly are not. Best of luck to you! You can definitely do it, I am not sure about you, but I never learned proper nutrition or how to limit what I eat since I was not ever able to gain weight as a kid/teen, and that is been the most difficult thing to break myself of/learn to correct. I went from 108 to ~150 in about 18 months.  Lot of different factors that made it so that was possible, I had tried for years previously.\n\nI am generally happy with my body.  I have noticed that if I dont at least so some bodyweight work I get a gut on a skinny frame.\n\nBut generally, it is great.  My posture has improved, my clothes fit better, and with \"reserves\" for my body to run on I do not get as tired.\n\nI will say, pushing 30, I have started to notice some things that worry me.  If I do not do my stuff, my back hurts and then some.  Some or that is getting older, but with the fairly mild stuff I do I think it is partially marfans. Loving your body is the most important part.  It is weird, the kind of confidence that comes from that is magnetic, in my experience.\n\nThat being said, when I put on a few lbs I was AMAZED how much better my posture was, specifically when sitting.  Turns out chairs work better when you have a tush! I guess a part of my problem is also that I have never gained any weight until I was 23.. So I was free to eat anything I felt good with.. Now I am not sure where to draw the line between nutrition and over eating.. I did try to work with nutritionists but I realised that our near normal lives are much different than the normal ones and their advise is not something I could follow even though I was willing to.. \n\nI am trying to build my own plan, allowing a steady pace to check if it is working.. It sure will be slow but I have hopes.. Thank you \u2764\ufe0f How tall are you? And how long did the 25lbs take? What were you doing wrong in your first attempts to gain weight? And what did you change? Only 5'10, so relatively short.  A year, give or take a few weeks. It takes 3500 calories to gain a pound. This is in addition to your TDEE (maintenance calories where you do not lose or gain weight taking into account your regular activities or food eaten.\n\nThat is most likely 3500 a week since your TDEE + 3500 is more than likely too much food to eat in a day. It may also be bad for your body. \n\n500 a day over TDEE would equal 3500 at the end of the week, that is 1 lb. I had surgery, and, to be honest, started an anti-depresant (mitrazapine) that increases appetite.\n\nSerotonin plays a huge role in regulating gut activity.  There is also a huge feedback loop between heart health and mental health.  Basically, both these are critical systems (eating and circulation), so you have evolutionary hardwiring that makes you sit your ass down if, for instance, your heart is not doing well.\n\nI will also say post surgery my testosterone was clearly higher.  I will spare you the gory details but it was like puberty at 30.  I put on muscle easier than when I was climbing 5 days a week. I went from 119lb to 135lb (about 54 to 61kg) at 5'11\" (about 180cm) - I am a bit upset about having a little belly and I do not like having boobs again, but I am enjoying the thighs and butt. \n\nI wish I could be a little more fit but my current condition and schedule is not much allowing it. Definitely. I gained 20-30 pounds when I started on my birth control pills. The main difference is that people never say I am \u201cso skinny\u201d anymore, and my body look better and more proportional. In clothes anyway \ud83d\ude02 I am only 15 but am gaining decent weight through body weight exercises. Not my goal to be big but simply healthier and the size has come as a secondary. But what I have found from having a nice physique with marfans is I like how my body shape is different. The long limbs and torso give me a bit of uniqueness to other guys. Plus it makes me a great swimmer:) Yeah. I struggled with Marfans and am eating disorder but have since gained 70 pounds. I feel great I can no longer see my ribs and I can wear a bikini. I know that your change will not be as dramatic but it made me feel a lot better I actually have never been skinny before I been obese/overweight for a long time I still need to lose 20-30 pounds to get healthy bmi", "What is the success rate for arotic root replacement? I am 19 and will have surgery soon as it is enlarged I am just kind of scared ", "Can I ride rollercoasters? I already have a trip booked to go to a theme park and I have ridden rollercoasters before, however it has come to my attention that it might not be the best idea if you have Marfans. My aorta is ever so slightly enlarged but nowhere near dangerous territory and my mitral valve is a little relaxed but again not in a dangerous territory. Do you think I will be fine riding them? Thanks From my understanding, the riskiest aspect of riding rollercoasters for us has to do with our eyes. The g-force puts strain on the eyes which could lead to retinal detachment. I am not sure if there has ever been a document case of detachment due to a roller coaster but i personally would not risk it but you also could be totally fine. Oh okay thank you yeah I am not in dangerous territory either but I stopped going on the more aggressive roller coasters since diagnosis. I just do not see the point in risking it. It is never stopped me, I have had two valve replacements and eye problems. The worst is the older, wooden coasters that jostle you around because well... they are old. And those would only make my back sore. Otherwise I have never been told to not go on them. Just to know my own body limits.\n\nWherever you go, I hope you have a great time! It will depend on your age and experience.  I black out on roller coasters now (albeit briefly). I think there is been 1 or 2.  That thing was going to detach anyway I am sure bc there is been detachments from intense yoga practice, running, air bag force etc.  I researched this and I try to avoid standing on my head, roller coasters and driving like a maniac. Not that hard.  I prob would not if I had more then 1 good eye left though. My retina surgeon says nope to rollercoasters.  I would do it if I was not already a retina surgeons patient tho. Ask your doctor. I also have mitral valve regurgitation but no other heart issues, and what I have been told is mild rollercoasters are fine, but do not be getting on anything crazy.  \n\n\nEDIT: we do unfortunately have a history of retinal detachment in the family, so maybe that is the reason for the above advice.

Though I am only 32 and my journey started late 80s early 90s, they did a ton of experimental shit with me as well. I was not supposed to see the age of four, but here I am today, a stroke under my belt, two valve replacements, rods in and out, heart failure, etc. I still have plenty of curious doctors but I am finding more practitioners seem to at least recognize marfans when I mention it (though most of the time you can just look at me and know).\n\nI am glad you are here to tell the tale and to have made things available to us who have come round later in the years.\n\nCheers my dude! My variant caused a malformed \"knuckle\" on ribs and sternum. My reconstruction was March of 1990. They opened me up, rebuilt rib cage and put rods and mesh in. Died for a few minutes, as I am told. Waking up on ventilator and my first experience with copious amounts of morphine in my system. Took a couple of years but I got back up. Found a rod that the doc left in 2 years after it should have been removed. As I said I lived, more broken bones than not, splints and so much PT I could probably teach others with connective tissue problems. Always get up. Fight ends when you are on the wrong side of the grass. \n\nAshes, you got the aorta troubles. In that, I was fortunate. You have had harder run in a shorter time than I have. I wish there there was more consistency of the related disorder(s). To you and others that may read this, live, fight and f\"*k pity. Eat, drink and be merry. I remember crowds of interns with stethoscopes on a few occasions - apparently my mitral valve I made quite a pronounced clicking sound. \n\nI must say they were very polite and respectful.\n\nHonestly, I think we are lucky. Everyone has challenges, but most people do their best to hide from their challenges until it becomes very difficult for them to adapt. \n\nWe have some pretty big challenges, but we know one a lot about our biggest ones, and we have actual professionals working hard on helping us. All we have to do is our best, which is all anyone can do anyway. It is quite incredible, actually. \n\nI also really believe that being clearly aware of my own mortality from a young age has made me appreciate life a lot. I discovered I was allergic to morphine directly after waking up from my mitral valve repair in 2001. \n\nBroken sternums and the dry-heaves do not make for a fun time hahaha!\n\nEdit: I got to say, it is kind of nice to swap war stories. No one else can really get it. I cannot fathom some events without potent pain medication. Here is more from spring of '90. \ud83d\ude02\n\nWhen I awoke in ICU I was led to believe there would be mild discomfort. The surgery as planned was supposed to be between 4-6 hours, took 14. I guess that is why body was shutting down. Too long under and too much trauma. They were doing pain management and checking a lot of things. An oversight was my bladder. I started to swell up and the body gets inventive. It turned my right lung into an auxiliary bladder. Catheter is such a vile word. I got the first in my boy. Why do they always bring in nursing students? The second was a life changing moment. If they say they need catheterization of a lung, demand to be unconscious. Its not a memory anyone wants. Back then it entailed shoving a surgical tube through ribs into your lung. Its worse if all your ribs have been sawed on and entire front half of rib cage is held together with surgical mesh and steel rods. They pumped me so full of drugs after procedure that at 11 years old I had my first trip or shock. The black dots on the drop ceiling turned into spiders until I drifted into  drug stupor. They did wheel to x-ray and had me stand for imaging. Total fluid: 1 quart 2 tablespoons of fluid. No, you do not forget a number such that as much as you wish it was not something you knew. Next day, lung drain removed, lung collapses and back on ventilator. You know, summer camp would be a better story and memory.\n\n\nAny votes on turning this into trauma and survival thread? Oh I am game for that. Now I am intrigued about what  your ribs looked like before reconstruction as that was something my doctors were suggesting when I was small (3-4, 91-92) to help my lung development and other things, my parents did not think they could manage dealing with that at that time (parents were very young) so they opted not too, then a few years later they brought it up again before it was 'too late' but my parents let me have some autonomy in surgeries that would not save my life or health in some way and I did not see the reason for it and then as a teen decided I wanted to do it but was told I would not make it off the vent since my lungs are already formed, so I have never gone back to the subject. But I have not seen someone with as severe case of pectus carinatum as I have with the added kyphosis. I have seen kyphosis like mine in people who are twisted up like a pretzel... But my scoliosis got bad super fast and then the rods had to be taken out prematurely due to it causing problems with a shunted tumor/Tarlov Cyst in my sacral spine, so that was a thing!\n\nI have been through a lot in my 32 years on this planet, a lot. A. Lot. But I am still here, living my life the best I can. For the amount of money for medical equipment that is gone into me, out of me, and has otherwise kept me ticking (fucking literally, man!), May as well get my damned money out of it. My ex always said 'you will likely out live is all and if that bullet is not silver you will not go anywhere.'\n\nI will have to upload one of my x-rays to share. It is one of my favorite things to use and an avi. Oh I cannot imagine. I am fortunate that the worst I have had with pain meds is that percocet gives me awful horrifying waking dreams that I cannot remember any details except for how incredibly uneasy it made me. I still feel as uneasy about that dream as I did when I snapped out of it. I will not take it ever again.\n\nI had a panic attack and took in way too much anesthetics before my first lens removal. It took 8 hours for me to be able to hold anything down. That instance is why anything that smells it tastes like black cherry/anise I end up doing everything in my power to not toss my tacos. Are you me? I had the same thing. I am always glad to welcome students into my rooms/appointments when they are doing rounds with new doctors. It is a great opportunity to teach them, and I feel most of them will not see a case like mine very often. &gt; Any votes on turning this into a trauma and survival thread?\n\n\nFully support that idea, this actually feels really good.\n\nOr maybe start a new one, and get the mods onboard? I like when Master Shake said, \"Highlander was a documentary.\" The friends that have been around me basically think I am a self-destructive lunatic. My spine had a slight curvature. It got better until I broke it a few times, now when I stand I lean forward a little. Not  bad outcome since spine doc said he was not sure why I was not dead or at least paralyzed. There was talk of a fusion c1-4, but best outcome being 50% loss of range of motion, I waited. Took 5 years for it to finally stabilize. And the doctor said he would have to send me to another because he did not operate on people with my condition.\n\nFunny mention about the silver bullet, a few years a0go I found a guy that makes live fire silver bullets, but was out of stock. A few days ago I got an email that they were back in shock.\n\nAnd surgeries and treatments, its cost a fortune to keep me alive. Anyone tired of being asked what their pain is on a scale of 1-10? Most of triage is based on generic human model. Nurse asked what I a 10 was to me. I replied, having my ribs ripped out and put on a table. Usually disbelief until I pull my shirt.\n\nAnd as we all vary in appearance and ability, I basically look like a grey alien had a kid with a gelfling.

I would say it is not overkill because it will ease some anxiety if he does not, and you cn start doing the right things for his health if he does. It sound like he probably does not, but the tests now are really quite easy. I do not know if he will need a referral or not, but I would do it. One afternoon to make sure your kid is healthy is well worth it. I agree. But in order for an echo to be done here where I live he has to  see a peds cardiologist Just to make the echo appointment. \nAnd because they are so rate, that takes a long time to get and then it will be another few weeks after that just to get the echo.\nIn the meantime we have so much worry as my son plays a very high-level/intensity sport and has some big tryouts coming up soon and now this is in the back of my mind \u201cwhat if\u201d he has Marfans. \nSo far he is cleared to play until further notice but of course now I am paranoid.\nAre they testing everyone now that is tall because from everything I have read he has hardly any symptoms except he is tall and lanky but still has more develop muscles than most 15-year-olds Nothing is overkill, you can never be too safe.  It sounds to me like he is fine, but it would not hurt to check, me and your son sound about the same except I am slightly taller and weigh a bit less.  I have only played in my sport for one year and my doctor recommends that I stop.  Again, would not hurt to try So you have Marfans? If you had no symptoms then how did you get diagnosed? He plays high level hockey which is very fast with lots of impact which he loves but this marfan \u201csuspicion\u201d has put a huge downer on him thinking now there is a chance he wont be able to play pro. . The only reason he is being checked It is because in  the sports physical the  number one question was \u201cdoes this player have any Marfan stigmata\u201d so yes, he is tall and can do wrist sign.Now its on his physical that he COuLD be Marfans so he is worried no team will want him. No I do have signs, the fingers around the wrist, thumb being able to touch the wrist, longer wingspan than height, concave chest, scoliosis, joint pain, back pain, and I have three heart valves that regurgitate, and I have done genetic testing, etc. My sport is tennis which involves a lot of quick movement.  It sucks that I cant play in school anymore but I probably will casually outside of school still.  If you son does have marfans, hopefully he does not, there is a separate tab on the marfan awareness foundation's website called Teen's Space.  On there they answer some questions that can help, like \"how do you deal with the fact that you cant play certain sports anymore?\" They bring up a good point with saying your doctor will really tell you which things you can and cannot do.  I will not tell you everything on there, you can read for yourself, it is really helpful. \n Marfans can exist on a spectrum , from showing all to no symptoms at all. He may be well off as you are saying, but it is good to test and see for any issues that may arise when he is older. My heart grew with me and I am stuck in a heart stage being 6'8 with an enlarged aorta that may correlate to height or my confirmed marfans. They are not sure which so it is vital for me to check in every so often to see changes. I have had this since I was 5, that is when I was diagnosed. However it is genetic and can be confirmed through testing. Defintely listen to everyone else saying is a safety precaution bc it very well is. Specifically for the scholeosis which if tied to marfans may or may not get worse when he stops growing. It is also possible that it randomly occurs in people so there is a chance he got it even though no one else related does. Sounds like he is just tall and lanky. It is good that they are checking for Marfan indicators to protect their players (and probably themselves). Unfortunately, if he is Marfan I am sure any doctor would confirm that hockey is a no-go.\n\nHe does not have many Marfan indicators so I would not worry about it, and if the doctor said he could play in the meantime they must not be too worried either.\n\nHope he gets the tests soon and the results he wants. Kids have died from heart issues were unknown, so it is better to check than to have him drop dead on the court/field. I think they are screening everyone, yes, that is how a lot of people I know have heard of it. Their kids are athletes and one of the screenings they do is a marfan screening. Your son just ticks a few more criteria than other kids.\n\nHe is probably fine since you guys do not have family history. I think this is maybe why they are checking athletes at the high levels now. It is probably a good thing but of course no my kid is a little freaked out as he trains hard almost every day Heres hoping but some of then do have spontaneous mutations that happen while the baby is being dormes. Having said that we have all heard of people having a heart attack on the court and probably most of them had something like marfans", "Has anyone been taking Resveratrol supplementation for Marfan Syndrome? Studies have shown that Resveratrol inhibits aortic root dilatation in MFS mice.  \nI am curious to know if anyone with Marfan Syndrome has had any experience with Resveratrol and whether or not it should be taken with Beta Blockers or Losartan I try to eat lots of foods high in natural Resveratrol like blueberries and raspberries, but I have never supplemented. In high doses the supplement can cause a small decrease in blood pressure, so if you blood pressure is already low from those other medications it might cause dangerously low levels.

I had several physical symptoms but just wanted to confirm. The thing is that since I got my result I became extremely depressed because I am affected by my body dysmporphia of being so tall and underweight accompained by the facial features. Added to this, my heart is not in the best conditions, nor is my spine. \n\nThe thing is that I am not longer excited for a life in which I am condemned to a body that I hate and to health issues that will make me suffer and eventually kill me in the future. Because of this I have become suicidal, which is new and shocking to me, I never despised my life before. \n\nThe reason for this post is to ask you guys what is your take on the syndrome regarding the life quality vs someone without the syndrome. I know I am exaggerating by being suicidal but it is just my initial reaction, I think it is a blessing that I have family, can walk, see, hear, taste, have all my limps and many other cool things. But still, I am in emotional pain like never before and I would really appreciate the insight of people who have already accepted the medical condition.

I think therapy could help you put things in perspective, so I hope you try to get help. I think that everyone has struggles. Like you said, some people cannot see or walk. I live a very normal and fulfilled life despite Marfan Syndrome. I do worry about the future, but I have family members who dropped dead in their 50s from this and others who lived into their 80s with hardly any issues. So it is different from person to person.\n\nGood luck and I hope you feel better soon. Dont let your health define you as a person. Plenty of the greatest people in history have succeeded despite their odds. Steven Hawking was one of the greatest theoretical physicist of our time, who lived with motor neurone disease for over 50 years, something that normally kills within a few years. Franklin D. Roosevelt upheld the United States presidency during the great depression and WW2, fixing the nation, saving the world, and winning 4 presidental terms, all while paralyzed from polio. Your body is not you, it is only an extension of your will.\n\nAnd yes, depression is a b**ch, pardon the language. It is all about finding ways of channelling it into something you can be proud of. Music, art, relationships, anything that can make you smile. People follow and support passion. \n\nYou can make it over the hurdle, I believe in you The way i see it is it drives me to do whatever the f i want with my life more (as in towards my purpose) bcs i are not got much time left in this world. \n\nMight as well make the most out of it before the ticking time bomb detonates right? I am 22 and have marfans, I was diagnosed at 3 so a bit different but you will still live a normal life man. Embrace it, shit sucks sometimes but we are unique.\n\nIf you want message me, as long as we know where our limits are our life is no different than the rest besides maybe a few more surgeries and more doctor visits but getting my heart checked is one of my favorite experiences At your age in this world you are likely to have a normal life with some minor stipulations. Start working out three times a week if you can &amp; keep to it forever. It will help with the depression &amp; the dysmorphia. It will also help with your heart health. Avoid weight gain no matter what as this will severely limit you in dealing with these things. Alcohol &amp; drugs will likely tempt you &amp; may provide a distraction but will ultimately fuck up your life in ways worse than marfan can. \n\nIt is not a death sentence even if your doctor says it is. Remember that. Everyday. Write it on a piece of paper &amp; hang it on the back of your door (or hang something that reminds you of this thought). Think about it everytime you see this. Only you can keep control of your mind. Good luck. You are going through a very traumatic time. It is a lot to  take in. I highly recommend getting to a counsellor asap.

What might help is some perspective - right now it may feel like you have woken up to a new world where you now have this new issue with yourself. But the reality is you are no different than you were yesterday, or the day you were born. You have always had marfan syndrome. You were born with it. Nothing has changed. The only thing that is different is that you know about it. And that is actually a very empowering thing because now you can better care for yourself.

After reading a lot of posts, it seems like people with marfan get a lot of sport-restrictions. Im a very active guy and imagining myself having to restrict activities and to stop completely after I get my aorta fixed is awful.\n\nI would like to know what workouts people do and what the options are after surgery? Look your lucky doctors know more about marfans now than they did when I was kid som 50 years ago you get to move forward with the knowledge gained from those who have gone before you I have out lived every prediction of how long I will live, I see no limit to the future so do not worry enjoy your life. *After* I had my aorta fixed, I took up training and fitness with (treadmill) running, weights, and machines. I did this to come in shape, and also because osteoporosis can be a side effect of Marfan's (it is in my case) and training strengthens the bones. \n\nDuring the Corona, I have been doing long walks and whatever training I can accomplish at home (e.g., plank, push-ups, crunches).\n\nWhile you should listen to your doctor's advice before the advice of folks on reddit, my cardiologist told me that any routine that I could do more than 15 times in a set was fine. But, this *really* depends how your particular case of Marfan manifests itself. Its nice to know that there are people who still stay active after surgery. IF i have marfan i must have a very mild case of it (no eye problems, no dialation, only mild heart valve issue and some marfanoid features) until the docs diangose i will keep my reps high enough, maybe 20+ range, thank you for answering! Yeah im the type of guy who overreacts, i should live my life and stop worrying so much about the future, but sometimes my anxiety consumes my mind completely but thank you for your answer Aerobic exercises are usually **strongly encouraged**.\n\nThe exercises that are strongly discouraged include any sports/exercise with extremely heavy weight lifting or risk of forceful body contact. Basically with Marfan Syndrome you do not want to get hit really hard in the chest or on the head (because of eye issues) - and you do not want to have such a huge sudden increase in blood pressure that can happen from lifting something extremely heavy if you have an aneurysm.\n\nI do light weight lifting and it is fine for me though.\n\nAlways check with your cardiologist though, they might have different advice depending on your specific situation. Thank you for answering! My I ask you in which state your health is? Are you post surgery and if not have they told you, you can continue after surgery? actually I did not end up getting surgery! I am not at the threshold yet!  \n\n\nIf my aortic aneurysm grows any more I will be getting PEARS surgery in the UK. \n\n  \nMy health is great.  \nI do not have my eyes natural lenses (had them removed) and I wear strong Proclear Multifocal XR contact lenses. I can see nearly 20/20 with them. I am really tall but other than this I do not have any other real day to day impairments. Be particularly careful with isometric exercises such as planks, push-ups, and crunches as retinal detachment is a real possibility during them.  A few users here have had their retinas detach from doing them as well. As for that, I suffered retinal detachments 40 years ago; lost sight in one eye and have the other retina securely fixed in place.\n\nBut thank you for highlighting this important concern.", "is it possible for short/average height people to get Marfans?

If people remark about your height/skinny body type, etc and how you \"managed\" to be like that, how would you respond? And relatedly, explain it to family/friends (as they might be unaware)?\n\nI first learned of the syndrome in a really strange way - I was at a party years ago where a friend of mine brought his girlfriend, a young doctor here in NYC - after pleasantries, she commented about my height (I am 6'7\") and asked in a kind of excited way about my hands. I had no idea what she was talking about, and I had never heard of Marfan's before. The conversation kind of died quickly, as her partner got visibly upset (but I was still ???). Of course later I learned what she was talking about, and rather belatedly, started getting tests done at the suggestion of my GP.\n\nIt goes without saying that that particular scenario is rare, but it does make me wonder.

You cannot detect Marfan by only using anthropometric signs, and the values you will obtain will vary a lot depending on the person making the measurements. How do you plan to address these issues? Actually, even with some degree of error there are particular ratios between those measures that are clearly abnormal in MFS, and to lesser extent in EDS with marfanoid habitus. So I guess more precise wording is to \u201cscreen for habitus very likely to be caused by MFS\u201d.  In any case, this is to improve the detection, and of course (like the Ghent score alone) cannot prove presence or absence of MFS.\n\nAs I said, this is to support the main data set, it is not the main data set ;) Just out of curiosity, are you affiliated with an university or a research program?

No muscles, just bones and some pretty deep wounds on his back and other bodyparts bc of very bad skin acne when he was a teenager.\nI am almost the opposite, 189cm, 98kg. A bit too heavy. \nBut we live together for almost 3 years now and we love each other from top to bottom. \nI do not care that he is very skinny and does not have the perfect body.\nHe does not care that I am a bit too heavy.\nWe love each other for our personality and character traits and I am sure you are going to find your big love aswell.

I went on a pretty intense weight gain diet for six months - I was having protein powder shakes every single day, clearing 3500 calories, working out and all I got was a fat stomach at the end of it. Someone took a video of me at Xmas and I was still as skeleton looking as ever. In fact I was almost shocked at how frail and thin I looked. It is just so much effort, time money to try gain weight as a Marfan. Exactly, it is sooo damn hard! So frustating when people simply say that we should just eat more! They have nooo idea. Are you diagnosed? &gt;LeonFan40\n\nconsistently consuming 3,5k calories every single day with workout and you made absolutely no progress??? Yep. If you check my post history you will see I used to make threads on the weight gain sub asking why I was not seeing results. I had a subscription of weight gain powder from Amazon delivered every 21 days which I drank daily with full fat milk on top of all my other meals and snacks. As for the work out I only used resistance band for light weight pulling stuff, but I look just as skinny as I did when I started. That is so odd, I know some other people with marfan who have managed to at least tone their body to look very well. Marfan's may be predisposed to difficulty digesting/assimilating as well. Proper digestion is more important than maxing calories...for what it is worth I find nitric oxide/atp boosters more effective for gaining weight/mass. Mostly body weight stuff with light free weights. Even got a compliment from a co-worker about being very \"vascular\". It is possible, just do not expect to pack on mass. Fit/healthy is the goal; not jacked. Ask your doctor to try angiotensin receptor blocker types of drugs for 1 month and see the result.(eg cozaar, aprovel, etc) these are high blood pressure medication. It works on me. And dont go small on these medication. Take the normal maximum dosage allowed..... bout to be 24. Feel the same way man. Already on heart medication though... I wonder how blood pressure meds helped you on your weight... that is really strange I turn 21 in two days.... always thought I would gain mass as I got older.... still waiting on it Thankfully i dont have marfans so severe.

Thank god for this community, should have joined years ago to vent my thoughts and relate to others. Keep your head up. Exactly! People here can be very helpfull..... You too man, best of luck! Thanks I am 25 and I am 110 pounds, so you are not alone. If anything, I AM the skinniest probably of all Marfan people, but my case is extraordinarily rare and severe (when it comes to the skinniness.) Damn... Hope you can get better someday I am predicting in my 30's I will get a gut, hopefully. I can imagine myself with one.\nMy right chest is kind of soft oddly enough. I can see it turning into gynecosmastia one day, not sure if the left chest will change because it is rock hard. Just try it. I dont understand the concept, but it works Late to the game, but just as a side thing. When my marfan husband and I met he was 6'6, 125lbs, and I thought he was gorgeous. Even if our friends made jokes about hearing our bones clanking when we hugged, since I was pretty thin too. \n\nHe was wearing a t shirt that said 'Chicks dig pale scrawny guys'. I walked up to him and said yes, yes we do. \n\nYou will find your someone. Definitely not late eheh. Thank you!! Hopefully someday. You will. Be as comfortable with yourself as you can be, find and do the things you enjoy, and the rest will fall into place. Mongo did not have the best self image, just happened to help a friend out at the theater I was performing at. Neither of us were actively looking. But if you do things you enjoy with people, you will find someone you click with. I am still amazed at how nice strangers from the internet can be! Thanks for the encouragement !! Hey I am a fellow Marfan and was wondering about the expense of therapy, having a pretty hard time and was looking for a therapist to deal with my depression.

Should I get a CT or Echo? I am paranoid about radiation and cannot decide which one I should go with. I would rather get an echo if a CT is unnecessary. But my doctor is pushing for a CT because he can see more areas of the aortic root. Which one did any of you decide to have and were the results satisfactory? If you have a large dilation an echo will easily catch it. No questions. A CT scan is beneficial in certain scenarios where things get more complex, but I expect for a simple dilation 'yes' or 'no', an echo will suffice. If it is in fact dilated significantly, then I would expect a CT to follow.  They do not do CT scans for fun. I got one done a couple of years back and it helped to augment the echos my doc does each year. I would not plan on doing regular CT scans, but they are a great addition to the suite of tests used to understand your unique needs. \n\nAn MRI gives an even more detailed look than a CT without the radiation - your doc might be open to that if you voice your concerns.  Echo. I just had surgery for a dilated aorta, I have had it for awhile but it finally crossed a threshold. Echo looks at the actual roots of the heart, a CT just looks at the bone structure. \n\nYou will need to get a CT if you need surgery. It shows your surgeon where to cut.\n\nIf you have any questions about aortic dilation, I am happy to answer them :)  Agree with the echo need, but you are way misinformed on the CT. It delineates arteries quite well, and is a crucial diagnostic tool pre-surgery for more than what you have described. \n\nLook up 'CT Aorta' and you will see this quite clearly.   In fact, a CT scan is a CT scan is actually generally considered a more accurate diagnostic tool for aortic root measurement than an echo.  My apologies. I am just reiterating what my nurse practitioner told me, which was that I needed a CT pre-op for my surgeon to know where to make the incision. I must have taken it as a structure need to know, not a artery need to know. Thank you for explaining more!  I always used to have to get MRIs because I guess I have big lungs that make it hard to see my aortic root on an echo.  \n\nNow I have to get regular CT scans because I have metal in my chest and cant get MRIs any more.  \n\nEcho will be cheapest and least detailed (and in my case was very difficult to actually see anything so was a waste)\nFollowed my CT\nFollowed by MRI being most expensive and most detailed (and without the radiation of a CT) Plus its quicker and doesnt involve a bunch of cold gel All good! I do not mean to come off as crass :). We Marfans guys and gals need to stick together, and I hope we are all as educated as we can be around these kind of things.  Very true! It is my favorite scan (it is sad I have had so many I have a favorite). \n An echo would do it just fine Its tge only one of the major 3 (echo, CT, MRI) I can still get, Its definitly the most convenient, I could do without the yearly radiation, but maybe we will get super powers! Funny how different doctors and different patients work. I do the yearly echo and MRI every two. Only CT I have had in the past 5 years was my one pre-surgery a few months ago.  My siblings are on the same schedule as you. I could still get an echo, but it never shows enough because my lungs get in the way.  I havent had an MRI since my surgury because of the wires around my sternum. Before my surgery I would get an MRI every year   Interesting - just had an MRI post surgery with wires in. Must be a different type. Start with an echo and if it is needed, the doctor will order the ct. I just got my yearly echo. Still at a tiny 3.9-4.0 cm! If you are choosing then choose an echo.  In my personal experience CT scans and MRI are only used to get more accurate measurements if the echo shows you have a dilation.  MRI's are very expensive, and CT's have radiation so they are not routinely used (at least by my doctors).   \n\nMore details about my experience:\nYears before my surgery my doctor ordered a CT after I would been diagnosed through an echo to use as a baseline in the future.  He never did another CT scan.  After they became more concerned with the size of my dilation/aneurysm they did an MRI and second echo, both ordered by surgery department at hospital.  After surgery I have had annual echos again.  And I did not have a CTY pre-surgery, but did have an MRI with &amp; without contrast - and another post surgery before release. &gt;  I havent had an MRI since my surgury because of the wires around my sternum\n\nInteresting:  I had an MRI post surgery as a final check before release to make sure everything looked OK.  They told me the wires were not significant enough to cause a problem.  Wonder if it depends on the MRI machine used or what the difference would be. I would get what the doctor recommends.  I started with an echo which detected the dilation.  The next year the doctor wanted to do a CT as well, to check things out and serve as a baseline.  Never did another CT scan.  About 6 years later it was determined that my dilation had expanded into territory where it was considered an aneurism and needed to be repaired.  Before and after surgery I had MRI scans.  Since then they have done annual echo's to check things out.\n\nI know the echo can check heart valve function, and regurgitation level, but I am not sure if CT or MRI can.", "Does this sound like Marfans? ", "How do you guys feel about family planning? How do you feel about possibly passing your illness to your kids? Note (english is not my first language i apologize for any spelling and punctuation errors)\nI am writing my nursing graduation paper on the subject of family planning with genetic illness and i would like to understand your views and standpoints from a closer perspective. Do you want kids? how do you feel about passing on your illness? would you consider genetic testing with your partner? Do you consider IVF? \nAny replies are much aprechiated! Personally, I would not want to risk it. If I ever have kids I am adopting. thank you for your reply! Would you consider genetic engineering or selective IVF? I would not risk on passing the syndrome to somebody else. Maybe not even with IVF, I would not like to be an ill father. Marfans is one of the reasons I plan to never have children, especially since it tends to get more severe with each generation (this is a generalization, it does not always happen that way).  I do not even have a particularly severe case (but I have had to have many surgeries and it has affected my day to day life in many ways) and I still would not consider risking it.\n\nMy feelings on this topic are a bit complicated. If this is truly for a paper, etc, feel free to DM for my email if you want to discuss it at length.\n\nI feel a great deal of resentment for having this thrust onto me, particularly because my parents already knew that one of them had it (and had more severe issues than I do, actually). I also feel a little uniquely resentful of the fact that no one, genetic condition or no, gets to decide whether to be born. You just are, because other people decide. It is one of life's greatest (but also unavoidable -- it is not like you can give a fetus its own choice whether to be born or not) tragedies in my own personal view.\n\nConsent is very important to me in everything; the fact that it is lacking in the greatest choice of all is very unnerving to me personally. So, no, I would not consider genetic engineering, would not consider IVF, and would not consider a surrogate because of the medical reasons above, the general morality issues I personally have with birth as expressed above, and also because I personally think IVF etc are absurdly expensive and not something I could ever do in good conscience while there are already-born children in the world who need homes.\n\nAdoption of a non-genetic child who already exists is really the only choice I would ever feel comfortable with. (I do not plan to do that, either, but that is more of a lifestyle choice. I want to drop everything and go to the Maldives whenever I want.)\n\nOf course, these are deeply personal feelings, and I would never tell anyone else what to do with their own bodies. Whether to pass along a condition like this is a personal choice that is none of my business when it involves anyone else. But personally? No, I could not bring myself to do it and also sleep at night. I am sure others can, and that is fine. Kudos to them. I have chosen not to have children\u2013while my own life has turned out fine (so far), there have been too many medical close calls that I would wish to run those chances again.\n\nFrom my perspective, knowingly passing on your (severe) genetic disorder to your children is no different from having perfectly healthy children and then permanently maiming or disabling them.\n\nWe, who have genetic disorders, cannot eliminate genetic disorders from the gene pool, as random mutations are still a thing (e.g., I am the first in my family with Marfan), but we can certainly do our part, and are, I believe, morally obligated to do so.\n\nGiven how the Earth is already overrun with humans, choosing not to have offspring is perhaps the better, more ethical choice anyway. I am a 4th generation marf, for context.\n\nI have two sons, neither have been genetically tested yet but so far do not exhibit any obvious signs. We would like to have more children. \n\nI do not want my kids to have marfans, but I am not terrified to pass it on. We can and do lead full lives - it is not like for my grandmother (born 1915) who had a dramatically shorter life expectancy (she died New years eve 1999). \n\nConsidered, but did not get  pre natal testing.  \n\nIVF seems unnecessary. thank you so much for your reply and offer! Is it okay if i dm you once i have prepared some interview questions suitable to your situation? Sure! that is very understandable after all good health isnt the most important thing we lay in our childrens cradle but being able to provide a good upbringing is a often forgotten big aspect of being a parent aswell. Thank you for your reply! I want to have kids but I still battle this. I pray they are born without this gene, yet I do not think I want to adopt either. It is obviously very personal but I just want to experience having a little me. But I could not handle what I would do if my kid was not happy and blamed me for knowing. It took a lot for me to accept what I have no way of changing. But I cannot guarantee they will and that scares me. I cannot do that to someone , especially my kid. But I feel it is part of life. It really conflicts me I did not want to risk it so we did ivf for my first kid. We tried ivf again for a second kid but had no luck with a couple miscarriages and a couple implantations that did not take. We are currently signed up with an adoption agency- going on about a year now. I just did not want the guilt knowing I did not have to pass down the gene. I like thinking I may have saved many generations from dealing with it. This is a topic I am currently very passionate about. For context, I am a 21 year old female who was diagnosed at 5 years old with no previous family history of the disorder; i.e., my mutation was 'random' and not hereditary. My case is not severe, but it still does affect my day-to-day life significantly, including my vision and overall strength. I have been on beta-blockade medication since I was 5 years old which has kept my aortic root at a normal diameter.\n\nI will answer each of your questions separately. All of what I am about to say is my current opinion after much research - I am open to changing my mind, and I am very open to further conversation. \n\n1) Yes, I absolutely want children of my own. I have always wanted (many) children, but as a little girl I thought I would adopt. Now, I have a deep psychological need for having my own children which I have felt since I was 16, and I have been preparing myself for the task since I met my partner at 19.\n\n2) I do not want to pass on my illness. End of story - If I can avoid it, I will. If I cannot avoid it, I will not have children. It is a very difficult situation for me, however, as I hate to play God. However, my love for my future children and their health exceeds the feelings I have against messing with nature.\n\n3) I am definitely considering genetic testing. Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS) would be appropriate for my situation. If the results of the testing come back as having the mutation, I would most likely make the very difficult and heart-wrenching decision to terminate the pregnancy. \n\nHOWEVER - I have been doing a lot of research on epigenetics, and how important certain factors are in the health and development of fetuses. There are mice model studies that show a reversal of genetic abnormalities - I am hoping I can use these studies to my advantage and give my babies the best shot possible so that, hopefully, the genetic testing I go through will always come back showing a healthy fetus with no mutations. \n\n4) I am not considering IVF. In my case, it would be an unnecessary and expensive endeavor. Thankfully, my reproductive system has always functioned perfectly with a 'perfect' menstrual cycle and I have no hormonal issues such as PCOS. \n\nI hope these replies helped. The topic of family planning is so controversial and difficult for me. I cannot express enough how much I hate to mess with nature! I even hate taking my medication every day because it changes the course of nature, and it took me many years until I made my peace with taking it. But, like I said, my love for my (yet unborn) children exceeds any and all preoccupation with playing God. I would do absolutely anything for healthy and happy children! \n\nGod bless you. I would not, I believe it is too much to go through just for a bloodline child. I guess I knew I would never have kids. Was not exactly attractive but also, do I want to want someone go through what I did at school? \n\nIn hindsight, you see the bullying going on with the internet and honestly glad I never had kids. I mean, everyone talks of being more open and accepting of those different and yet everywhere you look it is just become such an awful world. \n\nThen there is money which is now pushing those without disabilities out of many things, environment, housing, jobs, relationships, etc\u2026 I would never want to watch any kids go through that.\n\nI know I could have done things different which could have meant a better life but still, when it comes to kids, you do what is best for them and sometimes not having them in the first place can often be the best thing. I did not want to have kids anyway so I am just using marfans as the main reason I will be telling my family when time comes. Apart from all other reasons, why would I force a life of suffering on someone and make them think - that is how life is supposed to be and you should be strong and get through it\u2026bla bla bla. Honestly, I have never seriously considered *not* having children specifically because of my Marfan's. My brother, who had severe aortic root dilation and a valve replacement, has two beautiful children. They both have Marfan's, but their symptoms are closely monitored and healthcare needs met as best they can be, just as mine and my siblings were growing up. They are happy and healthy children.\n\nI am a woman in my mid-20s with a serious partner, and we have discussed having children down the line. For a host of reasons, including my own health throughout the process of being pregnant and giving birth, I would certainly approach becoming pregnant with care. I do not have aortic dilation at this point in my life. But any of these things could change \u2014 my physical health, my family planning goals and desires, the health of my children. I think it is so tremendously difficult to know what the future holds, period.\n\nI do appreciate that everyone experiences their Marfan's differently. I have severe skeletal issues, have had a host of orthodontic treatments, I have pretty significant joint pain in my hips and suffered a knee injury from IT band issues, I have terrible eyesight, I was not allowed to engage in most sports growing up, I know I will need joint replacements as I age as my mother and her siblings have, and that aging for me will be more painful than it is for some people. I also have family members who have suffered with much greater medical issues. But ultimately, I do not think choosing to have children who may inherit a compatible-with-life genetic condition such as this is inherently unethical or selfish. No disrespect meant to anyone else in this thread, but that idea (that someone with Marfan's should not have children) is rather questionable to me from a bioethics standpoint.", "Hey Marfam!

MRI feels like a coffin box where the process takes nearly an hour and you cannot move an inch during that hour. Now you would know which one is yours.\n\nI had my biannual CT changed to biannual MRI cos my doctor did not think it wise to expose me to all that radiation (no radiation in MRI) when my prognosis is looking ok so far. Until all signs point to my aorta doing the expandy over-stretchy thing again, we are just sticking with MRI so I do not get radiation overexposure giving me some stupid cancer along the way. Is a gamble tho cos MRI can see enough but not as clearly as CT.\n\nCannot help with the thyroid issues tho, so far so good there for me. I had been getting an echo and CT rotation because I am within surgery threshold, but due to cancer risk from the radiation and my measurement not changing, they took me off the CT. Ah yeah I think maybe it is MRI then cause it takes about 45 min and you have to keep taking breaths. I am more concerned about the dye injection if there is no radiation. I have had a baseline CT and then switched to MRI annually. This is to limit cumulative radiation exposure. Be sure your doctor does the same after your surgery. &gt;se I am within surgery threshold, but due to cancer risk from the radiation and my measurement not changing, they took me off the CT.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I have only ever gotten bloodwork for kidneys/thyroid.

Any help would be appreciated \ud83d\ude42 I heard from a doctor that increasing pressure is the issue, not what muscle you target. So if you do very light weight it could be okay depending the severity of your heart. Thanks I am 14 they are doing genetic tests to see if there is any relatives with similar conditions but we could not find any so it is likely a spontaneous mutation. When they did the heart scan it turned out abnormal however blood pressure was normal 108 mmHg\ud83d\ude15 You should ask your doctors what exercises and sports you can do. It varies from person to person, but generally very heavy weight lifting is not advisable but aerobic activities are good.  \n\n\nYou cannot lessen Chest deformities from exercise. Ask your doctor about this too, but generally chest deformities are fairly common (not only in Marfan Syndrome), so try to feel comfortable with the body you have! The main issue with exercises is the stress on your aorta due to pressure spike. To avoid that is recommended that we do every gym exercises at high repetitions and low intensity. Stick to sets of 20+ reps. It is good to avoid muscle fatigue, the optimal point to hypertofy is a bit before muscle fatigue so you can achieve it without the blood pressure spike that comes with muscle fatigue.\n\nIt is good to work isolated muscles, it would be perfect to be one muscle at time but sometimes this is impossible, so stick to smaller muscle groups. Avoid isometric exercises like planks, pushups and leg press. Avoid holding your breath while doing exercises too. It will take longer at the gym but the health benefits compensate it. Also we have a harder time building muscles so do not expect a bodybuilding body and it will take longer to get in shape, but it is possible, do not give up and take care. Before following any of this advices check with your doc. I am 64 and in process if being diagnosed marfan. I have pectus carinatum. I started doing pushups and strength training since i was 13 years old to cover up my chest deformity. I have 7.3 cm aorta root aneurysm that was discovered last year. Never had any symptoms. I did cut down on pushups. I am just making sure that my BP  and heartbeat does not rise too much during the exercise. I tried to exercise and got a spinal deviation I would say check with your doc or a PT to be sure, because everyones case is different. All I can give you is my anecdotal experience.\n\nI am 36, with minor marfan traits (tall thin frame, 0 body fat, chest deformity, cardiovascular issues, and inability to gain weight), but not full blown marfans. No small palate, eye problems, heart issues (as of yet), or surgeries. \n\nI have always been pretty healthy and athletic despite being super skinny. No matter how many protein shakes, push ups, pull ups, yoga, or weight lifting I have done, I have never been able to gain muscle mass.

In my teens I used to naturally hunch over and sleep on my tummy. I began to incorporate rolling my shoulders back, standing up straight, and breathing from my belly as a form of posture correction at 20 years old and it has helped a ton. A posture strap helps too. I try to sleep on my back as often as I can to relieve pressure on my chest, but usually wake up on my tummy. \n\nHope this helps.", "What syndrome i most likely have?

I had covid 2 times\nFirst time in November 2020\nSecond time in April 2021\nThe only worrying symptom was arrhythmia in my heartbeat, I really worried too much the first time\n\nI have marfan, but I have never had a problem with my heart\n\nAfter having covid, the arrhythmia disappeared, I went for a check-up and my cardiologist says that everything is fine I used to get common cold (covid) two or three times a year. Now i get it once or less", "Dealing with Body Changes re: Isolation etc Hey all!\nThis is literally my first Redit post lol\n\nGlad I found this group.\n\nI have been having a Lot of physical affects from being in isolation (high risk), and not even thinking of muscle loss while at home all this time.\n\nI will be 51 tomorrow. My father had Marfan - I was 'officially' diagnosed at 35 when in need of valve repair. I have been dealing with Marfan all my life, really.  But never even thought of the mess my muscles would be in because of isolation.\n\nAn example; I recently started to draw again (thank you Procreate!) And my right arm from elbow to hand is now so weak it is hard to hold a (large, I will admit) mug of tea.\n\nAlso having a LOT of light headedness - and do not get me started on my lungs despiseing the masks (I am very pro mask, tho).\n\nSo.... how are you guys dealing?\nAnything else you are experiencing because covid/isolation &amp; changes?\n\nR.", "Do I have marfan snydrome? I am very tall and I was skinny until I hit the gym, now I look decent and I am still workoing out 3 times a week. I never heard about this condition until now so here are some symptoms that I have:\n-pectus excavatum\n-tall\n-had trouble with spine and doctor sent me to corrective exercise\n\n\nOther than that, I do not have problems with eyes, I lift weights without problems, index finger does not overlap thumb if I wrap them around my wrist (they touch), so my arms and legs are pretty long but because I am overall big I think it is pretty normal.\n\nDoctors know I have pectus excavatum, but they never mentioined marfans. So what do you think, do I have this silent disease that will slowly kill me? Nobody here can diagnose you. Yes, you have a few characteristics but nothing that is not also present in the general population.  My son and daughter both exhibit textbook Marfan characteristics. Tall, lanky, PE, positive thumb and wrist signs, crowded teeth, bad eyes, etc.  We had them genetically tested and only my son has Marfan's.  \n\nInstead of worrying and wondering \"do I or do not I\" please make an appointment with your primary doctor. If they are not familiar with marfans (many are not) or try and blow you off, get for a referral. At the very minimum a cardiologist. (An echocardiogram will reveal if there are problems with the aorta.) The Marfan Foundation has a wealth of information, also. They can help you locate a specialist.  \n\nTake care!", "Can you have formed abs or like great looking muscles when you have Marfans? I am a 16 male with mild Marfan\u2019s and a mild aortic regurgitation. Can people diagnosed with Marfan\u2019s gain muscles (like biceps and 6-pack abs)? And if you have somewhat achieved it, what was your workout? It is attainable, although you probably will not see massive bodybuilder biceps. You can definitely get a lean, cut build though. I asked the same question at 16 (17 now) and you are probably going to get told not to workout by people on here, but listen to your cardiologist, not us. I asked my cardiologist if I could workout and she said I could, I just could not max out heavy lifts like deadlifts, squats, etc. So make sure you are in the clear before you start. \n\nAll muscles work the same, you rip it and it grows back stronger and larger. Just with Marfans it may be a slower and harder process, but it still works the same. \n\nBiggest tip I can give you: eat TONS. More than just 500 surplus calories if you want faster results. I struggled eating 3500 a day but I definitely started to see some muscle gain. And do not just eat tons and not workout, it will turn into fat. I am wiry and hard.  Mostly from an active lifestyle.  You should talk to your doctor about what exercise is right for you. Yes we can, but if you want to do it safely (you do, the alternative is risking rupture/dissection) you need to be patient.\n\nCheck out a comment I wrote about all this awhile ago:\n I have been skin and bones most my life regardless of what I ate or did to exercise, but as I got older I developed a six pack but my arms still stayed pretty small. I started to get more consistent with daily exercise (walking, hiking, climbing,swimming, skateboarding) and this last year all my friends have been noticing my arms are getting bigger.\n\nI guess my advice for you would be to not stress about it, make sure you are eating good (fruits, veggies, protein) find some sort of outdoor activity you enjoy that gives you a full body workout but is still safe to do with your heart. If you still want to \"workout\" do a set amount of push ups, pull ups, sit-ups daily and and in some small weight traing. For me it is doing curls with 10-20lb weights till my arms are jelly.\n\nI am not an expert but I have been gaining muscle, it just took some time.", "Can you lift weights after aortic aneurysm repair surgery? Not that I have had surgery for it or anything I am just curious if you can lift heavy objects even after having surgery to fix an aortic aneurysm.  If not, is it because there is still a chance of having a dissection?  I thought the graft was there to fix the risk of it rupturing.  After my surgery, I was given a limitation that I could not life anything heavier than a milk jug, nor could lift both arms above my head. I think it is less about the graft tearing, and more about the scar splitting open. It does not seem like lifting weights would harm that, but the skin is already very thin and fragile, add in a foot long scar and a wrong shoulder movement, and you are in for a not good time.  You forgot to mention this is for a certain time frame.  The nothing heavier than a milk jug was something like 4 or 6 weeks for me after my repair.   Oh, yes! Yes, 4 to 6 weeks sound right. Now I am back to my restrictions pre-surgery, which is nothing heavier than 15 pounds. I believe I am on that restriction because they only replaced my root, not my valve. Though I cannot be certain.  During recovery after my surgery the discharge instructions said do not life anything greater than 5 to 10lbs for the first 6 weeks and nothing heavier of 10-15 pounds for weeks 7 through 12.  \n\nBy 6 weeks post-surgery I had started Cardiac Rehab, which is pretty much a standard post surgery instruction. Cardiac Rehab is basically supervised exercise run by a hospital, or hospital affiliated health center, where your cardiac patterns are monitored in real time throughout the exercise by the staff and they also get clearance and instructions from your cardiologist.  In my case it was three sessions a week of about an hour with mostly cardio exercise but a little light strength training as well and a once a week lecture on post surgery health matters.\n\nYour cardiologist will also provide follow up exercise instructions and limitations.   After I was pretty much recovered (a few months) the cardiologist said that it was OK to lift weights but I should restrict it to weights that I could do a full set of reps on.  I was instructed against pushing the limit to do anything close to a one-rep max or weights that I really had to strain to do just a rep or two.  I was also told not to do isometrics.  These restrictions continue indefinitely. How long since your surgery? This mirrors the instructions I were given. Late here but your whole aorta is at risk. They only fixed a part of it. That is why you will continue to have annual CTs/MRIs to check on things and what you are still limited in your exercise.", "Body image ", "My aortic dissection scar  Scar looks pretty clean, hope you have a good recovery ! Have a good recovery, you warrior ! Wow. Thanks for sharing. How do you feel. You are so strong dude! Sending you good vibes Looks good dude.  Chicks dig them ;) Hope you feel well. Good luck on recovery. My scar looked good after surgery, but within 6 months it became like an angry red keloid because I have stupid skin.  But it makes no difference to me.

Mine was done in 2011 and the scar is really not all that noticeable anymore. What I do have is a big knot on my chest where one of the pieces of wire they wrap around the sternum has calcified and lumped up. Sometimes my littlest one headbutts me in it. Its excruciatingly painful. \n\nGood luck on your recovery! The hardest part for me was asking for help. Dont hesitate. Its easy to wear yourself out while still trying to heal.

I have a friend from school who has Marfan's and I seem to have a very similar physique to them. No excessively long limbs or fingers, but i have very thin wrists and my sternum protrudes a bit. I also have stretch marks on my hips. I was going through the signs of the syndrome and while the wrist test was positive, I was not sure if i was doing the thumb test correctly. If i move my thumb as far over as possible I can get it to protrude on the other side of my palm, but just normally making a fist with my thumb has no protrusion.

I am 32 years old, but will be 33 by the time the surgery happens. I will be at Stanford Hospital, will have one of the best surgeons in the country working on me, and have lots of support. It is hard to justify being nervous with that much in my corner, but I still am. Ask me anything you would like.", "\ud83e\udd2f My Marfan Mind Blown! Hi friends, I live in Vancouver, Canada.  Two weeks ago today I was diagnosed with a 9cm thoracic aortic aneurysm by an incredibly unlikely and unbelievably fortunate series of events. Two days later I celebrated my 38th birthday at Vancouver General Hospital and have been here since the initial diagnosis. I am scheduled for open-heart surgery tomorrow morning to repair/replace my aortic root and valve.\n\nThat day was the first time in my life I recall hearing the term Marfan.  I still do not have a definitive diagnosis but it seems pretty clear. I am 6'2\", have weighed 140lbs (+/- 5lbs) since grade 10, and have long spidery limbs and digits.\n\nAny advice going into surgery would be hugely appreciated, as would any pertaining to recovery over the next few days and months.\n\nQuestions also welcome!\n\nLastly what is with the timing of this, like ffs! Hey I am in Vancouver too! Good luck with your surgery! Send me a PM and I can maybe help you with local doctors and such. \n\nYou will feel much better after your surgery. I had no idea the drag on my body my aorta was causing.  My aneurysm was a similar size. I had my surgery 25+ years ago (mechanical valve, ascending aorta fixed with Dacron, and coronary artery bypass) with no big issues since. \n\nWhen you are ready do a little bit of waking and increase it day by day. In these times it might just mean walking around your place though! Why and how did they find it on accident? If you do not mind me asking. 9cm is fucking huge for a thoracic aortic root aneurysm! You will be fine man. Seems like you are in good hands. Hey I am an American with a slippery diagnosis (more Ehlers danlos esque)... But fellow member of the upper thoracic anyeurism and bad valve club!!\n\nThere is..there is dozens of us! Having lived so far with a smaller one routinely tested.. I am super glad that they caught OPs HUGE one safely.  Well past intervention size That is quite a curve ball!\n\nYou will do excellent man!  Cannot say it is fun but the outcomes are pretty dang good.\n\nOn the other side, remember recovery is a an incandescent bulb turning on, not an LED.  Your body recovers quickly, and it is amazing how much better you feel every day (or even by the hour), especially in those early days.  Weeks 3-4 were annoying for me because you would be pretty good until you bent a certain way or something; it is frustrating not really painful.\n\nKeep in mind as you heal that a lot of the work your body is doing is internal.  You might get moody, tired, etc.  Even though you *look* healed on the outside, there is still a ton going on \"under the hood\".  Some peoples bodies make them real bummed out (post surgical depression), it is a left over evolutionary signal your body has (ie: if you are depressed you will be sitting your ass on the couch).  It is not the end of the world, and it does lift, but it is good to know.\n\nOther than that, given the whole worlds on lockdown, you will probably be as social as everyone else while you are healing (which was the hardest part for me, the isolation).  If you do any gaming online games helped me a ton.\n\nGood luck!  Get through the surgery then come party some more with us!\n\nMost importantly: Scars are sexy.  Enjoy yours responsibly. Do not mind at all.  Back in Dec/Jan I was off work for what was eventually determined to be acute stress, anxiety, and depression that had manifested in physical symptoms.  Before the final diagnosis I was being being investigated for mono, pneumonia, TB, and a range of other potential causes.\n\nTo be clear, up to and including now I have had absolutely no physical symptoms from my aneurysm.  After treatment for stress etc., I was able to return to work and everyday activities including playing hockey once per week.\n\nPart of the TB/pneumonia investigation was having a chest x-ray. It initially came back negative, all-clear.   About 3 days later (and a week before Christmas) they called back and said 'actually it is inconclusive, there may be something on your right apex (lung).' Was referred for a CT scan, received call late Dec and scheduled for scan March 10.  Have been in Cardiac Care Unit ever since.\n\nI almost never go to the doctor, have a strong immune system, never been for a CT scan previously, experienced shortness of breath, or chest pains.  The chances of me having had that scan at all extremely small.  Even more crazy is that if it had been scheduled for just a week later it would have been cancelled.  All non-essential services are on hold right now due to the coronavirus.\n\nAny stats wizards out there want to take a crack I would be real interested in hearing an approximation of the odds of me being in this situation! Appreciate the advice!! Yes on the plus side I really do not feel like I am missing anything!\n\nGlad you mentioned the scars, I would wondered about that.  I think I will be able to live with that ;) Twinsies! I am 37, tho I got an 11 year head start :D Mine was diagnosed under unlikely set of events too and was 10cm with the tiniest bit of dissection, so they pushed me into the operating theatre that same day I went to A&amp;E. Might have driven me mad if I had to wait for 2 weeks!\n\nSurgery took 10 hours, that is the easiest part cos laying on a table is piece of cake! I have a fairly high threshold for pain so they took me off morphine quite fast (boo!). Things will hurt tho, but manageable. Mostly just very uncomfortable.\n\nYour lungs are like deflated balloons now. Think of how when you inflate a balloon the first breath is the hardest. The thing you must remember to do once you regain enough wits is to breathe deeply, cos reinflating your lungs fully is going to take work only you can do. Think of the deep breath you would draw right before you sigh, is what my surgeon always says. You will not feel like you can do much at all the first few days, but the spirometer is your best friend so keep trying! Cannot stress this enough. Deep! Breaths!\n\nPost op the biggest adjustment is this mechanical valve is so bloody loud all the time! If that is what you opted for it will take time to adjust to the new normal. I remember I was hardly sleeping for more than a month cos on top of the loud clicking valve, there is some psychological trauma to deal with. Like you, I did not know about marfan until I was diagnosed with 10cm, so it went from I am invincible to welp I have a forever sickness overnight. I still hear every single click but it does not keep me up anymore! Everything\u2019s also been checking out ok so far, so good all round.\n\nWhen you are mended, we can chat about how the heck we managed to not keel over while stumbling through life with massive aneurysms lol. Life lottery yea!\n\nYou got this! Good luck :) Thank you, great advice and looking forward to swapping stories! That is fucking insane. Also, insane that you called late December and it took til March 10 to get a relatively simple scan done. Crazy story right there. Any family history of spontaneous cardiovascular related death? I am in Victoria, I attend a mixture of The PACH Clinic at St. Paul\u2019s, and BC Children\u2019s as well. Let me know if you have any questions as well, OP. Nope, no known cardiovascular family history. Much appreciated thank you! I am so happy there is a community here on Reddit that I can lean on for support :) Hey! Happy to hear that your aortic aneurysm was detected and you have a plan in place to get it fixed. Mine was also discovered through a series of fortunate events and my mind was blown, just like yours. I had my surgery in Nov-2017 and would love to offer any advice, answer any questions you might have. Shoot me a PM! I will chime in. As one of the dozens I will be rooting for you. Sounds like you found the right doctors. Wishing you a speedy recovery. My ascending aorta was 5.2 cm when they replaced it from valve to carotid arteries. Fortunately, it was a valve sparing procedure so I am not on blood thinners. My surgery was performed back in 2014 in Denver, CO by a fantastic team and I was out of the hospital in 3 days. Recovery was a longer process; they had me get up and walk the hallways shortly after waking up, I used the treadmill I had at home after that, just to walk, doctor wanted me up moving as much as possible but nothing strenuous (follow *your* doctor\u2019s advice!) I was back to work in 2 months. Weaker than before but otherwise fit for duty. \n\nThe pain from coughing was excruciating for the first couple months... very bad timing for you, I hope you remain well. I caught a cold about a month into recovery and it was awfully painful. \n\nStay healthy and may you have a speedy recovery! An update for all you kind folks. My surgery date is uncertain now.  Was pushed back from Mar 25 originally to today, and now I am told there is a small chance for tomorrow but more likely early next week. There is limited access to OR's right now and a complication with another surgery yesterday forced the last minute change.  Head's high, chin's up, feeling strong! Wow, I thought what with 9cm ought to put you beyond elective surgery into the emergency salvage surgery category. Maybe yours is holding steady for now - which is good news! Cannot even imagine what mayhem it is in the ORs tho yikes. I was just wondering how you are holding up, turns out you have not come out other side yet! Such a tease you! Lol seriously tho, you still got this! I know right! Exceptional times I suppose. They have been extremely careful in managing my blood pressure, and are constantly monitoring me.  Just building up the suspense a little ;) Thank you, love having this community to lean on.  It is been incredibly helpful! Haha.  They for sure noticeable, and you might get questions, but it is not like they freak anyone out (unless they may have their own surgery coming up but that is for different reasons).  Most women I know kind of like  them.  It is sort of like a tatoo. How did it go?", "Is BFR/Occlusion training a viable option for building muscle mass, without disrupting the heart? Hey everyone!\n\nAn individual that has been diagnosed with Marfans since birth here. While I was browsing and looking for alternatives for high-intensity training, I came across something called BFR (Blood Flow Restriction) or occlusion training, which to my surprise has not been spoken about on this sub. \n\nFrom my understanding, it is a method that allows you to do low-intensity high-reps, while getting the same results as a high-intensity workout, by restricting your blood flow and pools it in the limbs that you are training. As scary as it sounds, it does have a lot of research behind it, and seems to be the optimal way of gaining muscle mass for people with a heart condition. \n\nDoes anyone have any experience with this type of workout? Would love to hear some opinions or experiences.", "Need clinic recommendation, general advice To make a long story short, I was diagnosed with Marfans by a pediatric endocrinologist about 30 years ago... Only to be told I do not have it by a cardiologist (I was told I have most of the other signs of this syndrome, just not the heart abnormalities). I followed up with another cardiologist about 20 years ago to put my mind at rest, and was told after a vigorous stress test and echo there was no further need to follow-up.\n\nBut over the past number of years, chronic illness has set in, specifically with my sinuses, and middle and inner ear dysfunction.  I am under the care of an ENT who has suggested it could be GERD or Allergies, although testing for both revealed little issue with either.  He now wants to perform sinus reconstruction surgery, but does not think that will solve all my problems.  The fatigue has been immense, especially PEM.  Now my primary care doc is afraid I might have asthma or another lung disorder, so I am scheduled for a PFT.  \n\nI just was going through my medical records again, and I have a nagging feeling I might have been misdiagnosed years ago.  Maybe I do not have Marfan's but something related. But I do not know where to go.  I am within a 1/2 day drive of multiple teaching hospitals on the East Coast that have Marfan's clinics.  Anyone have any recommendations?  Will these clinics test for other things than Marfans?  Will they work with financially hardup patients (I am on a really high deductible plan)?  How much does testing cost these days?\n\nAny help is appreciated.  Thanks, Why do you *need* a marfan  clinic? Marfan is not an endocrine disorder so a diagnosis from a pediatric endocrinologist is not meaningful compared to a cardiologist.\n\nLook for a geneticist.  When I say Marfan Clinic, I am referring to the list that I downloaded from the Marfans assosciation that shows the list of teaching hospitals that have a Marfans clinic.  I am assuming there would be a number of specialities represented there including cardiology and genetics, no? Because when you go to a Marfan clinic odds are you will not know more about Marfans than the doctors do. It is a problem.\n\nI am in the Midwest so cannot help you with a nearby clinic for you but you can always call the Marfan Foundation and ask them any questions. They do have a list of clinics so I would assume any of them would be good. Good luck to you, our son was diagnosed last summer.  Yes. Our \"Marfan clinic\" we go to has cardiologists and geneticists. The other doctors associated with the hospital (like orthopedics) are also familiar since they get referrals from the actual clinic.  But people who do not have Marfan do not need to go to Marfan clinics to get checked for other genetic problems.  He does not know he does not have it either. We did not know my kid had it for sure when we went. That is what they do. They diagnose you. If he does not have it then he would not keep going.  He is already been checked by multiple doctors that have said he does not have it, the only one that did was an endocrinologist when he was a child. He has already been told no. How many times does he need to be told no before the no sticks? \n\n I know of multiple people that have been told no but tested positive anyway. The only way to know for sure is with a genetic test. Besides, a Marfan Clinic would know the protocol for diagnosis that other doctors may not.  Because lots of things have changed in medicine over the past 20-30 years, especially with genetics.  Because not everyone who has been diagnosed with Marfans has an enlarged aortic root or mitral valve prolapse, especially earlier in life.  Because when you are dealing with chronic illness, you leave no stone unturned and you reexamine the evidence because sometimes things get missed and a fresh set of eyes coupled with updated medicine might have the underlying answers to why I keep getting sick.", "No skin abnormalities like abnormal elasticity can i still have aortic aneurysm  Do you have Marfan, or another connective tissue diagnosis?

At age 17 he had the heart surgery where I believe they did something to the valve or aorta and had to break his chest bone because it was protruding. (Please excuse me as I am not familiar with all the terminology. Marfans can be very difficult to deal with and my husband seemed like he did not like to talk about it much). He is now 31. He was rushed to the hospital with severe back pains, he was yelling he could not breathe , he started vomiting and was having cold sweats very bad. I was able to get him to the hospital. He had to be air lifted to another hospital to get surgery. They said it was a tear in his lower aorta and that the pulse in his right leg was faint. He had surgery and there were able to repair it. He is still in the hospital and feeling miserable. He is continuing to have cold sweats but his levels are looking good. He is occasionally coughing up blood as well. Can anyone tell me if you have experienced this or have a loved one. I love my husband so much and I just want to help him get through this and find answers. The doctors are monitoring closely but are still confused on what is going on! Please share if you can. Thank you! I think your husband has been extremely lucky! An aorta aneurysm tearing up can lead to death within only a few minutes. Not only your husband had time to reach the hospital, but he had a successful surgery very quickly. He might feel miserable now, but you guys should definitely be happy and celebrate the fact that he is alive and getting better.\n\nA few years ago there was a thread on AskReddit where people were telling their stories of having witnessed their loved ones die from an aorta aneurysm right in front of them. A lot of very sad stories that ended badly. Your story is definitely uplifting in comparison, and shows that sometimes we can be lucky despite our unfortunate disease. All the best to you two! He will probably be at the hospital for a while I am lucky I live within about half hour of my great heart surgeon. But I know this will be me one day. I hope my wife can get me to the hospital quickly That is what I call luck! Sorry that you have to pass throught this traumatic experience. The worst has now passed and I hope his recovery after the hospital goes smoothly.\n\nAs some advice, since I have been to a (non emergencial) heart surgery, try to minimize his stress and give attention to every little bit of pain that he has, it counts. If he have back/neck pains talk to the docs and ask for meds or alternatives to relieve it. Very sorry to hear that. I wish you guys very VERY much luck and speedy recovery.\n\nSorry, I do not have anything else to say related to your situation that might help you. Thank you all so much for your kind and encouraging words! The issue he is dealing with right now is just not being able to breathe good and he is getting really hot. I think he does have to have one more surgery. But he is fine and I am very grateful he is still here. try cold wash cloths around his neck and ankles. i would ask the nurses for a bucket of ice so you can keep some wash cloths soaking in ice while the others are on him. Then switch them so he has fresh cold ones! I used to like that when i overheated in the hospital I am a 17 year old male, I have had Marfans syndrome most of life, I have had 2 valve replacement, 3 aortic aneurysms repairs (normal ascending aorta &amp; descending aorta). I have also had 3 spine surgeries. (Basically my whole left side is completely artificial). \n\nBut I wanted to say your husband is absolutely lucky, the life expectancy of a Marfan (that has not had an aortic aneurysm repair) is most likely 31 years old. I would assume his cold sweat are of his body still being going through the trauma that this aneurysm caused. Also If he is still coughing blood it most likely the blood that accumulated during the aneurysm which might have went to his other organs. I would also say just be there for him during his recovery, this near-death experience will traumatize him for a while (that how I felt when I had a hematoma occur 2 days after my spinal surgery). Also Marfans are mainly known for staying to themselves (do not know why) which means we keep our surgery scars to ourselves, and we do not share them to other easily. What I would recommend is just taking it slow with your husband, do not rush anything to fast (learned this the hard way). I hope he gets better, all my prayers &amp; best wishes are for him to have a speedy recovery, also one last thing you &amp; your husband are warriors!!! Life expectancy is closer to 70, certainly not 31. That is if you have had everything that is necessary for your body, the actual life expectancy (with all the surgeries and medications) for Marfans is 44-77 years old. But if you have not had your aorta repaired then it will be around 30-31 when it will erupt. I am 61 and female, currently scheduled for a tevar repair of my ascending aortic arch which has a tear.... cannot even get into a hospital to have surgery for 2 weeks.  I pray I do not have a dissection while waiting to go, covid has caused this and the staffing shortage.  I too had a 6.8 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm fixed in 2018... found during a CT scan of my lungs.  I was fortunate that they found it because my cardiologist at the time said it was not his job the check my abdominal aorta.  If not his who is, new cardiologist and vascular surgeon work hand in hand now to stay on top of my Marfan's which now affects every major system and then some.  I thank the good lord that your husband although as I am sure is still very ill managed to get his aneurysm repaired and after all the pain and agony, will be grateful that he can continue to enjoy life.  The best of luck to you", "Telling a stranger they might have Marfan syndrome? If you have seen someone who looks like they could have Marfan syndrome, would you tell them and recommend they get screened to potentially save their life? Or should you mind your own business? I would certainly say tell them. But then I have seen people and thought to myself: I bet they have Marfan syndrome, and did not say a thing. So... that is my hypocritical answer. I would mind my business. Well that depends, what are their signs?  \nCertainly people can be 7ft tall without having a genetic disorder.  \n\n\nIf it is a complete stranger you just see walking on the street, it would be nearly impossible for you to notice enough of the clinical criteria (dislocated lenses, tall, increased arm/leg span, stretch marks, reduced elbow extension, chest deformity, flat feet, scoliosis, thumb/wrist sign etc.)\n\nPerhaps if it was someone you knew more than just meeting them once, you could simply ask them, and say something along the lines of \"My family members have Marfan Syndrome, and I was curious if you had ever heard of this?\". Otherwise it may come off as rather rude, and some people may not want to get that personal with a stranger. I would tell them, I actually have told one guy on IG and he thanked me - he never heard of marfans before and he had all the visual traits, plus through our convo he told me he had heart problems which to my surprise made me extra glad I mentioned it. \n\nIn terms of describing him, he had tall thin features, deep eyes, glasses, pectus (which I noticed in his gym mirror selfie) and also scoliosis. His teeth looked a bit crowded as well - I figured telling him could do more good than bad. As for how I know him - I didnt lol he was a complete random who was tagged in some culture page that I follow. \n\nAll in all, his level of appreciate for my clear explanation- links to Marfans websites and time taken to express why he should get things checked out, was rewarding.  I would advise you all to do the same. \n\nIt may had been the case that hed gotten mad and offended-but that wouldnt be my problem, so long as I am respectful and empathetic in the process. Our concern for others who may have marfans comes from a good place, so just be extra careful with how you phrase things. I mind my business. I might bring it up if we are introduced or connected somehow, but I would not walk up to a total stranger with that.\n\nI have played the scenario in my head if it were the other way around. I would honestly feel quite invaded and potentially insulted if someone came up to me and said \"You look like you could have this random syndrome/disorder. Look into it.\"", "16M imaorryimaskingthisbut Do I have Marfan\u2019s I have been going to physical therapy for post surgery strengthening for a torn Thumb MCP UCL tear.  Today I checked back in with my surgeon for another post op. My therapists have noticed that I have a lot of joint Hypermobility. My wrists bend past 90\u00b0 as well as my fingers. My thumb la can touch my wrists. Today I was diagnosed with Joint Hypermobility Syndrome which means I have generally hyper mobile joints. During my eval my orthopedic doctor recommended that I refer to my pediatrician to make sure I do not have marfan\u2019s. I have been researching marfan\u2019s and I think I may be susceptible to a new diagnosis. I am 6\u20192\u201d, 225 lbs.  When I am standing and arms at my sides, my fingers reach to about 2\u201d to my knee.  I have flat feet. I am sorry for asking this because I am sure you guys hate it. Follow up with your pediatrician like they recommended, and try not to stress about it until then. If you do have it, that is the worst thing you can do!\n\nJoint hypermobility could lead to a different diagnosis, or you keeping your same one. Flat feet are pretty common, as is being 6'2\" and 225. Those things alone are not anything anyone here can diagnose you with.  What is important is a doctor told you to pursue getting checked out, so you should definitely  do that. Just stop freaking yourself out with tales of horror on the internet.  Thank you so much! I am very sorry I asked this; I am sure it happens a lot. 225 lbs? No way. For your height you would be no more than 150", "I am afraid I may have Marfan Syndrome I am 15 years old and I am concerned that I may have Marfan syndrome. I first heard about this when someone in Youtube suggested that the 16 year old girl with the worlds longest legs gets checked for Marfan syndrome and ehlers danlos syndrome. \n\nWhy do I think I may have this? Well, first of all I am unusually tall. Right now I am 6,4ft tall and thin as a skeleton. I say unusually because no one on my moms or dads side is as tall as I am. My dad is 6,1ft and my mom is 5,5ft. I have long arms and legs but I am not sure if it is disproportionate. I have nearsightedness when it comes to reading words far away and it seems that my vision gets worse as I get older, so I will probably need glasses. I have flat feet, but no scoliosis and my breastbone seems normal. I would not say my fingers and toes are unusually long. Today I have experienced pain in my left chest but it is gone now and I am not sure if Marfan causes heart pain. \n\nOf course, there is not any point in self diagnosing so I asked my mom and she said she does not believe that I have it so I will have to go get a diagnosis by myself when I am an adult. Should I be worried? Am I just a crazy zoomer who thinks of random things to be worried about? I do not know anymore.", "Anyone had any eye surgeries? I recently went to the DMV to update my address and took the eye exam. I passes with 8/12 meaning I failed the 4 letters that I could only with my right eye.  I passed the test with the minimun score. My eye doctor insists that surgery is a last resort but my livelyhood depends on my ability to drive. Has anyone had any surgeries?  Can you still drive? Do you still wear corrective lenses?\nEDIT - my lenses have shifted upwards to the point that I am looking through the very bottom of my lenses. Neither lense is detached but they have been moving more and more making my prescription more intense. ", "Curious Was wondering if anybody else had had a CSF as a complication fro Marfans? I know I have one now and I am going to my cardiologist and neurologist in the next couple weeks but was just curious as to other people's experience with this I am going to guess that you meant a CSF leak? If so, then yes, I have had CSF leaks on two occasions, first in the spring of 2009, then again in the spring of 2019. Both leaks were caused by dural ectasia and led to spontaneous intracranial hypotension and subdural hematomas. They both involved extensive stays in hospitals. The first was resolved by simply waiting it out until my body repaired and recalibrated everything naturally, while the second was resolved by multiple blood patches. Similar story here too. Had two subdural hematomae caused by CSF leak in 2009, first one hematoma was receding on its own, second kept growing. 2+ weeks in the hospital, burr hole procedure to relieve cranial pressure, then exploratory surgery + blood patches. Funnily enough, when they went in to patch the CSF leak in my back, they could not find the leak that was there less than 24hrs prior during the lumbar puncture/contrast tilt table test.\n\nHave been fine since. Learnt at that moment I have DE. Always an adventure. Thanks. For the reply I leak constantly from my my nose,have to blow it 15-20 times a day to not be embarrassed at work . Did you have any other symptoms ,mental or physical? I did not have any symptoms for the leaks themselves, just symptoms for the SIH and the hematomas. All I ever really had to deal with were positional headaches, intense headaches that went away completely when I laid down flat. I have low pressure headaches believed to be caused by  Marfans. I have to take diuretics to help relieve the headaches. I am almost forty and this just started within the past year. I do from my dural ectasia being so severe that it is caused chiari malformation. I get frequent CSF blockages, I do not know if I have had any leaks (I have a tendency to not go to the hospital for anything, my doctors hate it).\n\nIt sucks, it is painful, and I throw up more than any human being should ever in their life. I do not know how I even still have teeth some days. Lol Strong NSAIDs have helped get the inflammation down, but my body eats NSAIDs like they are nothing so they are already starting to not work. Eh. Do diuretics help? My neurosurgeon said hydration is the key to keeping my CSF flow strong. It is the only thing that helped with the headaches. I tried a bunch of different medicines but this one really helped. If you go on Drugs.com and look up CSF, you can see medicine reviews by people who suffer from the same thing. Interesting. Thanks!", "Possibilities with Apple Watch? I am not 100% sure if I have Marfan, but I show several symptoms like long limbs, Pectus excavatum, being super skinny, being very tall for someone from my country, having slightly crooked (asymmetrical) teeth. I have almost passed out at the gym once because I was exerting myself too hard, which I think could be related to Marfan. I still have not had a professional diagnosis, but I am looking to get one from experts in Stanford in January. \n\nDo you guys think the Apple Watch is worth it, especially for the EKG functions? Do you think it could allow people with Marfan to work out more safely, since they can regulate their heart more?\n\nI am kind of bummed out that I probably will not ever get to safely develop large muscles in my lifetime. Not really. It is not about your heart rate, or the electrical activity that an EKG shows. We are discouraged from working out because of the pressure it puts on the heart. If it shows blood pressure, than that is a useful thing, however do not be fooled into a false sense of security. Just because you can see this data in real time does not make weightlifting any safer.\n\nIt is a hard thing to deal with, giving up something we enjoy. But I would encourage you to turn it into opportunity. Explore things you otherwise would not have before. You may just find something amazing you would have otherwise missed pursuing weight training. Good luck! For sure. Right now I think what I need to do is to find a professional. As far as I understand it, Marfan is more of a spectrum, right? It is kind of similar to autism in that there are borderline cases? So potentially I could work out? If you genuinely have Marfans, then you will need regular echocardiograms and likely a combination of medication to lower your blood pressure to a level that will reduce the stretching of your aorta. Heavy weightlifting with a fragile aorta is not wise.\n\nJust saying, almost passing out at the gym from exertion (and all your symptoms) are very common. Why do you need experts from Stanford as opposed to a diagnosis from a cardiologist or a geneticist near you? Well, that is the thing. I figured since I have a lot of common symptoms I should go to an expert to just quickly resolve if I do or do not have marfan\u2019s. I use mine to track my heart rate. My docs said it should not go above 100 bpm when exercising. Plus I have had some rhythm issues the past couple of years. just get checked", "No title necessary ", "What should I do?

I obviously go to the doctor sometimes for things but they do not seem to be worried about that and obviously my social circle is not too.\n\nSo what should I do? Should I be worried? The main problem is how to explain to my family that I want to get a check about this because they might think I am crazy. Worrying has not ever accomplished anything, so do not bother with that. It is just a waste of energy. \n\nIf you have a genuine concern for your health, you should talk with a doctor. &gt;you should talk with a doctor.\n\nLocking this post because this is the only answer.", "Do not know what to do and stressed So heres some context. My mom and I are pretty much 90% sure i have marfan syndrome because i have a lot of the symptoms. (Dipped chest, heart palpitations, tall, skinny, flexible, large feet, always fatigued) \n\nAnyways we decided to schedule for a marfan test to see if i actually have it but we havent made an appointment because of the coronavirus. We agreed to wait until after the coronavirus went away so we could get the test done. But now theres a problem.\n\nThese past 3 days my heart palpitations have lasted almost most of the day each day to the point where theyre getting uncomfortable. I try to calm it down by using breathing exercises but tonight theyve been causing a little bit of pain. Sometimes my left arm and left side of my chest feels weird. I am starting to stress out because I dont know of this is something to worry about. Can this go away on its own? Am i at risk of having a heart attack? Im stuck between going to get tested but risking getting coronavirus or waiting this out. Did you contact your physician lately about your symptoms? If you have not, I highly suggest contacting one and maybe request for an echocardiogram to confirm any heart conditions that may be caused by Marfans. \n\nYes, I know you may feel very anxious about your maybe-undiagnosed condition, especially in a time of a pandemic. If you are really experiencing chest pain or any pain in your left side, I highly recommend contacting EMS (wear a mask!). \n\nIt is scary going to the ER for an emergency consult, but emergencies will always be emergencies. For now, to prevent chances of going to the ER, contact your physician for an online or face-to-face consult! If your irregular heart beats are lasting hours then this is a medical emergency. You can damage your heart or throw a clot. See your doctor right away. \n\nIf going to the ER, wear a mask, do not touch your face, and bring hand sanitizer. You need to get a chest scan to see how your heart is doing. If you are having panic attacks that could be worsening the situation as well. I get palpitations regularly and I have managed to calm then down with blood pressure meds and magnesium taurate. The principals problems of Marfan are the heart issues. I do not think you should be concerned to have a genetic testing for Marfan now, but I do recommend you to have an echocardiogram or chest CT ASAP. If you have any problems it may help taking medicine, or it even may be necessary to have a surgery... Any way, if you wait too long the problem can worsen and it is not so dangerous to go to a clinic if you take the right protection measures. I am 22 male and have marfans for sure. I got some pains starting when I was 16 unfortunately at the same time I lost insurance. I felt similar and I must say first and for most if you are worried there is a reason and if you have the ability see a doctor as soon as possible. When I was 16 once every couple days I would get a stab in my chest but I did not pay it much mind as I was not eating well. It got more constant until when I was 18 n able to sustain myself I worked on my diet and they have gone away mostly. It is more of every couple months, but I am unsure of what causes it but I accept it as a part of my life until I find a good enough job to get insurance. Anyway what I am tryna say is drink a bunch of water and eat healthy home crooked meals not fast food and soda and it should help. And again if you have the means to do so, see a doctor man do not play w your life. But I would look at what you are consuming none the less. Feel free to message me or reply if you need more Info I will get back as soon as I can. In this together homie Go see a fucking doctor jesus christ Definitely contact your doctor with any heart related issues. Like other posters mentioned eating well and minimizing perceived stress is really important to prevent heart palpitations. I work a pretty physical job and take 10-15 minute breaks just to be still and breathe (deep, slow, diaphragmatic). I also take a multi-vitamin, fish oil, coq10, and magnesium.

My shoulders, hips, and knees are all pretty messed up but especially my hips. I think I might have a really deep hip socket or something (I will have to get it diagnosed).

My ankles and wrists are tiny so they make my hands and feet look even bigger. I wear size 8 and most clothes are not fitting for me.\n\nMy ribs are caved in BUT not in the middle.

I wear baggy clothes because of my uneven hips due to scoliosis. I wish to know what exactly it is and if anyone has this problem. Is this considered Marfan syndrome? I wish I had normal limbs. Thank you. We cannot diagnose you, but definitely go and see your doctor! You do not have to have every trait of Marfans to have Marfans! You do not say how much you weigh are you really skinny or thick ? Are you male or female? You just described an ex-boyfriend, he said all true Scottish men had bodies like us. Used to make me laugh Oh that is nice to know though! Lol. That is funny. I am female currently at 130. I am not fat or too skinny. A Marfan syndrome diagnosis has much more to do with your internal body than your external body. Nobody can tell you if it is 'considered Marfan syndrome'. You must be diagnosed.\n\nFor example: I do not match *any* of the typical physical features of Marfan except height and long limbs, and yet I was diagnosed at 5 years old. All of which you have just described does not seem to be of any concern to me, but if you are truly concerned, you must see a cardiologist to check the measurement of your aortic root; that is the only way to know if there is possible Marfan syndrome. \n\nI would suggest that you not worry. If you are 27 and have no other signs except what you have described, it is unlikely that Marfan is the culprit. Again, the only way to know is through clinical or genetic diagnosis. No purely physical signs can tell. Please do not ask for a diagnosis in the r/marfans subreddit. Please see a doctor. Obviously \n\nPlease read the above stickied post. Not everybody with marfans looks stick thin and have crowded teeth and the eyes, I have been told I do not look like one because I was a bit chubby at one point and because of the scoliosis and hip and feet surgeries I have shrunk to 5\u201d10  when I used to be a 6\u201d footer.  The point is, it is a syndrome so it affects everybody differently, and I used to be so embarrassed about my body but as I have got older, I do not give two shits what anybody else thinks! You have to learn to love yourself, and do not worry about what anyone else thinks!

If you take risks well... that being said do not live too safe it is only once.  Per the below, you should expect a pretty normal life.\n\nThe biggest stressor with marfans is what comes with any life long condition.  You will learn doctors are not perfect, insurance is complicated to navigate, and health care can be expensive.  It is a pain in the ass, and there are times it will frustrate the hell out of you, but its manageable for the most part.\n\nBut I hike, climb and have an on/off road motorcycle that keeps me sane.

Make sure to see your cardiologist regardless if/where you go to school.  Marfan's is a lot \"predictive maintenance\".  They know what they are doing to an amazing degree, but they cannot help you if you do not go to the office. You should avoid contact sports because you are at greater risk of a displaced lens in your eye. I enjoy swimming, walking, hiking, light jogging, moderate weight lifting, and yoga. I have a family member with Marfan syndrome who never needed surgery and is in their 60s.  Are Marfans\u2019 lens in the eyes very vulnerable? Yes!

Is it possible that I only have a few symptoms common in Marfans without having it? Or do I have it and the heart problems might develop later? From what I understand you have to have an enlarged aorta to have Marfan Syndrome even clinically now. But the only way to know for sure if you have it is a genetic test. \n\nMy son has the enlarged aorta so he was clinically diagnosed even before we got the confirmation from the genetic testing.  Do you have a split uvula, high arches, or pronated ankles?? If so you might have loeys dietz syndrome, something very similar to marfans, and what I have. With LDS the absence of heart problems is possible.  No split uvula, I have normal arches and normal non-pronated ankles.

I can stand on my tippy toes but it hurts the bottom of my feet (I guess where the arch should be) Yeah I feel like it is super uncommon, and 100% been doing more resistance exercises to engage them more! Yeah mine are super flat, or were* rather cause I had them corrected when I was young but despite correction my ankles kind of tilt down and one arch has returned to being kind of flat. But really good point on the flat footedness cause I didnt really think of that tbf. That is prob a big part of why it feels so hard (my ankles are also really flimsy). I cannot put any weight at all on my tippy toes. I cannot even wear high heels because of it. It is like my ankles are so loose they cany stabilize to support my weight. Disclaimer I am on the severe end of the Marfan scale. I know other people do not have this problem necessarily but we are all affected differently. Agree, I totally get where ur coming from. As for heels I have found that 1-2 inch block heels are the best opt if u can tolerate them and find them comfy. It is quite annoying tho cause legit 90%of heels are literally impossible to walk in esp if they are 3 or 4 inches high (I am a complete fashion lover so I have tried practicing with my moms heels for years (in my early 20s now) but glad to say short block heels are manageable, deff give them a try and u may find it works for u! *straps around the ankle are a must tho, just for that added support and security* Xx Good for you. I feel that my ankles are my weakest area and they are the first ones to start aching after running or doing some strenuous activity.", "Can I completely exclude Marfan? I was tested for marfan when i was 19 (in the early 90s) and the conclusion was I just had marfanoid habitus. I have pectus carinatum, lower back stretch marks, raised palate, and very tall slim, slightly disproportionate limbs but that is sort of normal for someone 6-5. Joints and finger lengths all normal and eyes also.\n\nI had a normal Echo at 19 and 30. All seems fine but i was reading some study online where its possible in rare cases for heart problems to develop past the age of 30, so its sort of been in the back of my mind what if I really do have but the key issues like heart had simply not yet developed, and now at 45 I do have heart issues.\n\nI guess I get paranoid sometimes. Should I be worried ? thinking of going to get another ECG for piece of mind but I get anxious and just forget about it for a while until it pops into my head sometimes.  Marfan is tricky because its not really black and white so still bothers me sometimes but i generally always thing negative about things so I guess that does not help. Any advice appreciated cheers. You do not need an ECG you need an echocardiogram/CT/MRI to measure your aorta. Get it done and get the measurements. Ideally, get a \"TAAD\" panel DNA test to see if you have markers that have been identified. Plus remember you have a 50/50 chance of passing it on if you have it - and the person can be significantly more impacted than you. \n\nMy dad's heart issues did not happen until he was older. My aorta needed fixing when I was 20. Sorry i edited my post, I meant Echocardiograms , not ECG. They were normal. What age did they develop for your dad? He did not need surgery until he was 50.\n\nFor me, I went from \"normal\" to surgery in less than a year. Fortunately I had two echos within six months due to moving. The second echo detected it. The day of surgery my aneurysm was at 8cm. &gt; Fortunately I had two echos within six months due to moving. \n\nAre you saying you were worried the strain of lifting heavy things and moving would cause the aneurysm to bulge, so you got imaged 2x 6 or months apart? My yearly scans were normal until ~33, when it shot up in one year and required surgery. I have been on meds since the age of 2 and monitored each year. 33 was early for my family, one generation back ended up having their first aorta surgeries in their late 40s. \n\nIt would probably be worth seeing a cardiologist periodically and getting an echo. Better than dropping dead unexpectedly. &gt; The day of surgery my aneurysm was at 8cm\n\nJesus H. Tapdancing Christ! Glad you found it and made it through. I went from 3.9 to 4.7 in one year and was in surgery shortly thereafter. But not rushed into it. I moved to a new country so got a new doc who wanted a new baseline. at my previous job in the US i sent in requests to insurance companies to pay for certain imaging requests, and it would definately be paid for here in the US if the reason for the exam is marfanoid habitus and suspected genetic condition. \n\nso if the insurance companies in one of the worst covered country have anything to say, its that you really should just keep an eye on your heart until you can rule out a genetic disease with a test. Why were you on meds from 2, if you had no cardiac issues? Yes I think i will go get checked just to make sure. Genetic testing is a lot cheaper than it used to be.  So that is an option.  But no matter how that goes, if routinely tell you your skin is super soft, I would not let my guard down. To prevent or delay them from occurring.

I am a bit worried You need to find and routinely see and trust your surgeon.  I do not have Marfan's specifically, more like hEDS, so my surgeon experienced with connective tissue disorders has a lower threshold for surgery for Marfan's or vEDS than mine.\n\nIf they feel it is growing too fast or reaches 3.5 cm or 4.5 or their goal for you, they will be able to suggest surgery, but only when the risk is less risky than doing nothing FOR YOU.\n\nI am 36 and we had a scare when a different machine showed it like 0.7 cm bigger than previous tests and we moved back to 3 month imaging.  He did not want to do surgery for me unless growing 0.5 to 1 cm a year (and I am around 4.8 cm now, so also too much past 5 overall we will discuss surgery as an option).\n\nFor reference he has a lot of men my age only then discover the anyeurism and many with Marfan's over 6.5 with great surgeries and recoveries when discovered. have you grown during this time period in terms of height and weight?  \nHave you been engaging in stressful sports and/or weight lifting?  \n\n\nI am talking about in between your echo done 3 years ago and the most recent one. Thanks for your answer. My doctor gave it no importance; in fact, I realized the new measurement after the meeting with him...

In the last 6 months, with the confinement, I bought an elliptical bicycle and I have been doing some weight lifting too (no more than 14kgs, starting very light), because my psychiatrist recommended me to do it... Do you think it may have influenced? Since there was a change in measurements of your aorta and the fact that you have marfanoid habitus - I highly recommend seeing a cardiologist and letting him know this information.\n\nyour measurements are still within safe range.For marfan patients dilation is considered bad starting at 40mm-45mm.\n\nregardless, I reiterate once again, because there was a change in your aortic size (this could be due to many reasons such as normal growth), but because you have marfanoid habitus I -highly- recommend seeing a -cardiologist- and explaining to him everything. First of all you should make sure to have all your imaging done in the same center, as different clinics have differently calibrated machines/methods of measurement. If you want to know what your \"true\" measurement is, you should scrap the echos and have an MRI.\n\n2nd of all a bicuspid aortic valve is a cause of aortic dilation/aneurysm by itself, irrespective of whether you have Marfan or not, so that is something to keep in mind. mine was checked in december via echo, and MRI. before i had my Nuss bars removed. I was 4cm, and also had mild prolapse as well. I seen the cardiologist last month and they told me they would check again with a MRI at the beginning of next year. He didnt seem too concerned.

Or that my confirmation bias is acting up and I am reading too much into too little. I feel so out of line over-analyzing this, but I cannot help it.\n\nSome background, or why I started thinking along these lines (not for medical advice reasons, just context): his physique always struck me as extraordinary. Nothing extreme, just that there is a cohesiveness to his attributes if that makes sense. Then I got familiar with Marfans, and something just clicked. He meets some of the criteria, some not. Have not 'examined' it closely, would be over the line, but it is impossible to not notice certain things, and it would make sense if it was Marfans. His family on one side follows a pattern of some attributes not present in everyone, but a majority. So it is  vague, and way too easy for someone with a mind like mine to run away with, but I would not call it ungrounded.\n\nI have talked about it with him once, and was planning on leaving it there. I addressed my concerns so that he had a possibility to take a stance in regards to his own health. Good, I thought, now I can leave it up to him and support him however he choses to deal with it. We have not talked about it since. But then I recently learned one of his relatives suffered one of the more extreme symtoms of the disease, and it all flared up again. I feel so bad that my mind went there and made something else out of what he told me in confidence, something that can be explained for many other medical reasons, something thatI should be able to trust health care professionals to screen for in these instances. *But I just cannot stop worrying.*\n\nI would be so grateful for some perspective on how you would like someone in my position to handle this. If I am way out of line and hypochondric by proxy (hard or even impossible for any of you to say I know).

", "FBN1 Genetics Question I have got a lot of the physical signs of Marfan Syndrome: heart murmur, long thin limbs, scoliosis, pectus excavatum, near sightedness, and flat footedness. I am thinking of going to see a geneticist and get tested for FBN1 (the Marfan Syndrome gene).\n\nMy questions are what if I only have a partial FBN1 gene? How does genetics work? Is it a black or white, yes or no answer or is there any such thing as partially having the Marfan Syndrome (FBN1) gene? Also, will getting this test help me know the odds of my children having this terrible condition?\n\n***PS, please do not tell me to consult with a doctor. I have gone through the typical physical assessment with the family doctor and all the family doctors know is to do some of the physical assessment and write me the referral to the genetics clinic. Unfortunately, there are no geneticists in my state and all the geneticists we can choose from have 6-10 month waiting times (how on Earth do geneticists have such long waiting times? is not it supposed to be a simple, automated process: take the blood, send to a lab, print the results. ?)*** It is possible to only have partial effects n maybe some more so than others. Like if youre tall, or skinny, or anything else you mentioned. My mother also has this as it is mostly heriditary, but she did not know it. What she thought was  to be a heart murmur was diagnosed 20 years later as Marfans when I got a bit older.  She has good feet n good body weight and is only slightly tall. I am 6'7 and fairly light for my weight and have bad feet, needing surgery in one a while back. Not sure much about genetics though my apologies  I am not that great with understanding the genetics part, but I do know there are mutations on the marfan gene. For instance I have the mutation FBN1 exon 13. Idk exactly what that means. But I recently had genetics testing on embryos, and they not only tested for my mutation, but also for those on either side in case the embryos had a different mutation. It is not always genetics though- I am the first one in my family to have marfans. \n\nThe way I understand it, your kids will always have a 50% chance of getting marfans if you have it. Drs have told me that what they generally see is kids typically mimic their parent's symptoms in regards to severity, although they could have slightly worse symptoms (a different mutation). In other words, if your kid has marfans, they will usually show the same signs as you, but not usually any less as they grow. Although the hospital I go to says there are always new advances in technology. For instance, they have been researching early intervention methods like meds they could give to a pregnant woman with a marfans baby that could help the baby have much less symptoms. \n\nPersonally, I decided to avoid this, and did ivf with embryos that had genetics testing. It is a very personal decision though, everyone has their issues, ours just happens to be marfans. For me, I have the flat feet, slight scoliosis, tall and lanky. I had Pectus carinatum, but had surgery for that. I have also had my aortic root replaced, and have had both my lungs randomly collapse. I am currently pregnant with my first and am considered a high risk pregnancy cause of the marfan. If I had not had the heart surgery though, the drs would not have recommended I get preggers and the fertility clinic says they would not have treated me. \n\nThere are also other syndromes like Loeys Dietz that are often mistakenly diagnosed as marfans, but are treated a little differently, so it is still important to get on the wait list to get tested. I am by no means an expert in any of this, I am just regurgitating what drs have told me, and going from my own experience. \n\nI wish you so much luck! You either have a mutation of FBN1 (Marfan Syndrome) or you do not (no Marfan Syndrome). The way the disease presents can be different for different mutations and in different people. For example family members with the same mutation can have different severity of disease. Or unrelated people with different mutations can have the same symptoms. If that does not answer your question, I am happy to try again. Just let me know.  Afik it is quite simple. If your fbn1 gene is \"not normal\" (i.e mutated) you will end up with connective tissue problems. The exact position of your mutation is probably different from mine, and that might impact the degree and nature of our various complications. But we both will have connective tissue problems, especially the usual suspects like aortic aneurysm etc  You can have Marfan syndrome without the genetic mutation. It is unusual but it does happen I snooped around at OMIM.org,  \n\n\n.\n\nIf I understand correctly, FBN1 is a big gene, and mutations can occur anywhere.  Some may be harmless, or relatively benign; while others may be rather lethal.  Genetic testing would probe for *some* of the *known* mutations (137 as of 1998).  If you exactly matched a healthy FBN1, they could say it was not Marfans.  If you did not match the healthy, or any of the known / common Marfans mutations, then they would still have to diagnose based on physical signs.    \n\nshows that if you have it, there is a 50% chance for any of your kids to inherit.

Hello everybody. I hope everyone is doing okay. \nI wanted to ask the marfans on the younger side (college/high school/young adults) how are they dealing with dating in such a sexualized society like the one we live in today. I just graduated from college, and never felt comfortable going to parties or trying to hook up with girls because I always thought that young women perceive the Marfan physique as rather unattractive.\nI know in the long run, one should not focus solely on physical traits for picking a partner but dating as a young man always seemed very cool to me, being a bachelor. I just want to have that kind of experience before I get older. \n\nI appreciate any thoughts, testimonials or opinions. Thanks for reading! I currently do not even bother. Granted, I am probably an overly cynical case, but I just decided to focus on my classes and platonic friendships instead. If I felt like something was missing, I would try to make an effort to fill that gap with something productive or tangibly rewarding, or just enjoyable like my hobbies. I am no nine-to-fiver, mind you, since I am filling most of my time with full class schedules when I can to finish college in a reasonable time, but keeping busy keeps the mind from thinking about what we do not have.\n\nI would also be mildly curious how others go about it, since I have noticed a general atmosphere these days, at least in my social circles, of people being more offput by relationship seeking, whether Marfans or not. But that might just be selection bias. Yeah I am a 17 year old dude with marfans. Never had a proper date/relationship in my life and I am sure that is almost certainly partly due to how it affects our looks. Do you have any other specific questions I can answer?\ud83d\udc4d Wow I wish I felt about this like you mate. Lucky you lol I honestly would not recommend it. I might have accidently made it sound idealistic, but there are downsides. People get really wierded out when someone resigns themself to the single life indefinitely at such a young age, and then see them stick with it so consistently for so long. It almost becomes this awkward \"wall\" between me and other people, like they think I am some misanthrope who hates everyone or something. So others I have known who have done the same and felt that \"wall\" start to form felt \"cut off\" and felt pressured to start dating again and, when they have another setback, the cycle  repeats itself. And when they see others live that lifestyle without feeling that same pressure, they start to get weirded out too. I might not be explaining it the best, but I never really discuss it, so may as well wordshop it. A guy with Marfans here. Never a problem. The upside - tall, lanky, never overweight, etc. outweighs the slightness of build. Maybe it is gender specific, or maybe not (I have seen a few female models that would appear to have Marfans).\n\nI had cystular acne, teeth that came in every direction but straight, and thick glasses. Any of those was a bigger issue in my mind than Marfans.\n\nGood luck. 22F. I feel you on that one and I have never been in a relationship.

Chalk it up to OCD, I suppose, but anything we do excludes us from doing something else, and I get overly hung up on those details and hate when people do not acknowledge the negatives of something when talking about the positives. I am a bit older than you are asking for but this is my story. I spent HS and college years single, had a couple of hookups, but that was more thanks to my roommate at the time being a smooth talker. I eventually stopped caring what others thought of my body, focused on myself with exercise and hobbies. I would tell myself \"what will be will be,\" and do crazy things like climb mountains and what not and post pictures on social media.  One day a girl on MySpace (yeah, I am old) messaged me, neither of us claimed to be interested in a relationship. Then things turned sexual and when we did meet up I thought it will be another hookup and done. Thing is, we really liked each other, after the first date we agreed to meet up the following weekend. This quickly turned into sex daily. About a month or so in I muttered the FWB killing words and said 'I love you' and she said it back, been married 12 years now. I do not really have any advice except to focus on yourself and the things you enjoy and your confidence will improve whether you realize it or not, and confidence is much sexier than being worried what they think of your body. 22 M. I used to had similar problems when I was younger but I realized real quick that an authentic character outweighs things like muscles. And that counts for relationships and hookups! Just put yourself out there if you are interested in it and you will see. For a start, dating apps can help but getting to know people in real life turned out to be the more sustainable way. I hope you get what I mean, otherwise feel free to ask me anything. 24F and have had really no problem. I highly recommend dating apps because I used to be self conscious and thinking no guy would find me attractive etc until i got on dating apps and got a ton of matches. I have had some casual flings as well as 2 relationships come from dating apps It took me a while before I had my first real girlfriend, maybe that is due to the marfans look but probably more to do with my lack of confidence due to being teased. I also was a bit clueless, now that I reflect I can see that there were interested women but I had no clue at the time \ud83d\ude05\n\nOnce I got the ball rolling I have had no trouble. You will meet people who like you for your personality not your body. You do not want to date someone who is only going to like you if you fit a certain look anyway.\n\nTo be honest I think the tall lanky look has helped more than its hindered. It was my confidence holding me back. I mean, speaking as a woman who is married to a man with Marfan syndrome, I can say that we do not all perceive the stereotypical Marfan physique as unattractive. I have always been attracted to tall, lanky/skinny guys, and I am not the only one in my circle of friends to feel that way; my BFF Paul also goes for that type of build. I will say, though, that in my experience, the guys I dated who did not fit the stereotypically \"attractive\" build were almost always more insecure and less attractive to me because of that. Guys like my husband tend to be (again, this is just my experience) more sure of themselves and who they are as a person, their likes and dislikes, their worldview, things like that, and that has always been much more attractive to me. I do not. Plenty of friends that I enjoy spending time with, and I tend to keep to myself...mostly cause talking for an extended period of time hurts. Had a pneumothorax happen a couple years along with scoliosis and shifting ribs which typically restricts breathing. No real shortage of female interest just a lack of interest on my part out of not wanting to burden a significant other.", "Marfans and Weed? I have Marfan Syndrome and was wondering if smoking weed is an issue or not? What have some of your doctors said? Is it not a big deal at all? I would say the main risk is high blood pressure coming from the smoke but that can be managed a lot of ways. it does wonders for joint pain so i switched to concentrates for the most part to try and avoid some of the stuff in smoke, and my dr cleared me for a medical card. but at the end of the day everybody\u2019s situation is a bit different as far as what you are at risk for so consult with the dr, but most likely you will be fine :) sweet because i smoke pretty much everyday and it is been about 8 months and was able to get a med card at 18. for the most part it helps with practically all my pain especially from my sternum, plus if smoke is an issue then i am sure edibles will be a perfect replacement Smoking or vaping is not a great idea for vascular reasons. However much this affects you will depend on your specific presentation of Marfans Syndrome. May matter a lot, may not. I will say that I am not aware of any specific risk relating to weed itself, other than potential blood pressure changes; consuming eg nicotine is likely to be riskier because of the above + well-documented vasoconstriction.\n\nTldr; probably riskier than smoking is for a normal person, which is already not great. But it is probably unlikely to kill you directly in the near term unless your version of Marfans presents with significant cardiovascular issues already. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Up to you to determine acceptable risk. Nicotine is definitely something I refuse to touch at all so I only smoke weed, I hear what you are saying and personally I do accept the risks because I feel that the benefits outweigh the negatives (in my specific case), but regardless I will ask my cardiologist when I get an echocardiogram next week! Expect them to not be thrilled. But unless you have cardiac/bp issues already, I think the risk is similar to smoking in general. Maybe slightly more. But if you are cool with the risks of general smoking then I do not think the calculus changes a lot. \n\n(If you have an aortic repair or something... Do not smoke.) I could only imagine what they might say... Worst case scenario if I have to quit then at least edible THC is available! Edibles are likely to be fine, yeah. They will probably have to warn you about potential bp issues for liability reasons, but lots of things raise bp. Caffeine, for instance, which is also a drug. So meh. I would you are under 26, just be aware that since you are still having quite a bit if brain development you can have higher risk for anxiety and some other issues. \n\nI find that blends with a higher CBD content tend to help me better with my pain issues, and less impact on mental health. I have said it here before but had low BP issues.  Not sure what strain or conditions that day caused it, and it was rare, but it got the the point I lost vision a few times.\n\nI still occasionally enjoy but something to keep in mind as you change meds/your body changes. I take cannabis every evening and have for many years without problems. I do vary the form, from edibles, to oils, to vaping and smoking. I find it is help to stabilize my mood, improved my sleep and help with end-of-the day body pains. \n\nI have not talked with a doctor about it as I quit doing follow ups with my specialist a decade ago. I personally am unable to smoke or vape because I have got asthma. I use concentrated oils and basically use them like edibles.. In the beginning I had some issues with my blood pressure shooting up but it is been over a year that I have been using weed for pain management so I have figured out my tolerance/dosing.\n\nInterestingly enough I have got pretty bad allergies to essentially the entire planet, which includes \"exotic grasses\", and occasionally certain strains will set off my allergies. I have no idea if weed was what my allergist meant by exotic grasses but it *is* a plant lol. Wow that is an interesting case! I am glad you can at least resort to edibles for pain relief, it definitely helps identically well! Interesting, I will start trying to include CBD type flower elements such as Lavender or something to see if I feel a difference! It is kind of bizarre and I was not sure what was happening at first, but it is an identical reaction I have to fresh cut grass. Now I only notice if I am out of allergy medicine. You can also buy CBD flower online. I would like to say that anecdotally I can confirm that long term heavy use in teenager and young adults does increase the risk of psychosis and schizophrenia and other mental illness, and to look at combining marijuana with PT, anti-inflammatory drugs like naproxen and the classic hot shower. These are all really common recommendations with any pain med.\nI know this message is not something that you hear a lot, and I am sending conflicting messages, it is just that it can have some negative consequences that you need to be fully informed about in order to safely use. Lavender does not have CBD in it. CBD and THC have very specific interactions with your serotonin receptors. You will not get as high, but if you are going for pain management, you do not want to get super stoned When it is processed it is denaturing the proteins that your body is reacting to. Your maybe not getting complete combustion, or your reacting to the smoke. One of the higher risk issues with smoking we need to consider with marfan's is lung collapse, regardless of substance. Using a water pipe, tincture or vape can help with that. High blood pressure comes from smoke, but the higher risk is from racing heart or palpitations when stoned, which can cause a sudden increase in blood pressure. I know I am talking about a lot of the risks, but I do want to note that I have been using marijuana for about twenty years pretty consistently, and I do think that it has some benefits. But like any medicine, its a complicated tool.\n\nMy Mom actually comes from a community in Maine where some families brought marijuana plants with them when they emigrated to the states, and have been using it as medicine for generations. Interesting. I do not smoke it at all I just put a couple drops of distillate or RSO onto something like gummies and eat it. But my parents smoke (not around me) so maybe I am reacting to theirs. Literally was hitting the bowl as this popped lmao. Could cause paranoia on occasions where you find your heart racing. Otherwise avid toker for10 years.   Maybe stay away from huge dabs that may cause you to cough a lung up. Otherwise not sure what adverse effect it would have. Yeah, allergy and asthma issues are so tricky! sometimes my heart kicks into overdrive when I get a bit too stoned, and I cannot imagine that is helpful for people with an already strained aorta. that being said, weed helps tremendously with my anxiety, joint pain, and gets me quickly to sleep at night. I have tried cbd and it is helpful, but not as much. thc affects everyone differently.", "Question: how has your dating life been impacted by Marfans? keeping it real: muscle / average weight is attractive to a lot of people, but with the struggles of gaining weight / lifting hanging over our shoulders, i am curious as to how that has impacted your dating life? \n\nI feel as if it is incredibly difficult to garner interest as a skinny person. I am sure others feel the same. I think that it has a huge impact. I also think the extreme height has an impact for some people. I am 6'5\" and female. That is incredibly tall. Then pile on being thin, sometimes in weird places. I also have fairly distinct Marfan facial features (downturned eyes, very long face). Then pile on health problems and future health problems because everything just gets worse as you age. It does not really sound like an attractive package, right?\n\nBut who knows. Maybe I would struggle with dating no matter what (although I do not think so). I feel like I fall into this unfortunate pattern where I only have guys interested in me occasionally (due to being 6'5\" with unconventional facial features) and I always mess it up because I try to make everything perfect because I get interest so rarely. I overanalyze everything. If I was a 'normal' girl I assume I would be like 'who cares if this does not work out plenty of fish in the sea'...but I know there is not plenty of fish. \n\nAnyway. I definitely think it has a big impact. That being said my mom and aunt and uncle who are affected were/are married. My two cousins with Marfan are married or in a relationship. So who flipping knows. Sorry to write so much but I think about this stuff a lot. It is my time to shine: I am an older dude and I married a beautiful woman. So I feel as though this is a problem I effectively \"solved\". And I will walk you through what I learned.\n\nFor background, I have the typical Marfan Syndrome build. I am skinny, and at the time of attracting my wife I was in no way athletic or muscular (and it is really only gone downhill from there, I got to be honest). I am not an ugly dude, but I am also not particularly handsome. We will call me average for the sake of reference.\n\nSo, you need to think of your attractiveness in effectively two parts, the first part acts as the foundation to the second, so we will start there. The foundation of your attractiveness is confidence. That is a really vague term at the end of the day, so let me try to be more specific. Confidence means that you are happy with yourself. This can be very hard to do for someone with Marfan Syndrome (or anyone else who suffers from some set of physical abnormality, be it obesity, deformation, whatever). However, it is the most important thing you can do both for yourself and your future partner: Be ok with yourself. Hell, love yourself. Because what this means is that you will not compromise yourself. It signals to someone else that you have respect for yourself and will have respect for others and will not compromise them either.\n\nOn top of that, be funny. Humor is the key to attracting a good partner. If you bring humor into your life, then every day will be a happy one. My wife has told me time and again that making her laugh was one of the biggest reasons she became attracted to me. If you do not feel like you are funny, do not despair. You are in luck: it is a learned skill, but it takes patience to learn. Do theater, join an improv class, try standup. You will learn. MAKE FUN OF YOURSELF. I know this sounds counter to my point above, but really it is not. It takes genuine confidence in one's self to be able to make fun of themselves. And if you cannot make fun of yourself, you have NO BUSINESS making fun of anyone else, so start there. Learn to laugh, and you will bring a lifetime of happiness both to yourself and your partner. I promise you.\n\nE\\*: If you struggle with confidence and you are a young person, I have good news for you: With age comes confidence. Sure, it comes in the form of a curmudgeonly, 'I do not give a crap what you think' kind of confidence, but hey it counts. 6\u20198\u201d 21 yo Male with Loeys-Dietz. My chest is outward along with thin limbs and just a bunch of weird stuff tbh. I used to think that my appearance hindered my ability to be in a relationship with anyone. That is until I met my current SO who accepts me for me. For our first date we went to the beach (which I am sure many of you can understand why the beach is awkward for us). I figured I would break the ice by being straightforward with the things that made me self conscious (my chest, my feet, etc) by telling her. Yes I told her everything on the first date bc I was so nervous lol.\n\nAfter the initial \u201cwoah\u201d moment she was completely fine with everything. In fact she said that she loved my body and that she is never seen anyone with a body like mine. Fast forward to now, we live together, she is helped me recover from aortic root surgery, and so much more. \n\nYes, people do judge us from time to time but I do believe that some of the hinderance in the dating scene is in our head. If you develop some confidence and take the time to explain to people you just might be surprised. Hell- I was and still am Second the humor advice. Happy to hear that you are doing well \u263a\ufe0f Yeah, sharing those intimate details with someone creates a bond. Same thing for us; when I shared with her that I had a pectus excavatum, she told me later that it felt like I was trusting her with a secret, and it was incredibly intimate. The right person will feel the same. I am not sure why I think this, but I feel as though women have it worse than men when it comes to the impact Marfan Syndrome has on your dating life. Still though, I think the advice I posted in this thread still applies to you. I think you are right, though. You cannot over-analyze and try to make everything perfect. I heard a great quote once that I have always thought was true: \"No one wants to be in a club that actually wants them as a member.\" It is weird, but you got to make people earn the right to date you.  Your mantra has to be \"Bitch, I am fabulous.\" Cause you are. Yes, you, /u/llamalobster. You are fucking fabulous with your crazy ass bird obsession. OH YES, I LOOKED. Next time a boy does not seem to get how awesome you are, show him your tits. No, I mean your bushtit posts. The birds. Rock his ornithological world. I am 29 with Marfans and have had no dating life. Most of my life I really had no interest in dating or relationships. When I tried asking girls out the past two years it was just a world of hurt.\n\nI am on disability and with my surgeries and need to see specialists, I cannot afford to lose my insurance. So right now, working is not a good option. (And people I speak to about it all seem to agree).\n\nI really have no means to date and have found it impossible. My whole life I have just never connected with anyone that way. I have had crushes before but they were girls who were either already taken or they just did not have that kind of interest in me. \n\nHonestly, it is caused a lot of emotional scarring that I have just been trying to heal from. It can be very hard seeing young couples holding hands, or hearing from my single friends that they found someone. I am becoming much less sensitive about it lately though.\n\nI have an easy life, and I have my mom to support me, but I have given up on trying to find love. \n\nI do not know how much of it has to do with Marfans but I feel like for my life in particilar, it just seems like something I cannot win.\n\nThe best I can do is try to enjoy my life the best I can and trust in God. But I do not expect any partner to come out of the blue and have a relationship. I do not even know what that would be like.\n\nSorry if I sound like a debby downer. I am just telling you my experience. Thanks. I think that confidence has to come from somewhere though, right? And I am confident in the fact that I am funny, smart, a decent person, etc....but that is all irrelevant in terms of dating because my face looks weird. And that just kind of is what it is. I do not know how to truly  be confident when I know deep down that I am ugly, and that ugliness comes from having a genetic disorder....I am literally ugly for a reason, like my face is advertising that my genes should not be passed on. Also I promise I am not a bird obsessed weirdo lol. I post in divorced birds because it is more of a story telling subreddit, and I am obsessed with writing and story telling. Dude, that is awesome. I have discovered something new today, and now I have to go check that out.\n\nAs for looks, you seem to have sold yourself on the fact that you are ugly, but have you considered the fact that maybe you are simply not your type? But I guarantee you, you are someone is type. You are lots of people's type. Just not yours, and that is ok. So do not write yourself off just because you do not want to date you. I have gotten implicit and explicit feedback that I am not attractive from other people. As a tall woman, height usually has an impact but I just had to get over it. Ultimately it does not matter. \n\nOther than needing a bit of extra help from a long term partner (driving to or from procedures or realizing when you) it never really effected my short term dating. \n\nIf anything, since I know I do want a kid or two, it has a larger impact on choosing a partner that would or would not pass on marfans to a child. Hmm, what is a dating life? \ud83e\udd14\n\nI hear people talk about it but not sure if I am missing out on something. Is it part of Amazon Prime? Maybe that is why I am missing out? Have not we all. I bet you have also gotten implicit and explicit feedback that you ARE attractive Not really. Generally most guys I have went thru the talking phase with in the past have just thought and vocalized how they felt about me being really thin - so on that basis it was hard making things work. - most of them assumed I had an eating disorder and ofc that is a straight turn off (so I have been told by some of them)\n\nFor ref im a 21 y/o f, 5 6\" aprox 130lbs\n\nMy 1st bf (which was awful compatibility -i went with it cause I was a bit shocked he was okay with my marfan features and ofc I was excited to have my 1st relationship at 18) anyway once we dated for a few months he made a joke this one time that I looked like an auschwitz survivor.. after that I kind of lost hope in dating but ended up dating someone new a year later who never brought up my marfan features or how thin I am - with both relationships I never bothered sharing I had marfans but best thing I can say is to not worry - people can overlook these things, a few months ago I started seeing this guy and now we are official but b4 that i felt it necessary to tell him i have marfans and hes fine with it - yes i feel weird seeing how perfect (normal) his health is compared to mine (and tbh I get kind of baffled that hes accepted me for all these medical flaws) but it simply reminds me that appearances are not everything. With marfans - regardless of where u r on the spectrum its necessary to just accept that we r different, and its completely okay. Like yes we r thin, maybe have super thick glasses or extremely tall, some of us have awful scoliosis or flat feet and theres no need to elaborate on the cardiac complications that any marfans person could have. \n\nWith all this said, dont stress that dating will be difficult, just be you and the right person will see right thru marfans - because beauty fades but who u are is forever. *also if any1 decides to be a nuisance or insensitive to you about ur marfans they arent worth it (just as my ex proved with his horrible Auschwitz joke - did not help that he was German like really??). \n\nBack to the point dating at the end of the day is to find love/a partner and any1 who has the audacity to make u feel unloved or unaccepted ovr marfans isint worth ur time and amazing presence. I never noticed my boyfriend looked different (hump from scoliosis, one leg shorter than the other, skeletor skinny etc) I could tell he was extremely self conscious but I did not care. We met each other years before we started dating so no infatuation (in case you wondering lol). I whole hardheadedly endorse the evilschwin.  despite his evilness and schwin-ness.\n\nConfidence is going to be hard to come by at a young age when you have a named condition, however it is a blessing in disguise.  Everyone has their crap, you will come to terms with it while some people just... never do.\n\nI have dated people who (cosmetically) were *way* \"out of my league\".  There is no such thing.  It is a fake concept and the sooner you realize that the better.  Focus on having a good time.  Focus on enjoying the conversation with someone.  Focus on finding out more about the parts that your curious about and just enjoying company.\n\nSad part is that is really the way it is supposed to work for everyone/every relationship regardless of their genes... I always liked you. ;-) I relate as a woman too. My face is average when I am smiling (otherwise I have a downturned mouth and really flat cheekbones), and I am 5'8. But my back is *fucked.* Beyond fucked. And I suspect I have pectus excavatum. I was bullied for my appearence in school and this shattered me. I look at the mirror and see my dating prospects out the window. I try to not have this affect my mental health but I am objectively in bad shape. \n\nAlthough, weirdly enough, I sometimes romanticise the extreme ways marfan can manifest in. I have a huge crush on Javier Botet for instance. And I wish my height had exceeded 6 feet. I wonder if this is a coping mechanism. \nBut oh well. &gt;For ref im a 21 y/o f, 5 6\" aprox 130lbs\n\nYou have been called an Auschwitz survivor before you have gained this weight? I am 112lbs and I do not assume I am *that* visibly thin. Back then when that happened I was 18 and around 90 pounds, and ikrr As a girl, not being able to make any booty has had a negative impact on my confidence. Felt that big time, since being thick is what is desired these days, being 5\u20192\u201d and 85 pounds is not really cutting it \ud83e\udd74 Not to sound so extra but if ur an adult maybe consider a bbl (Brazilian but lift). I have the same issue, all my weight goes to my mid section so I am potentially looking into the plastic surgery route in a few yrs - maybe around 25 (21 atm), but only if it is safe for my body, could be an opt if you rlly desire such figure. And yes ik this is not a popular idea and not an end all solution to marfans ruining our weight proportions but hey whatever ones comfortable with;) xoxo best of luck gitl Yeah I have actually been considering it later as well! It is made for people with a similar problem anyways! A butt would be nice, we will see how it goes. Best of luck to you too xoxo", "Is it ok to drink protein shakes? My brother just bought a huge 2.5kg bag of Mass Gainer. I am not sure what he is trying to do... Why would it not be ok to drink protein shakes? I do not really know how protein shakes work \ud83d\ude05\nBut if you drink them, does not it mean you have to exercise as well? I am worried he is planning to push himself more with the weight lifting. Actually a good question, but you can rest assured that nothing will effect you any different than a regular person.\n\nIf you want to bulk up, the best way to do it is to eat. And by that I mean really eat. Mass builder and other protein shakes can help but they cannot replace a good diet. So you need to take it with a meal plan.\n\nAlso, it is not impossible to gain some mass while having marfan but it is does make it difficult. The key is exercise as it will tone your muscles. If you just eat and take extra protein, the fat will just go to your stomach.\n\nI thought I could never get fat but after buying my own food I have actually put on weight. I am still not the bulky person I want to be but at least I am not looking like I am sick all the time.\n\nI hope this helps. My understanding is that it is fine as long as you shout \u201cBEEFCAKE\u201d while you drink it. \n\nSeriously though, there is nothing wrong with protein shakes, and it could be a good nutrition supplement (not replacement) for meals to keep weight up if you are otherwise having trouble maintaining weight. But yeah, do not weight lift. You can use them to fill calorie gaps and for meal replacement too. He may be planning to do that to put on some weight, or to expect them to work miracles during weight lifting (they will not).\n\nIf you drink them to excess you just get fat, like any other food. Lol I am getting used to it. I am 1,84 and 58 kg due to metabolism(3000kcal daily diet) and casual athletic routine, I pay a lot of attention on my eating habits and I am very healthy overall (never get sick, on schedule with docs and nutritionists etc..), everything is ok despite the fact that almost every week I get people talking about how I look sick cus Im skinny and should improve my health habits. I see! Thanks a lot! Thanks for the info! This helps a lot! That is a relief to hear. Thanks! &gt;My understanding is that it is fine as long as you shout \u201cBEEFCAKE\u201d while you drink it. \n\nI am dying right now \ud83d\ude02", "Do u guys think i have marfan?

No. They are both connective tissue disorders, but the defect in the connective tissue is different. For EDS, it is a collagen defect. Collagen is a group of proteins that add strength to connective tissue.   \n\n\nFor Marfan syndrome, it is a defect in protein called fibrillin-1. Copy/pasting the next bit: \"Marfan syndrome is caused by a defect (or mutation) in the gene that tells the body how to make fibrillin-1. This mutation results in an  increase in a protein called transforming growth factor beta, or TGF-\u03b2.  The increase in TGF-\u03b2 causes problems in connective tissues throughout body.\" (  \n\n\nSo, they are related in that they both have problems with connective tissue proteins, which can result in joint pain, skin manifestations, eye problems, vascular involvement, etc.   \n\n\nSince they are different in their mechanisms, the complications also do differ in many ways, so it is important to consult a geneticist and identify which you have so that you may seek appropriate treatment. Thank you I have heard the syndromes referred to as cousins, so similar but not the same. MFS affects fibrillin, EDS affects collagen. There are many similarities and differences. is there a way to test the increase in that protein?", "I am really scared. ", "Depression Hello people. Has anybody had an unremitting case of depression following your diagnosis? Ive been feeling very bad for the last 2 years.

I find this subbreddit slightly better than facebook groups so Iam turning to you :)\n No depression at least not from being diagnosed with marfans. Mine came as a relief as i finally felt i was correctly diagnosed. I was a 12 year old so i made sure to not get in fights and to keep my chest protector on while riding dirt bikes and normal bikes.\n\nWent to college got my associates and starting my bachelor's pretty soon. Work in IT as a network tech for a school. I think that is really professional. Been married for 6 years, was engaged for 2 years, dated for 2 years, and have known each over for 15 years.\n\nShe knew i had something as we all grew up in the same school system but i had friends to protect me from and dumbasses and did not stir or fck with anyone to begin with. Within the first  3 months of dating i told her what i had and how it effected me on a daily basis and a long term basis. That last comment is very uplifting, hope I can get to that level one day. I do not want to be overly negative but realistic. My life fell apart as my condition worsened. I managed to finish a master's degree but by the end, it progressed to the level where I was unable to work. 5 years later, I am highly educated but cannot handle more than a few hours a week. Things are on a steep decline over the past year but I can just hope it is cyclical and I improve. I do not really know where I go from here if there is not a massive turnaround.  A few things:\n\n1) chronic health issues have a higher incidence of depression the general pop.\n\n2) recently it seems there are studies to suggest that even after adjusting for that, connective tissue disorders have a higher incidence of depression and mood disorder.\n\n3) heart health has a documented and strong emotional impact.\n\nI feel very strongly that it is important to treat mood disorders as you would any other symptom of marfans.  This should include counciling and may include medication.  I wish I had done that years ago.\n\nEveryone is different, and I do not want to compare my situation with yours, but I have had a number of very fulfilling romantic relationship over the years, with the normal highs and lows that come with that.  Im not sure your age but I remember growing up how awkward  my weight etc made me feel.  As an adult, the character I have  gained from dealing with that and the kind of partner it is allowed me to be is usually the best thing I bring to the table; it is a rare gift and something  that is appreciated the older you get.  I have been self employed for the last 7 (which has taken more of a toll on my mental health than anything else to be honest).  There are times this was harder than for your average bear, but counciling and some mood drugs helped tremendously.\n\nFor me, the hardest part was being able to relate.  I had heart surgery about a year ago, and for the two years leading up to it I had no idea how sick I was.  Most of my friends were stressing about planning weddings and honey moons, and I was planning surgery and recovery.  There are times it made me bitter, for sure.\n\nI will say this, however, you will be a stronger person for all of it.  If you choose to have a partner someday, you will be able to support them and empathize better.  If you choose to have a family, you will be able to pass on the strength you gained.  And yes, in time, those will both be options for you like everyone else.\n\nIt can be a raw deal, but it is the deal you got.  There are times you may feel alone or overwhelmed.  You get to; it can be lonely and overwhelming.  Much like the protagonist in any story, this is a quest you cannot refuse or walk away from, but it will leave your life enriched.

But I was wondering do cardiologists have to specifically look for Marfan symptoms or would they pick up Marfan related symptoms on a general test?. Like is it something they have to specifically be looking for? Yes I know I am probably stressing too much but want to be sure. I am getting the genetic testing done soon so I can know once and for all.  The Marfan's related heart issues would be aortic root dilation and mitral valve prolapse.  If there were any issues with your aorta or mitral valve, your echocardiogram would not have come back \"good\", as you said.  My sister, daughter, and I all have aortic root dilation, and my sister had surgery on her mitral valve.  All were obvious issues on an echocardiogram.  Hope this helps even a little to put your mind at ease :) Okay thankyou that does put my mind at ease quite a bit. I have just got so many of the physical characteristics which is why I asked for a genetic test. The reason I went to the doc in the first place was for heart palpations, so I suggested to the doc I think I might have Marfans. But as the heart came back clear the doc was not worried about the palpations. Thanks for the reply.  I wish I had a dollar for everytime some medical test did not find something which later showed up *when they were specifically looking for it*.  For echo., maybe it does not matter, because heart problems can progress, and they need to check periodically anyway.   ", "How did I go 27 years with this body never realizing what is wrong! In process of Getting diagnosed currently  I would say because not many people know about marfans or what it is and consist of. I think there is many people with it that do not have the knowledge that they indeed have it, which is why spreading awareness is important, I think. \n\nPs: you are very pretty. You do not look bad at all. I am waaaaay skinnier than you are and I am a guy lol. Good luck in your diagnosis journey! My body has changed like this recently but idk if it is progression  or the weight loss I cannot do angering about that makes the hunch and indent that much more apparent, but I started noticing an indent of my chest and over all a more broad build with narrowing hips. Have had cardiac issues and wondered why it said my echo was suboptimal due to my body hiatus. I assume my chest deformity (which now I look back and all my aunts have had this to an extremely disabling point ) and my sister had to have her impala Ed removed after similar findings and them pushing on her chest and lungs it kind of broke her as she contemplated surgery after her kids for 5-6 years and finally plunged and spent a ridiculous amount for them tatas I have always had Lank but I have never been this skinny :( I hate it so much. I am insanely jacked though I think the thinning skin and hormonal imbalance give me vascularity almost everywhere. I do not really have a narrow palate but then again maybe I do bc I think my voice is annoying as shit You look fine to me. Also, you seem to have a bit of scoliosis, might want to get that one checked as well. This may be possibly eds since my family has it and such severe hunched over scoliosis. The sad thing is noticed this plus a clicking and misplacement of my shoulder so I called and made an appt wirh a chiropractor. My appt was supposed to include X-rays and an adjustment. The doctor refused to do the X-rays bc he said there is nothing wrong with me and he has been doing this for years etc. she I threw a fit and said you are not adjusting me without an X-ray. So he does ONE of my neck. Like not even shoulders up. And I did see some curve to the side starting and he said \u201csee I knew you are perfectly fine, curves are normal anyway\u201d and sent me on my way. I am on my way to their office currently to pickup my X-ray and I want to say something so bad I am sorry you had someone treat you that way. Keep pushing, for every 10 that do not listen you will find one that does. \ud83d\ude25 Ps you are very pretty I am the same age &amp; almost identical build and waiting for my formal diagnosis as well! Glad that we can find like bodies in this community &amp; hope it helps you to feel less strange &amp; alone. Wishing you the best friend! Thank you so much for the compliment. :) but yes I agree I am sadly waiting for a month until I move to a much bigger city to start looking for a provider who has experience in these areas. OKC is where I am located now and there just is not enough practitioners who have egos that are threatened by education in their patients let along they just cannot stand a patient being proactive in their care. I just picked up my X-rays and they are so worthless I cannot believe he refused to do my entire back! I am in Iowa and Iowa city has pretty fantastic doctors. My daughter is having a spinal fusion in sept and people come from Alaska just to have him, but I am not sure if he is just a Peds doctor or not. I am not sure where you are moving too, but If UOI is an option, it is a good one! Thank you. And thank you again! This is the 3rd year I have had such horrible experiences my literal shoulder blades are visibly off and my shoulders roll forward and it is obvious I have this chest indent thing as does everyone in my family. I just picked my X-rays up and they seem so useless. To me anyway. Hopefully a new practitioner will be able to detect something from them or at least look at my posture and tell me I am anything but \u201chealthy and fine\u201d I will not give up and I refuse to let me fate be that of my aunts (complete bending / cane effect from hunching over and needing walkers) sure that may be my fate but I would love to prolong this as soon as I can! The sad thing is my other aunt passed from lung infection and she had all her wits and I used. To stay with her and had no idea I had these issues at the time or asked about her health. Her sister who is also severely disabled from all the physical ailments and deformities but she has Lewy body and Parkinson\u2019s so she thinks her fingers and toes and spine are from an accident she had at work. I do not have hospital records that go back further than 2012 for her but I found the mention of these diseases but no record since 2012 of any treatment or regard to them anymore. Once you are old and fragile the ER just basically sees you as \u201cold\u201d and no other details are necessary Good luck with your diagnosis! Guess this is why the Marfan Foundation urges ppl to \u201cknow the signs,\u201d so ppl like you can finally get answers! You look great BTW,  you probably just have a mild case  that the only makes you look better , marfan is not always bad, sometimes all it does is literally makes you look good , lol Mu body also does not look like a marfan body , but my brother you can diagnose him with just seeing his body , he got all symptoms , does marfan syndrome have levels of symptoms ? I have no idea actually. I am very confused on it bc my family has EDS but not severe in immediate family only great aunts and uncles are severely deformed. This may be bc of their age too idk. But I have had on and off flares of EDS but then it goes away.... I think that the only thing that we need to care about is aortic aneurysm I am in Chicago going through testing for Marfan Syndrome and I cannot speak highly enough about Northwestern Cardiology. They have a dedicated Marfan research program. It is worth checking out if it is not too difficult.\n\n\"Meet the Downtown Chicago Marfan Syndrome Team | Northwestern Medicine\"  Also thank you ever since you mentioned scoliosis that makes perfect sense wirh my pain and stuff, but what is it that you can tell? Two chiropractors never mentioned it despite me asking and refused to do X-rays so I am just SOL. Hopefully I can find better luck when I move next week in my new city Retina detachment Do not get down on yourself! Glad you are getting tested. Most people with no idea about Marfans will say that you look normal. You look fantastic, by the way! Keep us updated. \nP.S. I have been living with it for 40 years. Yes, it does.

Does anyone have suggested/concerns that he should bring up to his doctor?", "Please help support my 1st Marfan's Annual trip. Low income student struggling with Dural Ectasia and Marfan's ", "Can I gain any muscle mass with Marfans? I am 15F and while I know that people with Marfans are likely to stay skinny I still want to gain muscle and at least see any sort of change in my appearance. I have been doing exercises every night (no weight lifting just at home stuff) for quite a while now and I do not see any loss of fat around my stomach or any muscle on my abs or legs. Is it *actually* possible for me to gain muscle or am I just wasting my time? Yes, it is possible but you can cannot safely get all \u201cswole\u201d. \n\nSwimming, light cardio, tennis, etc are good ways. Weight lifting is said to be safest with low weight and more reps. Do not do anything where you have to strain, hold your breath, raise your heart, or potentially fall. Yes, but it will likely be lean muscle, so you will not see major definition but you will look 'fit' or 'toned' but are less likely to have that distinctive 'look' of gaining muscle. \n\nBasically. You will look more like a marathon runner where it is not exactly bulk muscle. Yes but it is going to take a lot longer than most people and you will never be super muscular.  Swimming is great, light weight lifting, yoga, etc. You will most likely always be fairly lean BUT that does not mean you are wasting your time. Try and keep a proper high protein and carbs diet if you want to gain muscle mass just keep doing the things you can do, try pushups those are sometimes an underated exercise. Above all just do not push yourself too hard know your limits and work at it eventually you will see some growth Okay, thank you!! Yes, you can gain muscle mass with Marfan.\n\nTo gain muscle mass, you will need two things: fuel and stimulation.\n\nFuel is the simpler aspect. If you are actively trying to put on mass, eat at a caloric surplus, i.e. consume more calories than you burn. This can be a chore for people with Marfan, as the prototypical Marfan is taller and thus has higher daily energy needs. You will also need to get enough protein\u2014around 0.8 grams per pound of body weight. The composition of the rest of the diet is up to you, but people generally feel better when they are not eating junk, and carbs help with workouts.\n\nStimulation is the other bit. To grow, your muscles need  to work and to be progressively overloaded. Weightlifting is the traditional way to do this. Weightlifting is dangerous for people with Marfan\u2014in particular, lifting heavy weights is dangerous for people with Marfan, due to the massive spikes in blood pressure that occur when lifting heavy. People with Marfan are thus limited to lifting light. \n\nI am NOT a weightlifting expert by any means (the r/fitness daily questions thread might be a better place to ask this question), but a quick Google shows that lifting light can engender muscle gains. I think the limiting factor is going to be time, rather than something biomechanical. It is a lot faster to lift, say, 1000lbs in volume if you can lift 50-300lb at a time, as opposed to 5-30lbs.\n\nSo you can gain muscle mass with Marfan; you will just need to dial in your diet and then spend a decent amount of time in the gym. Like someone else already said it will probably be lean muscle, but it is definitely possible. I was as thin as a bundle of sticks until I started working physical jobs, but I soon found out I had no trouble putting on muscle. I still have a hard time putting on weight (muscle OR fat) in places that would make me look less skinny overall, but my arms and shoulders built up quite nicely.

My girlfriend has no insurance currently and obviously has not been getting out but she is about to run out of her medication and the doctor basically told her to screw off and too bad too sad. So does anyone here have experience with or know of a teledoc place or anything else that could get her the refills ASAP without having to go through the risk and debt of an uninsured doctors office visit at a time like this? Im a Walgreens Shift Lead with technician status.. \n\nWalgreens has its Perscription Savings Club. $20 a year and you get discounts on generic medications and if you do not save atleast that $20, you get the difference back. If she has prescriptions at a different pharmacy, check with your closest walgreens and they can transfer the script over. \n\nThen they can fax her doctor for more refills as needed. If there is a Costco near you their pharmacy is available to folks who do not have a membership and usually have deep discounts. There is also things like  which offers pretty deep discounts as well as comparing prices. I moved to Colorado in December of 2018 and did not get insured here until February, goodrx discounts was super helpful for my $500+/mo medicine haul. I think I ended up paying around 100-250. Unfortunately I could not skip out on any of mine as mine keep a lot of things in check, but if I could have been able too, it would have been a big saver as well.\n\nIf she is on blood thinners and is out of them, she can take one aspirin to help keep her chances of clotting down, but it is not a garauntee nor is it safe long term. I also advise if that is the case that she do her best to not make any major changes to how she eats, exercises, etc, and that can all affect her inr/pt.", "New here (Have some questions) I had a rare side effect to my ADHD meds (Reynaud's Phenomena) which led to me getting tested. I am still in the process of getting diagnosed. But I do think I meet most of the criteria for it.\n\nI have a heart scan scheduled and my blood pressure is at stage 1 hypertension (but it could also be because of my ADHD meds, ritalin is a stimulant so it increases blood pressure but it actually makes me feel calmer idk)\n\nMy dad's side of the family actually has a history of heart attacks and high blood pressure but my dad and his family spent most / all their lives in India so they have not been tested for it.\n\nWhat is life like with Marfans? What have you given up due to Marfan (I have been reading that you cannot really exercise and what not)? Any advice for me? For the women with Marfans, is there any correlation with Marfan's and very painful periods (I can barely move on mine)?\n\nFeel free to tell me your story too! Hi, I cannot answer your questions with certainty because I am currently working on getting diagnosed.\n\nI am literally in the same boat, I bought an AncestryHealth test in February because it detects markers for connective tissue disorders and am currently waiting on the results. I was taking Adderall for about a year and now I take Ritalin, this whole time I have had circulation issues, but if I do not take my meds I know things will go downhill (career and life wise). \n\nI had heart surgery in 2010 and had my last check up a couple of years ago. My cardiologist said it was normal and did not seek out to run further tests. However I still feel pressure in my chest (especially when I do not sleep enough, and when I get startled or anxious it feels like I have a weight around my neck)\n\nWhen I was in my teens I had such terrible period pain I would throw up and get fevers, so I started taking birth control and now I do not get cramps at all, which is great! If that is an option for you I recommend it. \n\nAs I get older I have more and more pain in my joints, the less stable my limbs feel in general. I tried kickboxing a couple of years ago and I absolutely loved it, but my stamina was shit and I fucked up my knee :( \n\nI feel like every time I go to the doctor I do not get taken seriously. I have not seen my primary in years because when I asked for psychiatric help she referred me to a drug rehab clinic. I have not found the right PCP, so I really hope you have one you can trust. \n\nPlease keep us updated on your journey! Hey thanks for sharing and being friendly!\n\nSame, I cannot afford to go off Ritalin, mentally and studies wise I have been doing a lot better. (I am 20F)\n\nI do get chest pain when anxious or nervous. Whether or not I have marfans is not confirmed but I am pretty sure my heart is stressed. Back when i was coping with my adhd by being really anxious (using anxiety to get through the executive dysfucntion), I used to get atleast 3 panic attacks a day and after a while I would get constant chest pain so I would chill for a while and then repeat. It was not healthy, I am doing better now :D\n\nI did consider birth control, but it can cause mood swings and depression and since I have been doing so well after starting ritalin (started about 6 months ago) I have decided not to. I have been taking like natural anti inflammatory pills and they reduce the pain significantly altho not completely.\n\nI am just kind of disappointed because I was finally diagnosed with ADHD last year (thanks stigma even in medical field!) and began coping a lot better but now its another hurdle.\n\nI really hope you are able to find a doctor who takes you seriously! I do not know what country you are from but if possible and affordable maybe get a private doctor or one that is well versed.\n\nMy psychiatrist was the one who recommended me to seek out a specialist because Reynaud's Phenomena never happens here, its tropical so it is always 30C . The specialist (rheumatologist) does not believe in ADHD (sighs) but he was still willing to do all the tests. He actually tested me for auto immune diseases AND did like the physical tests for marfans. The skin pulling test(?), the hyperextensibility and the ones where you wrap ur thumb and index finger around your wrist and arranged for a heart scan. I meet all those criteria.\n\nThe heart scan is arranged for august, so It is a long wait. He did do a bunch of blood tests for the auto immune stuff, and he was supposed to call about it but I missed it because I was in an exam and the hospital did not pick up when I called back. (But hey if i really did have it, he would probs already have called again)\n\nI am just keeping fingers crossed that although the chance that I have marfan's is high, hopefully physically my heart is not in a terrible state.\n\nLet us stat strong!! Jiayou!! Okay so I have got Marfans and ADHD and I (personally) do not find that they cross over much aside from medication. Not a professional, but you got to be careful when taking stimulants cause they definitely can affect your heart rate even if you do not feel it. I have been on adderall for a few months now and it is awesome and really helps, but talking both with your cardiologist and psychiatrist is a good idea to make sure you are using it safely. \nWishing you the best :D I also have ADHD and take Adderall, but I have to take it in small increments on an IR level because taking a whole pill at once or taking XR makes me feel weird or gives me a headache. It is a pain because I do wish I could feel the positive effects of the medication longer but it is a compromise I am willing to make for my overall health. \n\nSome things that I have always been limited by is pretty much anything that will make my heart race or put me upside down. I live near a lot of theme parks with roller coasters and I can never enjoy them because they are unsafe. I had to stop playing competitive sports as a teen and as a young adult I could never get too into the party scene because I was always careful and cautious about the effects of anything I would take. \n\nAs far as periods, I personally do get bad cramps at the beginning but they do not last more than a day and they are not \u2018I need to be in bed all day\u2019 debilitating so I have never considered them *that* bad? My mom also had marfan\u2019s and never complained of bad cramps either so I am not sure how much the correlation really is. Thank you! I have actually never been on roller coasters, I was hoping to go soon cos now I have a bit more financial independence but oh well. I am actually a thrill seeker going ziplining, jumping from the second floor to the first despite fear of heights and I really do want to be able to continue to do those things.... Sigh.  I have always wanted to go snorkeling at the very least\n\nThanks for your response! Hi! Thanks for sharing your experience, I am glad you were able to find a rheumatologist who conducted all those tests, I finally went to see one last week (USA) only for him to say to come back when my Reynaud\u2019s gets worse\u2026 no tests or anything which was so disappointing\u2026 in addition, what I have is more like Loeys-Dietz which most doctors I have spoken to have no idea what it is. It is similar to Marfan\u2019s but people know less about it. The Loeys-Dietz sub is empty so it is easier to seek information in this one. Honestly I am feeling so discouraged. It is like I am just going to have to wait until I have a aneurysm or something to get a diagnosis. \n\nI hope you get good news when you have your heart scan. Hello!\n\nI am so sorry to hear about your experience. Perhaps rather than using the name Loeys-Dietz if you were to specify what you mean or go to a cardiologist and just demand a heart scan you are more likely to get a test done. If you are not persistent they will not do it but at the same time to my knowledge, it could be that the healthcare system in the US is overwhelmed due to covid thus the doctor telling you to comeback later? \n\nThe test i am supposed to have done is an Echo Full Transthoracic, which I think allow them to see the shape of the heart. (Like an ultrasound but chest version) You can try requesting for that. My lab tests results were uploaded online so I dont have an auto immune disorder I dont think.", "TAAA repair Hi, is anyone familiar with thoracicoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair surgery? I have one scheduled this summer. Hi how are you?\n\nI have Marfan and in a party in March I have had a serious aorta dissection.\n\nI have been brought to the hospital and have had an emergency surgery as the one you are scheduled to get.\n\nI would gladly answer your questions if you would want me to :)\n\nI might not know all the details per se but maybe can help you with some of your concerns. Hi, thanks for replying. \n\nUltimately I think I am worried about the risks that come with surgery, although they are not high and I have a great surgeon. Just hearing from those who have made it through helps. Also dreading the pain of recovery. \n\nI try to remind myself things usually are not as bad as I expect and it will be great to get this procedure behind me.  Heyy!! Sorry for delay of answer... I got a second aortic dissection since the last time I post (I have angered the gods this year)\n\nFor the risks, I would not worry too much about it. We live in an incredible era right now and surgeons have better techniques then ever before. They can do a whole surgery by passing somewhere in your leg. They can do amazing stuff.\n\nMy last surgery left me with a weak voice because they cut the nerve of one of my vocal chord. It is not moving anymore. But apparently they can fix it with nerve transplant or something like that. Otherwise, nothing else. It is a small price to pay to be alive, very small risk. All I can say is: everything is going to be fine.\n\nAlso the pain eleven years ago when I got my first surgery was quite something. Now they have realized how stressful and unhelpful it is on the body to be in pain. Everybody at the hospital encourage you to NOT endure the pain. You feel a little something, they want you to tell then and they give you proper medication for you to not feel a thing.\n\nI think you are going to be tired, which is normal. Go easy on yourself. But do not worry about the pain. It is incredible today what they can do with medication. They broke my ribs and opened my whole left side front to back, and honestly I slept like a baby and I was feeling almost like it was a vacation from work.\n\nEverything is going to be just fine. Also stress is not good on your aorta (I have learned this recently. Stay relax and do not stress out, the surgeons know what they do)\n\nKeep me up if you want! :) I am sorry you have had more trouble! It sounds like you are on the right track now at least.\n\nThe points you made are encouraging, so thanks. I have had aortic valve replacement surgery in 2003 through the chest so I am a bit familiar with post surgery pain, I would just heard this one coming up is a doozy pain-wise. Plus I am used to being fatigued and weak from medication side effects that were increased after the dissection last year. \n\nCurrently I am going to cardiac rehab three times a week to strengthen but have an underlying anxiety about being active with the aneurysm (even under close watch of nurses at the rehab center). Overall I have gotten better about controlling stress about health most days. \n\nHope your most recent recovery goes smoothly! I can relate so much to your experience. I was at the hospital in ICU and I was convinced beyond doubt that I was dying, that the nurses were dropping the ball about my case. The surgeons came saying calmly how they were satisfied that I was stable. I was still super stressed and anxious.\n\nFinally my boyfriend told then I was holding a social mask and that I was being paranoid, that I thought I was dying. They laughed and gave me a sleeping pill lol.\n\nStill at home, every time I have a little pinching sensation I freak out. I am getting better at controlling my emotions, but yeah, I understand the state the dissection puts you in. It is sn awful stste of mind. I have gone to the emergency room four time since my dissection last year with symptoms I thought were anjerydm rested. A local ER doctor even said they would be horrified if they were in my position. It is just a lot of mixed signals/opinions and feeling out of control that were the most stressful. Meditating and finding a provider who has a good surgery plan have been helpful.  Umm did any of you got a CT-Angio test done before the surgery?  Yes, my doctors did multiple CTA\u2019s when I was initially hospitalized and I have had them about every 3 months since then.  I know someone who suffered from marfan and had Bentall Procedure done at age 21. He had a dilation of 7.8 cm and his surgeon called him a walking volcano. lol He had at most two (pre and post surgery) CTA's while he was a hospital. Any reason why you have to get CTA's done that frequently?  Yikes, hope your friend is doing well now. When I was hospitalized they did a few to make sure it was not changing in size before they would discharge me. They did not perform surgery then and still have not, I suppose I have them routinely as a precaution / to check and compare the size from previous imaging. They would pushed my scans out to six months apart but then I had troubling symptoms and got another one sooner than the six month appointment. \n\nI began around 4.4 and am now at 5 in April. Pretty eager to have it repaired this August and have it off my mind, among other positive changes like medicine adjustments etc.  Yup, that little guy is doing almost fine atm. \n\nRather than a repair cannot it be replaced by an artificial graft? That will be a better fix.   That is good! Yes, sorry, it is a replacement. A good bit of my aorta will be replaced. The surgery prep paperwork refers to it as a \u201crepair\u201d. Is this your first surgery?  No, I have had pectus repair, aortic stem and valve surgeries and eye surgeries.  Ahh so sorry mate, I somehow missed this notification about this and that is why no reply. \n\nLittle guy too have little distorted ribcage, but no surgeries for it. He had few for his eyes and something else (do not know exact details). \n\nLooks like your aorta have already gone through quite some fixing. That explains frequent CTAs. Dude, I wish this is last one that you need and hopefully you can live long and happy life ahead. :)  ", "AVR surgery 24f with Marfan syndrome. I will be having my 3rd open heart surgery soon to replace my aortic valve. Previous OHS include mitral valve repair and aortic root replacement. \n\nI am quite worried because I have what is considered severe aortic regurgitation, an ejection fracture of 40-45%, and symptoms include SOB, chest pain, low diastolic BP, and dizziness. My cardiologist stopped my irbisarton and started me on lasix. \n\nThe surgeon I was planning on going with has a full schedule for 6 weeks. Everything I have read shows the clinical outcome is better if you have AVR surgery just before symptoms start and you decline rapidly once they do. \n\nDoes anyone have experience with this? I am unsure if i go with my original surgeon who said it is \u201cfine but not ideal\u201d to wait or look for another unfamiliar with my case. Similarly, if you have recommendations of good surgeons or marfan specialist in the Southeast of the US let me know! Here is a link to locating a CHD Specialist ( Sent you a message I have had mine with Jos\u00e9 Pedro da Silve, he is one of the best and is currently working at Duke University. He is very active, maybe you could get in touch. I googled him and see that he is in pittsburgh. Do you have a link or anything stating he is at duke? i would love to see him Hi I am 32 and had open heart surgery on my aortic trunk and valve at the age of 26, I did not experience many problems with this, it was tough to recover. I had the same symptoms you are experiencing now, I always felt  on backup energy and chest pain, but now I have plus energy and feel better than ever. he is the founder of something at UPMC childrens hospital of pittsburg. I only found this link\n\n  He is brazillian and often comes to brazil to do some surgeries as we do not have any specialists as good as him. In the world there are few.\nDue to that, the contacts I used were only for his brazillian clinics. Did you have your surgery yet? Hope all is well! I am 26 and have had 2 myself - aortic root replacement and AVR - and now might be looking at a 3rd as well and am a bit anxious. Would love to know your experience! I had a TAVR just a couple days ago actually! It is a minimally invasive procedure where they access your aortic valve via your femoral arteries in your legs. Unfortunately it was unsuccessful because my aorta was found to be too large and they do not make a large enough valve for this specific method. So back to the original plan of having open heart which should be in a month or two Aw jeez I am sorry to hear it did not work out. I am surprised they even attempted it tbh, every time I ask my doctors at Mayo Clinic about it they say that Marfans patients are not candidates for TAVR because of the instability of our blood vessels and especially in your 20\u2019s the best long term outcome is with open heart.  Regardless - I am sure all will be fine and you obviously know what to expect in terms of recovery! I had questioned them severely on if it is safe for Marfans and they were not concerned. The reason they attempted was because my last open heart was a year ago so there is some extra risks with going back in. Ultimately my aorta was too large which i predicted but no adverse complications happened regarding my blood vessels. Oh that makes sense! Good to know. Well, I am sure all will go well. Is your mitral valve mechanical? i had a mitral valve repair previously. So it is my own biological valve but they also put in some sort of plastic reinforcement device", "Marfan\u2019s Syndrome and Birth Control? Hi! New to this subreddit.

I am in my early twenties and was suspected of having Marfan syndrome a few years ago. The physical signs of Marfan were present. I had a long wingspan, elastic fingers, scoliosis, severe myopia (8+ diopters), and pectus excavatum. So basically, my systemic score were 7+ which was a positive sign of Marfan syndrome. See systemic score calculation here: \n\nHowever, every time I tested for echo-cardiogram my heart has always been normal. I tested once or twice a year, and my doctor cleared me to lift heavy weights since my first echo. I had no family of Marfan syndrome as well, and no ectopia lentis (eventhough my eyesight is really bad). So I am not even sure if I have it or not since the doctor was not sure too, he just advised me to check up with my heart at least once every year. Another possibility I might have a mild form of Marfan.\n\nI am very active I have been lifting weighs regularly for almost 2 years, 2-3 times every week, and I have been consuming around 3500 calories per day on average. By lifting weighs, I mean really lifting heavy like 100+lbs bench press and such, not the Marfan definition of heavy like anything over 10 lbs. However I still weigh 160 lbs at 6'0, and my muscle tone is not that well defined for someone who has been working out for quite a while; and of course eating that absurd amount of calories. Any there Marfan/suspected Marfan who has difficulty gaining lean muscle mass? Can you share your experience? Also, I really want to know the science behind this. But it seems all of the research journals that I found were inconclusive.\n\nThank you guys! Are you squatting?   No due to my scoliosis. I use leg press machine for substitute Food for thought:  \n\nLamar Gant is one of the greatest powerlifters of all time.  He has scoliosis. Do u feel chest pain sometimes I tried squatting and it hurt my back even with less weight and proper form. Some people may experience different things but it is not for everyone and definitely not for me. Also my goal is to build muscle, if I can substitute squatting with baby weights that still hurts my back with leg presses and other exercises that I can do optimally, that is thousand times better. Thanks for the encouragement though, if I person with scoliosis can be a great powerlifter, I am encouraged that a person with Marfan can build muscle as well. \n\nDo you have Marfan? No one has ever suggested me to lift heavy weights, and here you recommend me to squat which is probably one of the most strenuous weightlifting exercise that can be detrimental to joints and bones health which are clearly affected by Marfan.  No. Why? No, but i work on treatments for aortic dilation.  I also lift, bro.  \n\nIf squatting hurts, so be it.  But they guys at starting strength may know a way to make it not hurt. \n\n I feel very little pain for seconds When you lift or in general? Generally This seems really irresponsible to me, as a marfan patient who is primarily suffering from the ligament issues. Marfan syndrome is not just a heart condition, I hope you do not end up fucking yourself over by being encouraged to treat it like it is.  My doctor has cleared me to lift weights since day 1. Do you have a MD degree and know my situation better than him?  Nope, just a warning from someone who is been there and lived through it.\n\nHave you seen any doctors other than a cardiologist or is this doctor a marfan specialist? He is a rheumatologist which had a ton of experiences in treating people with Marfan. Yes I see cardiologist every year, and I check my scoliosis and eyes in every one or two years. I know this is really weird. Sometimes I think about what I am doing if this is right or not. I am not even sure if I have this as I told you in my story. But Marfan is a wide spectrum. Isiah Austin a basketball player who did not get drafted in NBA because of Marfan now is cleared to play basketball again from what I have heard. Maybe consider asking for a referral to a geneticist to get a clear answer. I hate having to think back on the time I spent having fun in the gym and wondering if that is what got me where I am today (my neurologists and neurosurgeons have all said it is not productive thought, but that does not stop it from happening). \n\nI would think being certain would help quite a bit, especially if all you are showing is mostly the signs that are fairly common in the general population as well. It is not as if the answers to this question are unavailable. It would really suck if you are just a lanky kid with scoliosis and bad vision and they are sending you around to all these doctors for no real reason, and it would be even worse if you are putting stress on your body by powering yourself on your youth.\n\nI can tell you that I have been to physical therapy and my therapist told me that I had to rely on the building of muscle to support my body, since my ligaments are so weak (and this is true of marfan patients in general). I was given bodyweight exercises though, and instructed that I could rejoin a gym but lifting was not to be part of my regimen.  I told you my systemic score is positive. I have the wrist &amp; thumb sign, pectus excavatum, and stretch marks as well. So I am not just a tall and lanky kid who 'happens' to have scoliosis and bad vision. I talked about genetic testing but the doctor said it is going to be worthless, cannot remember for what reason, since it was a few years back. But thanks for bringing that up, I will check up with the doctor next time I visit. You can find a doctor to tell you anything you want to hear, if you search hard enough; just because he found a doctor who eventually cleared him does not mean it is the right, or even safe, thing to do. In my opinion, it was wildly irresponsible of him, especially considering he took on the role of ambassador and spokesperson for the Marfan Foundation.\n\n\n\nThat is the most recently released physical activities guide for people w/Marfan; you will note that it uses the term \"generally\" in multiple places, as this is a spectrum disorder and it manifests differently for everyone. You will also notice that weightlifting is specifically discouraged, so there is your answer. I would suggest you see someone who is not a rheumatologist to address your concerns, rather than strangers on the internet.  \"As this is a wide spectrum of..\" You just contradicted your own argument and repeated what I said. I am not asking strangers to address my concerns,  \"Rather than strangers on..\" And you just did it again. I talked to enough respectable doctors that this was the best thing to do for me, do echo every year and continue lifting weights like a normal person, I listen to them. Not you and not the guy that made a comment before.\n\nI just want to know if anyone here is cleared to lift just like in my case and what they are doing to gain muscle. If you are not then just do not answer. Why give stupid comments about what a guy that you know nothing about advices about what he should do when a handful of doctors have already decided for him?\n Disagreement is fine, but you will keep your comments respectful. This is a sensitive subject for many, and this should be a place where we can find other individuals with the same types of concerns to have civilized discourse with. (As much as is possible on the internet, of course.) ", "Do you think someone with marfans would be able to join the air-force and be up in those high altitudes? I have read the papers saying you run the risk of your lungs collapsing due to the increase of pressure, but if you are in a pressured aircraft, that should not be a problem right?\n\nI know the main kicker is boot camp, and I would have to even check to see if the US air-force would wave my condition. Planes are generally pressurized on the ground, so I do not think there is a high likelihood of pneumothorax due to pressure change at altitude. Maybe if you were a crew chief/ loadmaster etc. (I.e. back of the plane guy).\n\nI do not know if anybody\u2019s studied the effects of g-forces on people with Marfan. I cannot imagine the two get along well. I believe having longer limbs puts you at a disadvantage when exposed to G\u2019s\u2014the blood can pool in your limbs and you would pass out. Of course, it is unlikely that you would be catching significant G\u2019s.\n\nBut honestly, the biggest problem is going to be boot camp, and the daily aerobic and anaerobic exercises. You might be fit enough to complete them, but I doubt your doc would clear you to do them, and an Air Force doc might dismiss you. Yeah. I will talk extensively with my doctor and the recruiter. Thanks for the info mate Depends on your case but most likely even just basic training would be too intense for a doctor to say it is safe for you.\n\nIn regards to planes, high G forces can cause dilation/dissections of the aorta\n\nEdit: meant to reply to OP, whoops! My understanding is that having Marfan will automatically disqualify you for military service. This has come up before here and on the Marfan Facebook group. \n\nIf you want to work for the government there are many other options. That makes sense. I mean, who would want a pilot with a jacked up heart y\u2019know? Haha.\n\nLuckily the military was not my only career path. Good luck and stay safe \ud83e\udd1d I think that if there is any cardiac involvement, then you are unfit for military service. At age 18, I took the physical to join the Navy and was disqualified due to Mitral Valve Prolapse. The MVP also disqualified me from SCUBA diving because of the pressure. This is also my understanding. Automatic disqualification. Marfan is a medical disqualifier. My husband tried to enlist at 19 and was automatically disqualified.", "Marfan parents with marfan kids Do you ever feel guilty? My kids are 1 and 5 and still not confirmed with marfan but its suspected. I hate going to appointments for them because I get upset and go through a guilt trip . if I did not have them they would have marfan.", "I am doing a research project on the Marfan Syndrome, is there anything I should know that is not in scientific journals, internet, etc?  Can you please elaborate on what your research is about? What is the scope? Who is funding? Where are you intending to publish? What are you hoping to learn? Male marfanoids are anecdotally unusually well endowed, per a thread on this subreddit I believe :) Made gym class in school awkward as hell, as I recall. Who said OP is publishing their research anywhere? They might be in undergrad and just turning in their work to their professor. And that would be fine. However, it is appropriate to specify those details. Scoliosis usually follows idk why That Is under the symptoms for Marfans on most medical sites.", "Diagnosed with Marfans over the Summer and had my aortic root replacement surgery a month ago. Reach out if you have questions about my experience! Hey everyone! I am a 28 year old male who was diagnosed with Marfans in August and had my aortic root replacement procedure in November. I am home recovering from surgery now and feeling well. If anyone has questions or want to learn more about my experience, do not hesitate to comment or message me. I wish you all good health! Did u feel any little temporary(minute) chest pain before diagnosed and how can i increase weight No, never felt any sort of chest pain before my diagnosis.\n\nNot sure I understand your second question. Increase body weight or weights for exercising? Body weight Only way I have been able to put on weight is by building muscle lifting weights. Now that I am on exercise restrictions, I will need to figure out other ways. What were your symptoms? How did they diagnose you? The reason I ask, I am 27 years old and recently had some chest pains, I met with a cardiologist and he said a possibility of Marfans, I met with a 2nd cardiologist and he said he would be surprised if I had marfans, had an echo exam and everything came back fine, met with my primary doctor and he said he would also be surprised if I had marfans. I am scheduled to meet a geneticist December 12th. It is just been doctor appointments after doctor appointments and no one has given me any answers. I do have high blood pressure and have been taking medication for that. Hi there,\n\nIn July I visited a cardiologist because I experienced an episode of Atrial Fibrillation after playing basketball. Every new patient at the cardiology office takes an echocardiogram and the echo revealed that my aortic root was very large, bigger than it should be. I am 6'4\" and have a thin build. My body type plus an enlarged aortic root led the cardiologist to believe I may have Marfans. He referred me to the Marfans Clinic at Stanford Hospital where I was officially diagnosed.\n\nI had no idea what Marfans was before the cardiologist mentioned it in my initial appointment for the Atrial Fibrillation. I am very lucky to have gotten the A Fib, or else I would have never known my aorta was enlarged.\n\nAs a long answer to your question, I never experienced any symptoms. I have the characteristics of a typical Marfan patient, but never knew my characteristics could mean I have a disorder. Do you have the characteristics of a typical Marfan patient? It sounds like it was irresponsible for your first cardiologist to mention Marfans unless he really did believe it was a possibility, but I hope you are cleared and do not have the disorder!\n\nBest of luck. I am 6'1\", I have slight scoliosis, my thumbs are pretty long(my fingers are not that long though) so i can wrap my fingers and thumb around my wrist. I am 180 pounds so I guess I am kind of skinny, I have never had trouble gaining wait though. I do not know like I said they other doctors I have been to said they would be surprised if I had it but I am still meeting with a geneticist just in case. Did you see Dr. Liang? He is great.  Is chest pain a symptom of Marfan? I have not heard that before and do not see it on the list of symptoms on the Marfan Foundation website. If you wrap your thumb and pinky around your wrist, does your thumb cover your pinky nail? Just curious.\n\nHopefully the results from the geneticist come back negative and you are clear! Wishing you the best.\n  Yes! He is awesome. Very fortunate to be local to such awesome doctors. It doesnt cover my whole pinky nail but I can touch my pinky finger tip. And thanks. Glad your surgery went well. I would expect that your post surgery instructions would include going to a Cardio Rehab session.  The people there should be able to guide you back into physical fitness and advise you on exercise routines.  You will not be heavy lifting for a while but it will not be long in the scheme of things.  The only continuing issue I have is instructions not to lift heavier than what I can do multiple reps of - no one rep max sort of lifting allowed.", "Must watch this ...  5 minutes in and it is great. I love it so far. Thanks for the share. You are welcome.\ud83d\ude00 Agreed. I am also watching. Very powerful (and positive) message. Made me think of a friend from school, Marie who had CF. She had the same sort of sense of humour.\n\nBut I think it is one of those things of having to deal with so many health annoyances. If you do not try and laugh at everything, it will just pull you down and it is hard to explain to healthy people when they want you to take something serious, lol \ud83e\udd14 yeah, no!\n\nYou be all serious and boring but I will stick to joking about everything! \ud83d\ude08 Makes me very thankful for all that i have!! Thanks for sharing!", "Unsure whether to go get myself tested Getting to a doctors office is always a mission for me, so I do not want to waste my time or the doctors time. Also an apology as I can imagine this type of question is asked a million times here. \n\nI am around 6 feet tall, (Some doctors have measured me at 6'1, not sure about the discrepancy), weigh about 150 pounds if I am healthy but usually hover around 145 because of poor dietary habits. I can do the \"thumb test\" with ease and also wrap my pinky and thumb around my wrist with the thumb easily overlapping the pinky with no issue. Those are the only visual signs that I can say remotely exhibit any connective tissue disorder, besides the obvious signs like being double jointed. \n\nMy heart health I am unsure of, I vaguely remember when I was a child going in for some sort of heart test (my mom is horrible at remembering medical details because I was always in and out of the hospital as a kid). If I remember correctly, the doctor told my mom that I had small mitral valve prolapse.. now I could be wrong about the terminology but it was something about a small pin sized hole in a part of my heart (sorry about the lack of detail). The doctor said it could close up as I grew older and to just keep an eye on it. \n\nWith all this being said, is it wise to go get myself checked up for not only Marfans but any other related conditions (not sure what other conditions there are). Or am I probably fine? If I do need to head to a doctor, what exactly do I tell the doctor? I hate being one of those people that think they know more than a doctor because I read something on WebMD. \n\n\nThanks again everyone.  It does not do any harm to ask your doctor! Do not stress about it and just find out.\n\nGood luck! None of the things you have said are necessarily a guarantee that you have Marfan, especially without a family history. Marfan with family history is rare. Without, it is *extremely* rare. \n\n*However* if you have been diagnosed with a heart condition, no matter how common, you should get it looked at again.  I do not know my fathers medical history at all since I did not grow up with him. But I have never heard anything that my mom or other family have told me about them being sick in any way. \n\nGuess I will just make the mission up to the doctors office.. do I just tell them I want to be tested for Marfans? Is there a blood test of some sort? If you do not know your father's medical history at all and have no access to it it actually may be better to start there. A doctor may be able to help you get your genes tested for not just marfan, but more common things like cancer risk and such.", "Should I get a diagnosis? I am 15 years old and I am concerned that I may have Marfan syndrome. I first heard about this when someone in Youtube suggested that the 16 year old girl with the worlds longest legs gets checked for Marfan syndrome and ehlers danlos syndrome. \n\nWhy do I think I may have this? Well, first of all I am unusually tall. Right now I am 6,4ft tall and thin as a skeleton. I say unusually because no one on my moms or dads side is as tall as I am. My dad is 6,1ft and my mom is 5,5ft. I have long arms and legs but I am not sure if it is disproportionate. I have nearsightedness when it comes to reading words far away and it seems that my vision gets worse as I get older, so I will probably need glasses. I have flat feet, but no scoliosis and my breastbone seems normal. I would not say my fingers and toes are unusually long. Today I have experienced pain in my left chest but it is gone now and I am not sure if Marfan causes heart pain. \n\nOf course, there is not any point in self diagnosing so I asked my mom and she said she does not believe that I have it so I will have to go get a diagnosis by myself when I am an adult. Should I be worried? Removed. Please see rule 2.", "Does anyone here have marfanoid habitus rather than marfans syndrome? I am 34 and doctors told me I have marfans despite negative genetic screen and a healthy heart, my symptoms are dual ectasia, height, facial features, stretch marks and pectus excavatum. \n\nDoing some research online (I know, never a good idea) I came across the term marfanoid habitus. Effectively you look marf but do not have mfs and have no reason to avoid exercise aside from the joint and soft tissue injuries youre more likely to get. \n\nAnyone know any more than I do about the difference between the two?", "Is this a positive wrist sign?

That is all he did, should he have looked further? were those two tests the critical ones? Did he ask about your eyesight? Stretch marks? Your joint flexibility, arachnodactyly?\n\nI do not have flat feet or a high arched palate but my doc thinks I probably have Marfan regardless because I have all the other symptoms No, I am 196cm and skinny, sunken chest and short sighted. I am not flexible as such and have no family history that I know of anyway. What kind of doctor did you see? A GP here in the UK, he looked in my mouth and maybe my feet also and did not seem worried. If you are worried, I would push it. I had a couple of GPs look at me very superficially for Marfan and said I looked fine. (My outer characteristics are quite mild.) It was not until my cardiologist brought it up while I was seeing him for an unrelated reason. I am lucky to have a Marfan specialist in my city, so I got a referral and boom. I was a bit shocked, tbh, since several doctors told me in the past that it was unlikely based on my appearance, but they were not specialists and have very limited knowledge. I mean I have maybe three symptoms of Marfan, no family history that I know of. I am certainly not bendy like Marfans and only have the chest thing, myopia and tall and skinny (my mum is 6ft though).", "42BPM on 40mg Nadolol, daily Hey folks.\nToday I volunteered to be a part of a cardiology study where I had to do a few different exercises while having my blood pressure checked periodically as well as an ECO during each thing; it was cool to be a part of. My take home however, was that my Cardiologist wanted me to try cutting my dosage of Nadolol in half (from 40 - 20 mg once daily). My resting was 42BPM at its lowest. \n\nI suggested to dose down over two weeks from 40 to 30 then 20mg as I had tried cutting it in half before as she had advised and went back up to 40 after a while because I was getting heart palpitations through the day. This was quite a while ago though, close to 10 years.  Anyway- she agreed I could dose down gradually and said that I am pretty low energy and it is probably just what I am used to so I do not notice it. I do like to think I am pretty calm most of the time.\ud83d\ude1b I do a lot of conciliation breath work too so that may also be a factor. \n\nDoes anyone have experience with their resting heart rate being as low as 42BPM? Have you changed medication (with the advice of your doctor) to bump your heart rate up closer to 50 or 60 and did you notice a difference in your energy levels after?\n\n I also get fluid retention in my feet a lot and wonder if it might help to reduce that. No doctors I mention that to seem concerned about it. They think it could be because of my hear function but no one has taken a second glance at that. \n\nAnyway- thanks for reading. I would love to hear your thoughts. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb My own resting heart rate is in the low forties \u2013 I regularly get warnings from my Apple Watch that my heart rate has dropped beneath 40. I take 25 mg Metoprolol daily. When I discovered this (concomitant with getting the Watch), I thought that might be the explanation why I often feel tired and more so than I did when I was younger (I am 50). However, according to my cardiologist, fatigue is not uncommon among people with Marfan\u2019s, and my heart rate, while low, is still within a normal range.\nThere may be a genetic element as well \u2013 one of my older sisters has a similarly low resting pulse, and she does not have Marfan\u2019s (I am a mutation).\nI do not suffer from fluid retention. I would be curious to hear people's thoughts too. Recently had a hospital visit (kidney stone) and my heart rate was 40, the doctors absolutely lost it. \n\nIt used to be resting 59-60 but I have not been checked in a year. \n\nEither way curious to hear. Interesting! I also often have a resting/sitting heart rate in the 40s and have not met anyone else with this problem. I set off alarms when I have been in hospital on monitors. I have a hEDS diagnosis with some Marfanoid traits and have not seen a cardiologist yet to rule out Marfan. I also have POTS, so when I get up from a sitting position my heart rate will immediately shoot up over 30 bpm and my vision will black out. If I am standing for too long my heart rate can go up as high as 120 and cause me to break into a cold sweat and faint. Fun stuff!", "Coronary Angiogram, safe for someone with Marfans Syndrome? Hello everyone, thanks in advance for any advice you can give.\n\nI am 29 years old, I have known my whole life that I had Marfan Syndrome. I get a yearly echocardiogram and the past couple years I have been getting CT scans with iodine dye injections. I have not had surgery yet, but it is going to be happening in the next month or so to fix my Mitrovalve and my Sinus of Valsalva, and probably my Aortic Arch.\n\nMy cardiologist made a appointment for me to get a Coronary Angiogram next week. But when I told my mother, who also has Marfans, that I was going to have this procedure done, she informed me that years ago she had a cardiologist tell her that cardiac catheterization of any kind was dangerous to do on people with Marfan Syndrome, but she did not really have a explanation as to why it is bad to do.\n\nHas anyone here had it done? I am not freaking out about the surgery (yet) but I am worried about this procedure because I do not want anything to happen since I am so close to getting it all fixed. I cannot really find any info online about it, which makes me think it is probably okay. \n\nAnyways, thank you for any help you can give me. This is all pretty scary and it is nice to kind of vent a little. Doctors know better than your mom or Reddit. Trust them.\n\nI recently had a ablation done through my groin to correct a irregular heartbeat without issue. I am about the same age and I have had multiple surgeries. I have never had this procedure specifically with the catheter so I cannot say for sure. But to put some perspective on it, your doctor's would not put in this much effort if it was a bad idea. Also medical standards can change from month to month so I doubt something from years ago would still be the standard today. Honestly you should just double check with your doctor if you are concerned. Thank you Thanks for the insight. He is out of the office currently so I have not been able to ask him, so I thought I would just get advice on what other people have had done.", "Has anyone had multiple Mitral Valve replacements?

So confused do u mind elaborating I figure they are referring to a TMVR, where they replace it by threading a catheter up through the femoral artery Ahh okay thanks for the explanation, I have had 2 valves replaced and 1 repaired and I do not think it involved that (was a kid then so unsure of the exact technicalities which were used then) but nice to learn something new:) His anatomy is different and from what I have been told it is turned so they have to open him. Last time the surgery lasted 12 hours of Im not mistaken. Yea something like that. Put a camera n everything n clipped her valve because it was allowing blood back in. I do not know terms so I figured I would through what I knew out there. Thanks for elaborating !

My thumb can touch my pinky but it does not overlap with the fingernail on it, is that a failure? yes Talk to a different doctor if you do not feel confident with this one. Lots of GPs do not know crap about Marfans so it is not wrong to ask someone else. Sure the chances are you do not have it, but unfortunately the chances ALSO are that your GP does not know what he is talking about.  Doctor is good I think , he went through the gent nosology with me but he also used the official NHS website to check what he was looking for? Is that a good sign or bad ?", "I did it! Hi all! \n\nJust thought I would provide an update to my previous post. On June 5th, I underwent an aortic root and valve replacement to repair my 5.0 aneurysm and seriously stretched out valve. Two weeks post op, I am feeling stronger every day and the relief of no longer having that time bomb in my chest is indescribable. \n\nFeel free to ask any questions about the process/recovery, as it is still fresh!  May be a dumb auestion: What has changed?  No dumb questions! My aortic root has been replaced with a dacron graft, removing the aneurysm. Also my valve has been replaced with a mechanical valve, so I do require blood thinners now but thus far that is been easy peasy.  Sorry, missed the edit. While I am still healing, it is removed a TON of anxiety as this surgery had to happen due to the aneurysm rapidly growing in size. Still have yearly checkups for repeat aneurysms growing, but fingers crossed that does not happen. Hey! I am undergoing the same procedure in 6 days. Out of curiosity, what made you pick a mechanical over a tissue valve? :)  Best of luck to you, I am sure you will kill it! After discussions with my surgeon, and due to my young age (23), we both decided that the slight pains of warfarin for life outweigh the eventuality of having to have another surgery in 10 - 15 years with a tissue valve. Mechanical valves are simply more durable in the long run, and I prioritized minimizing a re-op in the next few decades. \n\nAlso keeping in mind I am more of a nerdy homebody than an extreme sports enthusiast - a factor I considered in that the warfarin does not bother me as much.  I was thinking the same reasoning for myself! Only 19, having to get a replacement and go under the knife every 8-12 years just sounds exhausting and tedious and...painful. My main concern is I am forgetful, and will forget a dose of the blood thinners, but if I push myself I think I should be fine. \n\nI hope you do not mind if I ask a few more questions? Like- what was your first week of recovery like, and what pain medications did they put you on? Is there anything you did not expect, that you wish you would have known?  Firstly, check out the app myINR - it is been a godsend for a young guy on blood thinners. Tracks for you, etc. Its really not as hard as you may think, you will be surprised!\n\nThe pain with this surgery was NOT as bad as I thought - the chest tubes are frankly the worst part, and I had mine removed day 3 post op. I received diluadid for 3 days, then Percocet for 3 more. After my discharge on day 5, I was taking only over the counter Tylenol. The sternum is the most 'lingering' part of it all, but I promise it is more discomfort and awkwardness, not pain. \n\nAs for the last question - patience patience patience. I had a bit too much of a gung-Ho attitude thinking I would be running around a week post op. It takes time! Even though this was not the case, I was most surprised by just how well the human body can heal. They will have you standing and walking the same day as surgery, and literally every day you will feel stronger and stronger. Two weeks out now and my incision is fully closed and clean, I am walking more and more everyday and starting to feel like myself again. Oh also, if you go Mechanical, be prepared for the clicking! At first you can hear it 24/7 and you may be worried like I was you will be stuck that way. You get used to it very quickly to the point you no longer notice it at all. You are amazing, thank you so much! The doctors are going to try their hardest to spare my valve, since it is really only my aorta that has the problem. But if they cannot, I do need to make a choice before I go under. \n\nYou have no idea how comforting it is to even talk to someone who went through the same thing, the closer the surgery comes the more freaked I get. Thank you so much and I am so happy you are healing so well!  Best of luck to you! With the anesthesia and care I received, it seriously is a flash. You will be on the other side in no time. I almost feel surreal about it all now still. \n\nI had the same choice too actually! Unfortunately valve sparing was not possible once the surgeon actually got in there because my aortic root was so large (5cm) it essentially 'stretched my valve to shit', if you will. Looking back, I am glad they replaced it being the way it was as it certainly would have meant another OHS for me in the future.  Congratulations on a successful surgery and recovery! Hey sorry I forgot to respond, but no it was in another city with a fantastic surgeon who also did the same procedure on my father.\n\nSo glad to hear it went well! How are you feeling? im feeling okay. i recovered really fast. i got out of the hospital early the 4th day. now im basically just bored as heck and sweaty because its very hot out here. The boredom was one of my biggest battles for sure. Glad you are doing well! It is amazing how heart surgery is not as nasty as we imagine it, I found the recovery to be much quicker and easier than I expected. i feel you on that. it isint as crazy as you would think... i hope other people in our position see this because i was HORRIFIED since april when i figured out about it have you tried smoking yet? im probably answering my own question but does it hurt?(burn/cough) im so bored i just wana get high\ud83d\ude02 Unfortunately I do not smoke herb or cigarettes, so I cannot comment \ud83d\ude02 as long as your lungs are fully refilled I am sure you would be OK though.  I thought you said you did oops. haha I am so anxious about mine. Right now, it is stayed at 3.8cm but I am about to get my yearly echo and I just get so nervous every time. Which valve did you choose? I am worried about committing to a plastic one just in case I ever wanted kids. ", "Is a genetic test required for diagnosis? Or if you meet the body frame, Beighton Test (hypermobility), vision, and heart concern criteria, would that be enough?\n\nI have been working with a couple doctors towards a diagnosis for awhile, but my state has only one geneticist for things like Marfan or Ehlers-Danlos, and the wait list is like 18 months. My husband and I are planning to move before then.  I was diagnosed clinically. No DNA test needed.  No, with family history and enough symptoms you can be diagnosed. I have talked to a genetic counselor and she said it would be a waste of money. I had to be genetically tested as I am 5\u20194\u201d.. \ud83d\ude02 My brother is 6\u20194\u201d and they only tested him genetically because I was positive and he needed aortic root replacement immediately if positive.. which we have the identical mutation in the same gene!! Crazy world of DNA we live in!! But now if you fit the physical mold, the diagnosis is much easier as medical professionals are finally paying attention! I was told I am too short to have this for 7 years before they would test me and I had it on others\u2019 family death certificates!! This was in 2007 of course... great now people are so aware of it!!! We can live healthier longer lives if educated about ourselves!! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb", "New Snoo!

I grew a lot from ages 5 to 13 years and then maybe an inch or so since then so I certainly did not experience continued growing.  Not everyone is tall. It is possible to have Marfan without being a giant. :)", "Not coping at all. For some context, I am 22 years old and currently in a diagnostic process for Marfan syndrome. I got an echocardiogram over the summer that revealed tricuspid and mitral valve prolapses/leakages, but no aortic growth *yet*. My primary care physician at the time was not at all knowledgeable in this disorder (he was clueless about it during our meeting, and then took out an outdated medical reference with the most extreme possible cases and went based off that) and merely dismissed the whole thing as me being a hypochondriac, despite both the prolapses and my *clearly* evident physical characteristics that would otherwise score sufficiently high on the Ghent criteria. Coming to graduate school, I met with a cardiologist on campus who specializes in aortic surgery, and has had at least some experience with Marfan syndrome. He looked at my physical characteristics and is pretty convinced I have it, saying it was a good thing I was resistant and continued searching for help lest I suffered the worst. He wanted me to have a CAT scan last week in order to get a more detailed look and to establish a future reference, but my insurance, provided by my university, is denying any claim due to bullshit policies so I cannot afford it. I have to wait for further guidance and a plan of action from this doctor, but it seems like I will not have much access to health care lately due to the villainous insurance company (known among students here to be dangerously stingy).\n\nMy physical health is not exactly the best. While I am blessed to not *currently* be stricken with ailments like arthritis and the like, my cardiovascular system is not feeling very well. I used to be a distance runner, and while I was certainly no top-class athlete, I was still fairly good at it. Over the last year I made it a goal to start strength training (I was not aware of the whole Marfan syndrome thing at the time) to gain weight and look less weird. For the past couple of years, I suffered from orthostatic hypotension, which I had always attributed to anemia, which I had only a minor case of. Now, this whole thing makes more sense in the context of this disorder. It is making life very difficult. I am almost afraid of getting up now because my heart beats so damn strong through my chest. Early morning when my alarm goes off and I get up to turn it off, even if I take my goddamn time, my vision goes out and my heart beats **incredibly** hard and it is scary. Often times, I just do not want to get up out of a sitting position. To make things worse, even changing sitting position from slouched to upright will cause this to happen, albeit not nearly as bad (but definitely noticeable and uncomfortable).  This alone is highly affecting me. Sometimes when I am studying, I like to go and write things on a whiteboard, but the transition from sitting to standing is enough to stop me from doing so. It is absolutely devastating watching myself go from someone who was so confident in their ability to be healthy through exercise, to someone who is so physically incapable of even basic tasks. Having absolutely no mass in some areas is also incredibly difficult. For example, my ass hurts so much from sitting *anywhere* because it is all skin and bone. Though I am scrawny as can be, I have ever only really been able to put on fat which never helps those areas. Sometimes it is gotten to the point where I cannot even sit down because I have so many sores down there. Yeah, during those tough finals weeks where you cannot sit down because the pain is excruciating (sometimes laying down hurt my back), but standing up is cardiovascularly a challenge can really bring you to tears sometimes. The little things in day to day life just pile on too. My height is 6'0/6'1 and my wingspan is around 6'6/6'7, and I have really long legs with a short torso. Things like desks and all were not meant to match these proportions. Busses, airplanes, office chairs, everything, just feels more difficult to be in because of it. No leg room, arms to long for certain desks, the list is endless; it sounds petty but it just piles on. Finding clothes that not only fit, but that do not make me look creepy, is a damn **nightmare**.\n\nAs awful as those things are, that is not even the main point of this post. What is really getting to me is my mental health, which has seen a steep decline. I always had body image issues. I always saw myself as a bit awkward, and could not exactly pin down what it was. I was scrawny and had scrawny friends, but I did not know why exactly I felt so weird when I looked in a mirror. Actually getting measurements of my wingspan/ and extremities, it all makes sense now, but it does not make me feel any better. In fact, before I always just scoffed it off as it all being in my head. Of course my mom would say that too (not very helpful considering that she is still in denial over me having marfan syndrome, that is her usual coping method), but now it is objectively disproportionate. It is frustrating that even others who I have seen with marfan syndrome do not have such a disparity between arm and torso length. Even when others have a big difference between *height* and wingspan, their torsos are at least a little longer and closer to the appropriate arm length and makes it at least a little less noticeable. Mine, however, is fairly easy to see. Instead of my hands/wrists reaching the crotch/butt area or just a little further, my goddamn *upper forearm* (part closer to elbow) passes that. It is such a fucking weird look, and I have grown to hate it to the point that I just cannot bear to look at myself in the mirror. I get so anxious, and it could really ruin a huge section of the day when I catch a glimpse. My room has a giant mirror on the closet door, and I have to be extra careful to avoid looking at it when I need to get something from there. This is not just exclusive to me. Other's have noted and commented on how weirdly lanky I am, including people like those I have had crushes on, to it hurt **extra** bad. I stay mostly on a large college campus now, but until just a few months ago, I was even afraid to go out places because random people would always fucking comment on me or say something. Also I have pectus excavatum, and to make things worse, I have horrific stretch marks all over me. I have more than my obese friend. I cannot go to the beach, to the pool, or *anything* like that that. Outside of self image issues, having to stop the exercise I have been doing is absolutely killer. I have a sentimental value towards running. It helped through depression and was a huge symbol to me that I could accomplish things that seemed impossible at the time. I had always been the weak out-of-shape kid until I started running and became invested in health. I wanted to do the same with strength training but that is now all gone. My depression has become gargantuan and not a day has gone by since seeing the first doctor that I have not sobbed heavily at least one point of the day. Some are going to recommend seeing a therapist, and I am working my damned hardest to make that happen, but I am **severely** limited in terms of transportation and finances. I am living literally paycheck to paycheck and things like debt mean my leftover funds after nonnegotiable bills and expenses is pocket change. I am stuck and do not know what to do. It is been months since this whole thing started, and it is only gotten worse. I do not have many supportive friends. All the people I talk to on an intimate level are far, far away, and have been shockingly unsupportive and apathetic through this whole thing. My family is not very helpful either. My mother is in huge denial, is extremely controlling, and quite frankly does and says the most unhelpful things. I feel extremely alone during all of this, and my relationships have declined vastly. I am sad all the time and mean/impatient to those around me. I have considered on multiple occasions taking my own life because I cannot even get basic health care anyways. Part of me wishes I never came across this disorder, and that I stayed in the bliss of ignorance, that I stayed in a state where I could tell myself my distorted image is all in my head, that I am getting out of breath easily because I just need to eat healthier or because I am getting out of shape. I would much rather just have been ignorant, even if it means having my aorta burst one day, an excruciating sure, but quick death preceded by at least a better time. It is a raw deal that I am 22 years old and already watching myself deteriorate. Sometimes when I am angry, I wish my aorta would just burst right then, because I would *want* it to hurt real bad.\n\nEverything I have mentioned above is just an absolutely minuscule glimpse into how this is affecting me. Quite frankly, I cannot capture an iota of the pain this has caused. I do not expect any sufficient help or response to this. I fully understand, and have been living, the adult reality that there are things I cannot fix, cannot control, and that life is just damn unfair, but I guess this rant had to come out in some way, shape, or form. &gt;I am sad\n\n( hopefully it will cheer you up :).\n___\n I am a bot. use !unsubscribetosadcat for me to ignore you. Commenting so I remember to write you something tomorrow when I am on my computer.  As a 21 year old with Marfan, a lot of what you said has resonated with me. Hey man, sorry to hear about all this.  It sucks.\n\nI was diagnosed at 7 years old, I am 27 now.  I had my aortic root replaced as a teenager, almost died from a sudden dissection a few years ago, had 2 big surgeries to repair all that, and suffered from depression and anxiety caused by all the things you wrote about here.  I use the term \"suffered\" lightly because I still have occasional days where it gets me down. \n\nIn my experience, reading people's stories and advice is OK, but it is like a band-aid on deep cut, the problem is still there.  What actually helps is having conversations with people who have been there and have gotten through it all, at least for me that is what helped a lot.  Seeing the light at the end of the tunnel if you will.\n\nSo instead of writing out my life story, i am going to PM you my contact info.  I hope you reach out.\n\nEither way, you should contact the National Marfan Foundation.  They have counselors you can talk to on the phone for free, I have done it once or twice and it definitely helped.\n\n I would definitely suggest speaking with a mental health provider, one who specializes in co-morbidity if possible. I know that sounds oddly specific, but my husband has Marfan, and he is on the severe end of the spectrum. He is now 44, diagnosed when he was 18, and holy hell does he have depression. It is not something that he can handle on his own, and we have spent the last 5 years trying to find a therapist that understands depression as a symptom of an underlying physical disorder is a whole different animal than depression on its own; that is why I say try to seek out someone who specializes in it. As far as cost goes, you would be surprised at how many places offer low cost, sliding scale, or even in some cases, free counseling. Also? Check out universities in your area that have psych programs - the students are required to do a certain number of practice hours, and are often very inexpensive. Plus, they are supervised by licensed professionals, so it is not like you are just talking to a random college kid w/a textbook. If I can offer any additional info, just let me know, and I will PM you.\n Boop. Hey stranger, did you still want to reply to this guy's post? \n\nI am in a similar position of really wanting to reply and just tabbed this, because as an ADHD I have major motivation/memory problems, and cannot face giving this the attention it deserves right now. Perhaps we can help each other get around to it, and hope the OP is still around. I got diagnosed at the age of 4, have ADD and bruh, I forget it 9/10 times i live life as full as any other. my mum always said: You can worry about MArfan's get hit by a bus and die anyway. \n\nJust live life and deal with stuff that comes up when it does do not worry life is great even for us. If for instance dating is a topic you wonder about.. Tall skinny people are what we call a rarity and a niche so girls who are into that will love you. I had some really great GF already im 21 btw. \n\nI had a root replacement 2 years ago, yes it sucks yes it isnt the norm for the non marfan people out there. but I actually moved to a a new country and i am planning my world tour on a boat. Keeep your head up and your back straight.. life throws shit at you just make sure to throw it back harder. \n\nITs not the years you live but the life you live in those years, this quote gets me trough stuff. Yes i might die young but fuck that im not going to lock myself up in a room. I plan on  doing more than the average non marfan person has done in their lives because, by living with marfan you are already fucking mother nature in the ass. see it as a upside rather than a down side.. I know i should have died if it wasnt for modern medicine.. this is also why i started to not care anymore and just do wht i desire. ", "A summary of my Marfans story Hello. I am a 35 year old with marfans. I was diagnosed when I was in grade school. I have two children, both boys, one has marfans and the other does not. Myself, my mom, my mom's twin sister, my brother, and a couple of my cousins have it as well. We are pretty sure it was passed down by my mother's biological father who is not in the picture. I have had the lens implants, scoliosis metal rods, a tarlov cyst, an IVC filter, 2 aortic dissections repaired the second with valve replacement, and both of my boys were c sections to avoid labor stress.  My symptoms thus far have been the back, heart, and eyes. I am tall and skinny, would have been over 6 ft easily if they had not put the rods in at 13. My 18 year old son that has marfans has very slight aortic dialation, has had lens implants, and his retina detached in one eye but other than that nothing this far. He has been 6 ft 4 inches since he was 16. This is just what I can think of at this moment. If anyone has any questions for me I would be happy to answer. I have been fortunate enough to have pretty good doctors who have at least some knowledge. 4.0 inches \u2248 10.2 centimetres ^(1 inch \u2248 2.54cm)\n\n\n\n^(I am a bot.

Everyday I wake up in pain. Especially the lower back. I have to wear a back brace everyday to work and my back pain worsens when I lay down. I also had weird chest pains but only if I move a certain way and it feels like my chest is caving in for 3 secs and then goes away. I am 5'11 but have a 6'7 wingspan and pass most marfan symptoms like thumb around wrist, spider hands. Also have a recoding chin and a overbit. I weigh 129 pounds but I eat a good amount of food everyday and just do not seem to gain weight like others. my family just think I am skinny but I actually think I have a problem. Just wondering if you guys have any of these symptoms.  Hi I am from the Teen Council of the Marfan Foundation.  You should consult your primary care physician and also get an echo cardiogram to check your Z score.  Make sure to get a second opinion.

Hey guys, \n\nMe and one of my elder siblings were told we had Marfan (about 5-7years ago?) yet my sibling got DNA tested and did not have firbrillin mutation so we were told we /might/ have Marfans but not sure. \n\nMy health has always been worse than my sibling, and I seen a geneticist in Feb who said he does not feel it is Marfan, but I clearly to him anyway, have a connective tissue disorder.\nIt got complicated as that Dr registered that I have balance issues and assumed it was some genetic ataxia or brain cyst/tumour.\nMy brain scans are clear (thankfully) but I have seen 2 neurologists who said they thought my balance issues are a genetic ataxia and I am currently waiting for my bloods results for that to come back. I hope its negative. \n\nAnyway, after that shock, I seen geneticist (a different one) who said he thinks the fact my leg bones grew faster than my muscles/nerves means my feet/lower limbs are nerve damaged = very bad balance and said something like your nerves have connective tissue in/around them and could explain bad healing.\nI also have bad raynuards syndrome in my hands/feet/nose/ears which may make any nerve issues in feet worse. \n\nAnyway, this genetic fella, he said he can see why people are saying Marfans but does not think it is.\nHe said it looks like a new connective tissue disorder, (be it solely a new one or a mutation of Marfans). \nHe sent some blood off to be tested for all known connective tissue disorders and if that is negative then he signed me up to a gene research programme or something.\n\nSo I am currently waiting for ataxia blood results which I pray are negative and a red herring. \nAnd waiting for a all of the connective tissue disorder blood results - which can be negative or positive so long as I get an answer in the end. \n\nI just need someone to vent and talk to people who \"get\" this. \nBe a real laugh if it just turns out to be plain old Marfan eh?! \n\nThanks. ", "Not sure if I have marfans or not. So we were told by a doctor to get checked for marfans awhile back. We were never able to do so because of the virus unfortunately. But we did see other doctors and it got strange. I got my heart checked to see the beats. They said 223 beats a minute. Which is insane. That should not happen. I got my hear checked again by another specialist they heard nothing out of the ordinary. I have the long arms and fingers and CA do the wrist thing. My eyes are also garbage but that could be genetics. But my feet are not flat, and a lot can be contributed to my eating diets. I do not eat a lot that is why I am skinny. I am 146 lbs and 6'0. I know it can be hereditary, but I do not believe anyone in my family has has/had it. I did get diagnosed with hyper mobility syndrome and that does come with marfans sometimes. I am going to go to the doctors still I just think they messed up a lot lol. Your heart being at 223bpm at rest would be a medical emergency! Meaning straight to the ER otherwise some very bad things could happen.\n\nWhen things are back to normal, go and get worked up by genetics to be sure. You can be spontaneous mutation - meaning the first in your family. It does not have to be inherited. That is the thing I to on another test right after that huge number and they said it was normal. I am not sure if my doctor messed up or not at the time. I did not think my heart rate was bad either. like I felt normal. Ok thank you for telling me about it being able to be inherited.

I see A LOT of skinny crossdressing young adult males online (it is basically a subculture at this point) \\ and some of them are so skinny I wonder if they have it, some of them refuse to show their chests which is quite fishy. I think most do not have it, but again, I have seen some who were so skinny (mainly their arms) and long arms, that it puts it to question. I just feel like the only male who crossdresses to cope with being skinny, particularly with coping with marfan syndrome. A lot of males give me a bad time for doing this as a lot of the males I come across want to get buff and with me, I do not want to get buff, but I DO want to get thicker if that were possible, gain 150 pounds. Also please do not think this is a joke, crossdressing is like, the new thing for some males (and females), the times have changed. So I feel like the only one with marfan syndrome (or any connective tissue disorder) who crossdresses to cope. Not all, but A LOT of males with marfan syndrome are not like me and have not accepted it and they are not LGBTQ+, so they just look at me weird. Everybody feels like they are alone sometimes. And I do not say that to undermine how you feel. I say that because I have struggled to find others like me too\u2014especially in the LGBT+ community. I think I have found my place in the LGBT+ community, but I still feel like people look at me weird. As a bisexual person, I know I am valid, but I still fear that people view me as a lesser member of the community.  But what helps me cope is just trying to remember how big the world is and how many different people there are. \n\nEven if you feel like you are alone, that does not mean you ARE alone. I bet there are thousands Marfan males who crossdress. You just have not met them yet. And in that same vein, you will probably meet a lot of other people who accept you more than you think they do. Many people you already know probably do. You cannot read minds and you can never know for sure what they are thinking\u2014therefore, you can never truly predict if someone thinks you are weird. So just try to act as if you are accepted and you will be your most confident self. \n\nI hope my perspective can help you out. \n\ntl;dr\n\nFake it \u2018till u make it. I do not get how in society when a male accepts his gender role he gets praised but when I invert the gender role, and reject it, I just get dislikes online, I get hate comments, I get attacked, etc. It is just not right. I just want to be me. I totally understand. And you should just be you. People like you are extremely important and you should be able to thrive in a positive space. And maybe think of it this way: logically, for every person who gives you hate, there is a person who would give you love. \n\nYou are valid and I hope you heal from the pain you have been through. Like... in the world? Surely not. On this sub? I doubt that, too. But I guess 740 is not THAT many, statistically speaking. \n\nSound off, cross-dressing friends! I cannot imagine what it is like not to be able to be yourself without people hating on you. From a fellow Marfan if not LGBQT+, I love you, man. Yeah hatred just fills me with isolation and I start hating others but I try not to turn to toxic stuff like the incel stuff or other bad stuff. I just isolate myself and crawl up in a ball ready to cry because I am \"different\" from the other men and people IN GENERAL. You can wear normal clothes,you just need to found what suits you best,\n1.

Oh i did not read that correctly Not Marfan, but the most recent winner of RuPaul's Drag Race, Yvie Oddly, has EDS. While not exactly the same I found such huge representation of a connective tissue disorder in the queer community to be unexpected and inspiring. \n\nLet us uh, just not talk about my gender. It is complicated. Nothing I do is cross dressing, though, I only dress as myself no matter what I am wearing. No, I said I WANT TO BE 150 pounds. My sexuality is more complicated than my gender but this is not the place for that. I just dress like a girl to cope with my skinny body. I do not do it for \"fun\", I do not do it to \"trick\" any men or anything, I am just being myself. I identify nowadays as a male, (femboy), but sometimes I do get gender dysphoria. My gender dysphoria was kind of bad in the past but now I do not think about it much. Sometimes I do wonder if I have a comorbid condition that gives me an androgynous voice and a lack of body hair but I do not want to be a hypochondriac, then again, I should not care if I do sound like one. I am either an undiscovered intersex person with marfan syndrome or I am just a femboy with marfan syndrome who never got a deep voice, never got a lot of body hair, and never got a rough skinned face, because my face is still soft and youthful.

I have beautiful hands and most men usually do not have that beautiful hands, especially at my age.  That is one of the reasons I suspect Klinefelter.

My sister had almost no signs of Marfans besides her hight and a small heart murmur, however, when she got pregnant her mitral valve collapsed and she had to do a surgery. Never no one ever mentioned Marfan's to her until 2009, 9 years after her son born, and a doctor questioned if she new what Marfans were. After a DNA genetic test she was tested positive. Back then besides some physical tests, she was only able to be diagnosed correctly after this genetic test. Im not sure by your post if you were diagnosed or not, or your doctor's just suspect you might have, If you do not have many of the features you should ask your doctor for the DNA test. Keep in mind that Marfan's can skip a generation and though your parentes might not be tall which was our case, your grandparents might be. My sister did not have a lot of limitations besides no high impact sports, and a small dose of a medication to keep the heart beat on the lower side until now, she is only 38, and her tissues become very tin and she had a AAA aortic Dissection Surgery which is one of the most complicated surgeries for people with Marfan's.

I just discovered this particular subreddit, and thought it pertinent to introduce myself:\n\nI am 44 years old, 191 cm, 90 kg. (\n\nI was diagnosed with Marfan at the age of three \u2013 a mutation, as none of my relatives are afflicted. In the early years, Marfan manifested itself mainly on my eyes, and I underwent eight? eye surgeries during my childhood, the end result being one eye prostheses (eye sight lost to slipped retina, recovery surgery unsuccessful) and one eye functioning (lens removed, slipped retina successfully recovered through surgery). Additionally, I underwent substantial teeth correction (including some surgery), have a high palate, and some pectus excavatum.  In my teens, I developed the classical build with long arms, legs, and hands. I did not participate in sports in my youth.\nI have participated in a fair number of scientific studies of Marfan in Denmark, and I am thankful that I have done so, as I, during the very first one in my mid twenties, was asked the crucial question \"how often is your heart scanned?\" My doctors had been specialists concerned with my sight, so none had thought to have my heart checked. That was soon rectified, and in 2001 my aorta had reached a diameter of 55 mm (the threshold at the time, though I believe it has been lowered since), and I underwent surgery getting a composite graft (and a neat ticking noise when my titanium heart valve closes). Since then I have been on medication with Marevan and Metoprolol. I am checked annually with ultrasound and MRI \u2013 everything is now rocksteady. I am happy and relieved to live in a country with free, socialised medicine.\n\nFive years ago, I had a brush with death, as I developed ( \u2013 something to look out for, if you have an artificial heart valve. I spent six weeks in hospital getting in total around 25 liters of IV antibiotics. Now I know to contact my doctor, if I should developed a fever in excess of 40\u2103, and I have developed a hearty, if resigned, dislike for ( \n\nTwo years ago, I participated in another study, this time focusing on the bones of Marfan people using high resolution CAT scanning. Turns out that our bones are not as strong as they might be, so I am now also on osteoporosis medicine.\n\nIn daily life, I suffer no major ill effects \u2013 my field of vision is too narrow for me to have a drivers' license, but I do not suffer from joint pain or similar, which I know can afflict others. I thought for quite a few years in my teens and my twenties that my life expectancy was 35ish (in hindsight, had I not begun having my heart/aorta checked, I most certainly would have been dead by 35), a fact that, while it may seem strange, did not affect me overly \u2013 I suppose I have a sardonic nature. Now, of course, my life expectancy is normal, which does not change my refrain at every birthday: Still Not Dead. I decided early on that I did not wish to sire children and remain single, which suits me just fine.\n\nIn my professional life, I hold a PhD in Computer Science and work as an associate professor at the largest Danish university. In order to keep in shape (and to strengthen my bones per doctor's orders) I run and lift every week. ", "What kind of specialist to diagnose/handle Marfan syndrome? A few years ago my significant other went in for a physical with a new doctor and that doctor, based on his medical history and presentation (body type, slight chest deformity, etc) said that he probably had Marfan syndrome and might want to see a genetic counselor about it.  This semi-diagnosis was a factor a year later when my SO started having chest pains (to the echocardiogram! stat!) but he was fortunately clear of heart problems and it turned out to be a hiatal hernia in his digestive system.  He never got around to finding a genetic counselor, kept promising me he would take care of it after he got something else medically taken care of (which happened last year) and this year at his physical he was diagnosed with a mild hernia at his groin. Which is apparently something people with Marfan's are prone to, but he did not know that because he is never talked to a specialist about it. \"Oh yeah, I found this fact on the internet so I do not need a doctor since there is no cure\".  When he asked for a referral last week, his doctor was very vague and said he did not know who would be on his insurance anyway.  \n\nWhich brings us to the present. It might be marfans, it might be one of the similar connective tissue disorders (a close friend growing up had one of the related disorders) but the point is that we are planning our lives together and I would feel a lot more comfortable if I knew this problem was under observation by the right kind of specialist. I am having trouble figuring out what that right kind of specialist is. Some google searches indicate a Rheumotologist? Or is the genetic counselor a better bet? We are not planning to have children so that factor can be ignored. \n\nAny tips for finding the right doctor? This is clearly a stressful topic for both of us so anything that can smooth the way would be helpful.\n", "Coping with diagnosis 39 M - Received diagnosis last week and now scheduled open heart surgery for aortic root. \n\nI am absolutely terrified and numb.

My 13 year old brother recently got his physical to play football, and they did not clear him because of concerns with how his chest sticks out so much. They are doing an ultrasound Tuesday on his chest to check for anything abnormal, and the doctor called Saturday and said regardless of the outcome he wants my brother to go to the Children\u2019s Hospital in my state to get tested for Marfan\u2019s. \n\nHe is a tall, skinny kid for his age. He is 5\u20199\u201d at 13, but there are no other symptoms that he complains of. Sorry. I understand there is no correct answer to this, I guess I am just venting and want to know how likely a convex chest could be non-Marfans related. It is good you guys are going to get him checked out. If he does have marfans he should absolutely not play, no matter how much we wants to. I played for a year before I was diagnosed and I often think back how dangerous it was for me. Good luck to your brother and the rest of your family. Thank you, I appreciate it a lot. And yeah we have talked to the coach already and he is going to be watching in street clothes until there is a conclusive answer. His physical description was very similar to me at that age.  I had surgery to correct Pectus carinatum  (chest sticks out) at 13.  Was 6 '8\" by my senior year.  Was finally diagnosed with Marfans at 42 and had open heart surgery to repair/replace aortic valve 3 months ago.

I am 19M, 183cm tall(6 feet), 67kg. I am extremely active, go to the gym at least 3 times a week, play competitive Ultimate etc. I have been actively trying to gain weight but difficult for me to gain past 68kg. I have always struggled with stamina (run out of breath more quickly than teammates, take longer to recover and get headaches from hard cardio). I presume it may be due to my PE. I have the following physical characteristics that may be attributed to Marfan's: Wingspan longer than height, pectus excavatum, scoliosis, high arched palate, hand and wrist sign, arachnodactyly, long and slender limbs, flat feet, taller than anyone in the family, lower back pain. \n\n\nI have been suspected of having Marfan's before, have done 2D echoes (once 4 years ago and another half a year ago) and it came back normal fortunately. AFAIK Marfan can only be diagnosed with heart and eye issues (of which I do not have ) in addition to skeletal features. My father is against a genetic test as he does not see any point in doing it if my heart results are normal. \n\n\nI have pushed it aside for awhile but it is always at the back of my mind considering how physically active I am. Should I be worried? Or should I be at ease knowing my heart is normal and disregard my physical symptoms. ", "Recently told by GP I may have Marfans and have been diagnosed with an enlarged aorta.  I was only just diagnosed this year at 30 years old and have been having a rough time adapting. I dont present with many Marfans features apart from being really tall and according to my GP a high arched palette and crowded teeth.\n\nI have got a meeting with my cardiologist but wanted to know do any of you have anxiety or panic attacks and do you have to take SSRIs? Not looking for advice but just wanted to hear others\u2019 experiences.\n\nJust wanted to know does anyone have any tips or coping strategies? I have anxiety and am personally terrified of a dissection or a rupture. Do not stress out over it. What size is your aorta now? It probably still has a ways to go before it is close to a dissection. They will just want to watch it for a while to see if it continues to grow. 44mm so about 6mm from the point where we would consider surgery according to the cardiologist It is not always that black and white. While 50mm is definitely the one number where they do surgery, they can sometimes do it earlier if there is other problems or if it makes a big jump. OR if other people in your family had other complications at before 50mm. The key is the yearly echo's, it could be stable at this for a long time and no surgery necessary.  \n\n\nYour cardiologist should have spoken with you about Beta Blockers or Losartan (More Cardiologists seem to be moving towards Losartan these days for Marfan Patients as it has a vasodilating effect) or at least low dose of beta blocker with high dose of Losartan. At this stage the cardiologist has said no need for pressure reduction medication just yet. Speaking to them again August so ill have plenty of questions. Your doctor is wrong. You should be on meds as they can prevent further increases in your size. Go Marfan.org, print out the recommendation, and insist.  \n\nNormally people get put on a combination of atenolol and losartan. **I found links in your comment that were not hyperlinked:**\n\n* (\n\n*I did the honors for you.*\n\n***\n\n^( ^| ^( ^| ^&lt;3 I have had anxiety issues and have taken SSRIs in the past with no issues\n\nOne thing to look out for is that Marfans has a high comborbidity with POTS so if you have dizziness issues I would look into that as POTS can react badly to tricyclic antidepressants (ie. Amitriptalyine) so it is worth bearing in mind\n\nI had a lot of problems with Beta blockers and have been moved to lostartan which has a similar effect but has only started being used in the last few years so not all Dr's are aware. If you have issues on beta blockers do talk to your Dr about them\n\nHonestly the only advice I can give you with regards to the dissection is to become familiar with your own pulse in different situations (Inc. Anxiety attack) so that you can take your pulse and see if it is in the normal range for yourself (this may change once a meds are introduced). Takes a step back and analyse your symptoms. Do you have a sharp chest pain, if so it is worth getting it checked out it could just be anxiety hit might not. \n\nOver time you will get used to it (I know this seems like terrible oh you will get over it advice...) but I mostly mean you will grt used to what various pains mean and when you are OK vs when you need to see a Dr. Its all a bit information overload at first but eventually it will become second nature. When I was told about the possibility of dissection at 13 it terrified me, and many others have stories very similar. I had many panic attacks and it was a hard time. But a lot of that was because I had no resources, and i felt the weight of reality all at once, as youre feeling. Eventually over time it will get easier, sadly there is no way to make it all a little easier to swallow initially, i wish there was. But there are ways to set your self up for that better future. Make sure to educate yourself about marfans, its an investment in your future. I too have anxiety about my condition and what combats it is that knowledge. \nThough I have never taken SSRIs I did take up talking to a psychologist since march and I will say wholeheartedly that it has made such a significant improvement in my life. I am a bit of an odd case in that my major operations in regards to my heart were all before I was 10, at 4 I had my mitral replaced and then 4 years later I had my aortic valve replaced and an aortic graft - I do not recall any of my numbers or anything like that - so I cannot offer much as far as that goes.\n\nAs far as meds &amp; mental health. I have not been on an SSRI, but I have been on an NDRI for ~1 year now? It is helped with a lot of my racing/intrusive thoughts which has had a cascading effect and makes it a bit easier for me to deal with anxiety - but I still deal with it. I will be seeing a psychiatrist next week and start that process as I continue to struggle with depression and need much, much more fine tuning.\n\nTo my knowledge, you can take most meds for anxiety/depression - but you do have to be careful as some of them lead in increased heart rate/blood pressure, which can be bad. Something that helps significantly is finding a support community (online or in person, be it friends/family/etc), and a therapist, if it is something that you can afford. Therapists are great for offering ways to objectively look at things as well as learning how to cope with things as they come at you.\n\nHaving Marfan's sucks occasionally, but overall you are able to live a (mostly) normal life, you will have to shift your focus and possibly some of your long term/short term goals to suit what your heart/body can handle - but do not let it stop you living a full life if you can help it. \n\nGood luck and there is a pretty awesome community of folks in the discord that gets linked here every now and then, and the facebook groups are great but are definitely... sort of niche and full of parents who are concerned moreso than say, the discord where there is a wide range of ages/walks of life/etc and is pretty chill.\n\nBest of luck! Keep your head up. You got this, dude.", "If there are no issues with my heart am I able to lift weights and join a gym? I have got some signs of Marfan as you can see (pectus, skinny limbs, long fingers) and my GP told me before to avoid a gym \u2018just in case\u2019? What if I am avoiding it for nothing? How can I get my heart properly checked?  Go see a cardiologist and get an echo, I have a mild case of Marfan\u2019s and through out high school I was not allowed to participate in gym, sports, or any activity such as weight lifting. I am am now an adult (41) and due gaining weight (I was always skinny, I still am) and the fact that my aortic aneurysm numbers have not changed (and technically are lower percentage wise due to my weight gain) I now regularly run, did three half marathons this year and plan on a full next year (fingers crossed I get into NYC); about the only thing I need to avoid is any physical sports and body building / strenuous weight lifting. So go see a cardiologist and until then heed your GP\u2019s advice. Hi. Your post has been removed for breaking rule 2. Please see a general Practitioner or better a cardiologist for concerns about Marfan Syndrome. Thank you. I am not asking for a diagnosis? Visit the Marfan Foundation (link at the top) they have great resources for finding a doctor who specializes in Marfan syndrome or related genetic disorders. In fact they have lots of great resources in general that are worth checking out. Good luck. I also have a mild case of Marfans and played competitive sports all through my childhood and college until I learned that was not a great idea, but my heart is fine and it did not seem to do any damage.  I think the general consensus is that if you do not currently have heart problems with Marfans, working out at the gym is fine as long as you are not overexerting yourself (heavy lifting, competitive high intensity sports, etc). Perhaps a dumb question but do mild cases still show up in genetic testing or are they clinical diagnosis? Genetic testing still.  By mild I mean that I do not have some of the more severe symptoms of marfans, like heart problems (yet) or chest protrusion.  I do have dislocated lenses and joint problems, but Marfans does not really affect me on a day to day Echocardiogram. EKG. Genetics test to rule out fbn1 mutation.\nHas anyone in your family died of cardiac issues? If yes, you are probably safer if you take it easy in your body I have had a few Echocardigrams and everything has been fine. No cardiac issues in the family. Sounds like you are doing your homework. MRI or cat scan is another option if you are really on the fence about it.\nThe only way to entirely rule out marfans is a genetic test for fbn1 mutation. If you do not have that, you do not have marfans. Thank you. What does the genetic test entail? It is a blood test. You might have to go to a major city to find a geneticist or you might be able to find a screen online\n\nHere is some literature \n\n oh man I am terrified of blood tests. Ugh.

But you could just be unlucky and have those symptoms because of other things. I mean there are multiple people out there that are tall or old people with scoliosis.  But you either have your genome sequenced out and look for whatever sequence it is. Or you have a doctor look you over and say you have X amount of the symptoms of marfans and since you have a greater number of symptoms we will throw you into the marfans category.  I did not know I had Marfans until I suffered from a spontaneous aortic dissection. I am extremely lucky to have lived through the ordeal....granted, it was definitely a life changer. I do not have the typical Marfans look. Im about 5'9. Have always been a little long and lanky but still looked average. I also had scoliosis when I was a little girl which they classified as idiopathic. However, my joints, my eyes, and my lungs are all fine. I have never broken a bone or dislocated a bone.

My genetic counselor reiterated to me that you do not have to look like a typical Marfan syndrome sufferer in order to have Marfans. The only way to truly know is to get the genetic testing done. She also said that you can have Marfans and have zero symptoms, or you could have Marfans and have every symptom associated with it. Just depends on how the condition manifests itself within you. But your best bet is to get the genetic testing, and then follow up for yearly monitoring with the different specialties familiar with Marfans (cardiology being the most important). Good luck!!

It looks like you tested \\*specifically\\* for Marfan, and did not get the full workup of the similar things we know about so far, which from Invitae would be a 27-gene test. Even though my right chest, the small lump one, not the puffed out one, it has a U shape to it and when I have my arm down or push my arm forward the chest feels like a soft hump of some sorts, I would not say it is gynecomastia, but some odd mixture of hard and soft something. Need that aortopathy from invitae.com. I thought I had it and just got my results back last week. I do not have one if the known Marfan variations. I may have a new one but not likely because both types of my FBRN genes are good. What they did find is I have a mutation on the FOXE3 gene which is rather new, but predisposes you to thoracic aortic aneurysm which is exactly what I had. I still exhibit many features of Marfan syndrome so there is some kind of connection between between these \u201ccousin\u201d syndrome but hopefully you can get some answers that way. How old were you when you had an aortic issue?\nI have yet to have one, as my aorta looks normal. I am 35 and had a David procedure in August. My aorta was normal or slightly enlarged since 20. 3.9-4.1 centimeters displayed on an echo in 2018 and the next year in 2019 I was 4.89 and three months later I had the surgery. At time of surgery I was 5.0. Can you think of anything you have done in your life that could of caused it like heavy lifting? As to let you know, I BARELY lift anything, for exercise or just in general to move something. I have known about it for so long I was alway really careful. Never lifted anything heavy on purpose. Sometimes when moving something or at work but never if I could avoid it. In that year for dramatic swelling I was basically doing the same thing I have always done it just happened. That FOXE3 mutation for me was going to make it happen one way or the other most likely. What was your symptoms of an aneurysm, how did you know it was not a heart attack and how did you know it was serious enough to get it checked out because there were moments of me having REALLY BAD chest pain but either I did not get help for my chest pain or if I did, they just listed it as \"heartburn/GERD\" and \"acute coronary syndrome\". Chest pain I usually get is in the center of my chest or on the left side, so not sure if an aneurysm feeling is on the other side of your chest or back, like right side chest or back pain or in the middle or something, not sure. I am not a doctor so I am not sure exactly where the aortic root and ascending aorta is. You cannot feel an aneurysm. You can feel a dissection or a rupture but not before that. An aneurysm is just a ballooning of the artery. That is why so many people are asymptomatic and just have a sudden episode. It is scary. I found out about it because of another problem with my heart (arrhythmia). So I was able to monitor it every year with an echo and then CT and once it reached a size where they were comfortable repairing it, they did. I lived with chest pain the entire time however. Center of my chest or on the left side just like you. It caused so much I needed anxiety in my life. But it never caused anything. Just discomfort. In the early days I went to the ER for the pain but I did not know how to determine if it was something serious or not.  I am no expert, but have you looked into other diseases/genes that might result in a similar appearance? For example, since you are a male, there may be many X-linked disorders with varying degrees of similarity.  One I just read about is called Lujan-Fryns syndrome which can result in a very long, thin appearance with joint hypermobility but may not necessarily be related to aortic aneurysms, etc.  Some of the \"typical\" characteristics of this disease may not match your case; however, I do think there are often varying degrees of these sorts of diseases and the cases that are found online are more typically skewed towards the more severe side of the spectrum. I wish you luck in your search. I discovered Lujan's a while ago, but kind of forgot about it until recently. I was thinking Homocystinuria because I have vitamin issues however I do not have a lens dislocation.\n\nSo it is either Homocystinuria or Lujan syndrome. My appointment for my results is soon, so I will let you all know my answer (if they even find anything.)", "Sports? I just found out about marfans. I am seeing a doctor this week, but I am certain I have it. I like to play soccer, basketball and most of all ultimate frisbee. Will I able to keep playing? Will I be able to play competitively/at a high level? Can I lift weights?", "Heart Valve Regurgitation I recently saw a cardiologist again regarding my shortness of breath and chest pain I have had for a while now and had an ultrasound done of my heart. The results apparently showed that I have heart valve regurgitation in some of my valves, before having this test when speaking to the cardiologist we briefly spoke on Marfan's syndrome which is something I have felt like is a very likely possibility for myself as well considering nearly all of the common signs and symptoms I do have.\n\nDoes anyone else here have this same problem and if so what do you do to avoid it getting worse? According to my test results mine is just minor at the moment but I am concerned about it progressing worse of course. Yes, it had this with my aorta. The problem is that this requires the heart to work harder to function. This leads to an enlarged heart and then heart failure. \n\nDid your doctor say how severe it is? If it is bad enough they may have to do surgery. It says minor, my doctor said to get it checked every so often to make sure it does not get worse. I have an appointment with my cardiologist next week about it though. How has this problem affected you? It was my aortic valve and it was fixed alongside my aneurysm repair. But before that I had lots of chest pain and was fatigued all the time. Mine was mitral, and they said it was mild.   I have mentioned it to my Primary Care Provider, and we both seem to think I am better off worrying about other things.   YMMV, and I suppose they will want you to go back for another cardiology check eventually, but maybe it will be 10 years or more. Minr is mild too. I have seen cardiologists multiple times since I was a teen because of my chest pain. Do you have shortness of breath, chest pain, and fatigue as well? I do not know about 10 years, my PCP said every 2-3 years or so. Fatigue I think.  I have had chest pains a few times, including the one where they diagnosed my MVP. I grew up thinking I was somehow the only person on my mother's side that did not have Marfans.  I saw two different doctors growing up who both took one look and told me I did not have it. One ran some tests and measurements but this was before genetic testing. When I finally went to the clinic with chest pain, I was told to go home with some allergy medicine until I insisted on an EKG and they sent me straight to the ER.  I had a huge aortic aneurysm and severe regurgitation in the aortic and mitral valves.  I had surgery almost immediately and now have an artificial heart valve.  Now my regurgitation is actually better than average.  I guess the moral of the story is to make sure to have those things checked regularly and take it seriously.  My mother, both of her sisters, and probably my grandfather all died unexpectedly of aortic dissections. My grandfather was old enough that they did not really consider Marfans at that time. MVP? That sounds quite intense, I am sure the loss was heavy. I never heard of Marfan's Syndrome until a few years ago and I do not think anyone in my family has it as far as I know. My girlfriend believes that I have it but my family does not seem to know what it is or anything so I am pretty new to this all. Were you diagnosed with it yourself? I have had intermittent chest pain as well as fatigue for a long time now with no official diagnosis of anything. Most of the time they chalk it up to my scoliosis and say it is a \"musculoskeletal\" problem or whatever. Were you diagnosed with Marfan's Syndrome? I have not been diagnosed with a genetic test or anything and from what I understand those are not 100% reliable either.  But you can display some or all or almost none of the physical traits and still have it. My mother was not unusually tall but she did have the \"bird chest\".  The rest of my mother's side are all very tall and just look like you would expect someone with Marfans to look.  My brother is both very tall, long limbs and digits, bird chest, pretty much all of the physical traits. \n\nI think after the heart surgery it is a pretty safe bet that I was not the only person out of a very large family to escape it. Yes, clinically as a kid and now via DNA test. I had my spine fused - have you done that? Scoliosis is no joke. No, I opted not to have surgery. How were you diagnosed as a kid? I feel like growing up my parents missed a lot of things medically with me and now I am spending years trying to figure it all out. An optometrist noticed my dislocated lenses when I was four. Then they checked my heart and other signs right out of a textbook (they showed me the pictures lol) and diagnosed me. \n\nWhen DNA tests came out I had one but there was no match. &gt;10 years later I had another test and it found a more recently identified market. But this was just a formality as my clinical diagnosis was indisputable. \n\nI am in Canada so going to the doctor was no big deal. \n\nI am glad you are taking control of things. You got to do that in order to keep yourself healthy! Sometimes you will need to educate doctors and dig deep with them. E.g, recently I was diagnosed with Dural Ectasia but initially the radiologist did not find it though. My family doctor is super smart and referred me to neurologist. He said well the neurologist did not find anything. I asked: did you look at the scans? So he opened them up and there it was. So this helps explain in part all the nerve pain I am having. That is the kind of initiative you will unfortunately need to have sometimes. Mitral valve prolapse. That is what I thought, my mother has that same issue. I have never heard of dural ecstasia until just recently. Did that have anything to do with your spinal fusion that you mentioned you had? I was glad to hear the cardiologist mention marfan's syndrome, it is the first time I have heard a doctor even mention it, I was thinking about it for a while about how and who to even bring up the possibility with. When I go next week to speak to them hopefully they will be able to delve deeper into it. No, the fusion happened when I was young and the DE only started having symptoms recently. Do you know what caused your DE then? Is it related to Marfans? 100% Marfan. I have read 60-90% of people with Marfan will get it. But not everyone will have adverse effects. I see, wow I have not heard of this before.  How exactly did you get diagnosed with it again and what are the symptoms? Diagnosed via MRI and for me I have nerve pain in multiple areas. You can learn more here:  The symptoms of DE are things I have been dealing with for a while now. I have not had an MRI of my spine done in a few years now though. What are the signs and symptoms you have of marfans? Slender build, scoliosis, flat feet, chest curved in, nearsightedness, and long arms/legs and fingers. I am not sure about anything else right now. When you say slender build/long arms/legs, have you and your extremeties been measured and compared to what is an \"abnormal\" slender and tall build? And btw, hope you get better soon :) No I have not had them measure and compared to anything as far as I know.", "Pregnancy, possible Marfan Syndrome and Autistic sibling... I am 32 years old, been married for almost three years and am hesitating getting pregnant. I grew up with a younger sibling with autism (she passed 10 years ago from a nocturnal seizure), and recently found out about Marfan Syndrome (which I hit many of the physical characteristics).

Thank you all in advance for your input!", "Should I see a doctor about Marfans? I know you need a doctor's diagnosis to know for sure, but I figured I would ask anyway after a while of wondering. I have what I think could be quite a few symptoms of Marfan Syndrome, and just want to know if I should look into getting a doctor's appointment about it. Here are the ones I have noticed/found: scoliosis (doctors say it is slight), pectus excavatum (my brother has the one that is the opposite, pigeon chest), the thing with my wrists where I can easily reach my hand all the way around with overlap (same for my brother), I am tall and thin (my dad is 6'5\", mom is slightly above average, too. I am taller than her, about 5'8.5\"), I have long fingers and hand, long and narrow feet (it is SO hard to find shoes that fit, LOL), hypermobility in my thumbs (very uncomfortable to write for a long time), and I have had heart palpitations from just sitting in class working. Idk, maybe I am overreacting, and these are just tall people things, and the heart palpitations are from something else. I guess I should add I also have minor asthma. Another thing, my mom thinks I am overreacting and has given me these reasons for not going to the doctor; she does not want to take me. Idk, what do you all think?

I had some spectacular developments concerning extreme pain associated with my Marfan's suddenly disappearing, however I could be an \"outlier\". But I figured starting here might help me identify who I should pass this information onto at the foundation, and where I could go to find out if others experienced the same phenomenon as myself. Again, take your meds as directed by your doctors, I could be a 100% unique outlier.\n\nSo to give a quick, blunt characterization of my pain: after standing for 1-3 hours, the next 3 three days the pain in my ankles would like clockwork be so excruciatingly bad that if felt (sorry for the graphic nature of the description, but it really felt this bad) like my ankles were being held on by mere strands of tendons and felt like they could break off at any moment with every step. While holding a phone to my head for only a mere 5 minutes, my arm would lock into place, particularly around the elbow (the tendons or ligaments or joints inside that is, just like my ankles). It would take nearly 5 minutes to relax my arm back to normal for regular movements again and any attempt of forcing it down sooner, again, felt like it would literally snap off. Extremely, extremely, debilitating pain. Sorry if that all sounds dark, it just was what it was for me and I would wish it upon no one. This type of pain was full body, and those are relatively small or light activities I described doing. It only got horribly worse the larger or longer the activities. It would literally stop you in your tracks and take your breath away... BUT it was so normal I got used to it and used to hiding it because it was my daily life since about 12 years old (may not be a coincidence). I am 32 now. Saying that life felt like daily torture, would not be an exaggeration, and I could not possibly understand how true that was until it went away.\n\nAll that pain went away nearly overnight. It seemed almost like a miracle, an answer to prayers that I did not even pray for anymore. I thanked and praised God for it. I took atenelol since 12 years old when I was diagnosed with marfans and added in losartan around 20 yrs old when those research trials began showing promising results. Extraordinary pain remained until about 29 years old. It went away, almost miraculously, seemingly overnight. I could breathe better even, energy was higher than I ever remember experiencing in my life. So what changed? Standing for mere hours causing horrific pain for days to then suddenly be able to start Hiking 10 miles a day, carrying at least 100 pounds of equipment, something I would not have even dreamed being possible in my life. So what changed?\n\nAt the time, I could not pinpoint it. But I was overjoyed. It was not until around Christmas time last year that I took atenelol again (this was the factor I was not able to pinpoint and was a blindspot for me). I took only half a 25mg dose &amp; all that horrific pain I described flooded back almost instantaneously (witin 24hrs). I found my trigger. It was the atenelol, the beta blocker. I tested this many times to discover that it was in fact the catalyst for MY horrific pain. How it works, and why it works to cause such pain in me, I do not know. But it seemed like a godsend when my pain first went away at about 29, but could not pinpoint what it was until 31. DO NOT SUDDENLY STOP YOUR MEDS based on what I am saying. Atenelol itself has an extremely nasty rebound effect on the pulse when suddenly stopping it, regardless if you are a marfans patient or not - it is dangerous for anybody to do that, SO DO NOT. I tapered myself down and off of it around the age of 29 for reasons I will not mention here. But I stayed on my full prescibed dose of Cozaar/losartan (25mg b.i.d.).\n\nSince it was such an amazing answer to the worst side effects of my marfans (extremely, extremely horrible pain, exhaustion, low energy levels, etc.), I wanted to share it in case others suffered their most extreme pain like myself, due to the atenelol. Again, I might be 100% unique on this. This might only be me who is suffered so much only to find out the cause was the beta blocker I was taking. It could be unique to my genes only. But in case it is not unique to just me, I felt it was my duty to share it, and also ask for help about who I should pass this onto at the foundation in case they might find this useful.\n\nLast PSA - if this turns out to be true for anyone else, it is only cause for celebration. No one could have known this, and the doctors have done extraordinary work for us and aiding us in our battle with marfans. Essentially I am saying, do not blame anyone if this turns out to be the cause of all your most horrific pain as it did mine, because no one is to blame. No one asked for marfans. It is none of our faults. And every doctor I have known since finding out I had this syndrome have gone above and beyond and deserve our thanks only for that.\n\nThank you for listening, and may God bless all of you and your family's. \n\nSincerely,\nJustin Jones\n(623)810-2128\nText first if you plan on calling so I can know who to expect - lot's of automated calls (most likely political) as of late as you can imagine. that is fantastic!

To join go to  I also had it when I was 33, so I do not count, but that is not going to stop me from sharing :-)\n\nYou are young, which means you will likely have an easier time of it than us old dudes in our 30s :-) Here is what I can recommend: The healthier you are going in, the easier recovery is coming out, but do not stress over that. Even if you are a lump on the couch between now and then you will probably pop right up you are so young. Afterwards, just make yourself get up and move around. You will be shocked at how quickly you mend. Do you know if you will require blood thinners after? Are they sparing the valve if they can?  \nOne other piece of advice: This is heart surgery, so milk. that. shit. People are going to want to help you and do nice things for you and get you gifts. Let them. For as long as you can get them. You deserve it. I want you to practice grimacing and clutching your chest gently. Then, after surgery, whenever you want something and you are getting resistance from someone you pull out the chest clutch grimace and watch the weather change. ;-) ARGH THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE DISCORD SERVER!! i will definitely join :)) and thank you for the reply as well, really helped me calm down ^^ thank you for the reply, made me laugh jajjajaja I will definitely make use of the pity tactic. \nI workout a few times a week and eat healthy for the most part so I am glad that will help. My dad takes blood thinners but only if he is taking a plane (I think he just does it cuz he can get a bit hypochondriac) and they will be sparing the valve as far as I know. I still need to talk to the doctor more in depth about it but it will probably take a while because he is the best in the country :)) I am at 48mm right now (20M) and scheduling my surgery for next summer (before my senior year of college). I was told to expect the first three weeks to be pretty painful (especially the few days in the hospital post-op), but after that it is just getting your strength back up!

Hi everyone!\n\nI am a 38F with Marfan's, and this past year was \"diagnosed\" with Seronegative Rheumatoid Arthritis. I have diagnosed in quotes because my doctor still is not 100% sure, but that is the closest thing, based on my pain and swelling, and having negative results for everything else I was tested for (Lyme disease, Lupus, etc.). Having Marfan's, and knowing it affects the connective tissue, I cannot help but think that it could be connected, that my issues might be more Marfan's-related than arthritis. Or I just happened to get both. \n\nI am just wondering if anyone else in this community also has RA or has experienced similar pain or joint issues. \n\nMy symptoms- I started with crazy neck pain, which traveled down my back, which traveled to my arms and legs. Eventually after a few weeks, my hips were in so much pain, and so weak, I could barely walk, and needed help even getting dressed. It is now controlled (mostly) by meds, though my hips and shoulders still flare up quite a bit.\n\nAny insight is helpful, thanks for reading! I unfortunately do not have any anecdata as far as specifically a form of rheumatoid arthritis, but I have been told by several of my orthopedists and cardiologists as I have aged that say that there is already an increased chance of osteoperosis being born female, but things like osteoarthritis as well because of marfans. So as a general grouping of things, it is more likely that you will face some form of arthritis, but as to specifics it is up to genetics/luck.\n\nI have been seeing osteoarthritis in my charts since I was in my early 20s, I will be 32 at the end of August.\n\nHope that helps With our loved ones it is osteoarthritis and joints that wear out prematurely.  Knee and hip replacements are a right of passage in this family.  On the upside, going through these surgeries a little younger seems to make recovery easier.\n\nSorry for the pain you are experiencing.  I hope it stays under control. Make sure that they rule out dural ectasia, it does have some similar symptoms to what you are describing, and needs an MRI to rule out. Something like 60% of us have it, and it is actually part of diagnosing. Usually starts in folks 30s. You should read The Inflammation Solution: When Everything Works and Nothing Hurts \n\nI will not say that it will relieve your symptoms but it will help you understand what is happening to your joints. That is one thing that has never been mentioned, and I did not know anything about. After reading, you are right. I will definitely bring that up with my rheumatologist, thank you!", "Push ups and wall squats So without going into to much details am I correct in assuming push-ups and wall squats is not recommend for adults? What about for children? I do not think it is as black and white as which exercises are not allowed/recommended. For background, I have Loeys-Dietz syndrome and had an aortic root replacement surgery last November. I was given restrictions on how much effort to exert while exercising, rather than specific exercises themselves. My cardiologist recommended that I only weight-lift whatever I can do 20 reps of, without struggling. So going back to your question, push ups are fine under my restrictions, if I can easily do 20 of them.\n\nI know my situation is not the same as yours, but just wanted to share my thoughts. Always best to reach out to your doctor/cardiologist and get answers from them! Wish you all the best. If you are concerned about this I would say check with a cardiologist and a physical therapist. \n\nI have marfan\u2019s and have had my obligatory aortic bypass. Nevertheless, I work out regularly at the gym and doing body weight exercises.  Push ups probably not but wall squats? I do not see why those would be restricted? \n\nI know generally they want to avoid increased pressure on the chest, which is why push ups would generally be a no go for most marfs. But leg, butt and core strength is good so unless you have a joint issue? I would think wall squats would actually be safer than normal squats right? \n\nIf you can get a consult with a physical therapist that may be for the best.  Squats be careful to. People always assume cardiac risk (rightly so) but consider that not a lot of physios know A LOT of enough to necessarily keep you \"safe\". \n\nMy retina blew in physio doing isometric exercises the therapist said were fine. Turns out they were not. Not even close. If these guys have you doing the same \"routines\" as everyone else,odds are they are full of shit. Protect yourself and your points.

My whole life I had/have tried to gain weight and now the marfans explains why I cannot. \n\nRecently, I just went back to the doctor because I have been experiencing some leg/left arm pain and my skin is periodically turning BLUE in certain spots. They ran some tests, but they all came back negative. Has anyone else ever had this problem?\n\nI am getting nervous because my grandpa died of an aneurysm in his back when he was in his forties.

Whether you get the label of \"Marfans\" or not is - in my opinion - mostly irrelevant. Whether you have it or not, you still have to worry about your aorta, which you are doing. These are the cards you were dealt. It sucks. That is life. But at least you have a better chance of living longer than you would have if you had been undiagnosed. Please be careful with ADHD meds. Many of them are stimulants which could be detrimental to your heart particularly given your current measurement.  This new round of testing came from the GP about the meds and my heart so I guess that is a good thing.\n\nI have been off the meds for nearly 3 weeks due to the heart concerns but also the drop off in effectiveness.\n\nWhen the cardiologist did some score add up for the aortic dissection, Marfan's, Tetralogy of Fellow and the ADHD meds were all listed as being risk factors so that was an eye opener to just how at risk I am. \n\n Yep that is life, lucky this was caught now, not down the line if some bad happened.

Right now I eat a lot of Ezekiel Bread and avocado which are both high calorie foods that are easily digestible (I do not eat any sugar except from fruits because sugar gives me headaches). Any recommendations? Thanks!", "Who here exercises? This question has been coming up a lot, questions about gaining weight and muscles. Are there any people here that work out? If so, what do you do? And, have you seen any benefits or issues arise from exercising? Man, I already feel guilty for lying to my doctor about this, I do not want to have to lie here, too... :-) I do, I workout and play soccer despite knowing I should not.  \n\n\nThe only difference is that I try to never go beyond my limit, never go 100%, just 70% AT MOST. If I am tired or not feeling 100% I will not work out as well.  \n\n\nAs for benefits, well, less pain across my body, I have a pretty big scoliosis so any kind of physical activity makes it so I am not in pain from just sitting down or having long walks. Just walking mostly, and I do not have a solid diagnosis. Lots of walking/ hiking, some resistance training. I keep weight low and reps slow and volume high when doing so. Everyone should be exercising!  \nNow this said, the intensity in which some Marfan people should exercise varies.  \n\n\n( has good guidelines, but the best is to ask your cardiologist on what you should and should not be doing.

Do you notice any effects on your body after working out the heavier exercises like resistance? Yeah, I grew up playing football (soccer) and even played some friendlies after my surgery knowing my risk.\n\nDo you do any stretches for your scoliosis? Or is that painful. I used to have a pull up bar and loved hanging from it for a minute. I posted because because I actually read the guidelines yesterday and I was wondering if others actually followed them?\n\nMy doctors never told me not to exercise or do weight training, so I have had to kind of put all this together from different sources.\n\nI also want to know if others actually follow these guidelines, I know I do not. But it was useful to see the breakdown in METs (metabolic equivalents).\n\n&gt; In general, one with Marfan syndrome would want to keep the intensity of exercise andphysical activity in the low to moderate METs range (&lt;6 METs). I just do very basic yoga ones to stretch both sides of my back, 30 seconds each side every couple of hours. I used to push it to hard. I actually blew out my retina doing isometric exercise. Now I am confined to chair yoga. Can you explain how you pushed yourself hard and what exercises you did?\n\nI am curious because I was never told to avoid working out, just avoid contact sports, but after reading all these stories I am definitely being more cautious about my workout routine, which is weightlifting and yoga sometimes. When my retina blew I was actually in physio lol. The physiotherapist was unfortunately ignorant about our condition. I was doing a lot of yoga/weights. I was actually in a plank position and my retina ripped. There was a pop and that was it. \n\nMy cardiologist said I was quite lucky it was not my aorta. That lifting weights/doing that type of yoga is to much wear and tare for my body. \n\nI do chair yoga now and use resistance bands. 33M. I started doing lite resistance (~30lb max) for 30-60 minutes 3x a week and my 10+ year stable 3.9-4.0 aorta shot up to 4.7 between annual scans. 4.5+ is where they recommend surgery in Marfan's. \n\nJust had surgery to replace the root a week ago. It is a bummer, I was feeling the best I ever have when exercising (sleeping better, better positivity/mental health, feeling better and a little more confident). Even for someone with a seemingly mild case of Marfan's, feels like you cannot win sometimes. I will go back to exercise after recovery, will just have to make the best of it given my limitations. Sorry about that. I have had a simmilar story and this is very frustating. How was the recovery after the surgery? The first week was hell, but all shit unrelated to my heart (extreme nausea from anesthesia, extreme neck pain from being hyperextended for the intubation, insomnia from bed being uncomfortable, stomach pain, headaches, high blood pressure/pulse, etc). I hated how oxy (pain killer) made me feel so I got off that as fast as possible. Lung collapsed after surgery, that took almost a week to heal and was probably the worst part. \n\nHeart was fine through the whole thing, which is good. The rest of my body just was not having it. After day 6 everything cleared up, went home, things have not been bad. Pain is shockingly low for having been cracked open. Have to take everything slow and there is a lot I cannot do yet but the 6 weeks will go by fast enough. this is crazy because my aorta was also stable for years and i started weight lifting (and also being sloppy/irregular with taking my meds) and had a decent amount of growth that led to replacement surgery. I also was feeling my best ever when i was working out and light on my meds.  my aortic root. i do not remember the exact diameter.

I also lost some weight and now I weigh 85 kg. But I still have a great deal of abdominal weight that just do not want to go away. My facial features have gotten more extreme, sagging cheeks, drooping eyes and my teeth are pertruding back to a hot mess. I feel ugly, I feel like a freak.\nI am not wearing my glasses, because I feel miserable whenever I look in the mirror and I cry if I see a picture of myself.\nI just want to talk about it with you guys about it, because no one around me can relate. I feel like I am losing my self confidence. Can any of you relate? And what have you done to feel better about your self? I am 21 and it is been a rough path accepting myself. Somedays are better than other. I got braces but my smile is not good because of the jaw structure. My scoliosis is worse. I have been losing weight and looking too skinny. It looks like just bones except chubby cheeks of mine. It is super hard finding clothes that futs me and are tall enough. I do not know if i will ever be able to accept myself. But what i do is i tell myself\u2019I love you\u2019 everyday looking into a mirror. Even if I do not feel that way on somedays. I started wearing contact lenses but then it was too much and i am wearing glasses again. There are many people like us. We are not alone. I do not know if me saying anything will help. I have learned that confidence do make a difference. So fake it till you make it is all I try to do. I once heard an interesting point of view on this from the perspective of looks: at the end of the day, it is very likely that you are simply not your type. But you are somebody is type, and those people are out there. We cannot help the way Marfan Syndrome makes us look. We all have it, that look. \n\nBut that is not what defines your worth. You define your worth, and people will pick up on that. Another way to say it is: when you love yourself, others will too. Some people call it confidence. People are attracted to confidence, moreso than looks. But if you do not like you, why should they? I know that can be hard, especially if you are younger, but the good news is that it tends to get easier as you get older. Surround yourself with supportive people, and build up a love for yourself.\n\nYou are already off to a good start. You recognize that you need something, and you have reached out to get what you need. That shows initiative, drive, intelligence, and an insight many people do not have. You will be ok. Everyone is hard on themselves sometimes, but you will be ok. I am a 33yo Male and though I have not been officially dx with marfans(have most of the physical manifestations) it has ruined my entire life. I look so bad that it has precluded me from having any sort of relationships. No friends or gfs to speak of. And believe me, I have tried, to no avail.  I wish I looked normal. true happiness is found within Yeah, I definitely can. I am 15F right now and I really just struggle with feeling ugly all the time. Ever since I was little people always felt free to just make comments on my appearance as if there is not a person behind it so my self esteem was never the best. I am so used to that reality that I feel really uncomfortable when people compliment me (because nobody ever really does it unprompted). There are a lot of things I do not like about myself, some are changeable but many are not. Even so, I like to focus on what I CAN change. Maybe I will not ever be that muscular but I can still work out and be healthy. Maybe my teeth are messed up but I still fixed them with braces. Being able to fix things, even if there is no immediate result, always makes me feel better because I know that I do not give up on myself even if I may be unhappy. Idk if that helps but that is my opinion Hey. So full disclosure I do not have Marfans exactly but I have all the facial features. \n\nI wish I had some advice but all I can offer is love This is beautiful, thanks for sharing this insight for someone who too struggles with self esteem We all do, my friend. When you are young, it is typically about looks. When  you get older like me, it tends to be about other things like career and all that. I have learned how valuable kind and supportive words are to me. It is such a huge reassurance when someone tells me I am ok, or I am doing well, or I look nice. And then I think about how often I think other people are doing well or look nice and I do not say anything, but if I did I could give them that boost that I value so much. So I have been trying to teach myself to speak up and tell people when I admire something about them. It is not an easy habit to learn. You give some great advice! I think we live in a world where there is so many instances of an assumed perfection plastered anywhere and everywhere. And we need to realize that not only does that not match us with marfans but truly does not match basically everyone! We are all in this boat together of media defining an unattainable perfection. But I have heard a lot about waiting for when the dating pool matures. I think that people who have marfans have been through so much in their own lives and have had to come to terms with such serious things that we have matured much quicker than others. And I hope that others feeling inadequacy know yes, we are different from others. But we are different because we have so much more of a respect for our day, and who we spend the day with. Choosing to work on yourself rather than giving up is always the right idea! I am 20m and high school sucked regarding positive attention. You have to remember that in our generation kids are so absorbed in their phone, in social media, and in their own worries and fears that it would take so much willpower to overcome that to share a compliment. So it is nothing personal. Once you get to college people mature and genuinely interact with other. Until then, be the person you want to be. The excercising and being proactive about your health is right on the money. And rather than thinking of what would garner approval from your peers. Think of what garners your approval. I can definitely relate. Self esteem is something all people struggle with, but as people with marfans we have been so used to being identified by our features. But one thing I learned through talking with my psyche doc is that no one even remotely scrutinizes us in that regard. We are just regular people who get asked how tall we are a little too much. I will not act like I do not have bad days. I do. But you have to remember that our traits are what make us individuals, and being an individual is what makes us beautiful. I came up with this analogy and remind myself with it when I am feeling bad: what makes a mountain beautiful? Is it it is perfection? No. Its the unique shape, it is distinct features, it is awe inspiring size and strength. If we were to see a mountain that was \u201cperfect\u201d we would be unnerved. There is no beauty in something that is a perfect triangle, without tree or crater or one of a kind shape. And the same goes for people.", "Lens replacement I need your help, I am in the need for lens replacement surgery and I have heard that some people in the past have gotten lenses with the right strength put into their eyes, resulting in them not needing glasses anymore.

I had scleral lensectomy in both eyes. I had my lenses and zonules taken out  and an artificial lense put in and secured to my eyeball wall. I wear glasses now to get me to 20/20, and for reading. I do not know what lenses I had put in, but I know there are more variables than just the lense. Everyone is eye is shaped differently and how far back/close the lense is can affect vision. That is why I had one eye done, then the doc evaluated my prescription to determine any lense placement adjustments they would make for my other eye. \n\nJust because one person had the perfect lense and placement combo and ended up with perfect vision does not mean you can use the same lense and you will get the same result, because everyone is eyes are different. \n\nOnly an opthalmologist will know what is best for you. Good luck!! Indeed, happy for you  btw! My concern is that my doctor is very good, and he says that I probably should avoid the kind that makes me glasses free.

As of last week, I learned that my aorta is dilated, also learned that I have congestive heart failure. The mitral valve is not prolapsed, but it is regurgitating, and the aortic valve is regurgitating. The PCP and cardiologist both believe that I have Marfan\u2019s, but I have to wait for the next month's genetic testing. I have an MRI scheduled to get a better view of the heart to compare with the echocardiogram. I know each person's presentation is different. How do you all manage this long term, and is it stressful or forget about it over time? Thanks for any response. I am not asking for medical advice, although if you would like to share any experience with the issue, that is much appreciated. How do you know that your lens is detaching? Also, hope you do not have marfans bro. From my ophthalmologist. It was discovered at a standard eye exam. He was the one who prompted the test.  I have been going to the same eye doctor for 15 years. you manage it one day at a time. Focus on maintenance and prevention care. Biggest thing that helped me was to have all my doctors on the same page, whenever I have a pcp, gyn, cardio, or eye appointment the doctor sends the notes and any test results to my other doctors. Marfans is hereditary in my family, so I am used to it. It is scary but a normal life is possible. You may want to consider a counselor too. your going to go though a lot of emotions There is a lot of emotions; it can be hard to think of it as something that you can live with since it is only recently that we have a normal lifespan, but it is totally something that is possible. \nThere are good days and bad days.\n\nEdited to correct spelling/grammar due to mobile phone /u/amoebashephard, I have found an error in your comment:\n\n &gt; \u201c are good\u201d\n\nI claim that you, amoebashephard, miswrote a post and should use \u201c are good\u201d instead. \u2018They are\u2019 means \u2018they are\u2019, not \u2018they\u2019 or \u2018there\u2019.\n\n ^(This is an automated bot. I do not intend to shame your mistakes. If you think the errors which I found are incorrect, please contact me through dms or contact my owner EliteDaMyth) The doctors diagnosis seems accurate.\n\nThe lenses in both my eyes completely dislocated, and in one eye the lens actually fell into the bottom of my eye - but this was a miracle for me, because when I had my lenses removed from my eyes, I could see almost 20/20 with Multifocal XR contact lenses.\n\nIn some cases they are able to implant a lens.  \n\n\n  \nFor your heart, ask your doctor about Losartan and/or Beta Blockers, and ask them if there are any supplements you should be taking.  \n\n\nI take trans-Resveratrol 1g, Garlic, Coenzyme Q10, NMN, and I also now take long term Doxycycline prescription along with my Losartan.  \n\n\n( Thanks for the insight and useful information. Until last week I did not even think it was a possibility for me to have this issue but overlooking things for a wile caught up with me. I knew about marfans from the genetics class I am taking this semester. It surely has put some things into perspective.

(\n\n***\n\n^(Even if I do not reply to your comment, I am still listening for votes. Check the webpage to see if your vote registered!) Hey we are nearly the same person! I was diagnosed with Marfan's at 3 but I too have a dilated aorta and dislocated lens, and some minor scoliosis. Really the only way to manage it is by having frequent visits with your doctors to track growth and progression. I would not be too worried - we are at the point now where this condition is more or less manageable with proper doctor supervision and medicine. Just make sure that you are not too hard on yourself physically and you should be good! The good news is that you are alive at twenty without diagnosis, meaning you are not one of the most severe cases (there are some where heart surgery is required really early).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong term it really depends on the case, everyone has different severity. It sounds like yours is pretty average, meaning you can expect to have a long life filled with mostly normal activities, you just will not ever be able to lift weights or work in an overly physically strenuous job.  \n\n\nDo you know what your aortic measurements were?  \n\n\nDo not panic! When I first found out I could have marfans I sort of spiraled and it led to a lot of issues later on. Remember, you will be ok, it is an extremely treatable condition, and in most cases does not lead to disability. Why Doxycycline? I take it for acne, although in Mice with Marfan Syndrome it is been shown to be very effective to prevent aneurysms.  \n\nHowever in studies in humans without Marfan Syndrome who have aortic aneurysms, Doxycycline was not effective.\n\nI am not aware of any studies in human Marfan patients I am going to say that learning about everything that is associated with Marfans is scary/overwhelming. I have lived with it my whole life and my mother had it. I agree with those who said it is a day to day thing and keeps it easy to manage. Taking meds becomes second nature and automatic. One thing I have learned is not to sleep too late because it seriously affected how I feel the next day (heart palpitations seemed worse). I also learned how to limit my activity, especially when hiking or even being on walk. Once you realize what you need to do for the symptoms, for me anyway, I have forgotten I have it. There were days when I felt shitty because I am the only one in my family who has it (my mother had it also, but she passed away almost 16 years ago) and I just felt alone and just super different from everyone. After having heart surgery to fix the issues I had (aorta had a hole and experienced mitrovavle regurgitation) I have felt a thousand times better, but the rest of my body still has marfans. I have kyphosis (but not severe) which kills my back and flat feet so I have to make sure to always have some back support in the car, on my computer chair, etc. and because of my flat feet i make sure to have comfortable shoes or insoles. It is honestly just a regular part of life to make adjustments. Sorry this is such a long reply, but hopefully it helped a little.", "My guy has marfans. Aorta dissected today. Any input would be great. Hi..i was searching for marfans and surgery on here, and Found this subreddit.  I was hoping you all might not mind if I pick your brains a little? The love of my life-he has known he has marfans for years but tried to ignore it, even though I have fussed at him about it multiple times-is currently sedated in a hospital bed after 7 hours in surgery today. He had a multi focal aortic disection today, with a severely distended aortic root. They resected a section of his aorta and reinforced it with Dacron and replaced his aortic valve. They are keeping him under for another day or two. I guess what I need to know is-what happens when he wakes up? What is the best way to be here for him? How comparable is that to your experience? Do you feel like you again yet? Are you weaker than normal? anything you can think of or do not mind telling me, I want to know. I am going to be by his side for every step of this, even though I know his stubborn ass is not going to like me seeing him as anything less than a tough macho man. Not knowing if he was going to make it out of surgery today was the hardest 7 hours of my life. They had my heart on that table too. So anything! Thanks!", "Can We End \u201cDo I Have Marfans\u201d Questions and Threads that Ask for Medical Advice? I really, really do not want to be a jerk here, but sometimes it feels like people use this sub as some kind of internet-based ( (that is a link to an actual internet-based magic 8 ball). \n\nThere is no way to tell from a description - *no matter how good* - or a photo - *no matter how bad* - if a person has it or not. Even if we were all doctors, none of us are in a position to make a diagnosis based on the information available here. \n\nSimilarly, people asking \u201cis it ok for me to...\u201d simply should not. This is a syndrome, which means different people can do different things; and others, perhaps, should not do those things. There is no way to tell without seeking advice from a medical professional - and even then, it can be tricky. \n\nWe can not give medical advice, and we should not provide a venue where people might. Similarly, people already stressed-out by their possible condition, who are looking for answers, should be directed to where they can find them. \n\nJust my 2 cents. My apologies if I have upset anyone, it certainly was not my intent. Agreed on all counts This is a job for automod, just have it post on every post from a first time poster a standard comment with information. A blanket dismissal is wrong, as people may be truly freaked out and a quick reassurance and redirection to a medical professional is far better than a dismissal. OP clearly recognizes that in their post, but yeah expanding to a positive action of using automod for this. I have felt like kind of a jerk for getting harsh with some of the \"I am tall and skinny tell me I am special like you because my doctors will not\" hypochondriac posts round here, but damn they are annoying. Reddit is not a place for medical advice and even if any of us are doctors we could not diagnose anyone over the internet better than a person in direct contact with the pt. Hi all. Mod here.\n\nSo, this is why I have had the same sticky post up for.. nearly the entire life of this sub (which is something like 8 years now!) for this very reason. And every time I take it down (in this case to announce the wiki) someone makes this post within a matter of days. And I agree; it is why I made the original sticky post in the first place!\n\nSo do not worry; you are not alone, and you are not being rude. However, I do not think outright banning such posts is the right thing. I think the best we can do is teach people the best way to approach their concerns. If automod is the right tool for that, then I will look into it. At the least, I will certainly restore the original sticky post now that we all know about the wiki (which by the way, I really encourage you all to contribute to). Thanks very much for voicing your concerns! We will do our best to alert new users. Yes please Good mod :)", "Exercise and Marfans Hi guys, I have read a bit about Marfans and not being able to build muscle, wondering if any of you have experience with this.\n\nI do not want to be a body builder or anything, but I dance a lot and have recently started doing a few competitions. I would like to get stronger so I can lift my partner more, but I am wondering if that will be possible/safe with the Marfans. I know not to do any high impact exercise but I am guessing that low weight stuff should be ok?\n\nAny experience/advice greatly appreciated.", "How do i learn to accept my body? As a 19 year old female, I struggle a lot with my self image. I am super tall and thin with long limbs. I do agree it is probably easier being skinny than fat but my body type is still not and never will be the beauty standard. I get a lot of body anxiety particularly during summer and I rarely wear short sleeve T-shirt\u2019s. I am constantly thinking about my body, from the moment I wake up to the moment I fall asleep. Sometimes I will go through bouts of avoiding leaving the house so people will not see me. I have been told so many times it would be so easy for me to just gain weight. I have been to a nutritionist and I was given a meal plan but even after eating huge amounts of food I just did not put on any weight. I am just so self conscious all the time. Even I do gain weight, I will never be able to change my bone structure. I place a lot of my worth on my appearance and I often have suicidal thoughts because of how I think others perceive me. Male north of 45, learn to eat well it can come to haunt you if you develop bad eating habits early on, be true to yourself find an interest and make it you are own would be my advise. Male 23, so cannot say it is the same, but I had a lot of similar intrusive thoughts about how people saw me.\n\nThey were at their worst around my late teens, but after 20, once I would stopped growing and I was out in the world more for college, my body type was not a constant discussion point like it was in high school where everyone in my class had basically grown up together from K-12 and saw my \"abnormal\" growth the whole time. So I was just me, instead of \"that really tall guy who grew like 4 ft in a few years, how crazy is that?\" And once that change came, I stopped worrying as much. It is extremely tough to accept what we have to live with daily; we are all tall, skinny, with long limbs, and living with these bodies is enough of a struggle in and of itself.\n\nThe biggest realization that helped me - do not allow what you 'think' others view is of you, to drag things down. Your body is not your worth, you are as a whole. Live your life as you are able and want to. Honest truth is no-one here is really qualified to give advise as those issues cannot be fixed with a short paragraph. Myself included.\n\nThat being said, a therapist with a specialty or history of treating patients with genetic disorders would be far better suited to assisting your needs. Hey there,\n\nI myself have difficulty gaining weight and so I am not sure if its an issue Marfans patients have. However with that said, when I started counting calories, I did consistently gain weight. As a dude I aimed for 2800 calories a day and doing that consistently everday I managed to gain 1lb a week.  I stopped because it really was tough for me to eat so much and I ended up losing all the weight. However, it might not need to be as much calories for you since your a woman.\n\nI also believe that the most important thing is just to really stop caring about what others think. I tell myself that even though its not ideal, its fine, life is still good. You do not need to impress anyone to be happy. \n\nI hope this helped I was teased a lot as a kid/teen for being skinny, asked if I was anorexic etc. I would say it definitely had an effect on my self image.\n\nA few things helped. I did eventually put on some weight even though I am still very tall and thin. As others discussed I also found my own interests and hobbies and a community that accepted me as I was. For me this was the music scene. I was able to find friends who saw through the body type and learnt not to give a crap about what other people thought of me, I do not want to be friends with that kind of person anyway.\n\nGoing to see a counsellor or psych definitely helped too and especially if you are feeling suicidal that would be my main recommendation. I found them useful as a safe place to talk through my questions and worries without any risk of judgement.\n\nGood on you for reaching out, we have all been through it and know what it is like. Yeah, do not base the rest of your life on school, school sucks and kids are mean. You will find your people 23 female, i feel exactly the same about my body. It is very hard, i hate the summer months particularly and avoid pool parties, beaches, shorts, etc. I actually feel extremely confident in jeans or sweats so colder months are not at all hard for me. \n\nThings that have helped me:\n\n1. Wearing clothes i feel confident in. I let myself splurge on clothes that make me feel good. I have found high waisted jeans/shorts very flattering as well as crop tops (may as well show off your small waist, the one asset of mine i like). \n2. Dating. I used to use dating apps and it honestly helped boost my confidence a ton. I saw how many guys were attracted to me. And use honest pictures that show your full body/do not try to catfish or anything. That way you can truly know these people know what you look like and still find you attractive. I also met my boyfriend this way and he continually boosts my confidence. \n3. Educating my friends/being open about talking about Marfans. Once people understand more about Marfans, they are not as judgemental about weight/scars/etc. Then i feel more comfortable wearing whatever i want around them. Of course, even after explaining some friends will still say i just need to eat more protein etc. but most friends have understood. Look up Thich Nhat Hanh youtube videos I am just really happy to see all the positivity on here myself having marfans. I am 6'4 and 150 lb soaking wet, grew almost 2 ft in a year, horrible stretch marks  on my back , it took me a long time to accept how my body looked but at the end of the day you are a beautiful person and do not forget that.  self tanning helps me feel more confident! i recommend bondi sands for beginners I hear you. I am also super skinny and have long fingers and I am definitely not average. It used to reallyy bother me when I was younger. I remember being your age and thinking obsessive thoughts about how everyone must be looking at all my flaws all the time. Honestly, it was draining.\n\nThankfully, things are so much better. I am just a few years older now, but once I got out of school, I got a job I love (teaching) and I am now focused on other people instead of myself! It helps tremendously when you are in a giving position and realize that people admire you for so many things. My turning point was when, a few months into teaching, my student told me \"When we all saw you on the first day, we said, ohmygosh, our teacher's so pretty!!!\" And I realized just how critical I had been on myself.\n\nIs there a place you can volunteer or a summer job of some sort you can get that you will be able to help others somehow? This takes the pressure of thinking about yourself off your head, and instead you can use those obsessive thoughts about other people's problems instead and how you can make a difference in others' lives!\n\nAlso, think about the way you would treat a close friend or family member. Would you be so critical and notice all their flaws? Probably not. If it is someone you love, you accept them for who they are and you barely notice their flaws (or you notice them, but do not stop loving them because of it!). You deserve to treat yourself the same way! I would suggest to write in a journal or even send an email to yourself, praising yourself, your looks, your personality, accomplishments, whatever. This will help. Even if the thoughts feel fake at first , they will introduce a new line of thought and perhaps help break your depression. (i am not a therapist though so do not substitute this for real help if you really need, I am just sharing what works to me)  Yeah I am a 17 year old dude here with Marfan's. Super tall (1.98m) and underweight too (60kgs). I was the tallest in my school so I know what its like to stand out. \n\n\nFor the weight part I just deal with it by wearing bulky sweatshirts to keep warm and nobody ever comments on me being skinny when i do that as well.\n\nAs for the height I actually treat is as my one good physical trait because many people actually like tall people, of course it gets annoying hitting my head on doorways but I wear it semi-proudly because for me being tall is a positive trait.\n\nI am sorry I can offer any easy solutions but I wish you luck, also is it okay if I ask how tall you are? I often wonder how I compare to others with Marfan's.", "Do I have marfans and if I do how bad would you say ", "Looking for advice and support. So in the past six months I have been having pains in my chest. In the past two they have gotten more frequent and last longer. I recently had a minor surgery on my foot and they did an EKG beforehand. One of the doctors noticed \u201cabnormalities\u201d in the data. He began asking questions and informed me I may have marfans, though he could not give me an official diagnosis. I have set up an appointment with my pcp and am currently waiting an appointment time. \n\nAlong with the chest pains, I was also born with an indented chest, I am tall and skinny, always been flexible and can pull my thumb behind my hand, I am nearsighted, I have stretch marks on my back, along with a few other things that I would found through research are common signs of an individual having marfans. \n\nI am by no means self diagnosing myself, but I am a worry-some person with a history of mental health issues and I am prone to existential crisis. I understand people can lead happy and healthy lives living with marfans. I am honestly just kind of scared especially with the chest pain worsening. \n\nWhat changes did you have to make to your life after being diagnosed? (Diet, habits, etc..)\n\nAny other advice or support would be very appreciated.

During a physical, my physician saw that I had no murmurs in my heart and I have a regular heart beat, but he asked me stand up, he said that I could have marfans. He said that it was \"probably nothing\" but he still recommended I see a cardiologist. I am only 5'11 and when people look at me, they do not really notice any deformities. Im also not very flexible with my arms and legs and I heard that is a big sign for marfans. So am I just freaking myself out?", "Anyone here have success with contacts? I have been told since I was younger that I cannot have contacts because my astigmatism is too bad for a contact lens to stay in place. The last time I went to my optometrist he suggested that I get hard contacts and that they would also improve my vision more than glasses. Has anyone here had any success with hard/soft contacts? Hey - yeah I got a pair of soft contact lenses. Been wearing them for about 10 years now! No issues so far. I was initially told by an optometrist that I could not get any (I think she may have been a new grad?) - however, years later when I asked again, a different optometrist told me I could and helped me get a pair. I wear both glasses and contacts and they do work, but am thinking of having a lens replacement to improve my eyesight My vision with contacts is much better than with glasses. My eyes are flat though. I wore contact lenses from around age 15 until I was about 38 when I got LASIK. \nI had a little bit of astigmatism and a whole lot of myopia, and they helped a lot! I have been wearing (soft) contacts for almost ten years now and they work well for me. I just do not enjoy wearing glasses on a daily basis.  My new optometrist tested both normal contacts and contacts adjusted for astigmatism with me and gave me the option to buy the ones without adjustments for astigmatism because they barely made a difference.  Saved me a lot of money!  My vision is not that bad yet, though (-4, -3.75) so that may not be an option for everybody I used to have hard contacts and had to stop wearing them after detached retina surgery. I now wear soft contacts and there is only one brand that I can use (HydraVue). If you live in an area where you can find someone who specializes in low vision, I would recommend that. I have pretty bad astigmatism and the hard contacts were super uncomfortable. My vision actually ended up being better with glasses anyways because I could not see up close with the contacts so I needed reading glasses. With my glasses I just slide them down my nose and I can see up close lol. Hard contacts are very very uncomfortable if you have even slightly dry eyes, but they are worth a try.", "Anyone have any good workout routines for toning your body? Basically looking into toning my body muscle muscle. Anyone have any routines they would like to share that have given them results? I have the Marfans gene and I am getting tested in december till now I have been doing powerlifting lol so got a strong enough foundation there. My brother has marfans too and the doctor has told him that anything less strenuous or intense should be okay (I do not know where you stand so definitely ask your doctor/PT about a workout tailored to you). I would say you can look to invest in a bow flex maxtrainer (this is just what I have, but ideally could be any elliptical that lets you increase resistance slowly). Next you can probably use light weights or cables to tone your muscles. Ideally it depends on your goals are you training to have some sort of performance or just look good physically. If it is just to look good you can do shoulder; tricep; bicep work along with calf; quad and hamstring training on machines with relatively low intensity. These muscle groups will help fill you up. \n\nTo split it up you can do a legs push pull legs arms split; and do cardio and abs everyday\n\nLegs: cardio:15 min low intensity; quad kicks superset with bodyweight prison squats 8 sets of 8; finish with 60 sit-ups\n\nPush: cardio: 15 min. Since usually chest workouts are a iffy thing I would say do light weight lateral raises and super set with slow tempo push-ups with knee on the ground to lessen the weight 8sets of 8. Finish with 60sit ups\n\nPull: cardio: 15 min. Same thing with back. Going heavy would not be good. So try lighter weight movements. You can try slow tempo pull ups(pull down machine if pull ups are hard and adjust the weight); super set with good form face pulls 8 set of 8. The finish off with 60 sit ups\n\nLegs: cardio 15 min; hamstring curls and single leg deadlifts to lessen the weight and feel the burn 8 sets of 8; finish off with 60 sit-ups \n\nArms: try to stay away from workouts that stretch or engage chest into it. I would suggest a similar approach but with isolated movements. cardio 15 min; single arm preacher curl and tricep cable pull downs 3-4 sets of 10. Pull down bicep curl (use very light weight and feel the stretch of the bicep) and overhead cable tricep extension 3-4 sets of 10. Finish off with 60 sit-ups.\n\nOn the weekend you can go on easy hikes or walks and just relax and let your body recover.\n\nAs with anything tho I am not a medical professional or a physical trainer so it is just my thoughts. I would say run it by a doctor or PT to see if this is good for you! Also I know due to Covid, gyms are something I personally do not feel safe going to yet so you can even look into sandbag training and look for low intensity variations on the legs-push-pull-legs-arms routine! I was told that swimming is the best for toning the body overall. Unfortunately I hate swimming! So I just do low-impact full-body workouts instead. I work small exercise into my everyday life where I can by paying attention to posture, form and activity. The way I learned to do this best was working with a PT and learning my personal weaknesses.\n\nExample: I have a job that requires a lot of low to the floor work. I do a squat each time rather than sprawling out on the floor like my coworkers.\n\nDoing this, I have gone from having a medically concerning amount of  no ass to having great tone in my thighs and butt.\n\nCon- my knees suck and I have experienced a couple low grade dislocations, but nothing I cannot personally deal with, though that could also just be from age. lol This is super great advice, just what I was looking for, thank you! It is important to mention for future readers that, we all have different versions of marfan so, it is important like you said, to get checked by your doctor first. I use resistance bands (light) and do squats and very basic pulling workouts with them and have noticed small muscle growth and a more toned looking physique....actually took less effort than I thought. ohh interesting Kettlebells. They were exactly what I needed to make my whole body work together I have been told to stay away from stationary exercises like planking Look into PPL (push pull legs) routine. Just omit deadlifts and do sets in the 15-30rep range. Stay 2-3 reps away from failure as to not spike your BP. If you are scared of weights just get resistance bands and do sets of 50-100 with those every day for different body parts Interesting, thank you!! Yes, I like to pick one exercise that I do repeatedly, until I cannot do a single one more.

Lol ", "I think I have marfans, but endo caused confusion. Hello, I am 15 years old at the moment. Ever since I was a small child I have shown symptoms of marfans. I have severe scoliosis (corrected) The angle before going to surgery was 50 degrees top and 30 degrees bottom. I also have severe pectus excavatum, as well as having a very skinny and wiry build. I have large hands and tiny wrists, with extremely long fingers. I went to the doctors before my surgery which was about 5 months ago. At first they looked at me and decided that I have marfans. I matched pretty much all of the physical requirements. But before going under, I had to get an endo and ekg. Apart from a slight murmer at times, my heart is healthy currently. I do notice palpitations every so often, but other then that my heart supposedly healthy. I never went to the genealogist or the eye doctor to follow up, due to my heart being fine currently. My question is, can I have marfans and heart conditions havent made themselves noticeable yet. Being so young I assume this is not too uncommon. I basically am a basket case for marfans, apart from heart conditions, at least for now. I really want to know if I should follow up on this. I am not worried if I have it or not, just do not like not knowing if I have marfans or not. c: My aorta did not start dialating until I was 17 and am currently 19, I have had a very minimal heart murmor my whole life but some doctors do not or can barely hear it. \n\nI would check with the eye doctor and genealogist, not everyone with marfana will have a bad heart just like not everyone with marfans will have scoliosis. \n\nMy brother has a bad heart and multi skeletal issues (scoliosis and pectus (the one where the chest goes in, my pectus goes out I miss them up) my mom has everything, shes been blind in an eye since 23, heart issues has tore and fractured some bones and muscles but no scoliosis. I have a slight curve in my spine but not to the extent that surgery or a brace is needed. My heart is alright, slight aortic dialation, murmor and regurgitating valve and the lens in my eyes are detached.\n\nWith Marfans as we age shit tends to develop atleast that is how its been for me my mom and brother and me being the youngest makes sense to why I have the most mild case out of the three thus far. Definitely do not  want to wait around until you have heart problems years diwn the road Every person with Marfans has different symptoms at various degrees. My heart issues did not show until I was 25. Those with 'probable' or even 'possible' Marfans should at least get a yearly echo and ekg and have a cardiologist who is familiar with Marfans- just to stay ahead of things. Good luck with everything!  My son's heart is on the top end of normal range for his height but he does have Marfans per the genetic test. I would follow up with the geneticist if I were you.

I want to put muscles because life like this is unbearable. I even cannot stand properly and I tremble a lot. I want to feel the sensation of body exhaustion after an hard workout, I want to become handsome and attract women and gain respect from men but I do not want to die in the process. So now I  go to the gym, use small weights with multiple repetitions. You cannot imagine guys my frustration however. I needed to vent. I am really sorry to hear this. A very close friend to me has marfans and I absolutely understand his frustration. I assume you must have spoken with your doctor, try to get a second opinion on what is the most intensive exercise you can work on. At the end of the day, your health is and will always be the utmost priority though. I completely hear you.  Swimming is the most recommended activity (according to my cardiologist anyway) and can certainly be strenuous enough to build muscle. Honestly, I think your perception that you cannot be attractive and respected without big muscles is a larger issue than your weight lifting restrictions. :/ Maybe this lifetime is to teach you to focus more on the inner rather than the outer, if you believe that sort of thing. \n\nOthers here have given good advice for working out within due bounds. I myself offer this notion:\n\nSome of us, even if we could hit the big weights full out, will never be that \"ideal\" big-muscle guy. It is simply not in the genetics. \n\n*(digression)* The mass media and corporate marketing in our society has told everyone that if they work hard and eat right, they too can have that buff attractive body of a god/dess. Unfortunately, it is simply not true. While everyone can improve upon their health and physical fitness to some degree, the number one factor in whether a person can reach that \"ideal\"... is their genetics. The rest of us can work ourselves to death, and never get there. It is an awful lie intended to sell products and lifestyles. *(end digression)*\n\nI know myself, for instance, will never be anywhere close to that ideal. Yes, I can work out with the high reps on lighter weights, as you have been told, and I absolutely do put on mass. Pretty quickly actually. I only get to keep the mass, however, if I continue to work out regularly. \n\nBecause I am so tall and thin to start, because of my exact body type, because of what is physically possible to put on my frame, I could - at *best* - be the tall thin wiry muscled guy. I could not be the buff bodybuilder if I tried. Just not the genetics or starting frame. \n\nIf you are having issues with standing and walking, you definitely need to discuss that with your physician. I just under 6-foot, and most of my life weighed 95lbs soaking wet, and despite being such a skeleton, I never had problems like that. Definitely something worth checking on.  I am an ex gym rat who married a marf. I understand your frustration, I wished he could have felt what I felt working out, I believe anyone who has the physical capability should, at least once in their life, feel what it is to push your body to the limits. Then I got diagnosed with EDS, and also got banned from the level of lifting I used to do. Heres the thing though. Just like not all guys would have appreciated the muscle tone I used to have as a female, not all women are looking for some muscled guy. Not all men respect it either. I hit on my guy, because I was the type of girl who wanted a tall and lanky guy. Bonus points for the long hair and mismatched eyes. I was damned lucky that he loved having a strong wife. My 5'6 ass used to carry his 6'6\" self around piggyback style just to freak out our friends. Since I have a connective too, no matter how strong or weak I am, I tremble. No one else notices unless I point it out. Honestly, your perception is more important than you think, and people arent looking at you the way you think either. Muscles dont equal respect from men and drool from women, its just not how things work. Confidence is sexy as hell. Sorry this is not cohesive, but honestly, muscles are not the world. Work on your balance, work on your confidence, the rest follows. My lanky man got the hotty that made all the muscled guys drool, and I just loved that he enjoyed that.  Do you have marfan?  o.O Yes, I do. Otherwise I would not bother comparing my experience. Did you really find your husband attractive even if he does not have big muscles?  Can I ask if your husband trains and if yes what kind of exercises? ", "Found out about Marfans yesterday, spoke to my doctor today and getting heart scans next week. I was browsing subreddits about being underweight when I seen somebody mentioning Marfans.\n\nSo I searched it up and it would make a lot of sense if I had it as I show a lot of the common traits.\n\nMy doctor was very helpful and I will be getting an ultrasound on my heart next week along with a heart monitor for 7 days.\n\nIt is quite scary if I am honest as I deal with lots of chronic mental illnesses and need surgery for other health issues.\n\nI am thankful that I stumbled across that comment when I did because I have been having palpitations (maybe related to anxiety) but I need it checked to put my mind at rest.\n\nI guess the point of this post is to say thank you for spreading awareness of this condition :) Feel free to ask any questions, we are all here to help each other. Thanks man, I appreciate it. I had my echo today and it is all looked pretty much normal which was good.\n\nIt is weird because one of the things that led me down the connective tissue disorder route was because I need surgery on my tongue for a severe tongue tie and lots of people in the tongue tie groups I am in say that these two things are connected.\n\nIt is so interesting, so I was thinking about whether anyone here was tongue tied. But I did not want to sound like a crazy person ahah. Trust me, there are no crazy questions! I have never heard of the tongue-tie connection, that is interesting! I do not have that.", "Hi I am looking for some feedback if anyone else has had the same experience. I had a David procedure and a modified Ravith procedure at the same time August 23rd at the Cleveland clinic. The surgeries were successful and I was recovering rather well. But recently I will been plagued by this fog like feeling with lightheadedness that has been just terrible. I had a dizzy spell about two weeks ago and laid down to prevent passing out. I thought it was the high doe of metoprolol I was on. 75 mg 3 times a day. I kept calling the clinic telling them I am still suffering and they claimed that it can happen after this sort of trauma. My problem with that is I was really good for most of September. Only in October had I started having a constant feeling of something not quite right and funny in the head. So I got switched off metoprolol and started on atenolol. \nThat was last Thursday when I went to the ER. I had an ekg, ct scan of aorta, labs and an X-ray. Everything was good. So me and the doctor both kind of thought it is probably the meds let us switch it. So we did and I started on atenolol. For about two days I felt much better and got better each morning then the feeling came back but not as severe. But still noticeable where I was not myself at all and was pretty worried. So I talk to my cardiologist and she says to stop taking it and we will figure it out Friday during my appointment. My blood pressure is amazing through all of this but historically I have an electrical issue so I do need some kind of medicine for that. I have not been without a beta blocker for 10 years. \nSo today at 11am was 48 hours since my last dose of atenolol to try to rid beta blockers out of my body to see if that was the problem. But while I was feeling better thinking it is definitely the beta blockers I was a little more active and moved around more. But it was not much because I have been way more active in my time of recovery. But I started to get a neck pain and then I felt myself get really dizzy and had to sit down before passing out. \nMy neck has been hurting threw all of this and some have suggested c1c2 sublaxtion. \nMy head has a little pressure on it but not really a headache. And it is not constant. \nI am pretty fatigued more than usual. \nI yawn a lot during the day. \nWhen I wake up I feel the fog but still slept my usual amount of 8 hours. \nI feel a little shaky in my legs and arms at times. \nMy appetite is down but idk if that is the anxiety or a symptom. \nFeels like the flu or something like that but I do not have a fever. \nDid anyone have a similar experience ever at any time or after a surgery especially a double? It may be related or it may be something different even environmental. I really need help I am at my wits end. Nothing is worse than this thing I am experiencing. Surgery was a walk in the park compared to the recovery in experiencing. \nThanks for any feedback. I am sorry to hear you are having a hard time. While I experienced a number of complications recovering from my own David procedure, I did not experience what you described. Have you considered seeing a neurologist? I will see everyone hopefully until I figure out what is going on. I will put that on the list for tomorrow when I meet my pcp. Thank you for your feedback. I really appreciate it. Hey there! Unfortunately I do not have exactly the same symptoms/procedures, but I think my experience is somewhat similar!\n\nI had a aortic valve and root replacement 2 weeks ago today! Was discharged on metropolol - taking half a tablet twice a day, but i felt like it made my heart race too much and it just did not \"feel\" right. Talked to my GP and went back to my old atenolol dose. Although I still have some \"cloudy\" headedness, I feel a lot better!\n\nHope this helps abit. It is nice to hear someone having similar problems indeed. I forgot to mention I found a study where out of 6500 patients that had an AAA repair that after the procedure 84% had adverse effects to beta blockers. I am not sure if that is what I am experiencing, if it is related to surgery or something entirely different. It is so scary I hate it. \nI hope you are doing well after your surgery. That sounds very similar to what I was going through it is just this fog currently will not let up. I am looking into BPPV vertigo even. I almost have no beta blocker in my system and still having symptoms. Have you been checked for sleep apnea? This could give you similar affects.\n\nI was on 25mg twice a day of Metoprolol for &gt;20 years and then a couple of years ago I started feeling really weak at times - almost like I would pass out but not really. My doctor switched me to Bisoprolol and it is been fine ever since. I have an appointment scheduled after I meet with the neurologist tomorrow. My main complaint now is it is a constant lull in how I feel when I stand. Possibly the brain sag associated with CSF leak but not sure. I feel rested when I wake just fatigued and foggy. It is really hard to put my thumb on. The beta blockers in general are a tricky beast. \nBut I really really appreciate your input. Very sound advice.", "27 yo with Marfans. Had aortic valve repaired 1.5 years ago. AMA First time posting on reddit, so excuse me if I am not doing this right.\n\n27, male, 6'9\" 230lbs. \n\nI had my aortic valve replaced in April of 2014. I went with the mechanical valve as it is expected to last the rest of my life. My aorta was 6.8cm at the time of surgery. I never had a dissection, but my aorta was so large my heart was regurgitating blood because the aorta was not closing all of the way. \n\nI was in the hospital, initially, for about 5 days. I went into SVT after having my chest tubes pulled out. Took a trip back to ICU.\n\nSpeaking of chest tubes, because I am so tall, I was given the extra long tubes, which are extra painful.\n\nI went back to the hospital a week later due to SVT (heart rate randomly jumped to 200bpm) and took an ambulance ride back to the hospital. Turned out I was having other complications - infection (white blood count was down) and they found there was fluid trapped around my heart.\n\nI had another surgery, a pericardial window, to remove 2 liters of fluid from my chest. This procedure was significantly more painful than the first surgery (or maybe it was the combination of the two so close together). I was in the hospital for a total of 13 days this second time.\n\nI am on warfarin, baby asprin and metoprolol. I became addicted to painkillers because I was on them for so long. The day I took my last pill was a very sad day.\n\nThe pericardial window caused scar tissue to form and put pressure on my left lung, causing it partially collapse.\n\nOther than the subtle ticking of the aortic valve, some medications, and regular blood tests, my life is back to normal.\n\nI plan to have surgeries to replace both lenses in my eyes. My right eye is VERY bad. I have double vision in that eye, and my vision is so blurry I cannot recognize a face from two feet away. My left eye, with glasses, has 20/40 vision.\n\n-\n\nAsk me anything!", "A famous actor with marfans was posted up on the ugly subreddit and then it became a trending post.

Went on to Metoprolo for some time, and it managed to bring my heart to the much lower end of resting tachycardia and pretty much eliminated palpitations. Suddenly became \"intolerant\" of this medication and would up with a heart rate tanking into the low 30's. got off the meds and was at a comfortable 90 bpm at rest, however, any increase in activity would set it up into the 170's or higher.\n\nMost recently I have noticed that my heart rate is falling lower and lower over the last few months, now it is usually below 60 and I physically can not handle the side effects of this. I am currently wearing a heart bug to try and get some EKG's that may discover something. After 10 minutes of light cycling (not even out of breath, barely sweating), my heart broke past 195.\n\nHas any one else had some other issues similar to this? assuming IST is pretty common though. I feel that such a low heart rate at my height is going to cause worsening issues with my unbalance ending in fainting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny ideas welcome, Cheers! Have you had any imaging or other testing to confirm any mitral prolapse?  I am not a doctor but it sounds like your heart is working extra when it does not need to, which *may* be due to a leaky valve.  Do you hear any \"wooshing\"?  When mine got bad my partner at the time was able to hear it when she was laying with her head on my chest. Had a few echo's on it. First discovered the mitral valve was pretty elongated, but it seems to have shrunk (if that is possible?). Nothing suspicious has been found in the random ones I have had over time, though they were to more look for aortic widening. There are some other meds they can try. I had mine switched up which solved my heart rate issues. I went from Metoprolol (which I was on for 20+ years) to Bisoprolol and Digoxin. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey will do a special scan looking for electrical issues with your heart. Sometimes they will do a procedure called ablation where they burn out a misfiring signal that is causing the pacing issues. If all else fails, they will put in a pacemaker. Would there be a medication that allows my heart to not rocket in speed, but also allow it to not drop lower during rest? Quantum heart, both too fast and too slow depending which state I am in...\n\nCheers.

Just wanted to say you guys rock.  You helped get information for a surgery and answered a lot of my questions.  It was insanley helpful.  Hey I am really glad we could help!", "Another thing to feel insecure about... \n\nIts my face. In march to may during quarantine i went down the rabbit-hole regarding facial aesthetics. And now I feel terrible because I have marfanoid features which are apparently considered universally unattractive. \n\nA downward-swung face: a long mid-face; a large jaw inclination; a flat face with low, non-prominent cheekbones; bulging eyes... :/ these features are apparently unattractive - not even average just straight-up off-putting. I consider myself fairly average looking now tbh but i dont think im 'pretty' or even 'cute.' \n\nIt sucks because pretty women are *EVERWHERE* in media and I was browsing through the internet and reading some opinions on non-pretty characters or women in media and now i want to cry. Like I would be fine with the idea that Im average and that my beauty doesnt define my worth but people (men esp and idk why?) seem to resent you if youre not conventionally attractive.\n\nPlus it really makes me realize the other drawbacks of my appearence like the hump on my shoulder (due to my scoliosis), my lanky figure, etc. I was completely fine with my appearence before but now im starting to feel that i might get discriminated against because of how i look and that ill never find anyone in the media that i can relate to. This sucks and i hate it.  I am sorry to hear this. I cannot offer you much advice, but I do hope you learn to accept yourself for whoever you are and whatever you look like.\n\nBeing a guy, I really cannot relate very well to your situation, but I can say that as a fellow Marf-person, I grew up looking \"emaciated\" and it definitely left a scar or two on my self-esteem. I also wound up with severe cystular acne, bent teeth, and thick glasses. \n\nI finally bulked up at the gym as I got older, took Accutaine (heavy duty acne medicine - it took two full rounds to do the job) in college, make sure I buy the best glasses I can, and went through a few rounds of orthodonture. And you know what? At best I am \"interesting looking.\" I am good with that. Maybe it is just some acceptance that came with age and experience.\n\nI would like to think being slightly on the outside looking looking can make us a little more sensitive and kind.\n\nBest of luck. I know this sounds lame but I got cheek filler because I felt my face was too narrow. It gave me cheekbones for a bit and widened out my face. I was so happy with the results and I looked healthier. It is been years since I got it done and I do look better. Hey it is not lame! Technology has a lot of ways to help us feel better with ourselves, why not take advantage of that if we can? \n\nI am happy you liked your results and that serves as a testimony that small/ not so invasive procedures can give us that self steem bump we might need to accept our unique appearance. Please do not be so hard on yourself. We are who we are. More often than not we are our own worst critics. Unfortunately, this is all we got. Are there any things that you could do to change your look that would help increase your self-esteem? Please remember that there are plenty of people out here who are not pleased with their looks, whether they are marfs or not. I wish you the best! This 100%. You have to learn to love yourself and find things that you can do to make yourself feel happy about being you. I am seven feet tall and I used to be feel ostracized by the public but I learned to embrace it and now I have fun messing with people who give me a hard time about it. Self love is the most important. Humans are personalities . I am as God made me. No one picks or chooses, but God does. If I were you, I would not waste time critiquing his handy work any more. To make an analogy that does not come close to equating how ridiculous the thought of doing that is... imagine going up to Paul McCartney, Michelangelo, Pablo Picasso, or Shakespeare or any of the best artists you can think of and saying, \"You should have done better work and let *me* tell you how\"... it is like that, but infinitely more ridiculous. You cannot control other people if they are so brash and arrogant to have those kinds of thoughts towards you - that is, judging any persons worth by their appearance alone - but you do not have to live like that, and if you do not judge others worth based on their appearance alone, you certainly should not judge yourself that way either. If you can understand that, and live like that, you can intimately know how someone could possibly love you and accept you with all your \"faults\" because you will already be that kind of person ready to love someone else that way.

I am not diagnosed yet, but recently had a high blood pressure and accelerated heart scare. \n\nI met with a cardilogist and the Doctor said that I might have Marfan Syndrome. I am a 27 year old male, a little over 6 feet, weigh 180 pounds. No one else in my family has ever had Marfan Syndrome. Just had an ECHO exam this week and the doctor said everything came out good, nothing was irregular. I do have slightly high blood pressure and my heart does beat fast sometimes. My fingers and toes are not really that long but my thumb is, I can wrap it around my wrist. I had slight scoliosis growing up, nothing major but was seeing a chiropractor when i was 16-17 years old but have not really had any issues in my 20s. My feet were also slightly flat footed but I still have an arch on the bottom of my feet, they do not look flat to me. Also my eye sight is good. I was pretty blindsided when the doctor said he thinks I might have Marfan Syndrome and he said it comes it all different forms. Some people are more extreme than others..\n\nJust wondering if anyone else has had a similar case like me and if or what age do more problems start to happen? If I do in fact have Marfan Syndrome.. kind of want to prepare myself for it..\n\nThank you everyone for taking the time to read my post. Seems really weird that he would throw it out there when you really do not seem to have any symptoms.  Well he did the hand test, I have long thumbs and can wrap my thumb and finger around my wrist, also my slight Scoliosis and I made a comment that my old doctor said I have slight flat feet. He also bent my finger back and said I have pretty flexible joints but honestly I have never really been that flexible my whole life, I have never been able to touch my toes when stretching but not sure if that says anything. I am skinny but I am not that skinny, I have been super stressed out lately so I have lost a little bit of weight but I have never had a problems gaining weight. I do not know, this is all new to me. I am supposed to go back in 2 weeks. I am going to get a 2nd opinion because this doctor is really short with me, I have met him twice now and he comes in for 5 minutes and then it is like on to the next patient kind of vibe. Does not really ask me questions like how I am feeling or anything. Kind of irritating.. Scoliosis is really common. I do not know how far over 6 feet I would a little but if it is only  within a few inches you are at a perfectly healthy weight, not skinny. \n\nHypermobility is the closest you might have to something, but with only a thumb sign it really seems like this doctor is just using you. If he were truly concerned he would have sent you to a geneticist.\n\nI definitely think you should go doctor hunting. Bring it up with the new, hopefully more respectful one, see what they think. For the most part you should probably just chill out and worry about that blood pressure, man. That is a problem of its own.  \n Thanks for the advice, I really appreciate it! Based on what you have described about yourself and having no definitive family history, you would not be able to obtain a clinical diagnosis for Marfans. At least not at this point. The only way to be sure is to have genetic testing. In that case I would recommend seeing a genetic counselor, not a rheumatologist.  Well said.

The risk of tissue dying is also heightened because having thinners in ur system can cause obstructions and affect the healing (I was told that if tissue starts to die in ur nose u are seriously screwed - it is a surgeon's nightmare). \n\nSo if ur on thinners u have to stop them 3-5 days before and after surgery, and use heparin or an alternative blood thinner that is less intense but will still sustain u.\n\nAnyway i hope things go smooth if u go ahead to get it done! If I have it done I will drop an update on this post. Take care! Xox Does she take blood thinners? Yes.  Only for a few months though. She has. A nose bleed Which was hard to stop because of the blood thinners n they told her after the nose bleed she did not need the thinners anymore and they were only post op for some reason Did not take them before took them after.

Also want to note i have no aortic dilations or anything if that matters so some of the bad for us side effects of shrooms are increased BP and heart rate along with panic. I have been seriously considering micro dosing to help my depression and anxiety. The only advise my cardiologist would even give is that there is not a lot of research yet on exact dosage for benefits vs side effects. What about cbd to deal with anxiety ? I think there is a lot of great on-going research with shrooms and microdosing etc for depression and anxiety, but I have never tried it so I cannot recommend it. I do not think it is the first thing I would try for anxiety/depression.  \n\n\nAnxiety and Depression is very common among Marfan people, I usually suggest to people first trying CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy), you can even do it on your own, I recommend the book (or audio book) Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy  \n\n\nIf that does not work I usually recommend to people to see their doctor/GP, as they may recommend therapy or medication.\n\nSaying this - I do not think there are any reported incidents of this being specifically different/more dangerous to people with Marfan Syndrome in general.  Though I could see there being risk if the person had heart and lung issues (Marfan or not) Done it twice. Did not have any problems as such.\n\nObligatory: Be careful. Talk to your doc.

My doctor said therefore it would be safe for me to get a chin implant because of the length of the procedure (30-60 min) as well as my body\u2019s state of health. Ask your cardiologist and you will probably need to be evaluated before going in. The only risk lies in the anesthesia and pain meds you will be given affecting your heart. I might even think about your skin stretching. Since our skin is more elastic, once those fillers expire, it might lead to your skin sagging more. I think it would be fine. Depends on the filler but it is basically hyaluronic acid in your skin and therefore becomes part of your skin.", "Exercises Hello guys!

If you google positive wrist sign you get a lot of pictures that seem to be negative if you go by the diagnostic description (the thumb has to cover the *whole* nail of the pinky/fifth finger). Or is any overlap between the thumb and pinky enough to have a positive wrist sign? Even the picture of the Ghent criteria does not seem to have complete overlap. It is the nail in the left picture. I can do that. I cannot completely overlap the pinkie using the wrist test.  Neither can I but my thumb test is positive for sure. Are you diagnosed? Yes. Oh okay!", "I am 28 and still cannot accept my body and how skinny I am. Sorry but it is just permanent misery and self loathing. I have tried so hard to gain weight (I spent an absolute fortune on a six month heavy protein and weight gain diet and worked out) and all that I got was a fat stomach. Nothing works.\n\nI hate that feeling of putting on a t-shirt and it immediately hanging off your skinny shoulder blades and feeling the sleeves hang off your boney arms. I hate seeing my reflection from the side angle and seeing a stick figure. I hate never being able to enjoy fashion or clothes because nothing looks good and I HATE the summer when everyone can be topless (males) and wear shorts and I am still wearing baggy jumpers and tracksuits to cover up. \n\nI am fine with everything else but never being able to feel good about myself or feel attractive just sucks. I got a haircut yesterday and I just look like a skeleton. \n\nSigh. Much love dude.. It is hard to deal with this sorta stuff.. In regards to clothes there is an old post on this subreddit where people posted good stores to buy clothes for very tall and/or skinny people. \nYou might find something useful there to boost your confidence a bit. The struggle is real. Pre-covid I finally started working out regularly, doing mild weight lifting, etc. Felt better physically and mentally than I ever have. Next scan my aorta grew above surgery threshold after being stable for 10+ years. Fuck. Surgery tomorrow. This disease blows. Hey. I am in a similar position. I am 28,about 6'5, and up until recently I was really underweight. I have been bullied pretty much all my life for how tall and thin I have been. \n\nI would tried countless times putting on weight and nothing seemed to work. I also hated my own reflection, how skinny my arms and chest were, and my lack of butt. I also share your hatred for summer lol. \n\nThere is some good resources on ( and I have been following this for about two months now and I have put on nearly a stone. Some of that is gone to my stomach, but I am finally getting a bigger butt, arms, and chest through some light exercise. Still super skinny, but noticing some results. \n\nJust wanted to say it is not all lost. I know how you feel. Give us a message if you need a chat :) Good luck with your surgery. Let me know how you get on please? Thanks yo. I did mild cardio (slow jogging) and mild weight lifting. Usually 30lb max, tons of reps both in machines and with dumbbells, barbells. I bench pressed the bar only for example. Feels dumb doing it but anything beyond that felt like I was straining. Also fuck other people's opinions, I am there to make myself feel good/better about myself. They do not have to deal with the shit I do to make progress.\n\nI never bulked up visually but I felt and slept way better. My weight stayed roughly the same but there was definitely some body fat reduction and muscle mass increase going on. Day to day I noticed not having to work as hard at moving stuff around the house. \n\nI think the only machine I ever did more than 30lb was the leg press machine. Even then probably only did 50-60. Felt like doing body weight squats usually. \n\nI am hoping the jogging is what did it. I was trying to build endurance and would keep going even if I was tired or heart was working hard. Not doing that again. Marfan's surgeon said I should be able to return to mild weight lifting over time, so that is good. I am sorry, I know the struggle.  It is incredibly difficult most times.\n\nWhat I will say is do not let your body type lock you into clothes that attempt to \"cover up\" features.  Frankly, it does not work.  Something well fitting will always objectively look better, even if you think it does not \"hide\" aspects you are uncomfortable with.\n\nIt can be strange at first, but I would encourage you try some different fits.  Personally, I love levi jeans because the different types are literally model numbers.  A 511 levi will *always* be a 511 levi.  This allows you to find a pant that fits and then you can watch for sales online and buy with confidence.  They frequently will have 511 cuts, for instance, in colors or materials that they are looking to get rid of (just bought a pair in corduroy for the fall lol).  The systemization of it is a blessing.\n\nSimilarly, if you are having trouble finding button ups, do not be afraid to fit it for the chest then roll the sleeve.  In the summer I am usually wearing a long sleeve button up rolled up.  The sleeves are usually to short UN rolled but it looks MUCH better.  Youtube can tell you how to do a nice neat roll.  This works in the summer (and to keep you cooler do not worry about an undershirt, leave a button or two undone, yes I had pectus and now have a zipper scar).  In the winter a v-neck sweater neatens things up and shows the button up shirt.\n\nFor formal wear, vests can be fantastic to make a shirt that you could not get tailored work, and in my opinion are a nice, tasteful but not obnoxious addition.  There are formal vests and there are less formal vests.  I work onsight in engineering a lot where the \"uniform\" tends to be a crisp button up, jeans, and steel toed boots.  I have a vest that is informal enough it does not look out of place.\n\nShorts can be tricky because you want an ankle sock and smaller shoe, but a lot of really need good shoes.  I have not found an airtight solution to that.  \n\nAll of this is going to feel very strange at first.  No doubt, you will put together some outfits that you might regret later, but it is worth the process.  If you have a female friend who you are close with, ask them to go shopping with you.  I *guarantee* you will be surprised by some of the feedback.  It may be a difficult experience, which may be helped by talking about how you are really self conscious, but I promise you it is worth it.\n\nTherapy Talk:  You deserve to feel good in your own skin, and that is something only you can do for yourself.\n\nReal Talk: You can in-fact look great whatever your body type. I still have some self-conscious issues about my body too, but I have learned that some people absolutely love my height and lankiness. Do not try to compare yourself to those models with 6 pack abs and broad shoulders. Also, it is possible to gain muscle, but very difficult for some people with Marfan Syndrome. I think the key is to learn to love your body the way it is, but still work on making small steps every day to improve your health in the long run.  We cannot change ourselves overnight but you will you will see progress eventually! Preach.  It sounds tacky but confidence is really the best thing you can wear.  I have been told I give great hugs with my big old arms.  People like my big old hands.  At the end of the day, it really is how you carry yourself.  Wish I would have figured that out earlier... What was your aorta sidze precovid vs after you passed surgery thresh? I believe 4.0 now it is 4.7 (cm?)\n\nThis is the root. The rest is fine. Ex-model marf here. I still feel a little like an alien when I compare myself to \"normal\" bodies but spending time in the fashion industry helped, weirdly.  Often sample sales can be a good place to shop as most designers make their clothes to fit their models then shorten the limbs for their customer base. Designers constantly praised how the pieces \"hung\" on me as opposed to those with a fuller figure, although I personally believe that to be BS for the general population. In the end, all apperance-based industries profit off of our insecurities and the most radical thing you can do is like how you look, if only in spite.\n\nNowadays I dress in a way that tends to stand out, with a bunch of loud op-shopped pieces that accentuate my long-ass limbs. I like how there is not a frame of reference I can compare how I look in a certain item compared to others. I personally dig the 70's styles, we are starting to see gorgeous shaggy-haired, androgenous models with less \"commercial\" looks flood our markets now. Gucci and Prada are good examples - no buff six-pack bros in sight. Surgery went ok. Over quick. Extreme neck pain (overextension?) and nausea from the anesthesia for 24 hours. Heart is doing great but one lung is being pesky. It collapsed so I got yet another chest tube a day later. I am out of the ICU and just waiting for my lung to heal up. Coughing hurts like a bitch, everything is slow going but I am doing my best each day to keep healing up. dunno if bil has marfans but he always been a skinny guy . at 60yo he is still skinny. while all his friends have a few pound more than requiref. For me personally, I get more embarrassed by other people\u2019s judgments than my own. People, even friends, often think I am skinny because i do not eat enough. Even when I explain that it is hard for me to gain weight, I get advice such as \u201cyou just need more protein\u201d or \u201cyou just need to eat more\u201d. It is so frustrating to me. Or the other week I went out to eat with my bf and his friends and ordered a veggie pizza. His friends, who do not know my condition, kept asking if i was vegan and eat enough protein. \n\nI guess for me, the best thing has been to educate people on marfans syndrome so they can understand why i am so skinny and accept me for who i am.\n\nAlso, learning how to dress to suit my body type has helped so much!! For example, as a female I found high waisted jeans/shorts/etc combined with a cropped top is such a flattering combo. The cropped shirt shows off my small waist (my best feature) and the high waist shows off my long legs (my other best feature). I like the length of my legs but hate how stick looking they are, so i tend to wear pants. And as far as my stick arms, i find shirts with flowy sleeves to be flattering because everyone has tiny looking arms in those types of shirts so it is more normal. Late reply but I wanted to thanks for sharing and ask if you could tellxme what light exercise you did? I would love to have my arms and shoulders bigger at least. I can definitely understand the place your coming from. What really helped me was seeing people without Marfans who are just as skinny.  Sometimes because our condition has a name to it, we feel especially bad but there are lots of people who are just as skinny and perhaps shorter and worse off in other ways.  \n\nAnother point which I found to be really important was to stop caring about what people think. Its not easy but I tell myself , \"I like myself and that is enough. Many people do find this body type attractive, but even if they did not that is okay because I am happy regardless\". \n\nI hope this helped", "Isaiah Austin Cleared To Play Basketball  Ohhhh no that blanket statement is not ok especially for Marfans.

", "I am very depressed about having visual mild Marfan symptoms Why are we pressured to accept it when our  culture emphasizes ideal body types that we cannot ever achieve? It really sucks.

It is true there is a cultural bias against unattractive people in the general. This seems like it is generally improving, though.  \nAnd the reality is that everyday people do not really care. They are not exactly Hollywood stars, either. This is, ironically, coming from a Hollywood star. I have been in major movies and television shows, and I have the classic Marfan Syndrome look. So I feel particularly qualified to tell you that you should not despair. Most of the pressure you will feel in life will come from you. When you learn to love yourself, so will everyone else. I promise. I disagree. I am 19 and people in my age group and a bit older are kind of brutal on it. Maybe it is getting worse? Instagram / snapchat / etc might have contributed to the change Care to share some roles you played ? It could be helpful to some people to see what you can still achieve I made a post about it a while back. Here you go:\n\n Stupid people are everywhere.  I never noticed my boyfriend looked like a skeleton until we got together and even then it was more a passing thought than an actual concern because I thought he was fine af. \n\nAt the end of the day how you view yourself is more important than how you think others view you or the comments that they may make. \n\nOn the same subject I have scleroderma and my features changed  A LOT my doctor even referred to it as \u201cbecoming deformed\u201d. I was really self conscious but the doctor was full of shit because no one even notices anythings wrong with me and before I met my boyfriend I got hit on plenty. \n\nSorry for the rant but I do not think Marfans features are as undesirable as you may have been led to believe. As per usual, echoing the EvilSchwin \n\nI am not sure how old you are, but it really does get better as you get older.\n\nIt is not all roses, and we do tend to look a bit different, but, objectively speaking, it is not nearly what you think it is in your head.\n\nI have dated women of all types and levels of \"conventional attractiveness\", you know, the normal human experience.  And I *promise* you it is not because I have some crazy amount of charm or something.  As others have mentioned, the biggest thing is being comfortable in your own skin.  People are actually really drawn to that, because, at the end of the day, everyone has their own insecurities.\n\nAlso, do not discredit buying clothes that fit you.  A lot of marfan people try to get things that \"cover up\" their body, and it just does not work.  A nicely fitted shirt and pants goes miles.  It can feel uncomfortable when you start but I highly encourage you to try some things out that may be outside your comfortzone.  Learning how to properly roll a sleeve (google is your friend) makes it so you can buy clothes that fit in the chest but may be to short in the arms off the rack.  For more formal situations a nice vest is a slim mans best friend.\n\nBut it really is in the attitude.  Especially in the summer, I tend to wear a button or two at the top undone, you can see a fair amount of a scar from a mitral valve repair.  I sometimes get questions, but being able to casually say \"oh yeah, I had a heart valve repaired\" is just fine.  Most women actually find them kind of attractive, and for platonic stuff it is just a conversation point.  You get the occasional \"wow, so brave\" but more often than not people start talking about *their* own crap.  Everyone is got it.\n\nIt is that whole \"it is a part of me but does not define me\" thing.  If you are comfortable with it, other people usually are to. What AlanaDemell said ^^ being tall/lanky does not mean unattractive. Just got to find your own style and own it! Helps to have a couple friends that you can be completely real with. And marfans may come with some pluses (as long as your careful) I know another poster climbs phone towers for a living and I enjoy some occasional rock climbing cause I can reach all the holds! I cannot tell you how many times I have been told I look like I need to eat a sandwich, despite probably eating more than anyone who is ever said that to me. It is the assumptions that get to me. Even little seemingly innocuous or positive things like \"I bet you are good at basketball\" get under my skin. That being said, at the end of the day, it does not really matter what the majority of people think. View it as a sort of litmus test. The people who are going to judge you or see you as unattractive for having Marfans are people you do not want to make friends with or date anyway. Think of how stupid the average American is. Then think about how half of them are stupider than that. I am sure you are beautiful just as you are.", "Reminder! We have a Discord now.  to get in. Would love to have any and all of you to grow the chat. Voice, text, all is welcome. ", "Can Marfans be found through an echocardiogram? Is that the main way it is found? Marfans is not simply looking at one thing and saying you have it. Echos are used to look at the heart and see if your aorta is ballooned which is actually called Aortic Aneurysm as well during the echo they can listen for heart murmurs and odd heart beating.\n\nBut many people have those individual issues and does not automatically put you in the marfans group. As marfans is not one single thing being wrong. This is likely wrong as i was diagnosed as a kid and was more in shock than anything at that time. But you have to have x out of the 30 things that falls under marfans to be put into that group.  I think X = 8 or some crap.\n\nBut the echo is the start and might just say you have this one single issue with your heart which actually puts you into this group. But is it safe to say if nothing was found on a echo then you do not have Marfans? Out of those 30 odd things that are symptoms of Marfans, is not heart issues a consistent one throughout? Heart is one of them and most usually have one of the heart things but having a single heart issue does not put you in it. And other issues out of that 30 may come up later in life. Or there is the fact that you may be born with the minor ones and not have a severe case of marfans.\n\nBut if you look at the list i think wikipedia has a pretty decent list you can techically have marfans without the heart issues. Of that list the heart ones are up there on causing major issues. But stretch marks when you are not fat is a liveable issue.\n\nI would go to a doctor and have them check your heart and if you do not have a ballooned aorta at this time it does not hurt to be checked every few years. &gt;I would go to a doctor and have them check your heart\n\nyeah i have seen my doctor a good amount this year for various reasons and right now we have been looking at my heart for a few reasons, and AFAIK an echo i had a few weeks ago did not show anything out of the ordinary but we are still checking to see if I have Marfans Check away, if you do have marfans you can live a pretty decent life.  The Echo is to check for aorta dilation/aneurism  which is a condition which could occur in people with marfans.  It is purpose is to check the existence and extent of any dilation/aneurism so that it can be surgically corrected if it expands to a dangerous level in order to prevent a dissection or rupture of the aorta.\n\nI had a dilation which ultimately expanded to a aneurism and was corrected.  I started having echos initially because of multiple family members suffering a dissection - all of which were catastrophic.  \n\nIn my experience, Marfans was determined through examination for other external physical characteristics and ultimately through a DNA test.  Doctors, especially the geneticist, did not feel I had marfans due to my physical characteristics but none the less recommended DNA testing to both confirm that and to see if there were other genetics that might have caused my aorta problems given the family history.  The main reason this was recommended in my case was because it would be a tool in determining what types of monitoring/testing should be done to other close relatives and my descendants.  My DNA testing did not disclose anything known to be conclusive.\n\nBTW:  Even though I do not have Marfans I occasionally like to look through this subreddit due to my interest in aortic issues and surgery.  I had valve sparing aortic root replacement in 2014. &gt; But is it safe to say if nothing was found on a echo then you do not have Marfans?\n\nNo.  If you have Marfans then you are at higher risk for issues with your aorta and heart but not everyone with Marfans has such issues.\n\n &gt; But is it safe to say if nothing was found on a echo then you do not have Marfans?\n\nNo.", "Has anyone with Marfans ever taken viagra? Is it safe? All I could find when Googling was this article which is alien to me -\n\n\n It is best to ask your doctor.  **Sildenafil (Viagra)** can add to the blood pressure-lowering effect of **losartan,** But Losartan itself can have a positive effect on Erectile Dysfunction.  Patients with *beta*\\-*blocker* related erectile dysfunction may request a prescription for *sildenafil* (Viagra).  \nThere is some evidence that Sildenafil Prevents Marfan-Associated Emphysema. Huh interesting, I never knew that about losartan.  That is probably why I have never had any semblance of an issue with ED in my life.  Been taking losartan for 20 years. Sorry can someone dumb this down for me? So some background, the diameter of your blood vessels is regulated (in part) by locally produced nitric oxide (NO).  This helps regulate blood flow and pressure.  It is why people with severe heart problems have nitroglycerine as a rescue med: if their heart's struggling, they pop a pill and it rapidly turns into NO, increasing the diameter of the vessles and lowering BP, making everyone happier.\n\nViagara (actual drug name of Sildenafil), influences an enzyme your body has that makes NO.  Most notably, this leads to blood flow for an erection.\n\nThe paper you linked to, said that they tried to use Viagra to make NO elsewhere in the body, to see if it helped with the aoritc root issues marf folks are prone to.\n\nThe paper said it did not help with the aoritc root, but the blood vessel expanding effect had positive impacts on some *lung* systems.  The paper outlines that blood vessel restriction within the lungs can lead to issues that look a lot like emphysema, so the blood vessle expanding aspect of viagra helps that.\n\nAs to whether or not this is right for you you will have to talk to your doctor.  Personally, I shy away from THC because it is also a vasodialator and can sometimes make my blood pressure tank through the floor.\n\nAs others have mentioned, if you are having issues and are on metoprolol, that to can be a likely culprit.  Never had problems until I started taking that.  It was addressed by adjusting the losartan/motropol levels. Very interesting stuff! Been taking nitric oxide boosters before yoga which helps with pain while adjusting ribs/vertebrae in practice. Definitely no complaints in the bedroom \ud83d\ude02.

Maybe someone who has been able to improve their situation with for example training? I would love to hear someone else's perspective. I had one when I was 6 so I cannot relate exactly. But I would recommend a therapist or Councillor or just a friend to talk through these issues. It is a traumatic event and people may take a while to mentally recover", "Do I have Marfan's?  Is your arm span longer than your height? Are you double jointed at all?  &gt; Is your arm span longer than your height?\n\nNope, but I am pretty flexible in my entire body.

Okay so I have Pectus Excavatum, not very badly, but it is there and i have noticed that my left arm across it quite well, i believe i was squashed when i was born. I am just under 6 foot 3 tall and weigh around 140 pounds. My fingers appear long and thin, but not sure whether this is due to my height and weight. I also have a rather high palate, with (what used to be) crowed teeth, until i had teeth out and braces. \nAnyway, i went to the doctor because all of this was concerning me (after having seen the symptoms for marfan syndrome) and she listened to my heart with a stethoscope and said it was perfectly healthy and said she was not convinced i had Marfan syndrome. She said I could go and get my chest x rayed to ensure that everything is okay anyway, so i obliged and got the x ray. When i went back for the results the doctors said everything was fine with my heart and all of the vessels were the right size and everything is in the right place (they knew I was concerned about marfan syndrome). So this time the woman took my height;190 cm, and took my arm span; 195cm. She then put that into a calculator and said that it would have to be 199.5cm for it to be classed as disproportionally long arms so that is okay. She then went through a list of symptoms; flexible joints? no. family history of heart problems? no. flat feet? no (I got her to check). \nanyway, so she was satisfied that need not worry any more, and i said to her \"so i can rule it out?\" and she said yes i can. \nHowever I still worry, can I let it go?\nthanks for reading :)", "Different levels of Marfan Syndrome?

I have never heard about marfan syndrome until I searched about PE (pectus excavatum) for a while on the internet.\nI have been to doctors a few times, they noticed PE, idk when exactly but I was pretty young (I am 18 now). I also have scoliossis and I have had some specific exercises for it.\nI am 196cm tall, weight about 95kg and I go to gym regulary without any problems, my only problem is shortnes of breath when I am running for too long.\nI do not have any problems with eyes, I do not wear glasses, my teeth are a little crowded but not a lot, have not considered braces. Fingers are long but they are proportional to my body so I do not think they are too long.\nAs I said I found about this on the internet, I have never heard it from anyone, I am scared a little, because it seems like a very serious syndrome.

Ive been getting chest pains and air hunger often, and I have a lot of signs of Marfan, like pectus and scoliosis, as well as being super skinny. Anyways, I went to the ER in November. They did a ct scan of my aorta and it came back completely normal. Im still worried about marfan but if the scan was fine am I in the clear for now?", "Have you ever had immobilizing pain/weakness in joints that goes away after a few days? Had It in my wrists this week, had to go get splinted at emerg. they did not know what was up. happened in my legs a few months later. Hm interesting - good to know, thanks, i did not know this was a marfans things but it is def been a thing for me. my doc recommended physio with a connective tissue expert too i just started taking it! i do not know if it is doing anything but i feeeeeel good about it so that is helps Good! \n\nYes it is a Marfan thing, loose joints popping out. Most of the time they go back on their own, but will be sore. I cannot count how many times I have woken up with my thumb slightly out, and had to put it back myself, at 3am though. That is why I highly recommend the first aid course \ud83d\ude05", "Possibly diagnosed with Marfans, electrocardiogram pending. Are results of an old electrocardiogram relevant?   Have not finished reading all of that, but an electrocardiogram is useless when it comes to finding aortic aneurysm/dilation (which is the big worry with Marfan). \n\nWhat you need is an echocardiogram or a chest CT. Oh, sorry... That probably was what the doctor actually told me to do and I confused it with an electrocardiogram, so I guess it is really a coin toss.\nI would delete the post, but I will leave it here if anyone wants to say something.\nThanks for the heads up!! Sorry again, there were actually both exams in the case, electro and echo. Everything was normal in both of them. Could a development of Marfan have changed that with age? It is been 8 years. Or was that one enough to discard these possibilities? (I am getting a new one regardless though, this is just for piece of mind) If your Echo was normal that likely means you have a normal Aortic root, that is the only thing that needs consistent monitoring for most people Marfan Syndrome.\n\nIf your doctor still suspects Marfan Syndrome, they will calculate your 'score' ( and if your score indicates possible Marfan Syndrome they should refer you for Marfan and related disorders genetic testing (to a geneticist) A lot can change, it is even more probable that something changed if you had most of your growth after the tests were done. You said you developed miopia and scoliosis at 14, the development of these conditions may be related to a growth spur that may also have affected your heart. \n\n Just do not do strenuous exercise before having the test done to be on the safe side; no running or strength training with heavy weights and/or isometry. Thank you very much for your help! He did make sure during the consultation to make it clear that he was not confirming anything, and that if I did have Marfans, it would probably be a mild case.\nIn this website, it seems that my score would be at most 10, with 7 unsure points:\n\nDural Ectasia - Never heard of this, but I have a chronic randomly occurring lower back pain since about 12, which an orthopedist told me was lack of musculature. That could probably be related.\n\nProtrusio acetabuli - Never heard of this either, but I have clicks everytime I put my legs up, although no pain, could be related as well. \n\nWrist AND thumb sign - I can only slightly do both, but to be fair I am extremely skinny, so my hands are small and my wrist is very thin, and given my fingers look normal, I am doubtful about whether this is valid for me. Thanks for the reply!\n\nTo be fair, I did not grow that much in terms of height or weight, and I also almost abruptly changed my active lifestyle into a sedentary one, using a computer all day right around that period.\n\nMy miopia is not that bad (apparently it is more severe when caused by Marfans?), I have not worn glasses in a few months because I can do everything normally, only have issues with reading from a fairly large distance.\n\nAbout exercises, I do not exercise outside of my routine workouts, which are not very heavy and not aerobic (crunches, push-ups, lifting small weights, etc.), but it does make me a little apprehensive to do them, at least until I get this sorted.", "should i get checked? i fear that my doctor is dismissing me as hypocondriac, should i get checked by a specialist? i have some of the symptoms, but they seems mild... what should i do???

I think you should ask them to check your heart out just to be safe. I am not very tall but have the skinny arms/fingers/thumb and pinky overlap. It was not until I was 25 that some doctor suggested I might have this disease. So I have to get my heart checked now. It is better to just get it ruled out (or in) than ignore the possibility.

", "To anyone having abdominal aneurysm repair At the end of 2019 I had an abdominal aneurysm repair and had some unwanted side effects which I later learned are common but not commonly talked about, and I thought I would post about it just in case anyone is about to undergo the procedure.\n\nThe major problem from having this surgery is that I now have retrograde ejaculation. This is because the nerves that control ejaculation run along the aorta and during the repair they were damaged. I only learned this later on when I was seeing a urologist, but many urologists will recommend that patients freeze sperm before having an abdominal aneurysm repair because of the potential damage. \n\nThe second problem I encountered because of this surgery is that it lead to several additional surgeries. Since the original procedure I have had a complete abdominal reconstruction surgery and a muscle plication of my lover right abdomen. 2 completely different surgeries with months of recovery time and rehab in between and I am just wrapping up my recovery now.\nThis is all because us marfan patients are blessed with weak connective tissue. So if you are having any procedure, please for the love of god, ask you surgeon about how they plan to close you up. The only thing that really works for me is layers of mesh wherever the surgeon cuts. \n\nI dont intend to scare anyone who is going to have the procedure, just want to give a heads up. \nAnd to put my condition into context, I am sitting on the preferred side of the spectrum when it comes to marfans. I am 30 years old and still strong, athletic, and active. But dont be a dumb dumb like me and think that because the surgeon is a \u201cspecialist\u201d that everything is going to be okay. Always ask questions (even if you think they are stupid) before a procedure. The only person looking out for you is you. Thanks for sharing bro! I wanted to ask you; you do not have Loeys Dietz? Or are you genetically confirmed for marfans? I ask because abdominal aneurysm is more seen in LDS than Marfan, thanks This is great info! It is amazing how we have to be our own advocates and learn much of this info ourselves. Is the sexual functions only associated with the abdominal aorta or do we also need to be concerned if we are having aortic root surgery as well? I have Marfans. I have been genetically confirmed. But when I was diagnosed in 2003 all they had to do was confirm that you had two of 3 physical signs (long disjointed limbs, enlarged aorta, and dislocated lenses) It is great to have this community to read about other ppls experiences. I wish I had done it sooner.\nBut to answer your question, Just the abdominal area. The nerves sit low, around ur belly button, maybe lower. And while I lost the ability to ejaculate it didnt effect the sensation or feel downstairs (sorry if that is too much info, just wanted to address it if anyone was curious).\nI had aortic root surgery (full on open heart) in 2006 and never had any side effect or unwanted outcomes. If we can make sperm from bone marrow or whatever, wouldnt that be a better way of like ensuring its like high quality stuff rather than freezing your hunk spunk? Not entirely sure what the procedure your talking about is. But i would assume freezing sperm the normal way is probs the easiest. Just a short visit to the clinic. I am having aortic root surgery (ascending) in 1 week, full open heart. Do you have any advice? First off, sorry to hear that you have to go under the knife, its never easy and it is completely OK to feel all the emotions that come between now and the surgery.\nSecondly, u got this! Dont be worried, we marfans people are a strong breed. \nI think the best advice I can give is to be patient with yourself. We are not superheroes, It is really easy to get down on yourself and feel like the walls are closing in. But the recovery period cannot be rushed, and if it is, it can really set you back. That being said, try to reach a new goal everyday. It can be as simple as taking your first walk after surgery, eating an extra bite of your meals or whatever. But every little thing helps you physically and mentally. \nYour mental health is important! I recently got myself a therapist after my recent aneurysm repair and it has helped sooooo much. \nLastly, remember the recovery phase is not forever. Sometimes it can feel that way, and some days are worse than others. But there is an end to it, and a return to life and all it has to offer. \n\nIll try to check this more frequently if you have any more questions. Or dm me if you want", "Artisan lenses? Hi everyone.\n\nHas anyone had an artisan lens inserted in their eye/s? I have spoken to an opthalmologist who says they are used for lens dislocations and can have good results in Marfan syndrome.\nAny advice?", "Marfans syndrome I am convinced there is only like three people online with marfans syndrome no matter the platform. I feel so alone with my syndrome and I have so many unanswered questions it is becoming impossible to deal with the pain. I would love to talk to others with marfans.  Well there is more than 3 of us but i have only met two others in real life. My case is mild to say the least. What questions do you have? What pain are you experiencing? It depends on the day and how much activity I do but lately my ribs have been in excruciating pain, they feel like they are slicing against my skin. I also experience really bad leg pain where it feels like my bones are too big for my legs if that makes sense, like they are pushing against them. \nI have been having a hard time with recognizing if certain pains have to do with my marfans syndrome or if it is something else, I am always paranoid it scares me so much  Questions like: is being constantly tired every day normal? I never feel awake I am constantly feeling exhausted even though I sleep regularly\n\nAlso chest pains are a huge issue with me, it hurts so much to the point where I cannot breathe or move. Is this normal with people who have marfans? Doctors cannot seem to find out why since my heart looks okay. There are not many professionals who are educated on marfans where I live.  As i am about to turn 30 i have found being tired almost nornal. Now i would like to blame habits like gaining weight to be some of that. As for chest pains those are not normal unless i do a lot of physical labor like mowing when it is 100\u00b0 plus out. At this time my plan is to start working out and dropping some weight to see of the tiredness goes away. There is a HUGE and active community on Facebook. Almost all of my friends are fellow \"Marfs\" now.\n\nI deal with a ton of chronic pain and fatigue issues and I am always around to chat/commiserate/compare! The chest pain you describe sounds similar to my Costochondritis pain. It is inflammation of the tissues in your sternum/ribs. The first couple of flares that I had with that, I really thought I was dying, the pain is so intense. It is painful but harmless, it might be something worth looking into with your doctor to give you more peace of mind, as I know a lot of people with Marfan have the same issue I have been having chest pains on and off since I partially collapsed a lung during surgery a couple years ago. I have asthma now, did not before. \n\nHave you ever had your lung capacity screened?  Seconded There is a discord channel that is pretty active if that tickles your fancy.\n\n Yo yo yo, ask away my friend The rib pain sounds a lot like what I used to get often when I was still growing.  Kind of a sharp sudden pain that felt like my ribs were stabbing into my skin or something.  I found that I could get it to go away by stretching out my chest and taking slow deep breaths. That kind of pain is normal? I just went through and set up an appointment over it because I just started having it after starting a new job that was more physical.  Well I mean, I would not say it is \"normal\" but it is definitely common. It is always good when you have a pain that is new to you to have it checked out. In my case, and many others though, Costochondritis is a culprit for unexplained chest pain. It hurts like a bitch, but is pretty \"harmless\". Well, that does make me feel a little better about it. Hopefully the cardiologist can clear it up some more, especially since it worries my girlfriend way too much.  I am with you!! My fatigue and pain seem to be worse than everyone else in my family! I have not had aortic root replacement yet but my brother did... we have some similar yet very different traits and it is prevalent in almost every member on my mothers side... but my son genetically tested negative!!!!  I was diagnosed with Marfan syndrome 25 years ago. I am fortunate in that I did not develop any real complications until I was about 41. Since the age of 41 I have had a heart attack two open heart surgeries, I currently have a thoracic aneurysm that is being monitored, my eyes are complete garbage, I have a malformed rib cage, a malformed heart, and every single day I have some kind of pain. All that said, I know a lot of Marfan\u2019s have it a lot worse than I do, I can still function on a daily basis so I am pretty lucky., I do get stabbing chest pains occasionally and as suggested by another poster in this thread I find that standing up straight stretching out my torso as much as possible and taking slow deep breath\u2018s generally makes it stop. If I went to the hospital every time I had a stabbing pain, I would live there. It is a matter of knowing your own body and knowing when the pain is something that needs to be addressed or when you just need to suck it up and move on. ", "any women who had open heart surgery? i feel like there are a lot of dudes on this forum (which is cool!) but i would like to talk with women and how they feel about their body after surgery, mostly how comfortable they feel showing their scars, etc. i had surgery recently (8/10/17) so still waiting for a lot to heal. My wife had her valve replaced in 2009. She says that sees it as a badge of honor and feels very comfortable in her own skin. She recommends keeping it out of the sun for at least the first year and the scar will fade.\n\nAs her husband I can tell you that her scar has never detracted from her beauty. I love every inch of her, and if someone is worth your time they will feel the same toward you. I could not be more proud of my wife or more attracted to her than I am today.  I had emergency open heart surgery on 8/7/14. At first I saw it as a badge of honor given the fact that I literally came back from the dead. However, after a few years, I have recently started becoming more self conscious about it. I was only 30 years old when everything happened. Everybody tells me to be proud of it. I try to be. However, as a girl who has always had a nice chest, I definitely have had my struggles with accepting my appearance now. But with everything, there are good days and bad days. When I look at the bigger picture, there are so many more important things than a scar running down the middle of my chest and above my left breast (I had an AICD implanted because my heart can no longer beat for itself). I have clinically died, came back from the dead, and I run solely on a battery (literally), so in retrospect, I really do not have any grounds to be upset about a scar, but that does not mean it does not bother me.  I am a 31 year old lady and had my aorta replaced just over a year ago. Ask away!  Hi! I had emergency open heart surgery to repair an aortic aneurysm on Sept 7th, 2017. \nI feel as if my scar is changing  daily. It was flatter and white and had recently become raised and a bit redder. \nI made the mistake of going back to work at my pretty labor intensive job and I think that is affecting it\u2014lots more movement, lifting, and stretching my arms. \nBeing a 6 foot tall woman I have long since lost any form of self consciousness so I am not that worried about the scar. I am a sight to see completely naked as I have a ton of stretch marks, and honestly they are much uglier than my scar. \nI also have rather large breasts so most of my wardrobe is low cut, scoop neck, or v neck. So I cannot really hide it unless I go get new clothes and that is not an option or really my taste.  I am just rocking the scar for all to see. \nI will say that the sudden diagnosis of Marfan (which was verified by genetic testing right after my surgery) and the surgery itself have had more affect on my mental state than anything. One day I was healthy(or so I thought), strong, and living life; the next day I was having surgery and feeling incredibly weak. It can also be very isolating as I do not have anyone in my life that can relate to this (I did not inherit Marfan from my parents, it was a spontaneous mutation). I have struggled with that and made some bad decisions, such as going back to work too soon and opting out of cardiac rehab. \nThis last Friday I made the good decision to take some more time off from work and enter an intensive out patient mental health program to help with my mind and the cardiac rehab program to help my body. \nIf you are struggling with body image issues due to the scar or just some stress from the surgery I suggest talking with a therapist. He/she may be able to help you navigate any negative feelings and perhaps give you some coping skills. You (and anyone else on this subreddit) are more than welcome to message me for support as well! \nThanks for letting me get that all out and I wish you the best of luck and health. Xo I have! It is scary going into the unknown but it will be over with before you know it and you will feel better too! I went on to have twin girls a year later\ud83d\ude01! You can do this!! Yes the scare sucks but I do not care! I still wear what I want because it is become a badge of courage. It is the reason I am alive and I am proud of it! ", "TFW a girl says she wants a \u201creal man\u201d with \u201cbig muscles\u201d \ud83d\ude41 Why could not I have been a girl born with marfans? I workout and am muscular but because I can never be big enough as an able-bodied person i will never be seen as a real man by the opposite sex. Thank god im bi. Im not a \"girl\" and I am also not a \"guy\", but this is just oof.  Wow.  I get that people might want a certain type of s/o, but personally for me I would not want someone with muscles that were too big.  That is not my type. So like, yeah it might be harder but there are so many people in this world so just calm down and give it time.\n\nBesides do you REALLY want to be in a relationship with someone who only cares for looks? Yes, I want to be desired and lusted after like most people do. But it is hard to make this happen as a guy with marfans without risking your life to be big which is what I will have to do. it is really unfortunate. Guys give a *lot* more leeway with looks than women do in general. Furthermore my mom is 5'12 (her words not mine) and finding guys that were willing to date her was hard for her too.  She has had two marriages, one good one not so much, but either way she was able to find guys that were willing to overlook her height, especially when she wore heels.  Tbh so many guys out there will not date a woman who is taller than them so I am sure some of the other women with marfans have the same issue. I am a woman with marfan's. It was definitely easier for me socially than for you once I grew up toward the older end of high school.  Tall and skinny was sexy. \n\nBut I was an extremely awkward kid, ugly, all that. It was hard. \n\nAlso, now, ad a 45 year old woman, I have degenerative disc disease and arthritis with bad scoliosis. I live in awful pain. My vision is a -14.  \n\nIf you can get past your looks and see what you do have... It is only going to get worse as you age.\n\nI am not sure if I feel awful for you, or if I want you to look at what truly matters. This!  I was 6 feet until I lost a couple inches to my back.  Lots of men did want me back then, but...i really wanted tall guys who could make me feel feminine. Hard to find. You do not need to oversimplify and invalidate women's struggles for your feelings to be valid and you definitely do not need to insinuate that women are generally this shallow. We all suffer and shallowness knows no gender. Women do not generally like skinny guys - skinny girls are generally liked by guys. The virtue signaling has to end. There is a reason why I could get with a guy anyday but never a girl and you know exactly why. You people are definitely lucky in this aspect. it is nothing to be ashamed about or to resent on your side That is all shallowness, you have to leave that world. There are skinny guys in loving relationships and non-skinny women in relationships everywhere. You are upholding the harmful stereotypes. it is not shallowness. it is the cruel nature of inherent preferences and r/ladyboners reflects that. There are but the point is not to have to message near 100+ women to find one who is okay with a marfan physique while for a woman with MFS much much less and even then she does not have to message or approach much at all. I am not upholding stereotypes. Look at the subreddit. They are almost all big. Here is a sneak peek of /r/LadyBoners using the ( of the year!\n\n\\#1: ( | (  \n\\#2: ( | (  \n\\#3: ( | (\n\n----\n^^I am ^^a ^^bot, ^^beep ^^boop ^^| ^^Downvote ^^to ^^remove ^^| ( ^^| ( ^^| ( Since when?  I was literally once on a date but after it was over I got a text saying he had a good time but \"my nose was crooked and he could not overlook that\".  It was broken when I was like 4 and I never really thought it was noticeable till then. \n\nEveryone of every gender has their preference, you do not need to change who you are to be with someone.  If someone does not like you for you, including your looks that is not who you want to be with plain and simple.\n\nAlso I am asexual as fuuuuuuuck so telling me that most people want to be desired and lusted after made me laugh \ud83d\ude39 Since forever. if you doubt that then go on any dating app or doll yourself up and go to a bar or any social setting and you will see what I mean meanwhile we men with it are invisible in life. Well I guess I do not want to be with most women then since we can never be what they want in a physique and will have to play the numbers game over 100 times to find one who is cool with it. Yeah, most desire it, you are a minority, just like the number of women who actually like skinny guys Sounds like pretty unhealthy thinking. Those kind of generalizations are worthless and only keep you in a negative mindset, while invalidating women and spreading shallow stereotypes. Man you can say whatever you want but reality is reality it is literally been proven \n\n\n\nMakes me sick just reading the title lmao what?\nMaybe do not base your thinking on some random nsfw subreddit? I know the feeling. It is hard seeing muscular people all the time and knowing you cannot achieve it even with hard work or without compromising your health. You are right that you are not alone - plenty of skinny guys out there who do not have Marfan and just do not have the genetics to become big have a really hard time with it too. It sucks, but everyone is got their baggage in life to deal with, some of which can be alot more serious than Marfan frankly. \n\nI think your best bet will be to try to accept the reality of your situation, and look for partners that will do the same. I imagine you will be much happier with a person who is attracted to you as you are, and not expecting you to take risks just to put on muscle. I know I am. Being jacked is not the definition of a real man, and it is not healthy to be with a person that thinks that way. Many people get jacked to compensate for the fact that they are fundamentally giant losers.\n\nPlus, I promise you there are alot of women and men out there who PREFER the lean look. Being tall is such an advantage for men, so use that! Also I would not be so quick to wish you were a girl. They face their own mountain of ridiculous image standards set by society that Marfan can make worse. Again, you are making harmful, inaccurate gender stereotypes based on an incredibly specific selection bias. That subreddit in no way gives an accurate view of what all women generally like in the same way that subs with loads of posts of unrealistic looking women does not in any way represent who men are actually generally attracted to. What those do represent are toxic and shallow aspects of our culture that do not need to be upheld. We are all in this together and there is no need to try to shove women OR men into these shallow stereotypes to express your pain. It is literally been proven and also that is one of the few subreddits (the others being also about muscular men) with actual women gushing over guys. The skinny / fat / etc guy subreddits are majority gay guys! You can say what you want but it is literally been found that women rate the strongest guy as the most attractive which means the polar opposite will not cut it for most. \n\nMost women do not like skinny guys which makes dating and hooking up with women MISERABLE for most straight / bi / etc guys with MFS.\n\n0 OF THEM PREFER WEAKER MEN My dad had marfans and before his health declined he had women hitting on him all the time... He was tall, generally well dressed, and very confident. Maybe it is your crap attitude driving women away. Yeah, because on dating apps and in real life women can sense my \u201ccrap attitude\u201d just by looking at me meanwhile men love me, how interesting. I am not saying that your pain is not valid, I am not saying there are not toxic people out there, I am not saying that men and women do not find skinny people attractive, I am saying you are using toxic communities full of shallow people to make unfair generalizations about entire genders that are not helping anyone, least of all you. I speak truth. It bothers women when it comes to light that most of them would never date a guy with MFS (even women with MFS on this subreddit browse ladyboners!!!) because it makes them realize and acknowledge their cutthroat shallowness that a LOT of guys do not share, but it is all truth, it is not like we wanted it to be this way to create some delusion, generalization, or anything else that is not true. We WANT to be fully desired and have chances. But the majority of guys with MFS are not and do not and have to try so hard while women with MFS do not. Take a break from these toxic communities including dating apps, no wonder you feel this way. They are making you take victim stance instead of have compassion for women who go through their own differing/similar issues. No one is doubting that studies have been done on attractiveness, they just do not have as much to do with who is able to end up in stable, loving relationships in real life. IT DOESNT MATTER HOW MANY BREAKS I TAKE THEIR PREFERENCE WILL LITERALLY NEVER CHANGE and i will always have to deal with it whenever I want a woman around. Why should I care about what women claim they go through? They do not even see me as a man because of something out of my control. What they go through does not matter to me because they regularly discriminate against me because I do not fit their silly fucking ancient preference Looks fade personality does not. Those studies are based off of first glance reactions.\n\n&gt; Why should I care about what women claim they go through?...\nOh, I do not know. It shows empathy, compassion, concern for other people.\n\n&gt;...What they go through does not matter to me...\nAny chance you had of being found attractive by a woman is gone at this point. \n\nThe dating scene until you get into your mid 20s is a drag, but if you spend the time on yourself figuring yourself out and what qualities really shine and what women seem to gravitate towards, have hookups, have fwb's, have fun. Stop pressuring yourself to fit into something that is actually not that common.\n\nThere are many married marfan men in this sub, so your thought that **nobody** is attracted to men with marfans is already busted. THE FIRST GLANCE AND MINUTE IS WHEN THEY DECIDE IF YOURE GOOD ENOUGH BY THE FIRST GLANCE AND STARE. They do not see me as a man so I do not see them as people, is not that fair? I would NEVER tell or think a woman is not a woman because she has no bust, it is so fucking dehumanizing to on both sides. I do not have empathy for people who dehumanize me. Women gravitate towards muscular good looking men. But because i will never be as big as they want they will never have lust or desire for me. It is very common. Check out the subreddit and study if you think otherwise. I hate it so much. You realize women and men marry each other for more than looks, right? Checkout r/deadbedrooms and I will NOT not be with someone who \u201clooks past\u201d what I look like in favor of how I am as a person. My partner needs to desire me physically and emotionally. &gt;They do not see me as a man so I do not see them as people, is not that fair?&gt;\n\nNo. Treat people how you want to be treated. Your personality is offputting and is easy to detect through the first few interactions of dating.\n\n&gt;I would NEVER tell or think a woman is not a woman because she has no bust.&gt;\n\nLol k but it is okay to treat them like shit.\n\n&gt;Women gravitate towards muscular good looking men. &gt;\n\nI love tall scrawny femboys and short fat dudes, not \"chunky\" but fat.\n\n&gt;But because i will never be as big as they want they will never have lust or desire for me.&gt;\n\nYou are right, not with that attitude anyway.&gt;\n\nyou realize women and men marry each other for more than looks, right&gt;\n\nUh, yeah. Literally what I had just told you.\n\n&gt;Checkout r/deadbedrooms&gt;\n\nI know what it is like to have a dead bedroom, been there, done that. Got the t-shirt and the not related divorce. (They were an addict)\n\n&gt;I will NOT not be with someone who \u201clooks past\u201d what I look like in favor of how I am as a person. My partner needs to desire me physically and emotionally.&gt;\n\nThen you will only find people who are superficial and will judge you in such a way. Conversation and compatibility are far more important than looks will ever be. OBVIOUSLY IF MOST WOMEN ARENT ATTRACTED TO SKINNY GUYS THEN THEY WOULD NEVER SAY YES TO DATE. All rejection from them. Guys are happy to date me though so keep spinning the narrative that it is my personality as the cause of why women reject me. That is not how it works in the real world - if people do not respect you then you do not respect them so therefore I do not respect women. It is when they treat you like shit over something you cannot control. I can guarantee if you were not a woman with MFS then you would relate and feel similarly. i am \n invisible to 99% of women because i am not big. So I have to agree that it is okay too. it goes both ways. Well then, it seems that most women are superficial enough about physique to not even bother with as people - even as friends - but I still desire them so i am stuck in this predicament of wanting the people I hate. Honestly...yeah. Speaking as a woman, they probably can. You need to buff out that chip on your shoulder and get over your pity party. I am guessing you are young? Late teens early 20s? That is when this \"I will never find love I am broken\" attitude tends to be at it is worst with men. Trust me, work on loving yourself and things will get better. In the future you will look back on this and cringe. Yet plenty of guys fuck and date women around my age yet I cannot. What you call a pity party is actually a tragedy because I and many other men with MFS will never be enough to be desired and lusted after by women.  Reality hurts! I loved my scrawny tall lanky pasty ex, got a thing for tall and skinny. Dont worry, not every woman thinks this way. I think you have other issue than being skinny. Your outlook is sour. You cannot generalize us and get respect. \n\nYour muscles are not the issue. Its your personality. \n\nI should have said I love skinny lanky guts who are t sexist and rude. INCEL ALERT I CAN YELL TOO WEEEE! \n\nNot a woman or a dude my guy.\n\nYou are borderline spewing incel rhetoric, which radiates an aura about you in which women are not attracted to you. Gay/bi dudes still date you because you treat them well (you said yourself if people do not respect you, you do not respect them, since dudes do not turn you away, they \"respect you\" thus you do not have a negative bias toward them).\n\nYour pain is legit, I am not arguing that point, dating blows, especially at your age, but you seriously have to change your outlook on things, invest time into yourself to find things that you can share with people, learn to woodwork, paint, knit, rig shibari, go for hikes, get into cycling. Find something that puts yourself out there. You will meet people and since you will have hobbies and interests, you will have more attractive and entertaining qualities. \n\ngdspeed and good luck. i am not an incel. I do not wish harm upon women. I just do not respect or like them because they do not respect me. There is a reason why he is your ex. They always are. \u201cI love (undesirable trait that people have / guys) my ex was one!\u201d \n\nLet us not falsely accuse. Um wtf is lady bones? I came on here for my ex that has Marfans.  It was the abuse I didnt like. Like you. I know you would be exactly like him. He hates himself and his illness and acts like you. \n\nI guess I cant be what I am because the marfans incel says im \"virtue signaling\". Piece of shit. Youre an incel. Youre projecting and youre hateful. Women do not like you because you are like this. \n\nGood for them avoiding your train wreck you got going on. Because youre a pussy  Im 6'1 and get called a man. But this guy will tell you you are wrong. Because he is an incel. Men will fuck holes in walls. Youre standards are non existent. You just want to stick your dick in something. You have no respect for women as people. Incel I can sense it all very easily right here. Do not need to know any more about you. If I had the standards that most women have for men I would be a virgin. \"Pooooor me. Other men with marfans gets love but no real woman loves a man with Marfans.\"\n\nYour sad logic. No one will ever love you though. That is probably true. His personality is absolute garbage. That Is what is going in here. Lol reality hurts. You being an outlier does not disprove the greater picture here. I am a woman with Marfans and it took me years to finally get into a relationship. Then after two years he broke up with my anyway because he was afraid that I would pass on Marfans to our kids. Havent been able to find another relationship since. Marf women have problems too. \n\nMy brother also has Marfans and is extremely tall and lanky with terrible cystic acne, and yet he is had girls all over him since high school. He has a great personality and currently has a great girlfriend who loves him for who he is. You are one of them to most people and this is about biological attraction between the sexes. I am not \u201cspewing\u201d anything it is all true. Women do not like skinny guys for the most part and will not consider them. its not like I CHOSE for dozens upon dozens to say no before growing resentment and hatred. Our reality correlates with what has been proved and it needs to be said. Too many hiding in private feel the same way (such as the awarder). You literally cannot comprehend what it is like having this as a biological male. it is a very subpar existence. Society does not respect us, most of half of of the population is not attracted to us, we have no voice, and people shjt on us all the time. But unlike able-bodied people we have to risk our lives trying to BULK just to get basic human respect and decency and god forbid attraction from the opposite sex. Literally EVERY stranger who i have met who i have told I have it made fun of me. Primates are always dicks to sickly looking members. People HATE us, most of us were bullied as kids so it is inherent. it is okay to hate back. Are you kidding me or what? Let us not be obtuse. Women get with abusive and misogynistic people all the time. Stay strong my guy, it will work out ( I disagree. I am a 5'11 skinny girl. I have gained a bit of muscle but still look pretty skinny and cannot get a guy. Like not at all. It is depressing sometimes, but I came to the conclusion that it is how you feel, not how you look. Being insecure about yourself and your body and  choosing to blame it on someone else it is like the worst combo. Fuck what statistics from fucking Cosmo say. Physical appearance does not impact on you being a real man or not and we (women) know that. &gt;Thank god im bi\n\nHaha oh wow\n\nPics? &gt;They face their own mountain of ridiculous image standards set by society that Marfan can make worse.\n\nYeah, Ive got the standard witchskull due to the downward swung caused by marfan. \n\nThis piece of shit is complaining for no reason. Youve got ugly-ass men with weak chins all over the media, especially in cartoons. But every chick in the media needs to have an angel skull or guys will get *e x t r e m e l y* pissed because guys.  \n\nAnd its okay. Life isnt fair to everybody. Get over yourselves. You are blaming your inceldom on women and denigrating women with marfan instead of realizing that the reason you are dateless is because you are rude, obnoxious, irresponsible, immature and whiny. \n\nGet a hobby or something damn. &gt; meanwhile men love me, how interesting.\n\nSays the man who only 1 day ago posted here about giving head for the first time.\n\nMaybe guys do not like you either. It may be true but until you accept it as your reality, you are going to be miserable. Yeah, most marfan patients are not going to be bodybuilders or even built/thicc. It sucks you cannot be that but you cannot control it and life is not fair. Learn to accept your reality and make the best of its confines.\n\nSome girls prefer muscular body type, some girls do not. There is plenty of skinny and average dudes out there with gfs and wives. Mine liked tall and what she got in return was my currently early 30s hospitalized ass with heart and lung problems. But you know why our relationship works despite these hardships? Because we put in the hard work to make our relationship successful. You need to accept where you are in life, what your limitations are, make a plan for how YOU will make the best of it, and then do it! Wtf Yoire the one making your reality suck. Lol obviously you are straight and do not realize that tops and bottoms exist. i have topped plenty of times. I have been wanting to bottom for a while now and what I desire is a part of that. Also, you are posting up asking about gaining muscle and fat which is super rich - I can only imagine why you are wanting to \ud83e\udd23 as a female with marfans, I can tell you it is not great either - i do not have any feminine curves. I will say many women are into skinny guys so i would not be too discouraged.", "Good outlook? So a few months back someone made a comment about my joints and finger length and asked if I have marfans, so I followed it up now I am having what feels like millions of tests to find out and I am still not ready for them to confirm it.

", "Anxiety and marfans I recently switched to a new cardiologist (first time since I was 13 and diagnosed) and he is extremely blunt and he told me I need surgery. I am meeting with a marfans specialist here in NYC but in two weeks. I think the anxiety is the worst part of waiting. My chest feels tight but it did not before this new doc told me I needed surgery. How do you deal with anxiety when you know you have marfans? Also I am thinking about getting a job in consulting because it is what I would love to do but am kind of nervous about stress level while having this disease. When I get anxious I remind myself that I am being cared for by excellent medical professionals who I completely trust.\n\nYou know about your condition and you take the actions necessary to manage it.  Provided you do those things (get checked, follow restrictions, etc.), you will not drop dead from Marfan.\n\nSo you did what you were supposed to, and now you may need surgery.  That part is out of your control.  Just remember that the doctors are very very good at what they do.  They will fix your aorta up and you will be good to go.  Will the recovery suck?  Probably.  But will you survive?  Yes.  The surgery is extremely safe when performed electively, with essentially no mortality or serious morbidity.\n\nRemember, people with Marfan have a normal life expectancy when properly treated.  This may be a speed bump, but it is by no means the end of the road.\n\n\n\n send me a pm anytime if you wana talk about it! had \nmy surgery 8 days ago", "Can I see pictures of your muscles?

But I am f(26) and I am gaining muscles just fine, but that fucking abdominal fat will not go away. I am a woman, so what I wanted from my workouts was probably different than you, but... I just never got any real muscle mass. I was very cut and toned, and I looked really good in a skinny way - I played all kinds of sports including softball, basketball, volleyball, and a TON of roller blading. But I never had a bubble but or really strong thighs or anything. A Pic now would do not good. I am a pudgy, middle aged mom.  Lol. Seems like as we get older that weight gets packed on easy. so I started working out early this year and so far I have gained about 15kg of muscle but I am still far from my goal, im not focusing on showing off  im focused on gaining weight,  if you want to start working out i recommend calisthenics at the beginning that way you can start gaining strength and you start to see results then when you think you got all the experience you can go to the gym but keep in mind that you may have slower progress than the other people and do not do crazy lifts start at the bottom even if you think is to easy and slowly you can add more weights to your workout the other thing you need to have in mind is the diet, the diet its the most difficult thing because you need to eat a loot, im doing a 5000 calorie diet and its not very easy because you need to supply your body whit other things besides calories so you have to eat intelligent and complement all of that whit a mass gainer after your workout that has helped me a lot and also read a lot of what you are doing, learn about muscles routines reps all of that should help and also get the perspective of your doctor \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit: sorry for the grammar and the redaction, English is not my first language", "Is abdominal aortic aneurysm also common in people with Marfans? ", "Safely break a sweat? How can one safely exercise break a sweat without going to hard? Obligatory Marfans is different for everyone and there is a wide range both of experiences and what one considers to be safe/an acceptable risk\n\nFirstly whatever limits and suggestions your own doctors have given you obviously superced any other advice. I do not know what state your heart is in and I cannot give personalised advice. \n\n1) a good rule of thumb is to avoid isometric exercises. These are ones like weight lifting where you are exercising a muscle but without increasing your heart rate. This increases blood pressure and the strain on the aorta. Contact sports should also be avoided\n\n2) warm up first. The NHS have some good warm up videos on the NHS choices website (I am not sure kf these are accessible outside of the uk) \n\n3) My Cardilogist reccomended that a good metric was that it should be difficult but not impossible to talk. If you are too out of breath to form words the man you have pushed too far and need to ease back down\n\nA good idea it so gradually increase your limits. Work out what you can do now which gets you to a point of discomfort/tiredness within the above limits without exhausting you. Then next time do 15 seconds more. Really gradual increases allowing for rest days are probably the best way to gradually increase what you are doing and finding your own limits\n\n4) bear your joints in mind. Sure a bad knee will not kill you. But part of sage exercise is avoiding injury as well. \nIf you are doing something requires stretching (ie. Yoga or even warms ups) then remember not to over extend hypermoible joints. You may want to book in some time with a professional, either a PT or a small group class to make sure your form is right. Injured joints will really limit you and may decrease your long term mobility. I was told I could do weights as long as it is light enough to do ten reps. Are you saying light weights are safer if my heart rate is also being raised? Such as combining light weights with cardio moves? The Marfan Foundation's PDF on exercise may be more helpful \n\n(\n\nThis is the quote about isometric exercises from their \"To Avoid\" Section\n\n&gt;An isometric exercise is when a muscle is contracting without moving, such as when you strain to lift a heavy weight, do pull ups, or climb steep inclines. During this type of strenuous exercise, you tend to hold your breath while pushing to complete the movement. These exercises lead to an increase in blood pressure which causes unwanted strain on the heart and blood vessels. \n\nA lighter weight which you can lift without straining and where you are doing the full range of motion with sounds like it would be safe based upon the above. But I am not a medical professional and with more specific questions regarding what exactly is safe you are better off asking your cardiologist (good luck. half the time i end up with a junior doctor who is maybe heard of marfans once before and says they have no idea and that i will know better than them which is fuck all help) \n\nAlternatively the Marfan foundation have a number at the end of the booklet which they say to ring if you have further questions. it goes through to their  help &amp; Resource Center: 800-862-7326, ext. 126, I am 64 and did not know i have marfans and 7.3 cm aorta root aneurysm until last august. I was always very physically active, I did cover up my pectus carinatum (pigeon chest) by large amount of muscle. (done mostly by doing pushups). After being diagnosed with aneurysm and in the process of being diagnosed with marfans - i still am very physically active. If i dont do pushups for couple days my costochondritis is starting to hurt. I do also hiking, biking and every weekend playing lumberjack cutting and burning dead trees. The only difference i made was i got a oximeter to be able to check my heart rate. Several time a week i get my heart rate into 140s or 150s for few minutes. Last month i have my aneurysm size checked and it is not changing. I have a cardiologist appointment end of May. Will keep open mind, but so far i will be probably avoiding the surgery Pretty sure at that size you should definitely get surgery StripyCardigans had a lot of smart suggestions. One thing I would like to add that works for my marfan body is exercising in water/ a pool. So if you have access to one, you may want to try it. \n\nThe really beneficial part for me is that it helped me lay a ground work for my muscles that for myself was essentially impossible in regular gravity. While in a pool you can choose how much exertion you want to use by how hard you decide to push (walking exercises, muscle strenthening excercises, anything really). After discovering this I was able to strengthen my muscles and bone density in areas that were impossible for me outside the pool, and they eventually got to the point of being strong enough to take the exercise outside the pool. The other great part is your body is staying cool while breaking a sweat, allowing you to train the muscles harder because of the cooling effect of the water and therefore providing me a way to exert more strength yet keep the blood pressure down as compared to much less weight outside the pool. Lastly, when you push yourself and get tired with aerobic activities you just fall in and the water catches you. It is really a nice feeling actually after a hard workout. Last last advantage for me was that my ankle joints (and many others in my body) hurt so bad at the end of a day, and even laying on a bed and the force of my weight on my heels while laying down still hurt incredibly bad. The water takes all pressure off every joint in the body. \n\nI praise the LORD for discovering this as its lead me to strengthen &amp; recuperate my body in ways I did not have access to the first 30 years of my life. I used to hate getting in the water as my deformities would show, but after discovering how beneficial it is, and really the truth always was - \"I am as God made me\" - if someone else has a problem with deformities, that is really their problem. I did not choose this disease just like people do not choose the color of their skin. And this is too helpful to deny myself it is benefits because of vanity. But even that is a grace of God that I was able to overcome it.\n\nHope you find something useful in all this! GOD bless!!!

I have a few questions and any insight you all can provide would be much appreciated.\n1. How long does the diagnosis take? Is it instant after an EKG? A few weeks? \nWe are going to be long distance for about a year come May and I would definitely like to be present for a diagnosis and would consider putting my post-grad plans on hold if it the testing proves positive.\n2. How big was all of your lifestyle changes? \nThis is what I am most worried about. My boyfriend is a world-class rock climber and competitive white water paddler. Those are not recommended activities, and I would love any insight on activities I can start researching in case it is positive.\n3. Any advice on how I can be supportive while not smothering him? He is all the way across the country from his family and will be for the next few years and I want to provide a good system of support. ", "worried abt marfans hi everyone :) i have been a bit worried lately as i think i have a few marfan like features. i have extremely long fingers and very narrow hands &amp; feet along with crowded teeth and skin stretch marks. my eyesight seems fine and i am average height for my age. no one in my family has marfans but i can do both the hand and thumb sign easily and was wondering if this was normal or an indication of something else going on. thank you :)) The best advice I have is to talk to your doctor and see if they can refer you to a doctor who specializes in Marfan.\nIf you suspect you have it act asap!\n\nI am not trying to scare you or anything but the dangers of it going undiagnosed and untreated can be very severe. I lost my 21 year old brother to Marfan this past September and we had no idea what the disease even was before the horrific incident. So please go get yourself checked. \u2764\ufe0f We are not doctors, so we cannot tell you if it is normal or an indication of something. You can visit the Marfan Foundation:  and you can print out the papers/brochures and bring them to your primary doctor (if you have one) and have them look into it and determine from there.\n\nHaving Marfan's is not a death sentance, going untreated *can* be. I have got multiple heart problems, have had a stroke, and a laundry list of other things that have occured and I am still here. Medical science is amazing.\n\nBest of luck.", "Mitral valve prolapse So for the past couple months I have been suspecting marfans, and the other day I finally got an echocardiogram. The cardiologist concluded I have 7 of the 10 Marfanoid attributes and no aortic complications but MILD mitral valve prolapse and regurgitation. Is it still possible for me just to have the marfanoid habitus body type without marfans syndrome, or does the mitral valve prolapse pretty much confirm I have the syndrome? I know you guys cannot diagnose me I just want to know if theres a possibility of having mitral valve prolapse and a marfanoid body WITHOUT having the actual syndrome. You sound like my diagnosis for a long time. I was confirmed with about 7 out of 10 markers and with mitral valve prolapse. The aortic enlargement came 20 years later. It would not have been picked up if I was not being seen for marfans regularly.\n\nThere are a lot of marfan related syndromes, I was told by a doctor once that I may not be genetically marfanoid (never been tested) but I definitely had the features enough to make the same type of monitoring and restrictions appropriate. I think that is sound advice, but genetic tests are available nowadays so that may be an option, they are expensivr though. Having a good number of markers confirms it more than MVP. MVP is very common in the general population. The only way you will truly know is via genetic test for FBN1 My daughter has every attribute except for the genetic marker.  Eventually, human genome mapping may identify other genetic mutations that exist and how they are linked to Marfans.  Do not let a single test dictate your healthcare decisions.  Do not let the lack of a formal naming ceremony of your condition impact your life.    \n\n\nDepending on your healthcare insurance / financial situation, you may want to seek out a nearby ( .  With our old HMO, our primary care physician, genetic counselor, and others never linked all the symptoms together.  It was an 'over-the-phone' 2nd opinion service offered by my company that a Doctor finally mentioned Marfans... this really got things moving and now we are at Stanford. Same, I have damn near every attribute, but the genetic test came back negative. I did have a mutation (Gly1366Ser) in an area related to connective tissues but there is no research into what the mutation does. The genetic counselor said he would just consider I have it, but he could not officially diagnose me due to the genetic test failing at the known marker.", "Is spontaneous marfan more severe? Hi everybody.\n\nWhat I want to know is if a spontaneous marfan, without a family history, is more serious than a transmitted marfan.\n\n No each case is different does not matter if it is spontaneous or not.  My mom's case was most likely a spontaneous case (although grandma was a slut, so maybe it was some ramdoms case that was passed on).  But her's was not any better or worse. And my sister's and mine seem to be relatively mild.", "Type of marfans? Hi everyone! Today at a doctors appointment I mentioned I have marfans and my doctor asked me what type of marfans i have. I had no idea there were different types, does anyone know what that means? I have the type I do not want anymore. That is the only type I have heard of. I think he probably got confused with EDS Marfan Mutations can be classified in 1 of 2 categories, Haploinsufficiency (HI) which causes a reduced amount of fibrillin-1 protein, or Dominant Negative (DN) which causes an abnormal fibrillin-1 protein.\n\nThe mutations that are classified as Haploinsufficient (HI) seem to have more severe symptoms. In other words, it is better to have an abnormal fibrillin-1 protein than to have a normal one but significantly less of it.\n\nBut this is not something the average Marfan patient will know unless they have found a really good geneticist.\n\n&gt;We found a pathogenic FBN1 mutation in 357 patients, of whom 146 patients (40.9%) were positive for a mutation causing haploinsufficiency (reduced fibrillin-1 protein) and 211 (59.1%) for a mutation leading to a DN effect (abnormal fibrillin1 protein).\n\nSource: (\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are also a few other things to note such as Neonatal Marfan Syndrome, and what is now known as Loeys-Dietz syndrome.\n\n&gt;Neonatal Marfan syndrome is a different entity than Marfan syndrome. It has early onset and rapidly progressive features, most seriously related to the heart, lungs, and airways.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Many doctors use neonatal Marfan syndrome to describe the severe end of the clinical spectrum of Marfan syndrome, rather than considering this a discrete clinical entity. Care should be taken to avoid use of this designation simply because a child is diagnosed with Marfan syndrome in early infancy, as this might simply relate to an early evaluation due to a family history of Marfan syndrome or a particularly astute pediatrician, as opposed to atypically severe disease severity.\n\n(\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Researchers have identified a subset of individuals with symptoms that are extremely similar to those associated with Marfan syndrome; however, these individuals have changes in different genes. Of equal importance, these individuals have now been recognized to be at risk for numerous features that are not seen in Marfan syndrome caused by mutations in FBN1. While a subset of these patients were historically designated as having Marfan syndrome type II, it is now more common practice to specify alternative diagnoses including Loeys-Dietz syndrome or Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome (see the Related Disorders section below). People with a Marfan-like condition caused by mutations in a gene other than FBN1 may require specialized counseling, imaging protocols and management.\n\n( Oh wow this is so helpful, thank you!", "I have seen people worried about the scar after surgery. This is one year out.  So here is the thing, people with marfan are more prone to stretch marks and unfortunately scarring. This includes post operative scars.  Yes, there are creams and oils you can buy and maybe they help a bit but man, at a certain point you have to accept yourself \ud83d\udc96  I do not understand your post, can you clarify? I have full blown Marfans, bad. My point was to say the scar looks pretty good after 1 year :). Sorry if you misunderstood it.  No no. It looks awesome!!!  Not sure what you mean by full blow though. You either have marfan or you do not. I think what I was getting at was a scar is a scar. A stretch mark is a stretch mark. It is awesome that you are so accepting of even having one.  I was just saying we are more prone to them. (I am a mom) There was a lady who was bitching about how gross it was that her marfan kid had stretch marks (facebook) and how to get rid of them. The kid had just been diagnosed and this was her primary concern...I truly did not mean offence. You healed nicely! Gotcha! By full blown I spoke from my experience - my bro is Marfans positive by genetic test but has literally zero symptoms, despite an MRI, etc. I mean I have all the 'bad' Marf traits. Sorry I was so quick to get on yah. Hope you and your family is doing OK :) Gotcha! Haha I guess I could be considered full blown then to (tall, heart stuff, eye stuff, hypermobile etc). Although I avoided scoliosis but made up for it be getting Dural ectasia and autoimmune arthritis lol. We all have our battles right? I was lucky enough to have to awesome boys :) 1 has marfan, 1 does not. The one that does has not had any of my most severe issues. :) that is a win! This is a very wholesome interaction on reddit, why sometimes I love it.  That is a huge win, legit. Hopefully all continues well for you guys. Best wishes from Canada :P I am jealous! When I was one year out my scar still looked angry af, and it became a little hypertrophic too so I saw a plastic surgeon about some steroid injections (are not we all a bit vain?). Now my scar looks like yours, but I am also nearly 10 years post op lol. Every body scars/heals differently, I reckon my boobs did not help too cos those pull your skin in ways you do not want when you are trying to heal properly. Glad yours healed so nicely tho!", "Migraines? Hi Marfans community! I am a 30 year old Loeys-Dietz patient. I have been an active member in this group because of the similarities between Marfans and Loeys-Dietz. In 2017 I completed my aortic root replacement surgery. Since then, I have had a number of migraines (never experienced any before surgery). My cardiologist mentioned that migraines are common for post-op patients but they still do not know why. My question to you all (maybe those who have experienced the same surgery) is do you also get them? And if so, any recs on coping with or preventing them?\n\nI have experienced them after strenuous (I know I am not supposed to be doing this) activity. My most recent one was yesterday after a bike ride with lots of hills. It is not a huge issue because they are rare and they seem to be brought on after activity, but I have had a few that were random. It is still frustrating, so any insight or advice is appreciated! I have had them since I was sixteen and they seemed to get steadily worse since my aorta surgery back in 2011. At the worst, I was getting them once every week to 2 weeks and they were so painful I would lose an entire day. I finally went and saw a neurologist. She put me on a new medication called aimovig. It is an injection I give myself once a month. This stuff is a gd miracle and I am now completely migraine free. I very strongly recommend seeing a neurologist. I have experienced a certain strange sort of migraine (ocular with peripheral to full temporary blindness, not just aura) since I was a 13 or 14 year old. My migraines are triggered much as yours are, by physical stress (including illness) but also emotional or general stress as well.\n\nBut more relevant to your case, my brother suddenly started having these exact migraines after having his mitral valve replaced. Same triggers and all. He would never had them before, now he has them similar to me. It is bizarre.\n\nI see a neuro and both of us see a neuro-ophthalmologist. I have had good luck with topamax, but was recently boosted to a specific migraine formulation that is expensive because of my need and because the weight loss side effect from topamax was extreme. Many migraine meds cause cardiovascular stress, so there were only 1 or 2 things they were willing to even put a marf on. I will get migraines if I am not careful about my salt and hydration intake.  I have problems remembering to eat so that is usually when I start getting them. Sorry to hear that u get them, they are the worst:( I had a bentall procedure and valve replacements when I was under 5 yrs old but similarly to you my migraines are brought on by physical exertion. I have been to a neurologist about it, as the migraines kicked off in early 2019. I will say tho that with exercise I only get the migraines with a proper good workout - light activity could but mostly dosnt cause the migraines. Also do check out exercise intolerance - it has potential of bringing on migraines post activity but my cardiologist said not to worry too much and just see what meds the neurologist would provide. I forget the med name but it was mediocre- gladly have not had many migraines recently bc I have not worked out in ages, after finals when I do get back into working out I will gladly update yall on how the med continues to work. I have had ocular migraines for a long time, since before and after my aorta surgery. Usually brought on by stress, strenuous activity or both. Getting to a dark room and massaging my neck is the best way I have found for getting rid of them, unfortunately they rarely occur when I am home so closing my eyes and doing deep mindful breathing exercises is the next best thing. Little bit late to this - but I too get migraines. I put it down to strenuous exercise. It generally follows the following criteria:\nA) I have put too much pressure on my lower back where I have a large Dural Ectasia (running, planks, sir ups, stair climbing worst for this)\nOr\nB) Too much pressure built up in my neck from not pacing myself gradually with exercises (swimming).", "Just found this subreddit!

It takes a while to meet a specialist here and so I have not been able to find out how Marfans may affect the surgery or complications. \n\nThank You! I just got diagnosed with a hiatal hernia as well, but after speaking with my doctor about the after effects of surgery I have decided to try medication treatment and change of eating habits first before going forth with it. My husband has one as well, and is currently having hellacious stomach issues, which I suspect are due to the hernia/exacerbation of the hernia. Interesting that this seems to be a somewhat common issue.

Ds and Fs were the best i could must at times. just before my 13th birthday i have back surgery. the lower back was fused with bone from my hip and the rest of the my back was reinforced with two rodes. top of my hips to the top of my shoulder blades. when i was 18 i had surgery on my heart. i loved it when people asked \"how did the heart surgery go?\" umm well i died. thee end! lol ive had surgery on both my eyes to replace the lenses. this has changed things so much. i can walk around the house with out glasses on!\n\nwhen i was 19 i applied for social security disabiliy. i was denied 5 times over 7 years. i finally got the help of a third party company that came along with me to places of work and watched me as i worked. they saw i would work hard but after a few hours i would start to slow down. my mind started to miss details. overall i would start to shut down. with this companies help the judge ruled right in front of me saying \"do to fatigue, joint pain, and general health keeping you from working. i hear by rule in your favor\" at that point i just broke down crying. i finally had income. i could pay rent, buy food, pay my bills, and still have money left over for a hobby. when i first apply for SSI my father said \"when you get this. you will be able to do things.\" i know that is not a big statement but to me i knew what it ment. now here i am. its been almost 4 years since i got on SSI and i have a lot going on in my life.\n\ni volunteer drive for those who cannot drive themselves. because they cannot drive and are on SSI.

(Yes he was very much not planned but i love him to death) I am eager to learn as much as i can about it to help him. \n\nI was wondering what where your thoughts when you found out your child has marfans? How did you explain it to them? Any other advice on what i should be careful with or keep a close eye on?

Hi hun, hope all is well, I am not a parent (21y/o f)  but I am the only 1 in my family with Marfans. The advice I would give to look out for is solely based on the weird things I did as a child that my parents were super confused about - such as sitting extremely close to the TV = I needed glasses for high myopia. - not walking right = needed leg braces for flat feet. - not eating or throwing up everything I ate = needed heart surgery to correct 3 of my valves for regurgitation. \n\nDo keep in mind we are all diff, some traits that popped up with me you might not see with another marfans individual. Best thing you can do is just keep medical tabs with his doctor! If you do that things will be okay\ud83d\ude18 \n\nIn terms of telling your son he has marfans, I would say u are on an easier path as you bf has marfs, it might make it easier as your son wont feel alone. Personally I found out when I was maybe 10, didint really affect me putting a name to my problems, as I always knew I was different- spending a lot of ur childhood in the hospital will do that ahahah. Either way best of luck!! Xoxo He seems to be doing well, he does sit close to the tv sometimes but not all the time. And he eats like a bottomless pit lol. Im sure things will change as he gets older. My bfs side has not needed any heart surgery so im hoping for the best. It seems to deminish in severity every generation, thank you for the reply! I suggest you join the Marfan Syndrome private group on Facebook and ask your question there (I know FB sucks, but it is good for some things). It is by far the biggest online community for people with Marfan syndrome and users are on average quite a bit older than your typical redditor (late teens, early twenties), so they will be better equipped to help you on this particular matter (or any matter relating to the condition, really). But i am in my early 20s :( lol okay i didnt know there was a fb group. Thanks hommie. Hey, me and one of my kiddos have marfan's (as well as my brother and dad). Welcome to the group! My son is 4 and we are doing ankle braces, glasses and losartan right now, although it is hard to be consistent about the glasses and medication. He is bigger than his brother who is two years older than him. I do not know if the difference is generational, but there have been a lot of changes to therapy that help with quality of life and reducing procedures. The FB group can be really good, I personally got sick of how public it was and how many folks came in asking for diagnosis. They have a marfan's Monday where everyone posts pictures of them and their kids, and I miss the normalization of the marfanoid body type. Over all I think this is a healthier group.

I am in the process of being diagnosed with Marfans. My doctor said I am a likely candidate due to my height, weight, flexibility, scoliosis and frequent chest pains. I am also having issues with my blood vessels, like they are rupturing in some places but no one really knows why. \n\nI have been reading up on it and there is a 50% chance my son could have it (if I do actually had it myself) He is 3 in a few weeks but I am not sure what age symptoms start showing. Would he already have physical symptoms like long limbs or scoliosis? I cant tell if he has pectus excavatum but I only have that very slightly. \n\nWe are also not at a point where he could communicate to me what he is feeling physically so I can only go by what I can see right now. \n\nI know I should probably get my own diagnosis sorted first but I worry more about him than \nmyself. And things tend to be long winded with the NHS. I am currently waiting for a cardiology appointment to come through to investigate a heart murmur that was picked up by a rheumatologist. You can get genetic testing done which is the easiest way with your son (since visible signs may be hard to detect at such a young age). I am the only one in my family with marfans and when I was young my parents decided to get the whole family genetically tested. Hence we figured i got the sporadic gene. Living in the UK atm so I deff understand NHS being sluggish hope all goes well! Xx Do not know about the NHS, but I would hope that since 1) you are being diagnosed 2) it is genetic and 3) the genetic test is pretty straight forward that the NHS would not make it *to* difficult.\n\nWhile there is a lot of variability in severity and presentation, with all the usual checkups at his age, I imagine that if there was a problematic symptom (ie: severe heart murmur), someone would have caught it, marf diagnosis or not.  At his age, the diagnosis is more important to start monitoring, there is usually not symptoms that require intervention (although it is possible).  I am not sure at what age they like to do a pectus correction but it sounds like that may not be a major concern.\n\nSo I would agree with prioritizing:  \"apply oxygen mask to self before assisting others\" and all that.  Especially there is a few connective tissue things with similar presentation, you will have a lot of knowledge in your noggin when it comes to navigating things with your son.\n\nAlso, if no one has brought it up, you should be aware that many connective tissue disorders can put mom in the \"high risk\" category during pregnancy; being pregnant is *hell* on your heart.  Not knowing your family plans, its probably advisable to avoid trying for another until you at least get sorted, but at minimum you should be aware of the risks. (I hope I managed to phrase that with the proper respect). I was diagnosed at four which then was traced back to my dad. What triggered it was my dislocated lenses. Thanks! If I ever get an official diagnosis, I will ask them about it. As far as I know I am the only one in my family. Although I am looking at my Dad suspiciously since he is tall and slim with joint problems. Hmm If I do have it, I do not think it is severe, at least not compared to some of the images I have seen. So I guess if my son does have it, it probably would not be obvious yet. \n\nAnd I agree on the pregnancy thing, I am one and done but my heart hurt a lot when I was pregnant. I had an ECG but nothing suspicious showed up. That sounds painful. I take it your Dad was diagnosed later in life? I was 4 and he was 32. He was much less affected than me. Eg I had scoliosis surgery, heart surgery at age 20, multiple retina detachments, etc. \n\nHe had heart surgery at about 50 and died at 59 after not taking care of himself. My kiddo is a brand new 11 (5' 2\" and 120 lbs, with mens size 10 shoes), and we are just now going to a geneticist to see whether he could have marfan syndrome. (so, technically, he has not been diagnosed). I am interested to see other responses on here. But, I will tell you what our experience has been (with the very critical caveat that we have not been diagnosed yet.)\n\nMy kiddo was 5 weeks preemie, but quite large for being so early (19 in, 6 lb 5 oz). He grew fast - I am pretty sure we skipped the whole size for 1-3 months - and kept growing. At 12 months, he was wearing 24 month clothes. We had to buy a special stroller because he was too big for the one we started with. We had to buy the top of the line carseat to get one big enough and with the 5-point harness he still needed. He needed nighttime feedings until he was almost 3 - because he was growing A LOT. My mom commented that she worried he had Marfan or something else, but we dismissed her (at the time) because there are plenty of big kids, and he did not have any other obvious symptoms, and he is definitely not slender - he has a body type more like a football player. \n\nHe needed to get glasses for fairly severe astigmatism when he was 3. When he started kindergarten, he was the size of a typical 2nd grader. Because he also has a number of different learning disabilities and other challenges, we started seeing an occupational therapist (for developmental coordination disorder, including big handwriting problems), who commented on how hypermobile his joints were. I filed that away, and he continued to grow. Until 2nd grade he was in the 97-99th percentile for height. We had a brief but significant setback in growth rate while we adjusted to ADHD medication, so now he is generally 95-97th percentile.\n\nThis year, I noticed that his flat feet are not just flat feet, but his ankle collapses in a bit. It seems like his hands and feet are stretching out more. When I measured his wingspan, it exceeded his height. Given all of these - I asked the pediatrician, and we decided to talk to the geneticist, just in case. Before recently, though, I preferred to see the \"horse\" (my kid is just a big kid) instead of the \"zebra\" (my kid has Marfan). Sorry, one more thing - it seems that having marfan impact your health as early as 3 is much less common, based on what I have read. I would find that very reassuring, in your position - so hopefully you do, too I got diagnosed when I was about your son's age. I was starting to learn how to read and I had to bury my face in the books, they found out I had severe miopia and subluxated lens ( dislocated lens, also, it does not hurt at all! it is just that the lens inside your eye is out of position/ loose because the ligaments that should hold it in place are weaker. If your son regularly tilts his head while trying to see things it can be a sign he has it. The head tilts moves the lens inside the eye so the vision focuses better in certain positions).\n\nMy suggestion is the same as most of the replies, figure out your diagnosis first, maybe check his heart and eyes , correcting his vision with glasses if needed while he is young is important because his optic nerve is still growing!\n\nGood luck with everything! 6 months. Thanks to a well observing consultation doctor you frequent when you have a newborn. I knew the moment she was born. She had long toes and fingers, and was very long. I think we started her on meds around 2 years old. I am 24 years old. An older ER doctor suggested it when I went in for something completely unrelated, started looking at my hands, etc.   \n\n\nAll my doctors pretty much know that I have Marfans, but they want the genetic testing done. My availability to schedule has been on hold for a year, because the geneticists are \"backed up\" or something like that. USA btw. I was monitored since I was very young. My mom had it and I was always tall for my age with skinny long limb (all my school class pictures always looked super weird, I hated it). I did not get a definitive diagnosis until I was 13 though when I started showing cardiac issues. \n\nReiterating what the others are saying and get your diagnosis first then go from there. There are other syndromes similar to Marfan\u2019s after all. I also have a child who looks two years older height-wise. She seems to fall more often than other kids. She had a murmur at birth. It was diagnosed as VSD, and we were told it had gotten better on its own. And her myopia was already detectable at age 2. Neither of us has the official diagnosis yet. Awaiting the genetic testing appointment in July.", "In our case, it is normal-sized people. ", "Hello! So this is my first ever reddit post, so apologies if I do not follow proper reddit etiquette.\n\nI found myself up randomly the other night and was wondering if there was a subreddit for people with marfan's, and there sure is. I spent hours reading through posts from various age ranges. I am a 29 yo female who was diagnosed when I was just a few months old. I do not know what life is like without marfan's. Ever since I was a little kid they were monitoring something. First it was my scoliosis, then my aorta. I had my spine fused when I was just about 10 years old. Thankfully the human brain is resilient and I can say happily that I managed to forget a lot of that horrible 3 surgery process. Just last year it finally came time to have surgery on my heart. I almost had surgery when I was 17 years old, but something odd happened, not totally explainable, and I was pushed back into the waiting line.\n\nBeing a teenager with marfan's was certainly a difficult task. I think one of the hardest things was that I was the only one. I knew that there were obviously others out there, but I never met anyone else like me. Briefly I met one older boy when I was in the hospital when I was 10, but we never kept in touch. I think that was one of the biggest things that could have made the awkward time of puberty easier, was having someone else to talk to about it.\n\nI read a lot of posts from those younger with marfan's and I can feel a lot of the same things I went through. Due to having marfan's I developed depression and anxiety throughout most of my life. I started struggling with chronic pain when I was only 15, and that is what kicked off the a lot of my mental struggles. Looking back, I would not blame anyone in my shoes, it was rough. I wanted to come on here to say that it does get better though. I learned to embrace who I am and I now wear my scar on my chest like a medal of honor. I battled through it, and I finally get to be in a place were there is no anticipation, no middle of the night anxiety that a momentary odd heart beat was \"it\".\n\nI wanted to come here and reach out a virtual hand. If you ever need a fellow marfan's beholder to talk to, I am happy to listen. I am no doctor, but I have certainly been through the ringer and can tell you what I did to deal with this that and the other. I want everyone, young and old, out there to know that you are amazing for who you are. Happy to have you here. welcome!! glad to have you here :)) Pleasure to have you ! Good to have more ppl in the community ! (: Thanks for sharing. I am not a Marfan 'patient', but the father of a 14 year old who *has it*. Although he is doing great, there is some struggles there around the corner. I hope one day he will find comfort in writing on non-Dutch forums and finds his way to others, like you could not. \n\nTo be honest, i actually never checked for him if there are others in my neighbourhood who have Marfan.\n\nAnyway, nice to see yo uhere, rock on! Thank you. I might take you up on your offer. Dad of a 14 year old daughter with Marfans here.  The comment about depression hit home for me.  My kiddos got chronic pain and it is the worst thing for her mental health.  Glad to know that it is not uncommon and your post helps bring awareness Can i ask how they diagnosed you as a baby? i have just had one and he has very long fingers already... I had a pretty significant heart murmur. When I was a baby, there was no test yet for it, but if you are concerned I know there is a DNA test they can do. Unfortunately, from what I have read pain is pretty common. When I was a kid I saw a pain management doctor on the pediatric side, and it really helped to manage it. I also see one now as an adult and for the most part I am pretty pain free. I have a weird question. Since it affects our chests,did it affect your boobs? And if so, were you self conscious about it?\n\nI am not trying to be creepy, I am just curious because I am a guy and I was really self conscious about not having any pectoral muscle, and, of course, not looking normal. Mine was pushed out too.\n\nI got surgery, my chest looks fine now. Been starting to get some muscle on me too and it looks fine.\n\nThank you for answering, I just wanted to know.", "marfans ", "Had my echocardiogram today - Aortic Aneurysm has not grown in over 6 months, meds seem to be working!

I am just curious. There is no such thing as \"just a carrier\" of marfan syndrome, either you have it or you do not, and the disease does not discriminate by demographic.", "Pregnancy Any of you gone through pregnancy? How was your experience? Any problems with aorta?\n\nMy aorta right now is about 3.9 cm in one place and 4.1 cm in another. I am 5 and a half months pregnant. My cardiologist just called me and told me she will see me May 7th ( Had a visit planned for next week). She saw me December. Should I see a cardiologist sooner?\n\nBefore getting pregnant I got a OK from two cardiologists. But now I feel left alone. I have read that Marfan pregnancy should be considered a high risk pregnancy. But my doctors does not seem to care as much. \n Marfans is not a very clear cut condition. My mother had it n had me. She did not even know she had it n she had me. I feel that if your doctor say so you should be okay. I think 4.5 to 5 is Where things get iffy. But a 4.1 is still a good bit away from worry. And I do not know if that is a 4.1 with the weird rub thing but if you get an MRI done , it is a lot more precise on your actual size  No, but I have been told by three different doctors (OB, cardiologist and neurosurgeon) not to get pregnant. \n\nI also have an extremely unusually large dural ectasia though, my spine is extremely fragile.  Undiagnosed, my mother had *six* of us, though she started young.  \n(She had me at 22; she had the youngest of my sibs at 36.)\n\nShe had no problems, besides some uterine bleeding during the sixth pregnancy, which frankly was not a surprise given that it was her sixth!\n\nHer little sister had it, and (undiagnosed, and as a HEAVY smoker and occasional drug user) had two kids, fifteen years apart, and both of those pregnancies went great as well.  \n The Marfan Facebook group is a good place for this as it is a common topic. Basically, at 4.5 is when you start looking at surgery. So closer follow up is probably warranted, plus doing a c-section and anything else to prevent strain on your aorta.  Sorry to go off track, but how does your back feel usually? Any spine deformities from the dural extasia? How do you test for this? Was it a MRI?  Er, awful. It hurts a lot, though I also have degenerative disc disease and scoliosis. Nothing physically on the outside if you are wondering that, but, I am in a minority of patients who has acquired chiari malformation rather than congenital because of damage due to the dural ectasia. My lower spine is pulling my cerebellum downward, but fixing it is extremely risky. Both DE and chiari cause headaches, and chiari causes loss of balance. The whole internal mess of my spine is completely fucked. \n\nIt was found inadvertently during a surgery and confirmed via MRI. For a normal patient it could be easily confirmed via MRI, even if the dural sac is smaller, like it normally is.  Thank you that was very insightful. I am sorry you have to live with that. ", "What ethnicity are you guys ? I am Mexican and from southern United States and was diagnosed when I was 5. I know this syndrome is genetic and also in some cases can show up out of no where. However I have always been curious if some people or places get marfans more than others. I am British but my family is from pakistan European here. Interesting question! It comes down through the Norwegian branch of my family. Thank you ! What is weird for me is that both sides of my family have at least one case so I might have it from both Cold ass honky That is interesting ! My family is almost entirely native to mexico , I know this because another genetic marker (for native Americans) is 3 roots in your tooth rather than one. However my mother\u2019s side has a little Spaniard because some of my grandmas brothers and sisters had blue eyes and blonde hair I do not know how accurate this is but my doctor told me that having both of the gamets carrying FBN1 mutations is mostly incompatible with life. Also Marfan does not \"skip\" generations\" so one of your parents must have it? I am from Brazil so I have a little bit of native South American,  African and European mixed in. That is interesting , I am tall as heck and have some issues n obvious signs but believed because I \u201ccould\u201d have both sides with it that It did not affect me \u201cas bad\u201d. However my mom has it, found out same day I did when I was 5. However my dads sister had a kid and he was diagnosed with it too. So maybe her husband is a candidate but it definitely makes you think of the odds ! It was just a theory I had though , it is always hard finding info on marfans and the possibilities I forgot the mention that the significance is that my grandma and grandma , both blessed to be with me still, both do not have it. And for my cousin , his mom and dad both do not have it. So it is just me my mom and him with no other linkage Irish, Welsh, English, some tiny fraction Cherokee. Red hair, blue/grey/green eyes, pale but do not really freckle. American, but the Marf gene comes from the Greek immigrant part of my family. Somewhere in central asia .. afghan \ud83d\udcab thing is, lots of immigrants/1st gen people do not get their health looked at that closely. Not so much bc of the system, but bc it is common that we \u201cignore \u201c stuff and do not bring it up to doctors. It makes sense, bc depending on where you are from, there may be no doctors in your area so you have to \u201cignore\u201d potential problem. The amount of times I should have gotten something checked out but my mom was like \u201cYOU ARE FINE.\u201d \ud83d\ude02 I do not blame her, she comes from the mountains. Not a single coffee shop let alone doctor. I probably would not be tested for marfan etc if it were not for a neurologist who saw me for an arm injury to refer me to genetics bc of how i looked and how I would bend. Lol. So perhaps many more people of different ethnicities have it but they do not know! I was born in Miami, FL but my parents are from\nNicaragua. Indian but I did not get marfan's genetically I do not know about the likelihood of having it, but I do believe ethnicity has an effect on how different symptoms manifest. Hopefully we will know more about it with more research in future Indian here too, suspected Marfan's. May I ask how tall you are/ what major symptoms you have? I have always wondered if Marfan's presents differently in Indians Ive considered similar. The variation in the syndrome is interesting  \n\n \n\nThese two papers suggest that Asian populations with Marfan, compared to Caucasian/European populations with Marfan, had lower rates of ectopia lentis and were less skeletally 'Marfanoid\" but had higher rates of aortic dissection (\"possibly related to underdiagnosis of MFS\" in Asian populations.)  \n\nInteresting. Your suspicion definitely seems likely. Have you read these papers? I hope more research is done too. Are you Jewish African American, I am a genetic mutation only one in my family to have it I am the only person who has it in my family, I am American but my heritage is Jewish + mostly caucasian/white heritage (Danish, Irish, German)", "How is a genetic test done? How will you be checked for genetic test? And also should you have your parents checked?\n\nAlso. Is it 100% sure if you have al of the symptoms? It is just a simple blood test. Usually, they will not test everyone at once so as to save some resources and unnecessary testing. They will test the most likely person to have it, then, if positive, test his/her parents and siblings. If one of the parent tests positive, they will then test *his* parents and siblings, and so on. \n\nIn addition to the blood test, the geneticist will usually do a quick review of your symptoms such as checking if you have got scoliosis, your height, your arm-span to height ratio, etc. Alright. But will they be 100% sure after the blood test? Even though I am not fully developed? I am 17 Around 5-10% of people with Marfan will not have a positive genetic test but still have the syndrome. So it cannot completely rule it out, but it is the best we have got. The remaining % is because we still have not found *all* the mutations that can cause it, and maybe there is some other genetic disorder with similar symptoms we do not know yet, etc. They can still be diagnosed if they have enough symptoms related to it + specific aortic and/or eye issues.\n\nYour age can influence the presentation of your symptoms, but it will not change the genetic test, so you will know even if you are 17. Yes it is to do with ur genetics not what can be seen or experienced thru symptoms. Keep in mind some people have no symptoms or severe visual traits) and still have marfans (theres a spectrum) That is not cool at all to get a negative test and still have it. But there is more tests is not there? That can tell if you 100% have it No.  Then it is clinical opinion of specific doctor or genetist But it is in really rare cases that it shows negative and you have it right? Yup. Anyway, if you test negative and do not have any aortic involvement yet, I would not worry too much. Simple blood test. We got our son's results back in around 3 months. Have not perused testing my husband or me because we have zero family history of sudden cardiac events on either side and we neither one show physical signs. So. No one has it in your family? honestly- like /u/SpacePontif  said... if you are negative on genetics truly what mattered and really only matters is that they catch any aortic dilation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am a negative on marfans..  I meet Ehlers danlos hypermobile type but that has no genetics and the particular geneticist did not diagnose me with anything except what I came with (undifferentiated connective tissue disorder)..  But I have all the fucked up joints and a couple surgeries needed, one done and one aortic aneurysm and body type not too uncommon for our kind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll that mattered then and now is the systemic care... in this case my heart monitoring and eventually my best, safe heart surgery in the future--- but not every connective tissue patient has this issue... while the reason it is so important to catch 'most' connective tissue patients' disorders is to hopefully catch exactly that kind of vascular and particularly aortic involvement. Alright. So what do you recommend me to? Get a genetic and physical exam. If the genetic comes back negative, what should I do then? My wrists are hyper mobile. But not my legs. \n\nCould it be a good idea to get a scan of the heart when I am like 20-22? I am 17 currently If you are worried about having a connective tissue disorder why would you wait three years to check your heart? Ask your parents to take you to a general practitioner and tell them all your worries, they will most likely ask you to visit a cardiologist and have an ultrasound exam to see if you have any anomalies on your heart. Sometimes that is how things are, spontaneous mutation and all. So, I think you are too focused on the \" 100% sure \" aspect, that is not how most things in health sciences work. The body is a complex system and a lot of different things can influence how it works.\nWe do not know exactly every mutation or Gene combination or epigenetics that causes every connective tissue disorder. We know about the presentations and the possible risks, so if you have multiple symptoms but still have a negative test that does not mean you should not pay attention for possible complications.\nThe best thing you can do talk to a doctor and ask them everything that worries you, they should be able to answer your question and give you some clarity. Honestly, genetics test or not-- if your arms are longer than your height, even Elementary age children requiring a simple physical for sports are denied until one gets an echocardiogram (it is an ultrasound like pregnant women but for your heart).  \n\nSo, genetics yes or no on testing or result... but talk to your doctor about seeing a cardiologist, they will make an appointment or help you along and a cardiologist would need to do a couple minutes with an ultrasound for an echocardiogram.  If they find something it would be likely not ready for surgery and simply mean you monitor it for years now and then with more echocardiograms as well as CT scans with contrast injected.  None of this is bad, it is just bad to NOT catch and monitor these things to eventually intercede with surgery. My son has it. 25% of all cases are believed to be spontaneous mutation. He now has a 50% chance of passing it on to his children.", "About the thumb test So im 23 year old male, and im tall (6'5) and pretty skinny. I have also narrow wrists. So about the thumb test, i can easily move my thumb over the palm, but it doesnt feel quite right. It doesnt feel really painful but still. I mean it is easy to just touch pinky finger with thumb and then lower it or just stretch the thumb over the palm, but if im normally closing my fist without knowing to stretch the thumb it stays inside the fist. If someone understanded :D. I cannot do this at all, but I have Marfans. Yeah,  that cant be the quaranteed method to diagnose. I think also that many people can do the thumb and wrist test altough they dont have Marfans. That doesnt mean i wouldnt be paranoided to have it myself. Is it uncommon to get diagnosed at older age? I dont now live like I think I would if I knew I have heart condition. I drink and party occasionally like most of my age group and use nicotine products like snus. Also weekly I do heavy exercise sports. I have also been in army which is mandatory in my country and got healthy papers from there. Althought I dont remember that the health tests were precise, like ekg or anything. You probably do not have it but I am not a doctor and I do not know you. It should feel all natural.

The only 100% sure for me test of course if you do not have family background of that disease is the genetic test. Yeah thanks for the info, how about the flat feet? Are they always present in Marfan? I dont have them, pronated feet yes a bit, but not flat. You should talk to your doctor and try to get an appointment with genetic. I have marfan and I am not too tall, no flat feet, no scoliosis. But many other traits that added together make my doctors positive I have it. Doing my blood test in a few months. Will know for sure.  Symptoms vary, that is why a lot of people think they have it. Do you have family history of that disease? Nah no family history from what i know, also I dont have eyeglasses. Theres also no way I could touch my feet when standing up lol. I have also been in army few years ago, but never have scanned EKG or anything like that. Maybe (and most likely) im just paranoided to have since I just recently find this syndrome, and im tall and lanky and saw those people who died because undiagnosed. And they looked like \"normal\". Many people with Marfan seem to look like they could be easily diagnosed, no offence by any means. Also I have long looking hands, but arm span is close to same as my height, maybe 1-4cm longer. Kind Of long looking face. But like G-Eazy said \"my lanky ass dont even go to the gym\". Still  I do couple times a week heavy exercise sports.

Here is my story:\n\nI have worked 2 years as a metal sheet worker, where I used a grinder above my head to grind down welds. I did not notice any problem with my collarbones then.\n\nThen, I started with weight lifting. I started doing the military press where you lift the bar above the head. After some time, I noticed my collarbones did pop in and out (subluxation), when I did this excersice. I went to the doctor, and she suspected Marfans Syndrome or Ehler Danlos. I underwent eckocardiogram, physical exam of my body etc. and wanted to send me to a genetic test. The genetics declined the appointment because there was not enough basis to complete a genetic test because its expensive. And I have not got any real answer of why my collarbones are popping like they do. I have not had any injuries as far as I can tell, other than the one time I landed with my whole body weight on my arm, cause I slipped and broke a bone in my hand, but that is it.\n\nDoes anyone here have any thoughts they will share on my case? Like, why is my collarbones like this and who should I talk to? Im still afraid I could have Marfans or EDS. I have some physical features for marfans but no problems with my eyes or hearth/lungs as I have checked them.. So, first and foremost, do not get to hung up on the name (or lack there of).  If you are getting your heart looked at, etc, and getting the \"OK\" that is best.  While a diagnosis of Marfan's or EDS may guide treatment (because it suggests what things to monitor) it is not a cure all.  Even if you had a diagnosis, you would still likely wind up with a bunch of ambiguous testing.  A \"syndrome\" is just a collection of symptoms that generally present together (and therefore suggest a treatment/monitoring).  The point is you have issues you need addressed.  You got the all clear for some other issues but you still need your damn collar bone addressed!\n\nRegarding your collar bone:  I *have* marfans, and have some popping out (possibly due to past surgery) and my docs are *still* less than helpful about it lol.  What is annoying is I cannot even get a strieght answer on \"is this ok or am I injuring further?\".\n\nI would ask your doc for a physical therapy referral.  I am still on this path, so I do not have it fully figured out, but from what I can tell PT docs are the \"is it supposed to click?  Is it supposed to jump out?  Are there exercises I can do to make it NOT do that?\".  But none of my docs made that connection of their own accord.  They can often be focused on the \"show stopper\" issues as opposed to the \"this is annoying/causing issues in my life and work\".\n\nLast, there may be surgical options, but I would strongly encourage you to try PT first.  Docs can be quick to recommend these quasi-elective surgeries, not out of some conspiracy (although it IS the backbone of the medical industry).  However, in my experience, once you start poking around in there it is never *quite* the same.  The benefits can be incredible, but if they can be achieved through some PT you are likely far better off.  I am not a doctor and would defer to their opinion (some physical things are progressive and do in fact benefit from early intervention), but definitely get a few opinions before getting the knife. 29, m, 185, 6'3\"\n\nMarfans \nBodybuilder\nShattered my right collarbone at 16, had a rod till i was 18. \nSupervisor of the largest metal distributor in the SE. \n\nWhat exacty is your question? I just got my genetic test confirmed yesterday for marfans. The bodybuilding is what caught it, after three years the connective tissue in my back, neck and arms is so damaged i havent been able to move well, or lift the last six months.\n\nAre you asking if marfans and popping collarbones is normal? Dude, i can walk through the grocecy store and mine pop in and out of socket. I can wake up and have to relocate my whole shoulder back in place. My last day of lifting, the day before i went to the dr. I did a 255 bench and my whole left shoulder blade was collasped into my back for a week. I cant tell you if its nornal, or if its marfan related, or if its bodybuilding related. My doctor said marfars is like your insides are coming unglued, and that is what my daily life feels like tho. And its heart breaking to me that lifting makes this sooo much worse, still figuring out my way through that. Edit: also slipped at 17, broke my right hand like yourself, bone never healed (proably marfans related) 27 had to have the bone surgically removed, due to it was dead and speading to the other bones in my hand. Thanks for your story! I am just curious if the collarbone can have something to do with marfans or not tbh, since it pops in and out or if its due to something else.. I understand you cannot answer that for me :) I see. Thanks for clarifying the term syndrome for me!\n\nAnyways, I asked the doctor if I ever needed echocardiogram again, like check it yearly. But she said no, I didnt need that. And they didnt suspect any connective tissue disorder, because if they had suspected it, they had sent me to a genetic test. My problem is trust, I just feel so insecure, and if the doctors are wrong.. because I dont have any answer to why my collarbone pops in and out. My other doctor said that its common to have hypermobile joints, and be born with that without having a connective tissue disorder. The doctor said that she wouldnt recommend surgery in that place. You bet!  I have said it here before, but in this day in age we are used to associating disease with a specific cause.  X bacteria, Y gene screwup, etc.  But medicine was practiced successfully for almost all of it is existence clinically.  It was \"when I see these 5 things together, and do X, I know Y will happen and should treat.  When I see 3/5 of these things together, maybe not\".\n\nI work with fabricators a lot, and you mentioned grinding down welds.  You know when you are building something to the drawing and you go \"... that is not going to work the way they think it is\".  That is doctors.  They are more shop folks than engineers, even though we think of them that way because of the education.  But unlike you, they cannot look at a weld, because *you* are the part; you have to tell them what is going on.\n\nMy point is two fold: \n\n1) it is good you got your critical systems checked, and absolutely check in if you think you have got symptoms of heart issues, etc.\n\n2) Docs are over worked and can gloss over stuff that probably wont kill you.  Be your own advocate for PT.  Marf or no marf, there is probably stuff you can do address your collar bone, or at least make you rest a little easier going \"yeah, it does that sometimes, it is annoying but is not leading to long term damage\". if they preformed an echocardiogram and there were no irregularities then that in it self is good concrete data you can trust! If they do not think you need yearly echos I would not be too concerned. Also, as someone with heart problems I can tell you, I can feel noticeable symptoms that my heart is not working properly. If you start getting symptoms such as excess fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain, etc. then definitely go back to the doctor! But until then rest assured it sounds like you are all good (: Sorry for lurking and replying to old comments but I feel this\u2026literally. \n\nEarly 30s M Tn 240lb 6\u20197 sz 16 shoe. \n\nDiagnosed marf at age 6\n\nI too am dealing with joints that have destroyed themselves. Could be due to activities in the younger years. (Kick boxing. Weight room. Moto. Mtn biking) but as time goes on its getting worse I literally have to pop my knees before I can get out of bed/off the couch/walk. My collarbones are trashed. No direct injury. Just noticed mid teens my collarbone would dislocate. Now both sides are gone since having valve/root replacement and sternum being wired up back to \u201cnormal\u201d.\nI am finding myself constantly in pain having to \u201cpop\u201d not just knuckles. Elbows. Knees . Hip. wrists now spine.  I can lock fingers behind my back.  Take a deep breath and stretch and push it forward and pop my back and that helps when I stand.  It gets very old being early 30s and feeling early 80s.in pain but alive. I work at a large scale forge shop locally. constantly wondering wtf I am doing there. Explaining to grown men why I limp and how my hip is needing replaced and I am only 32.. I can strangely do the same with popping my back and you are the only other person I have ever heard capable of that. I do not have any of the definable marf features tho. I am only 6'3\", size 12 shoe, slight but nothing crazy \"bird\" chest, and I can build muscle pretty effectively. My test was inconclusive, but my GP insists on Marfans Syndrome and this always makes me wonder if she is correct. I feel like all my issues come from major inflammation flare ups like fibro or ra. Both which run in my family. I have had pneumonia every other month since Nov 19', this and my back pain is what led to the marf diagnosis at age 29. Xray tech said yesterday I have extremely long lungs tho. Cardiologist says no marfans, GP insists it is and I am just stuck in the middle waiting on someone to treat something. Lol it is been 18 months since I first went to the doctor with my issues. Nada. My collarbones pop in and out like you described, and a chiropractor told me to look into prolotherapy for it, because I would get arthritis from it. One of them is shorter than the other, so, I am not even sure how often it happens cause I cannot feel it when it does. Prolo are injections to strengthen the tendons in that area. But if you are a Marfan, I do not know if that would work or not. The chiro stated I would get arthritis in that joint if I did not address it, but I have got other health issues from Marfan's to deal with, and I suggest you get the genetic testing done to be sure.", "I found a Marfans hand signs graphic on Facebook\u2026 currently diagnosed with a generic hyper mobility spectrum disorder from my GP, but wondering if I should push for more testing.

Interesting!  Who was interpreting the test results?  \"Uncertain significance\" might just mean that there is not definitive research in the clinical sense (the paper you referenced is pretty new as these things go).\n\nAlso out of curiosity, who did your micro-array?  I have wanted to get one done, but could never really justify it because managing my condition like traditional marfans covered all the important stuff (namely heart monitoring), but I have a degree in biochemistry and it kind of kills me not knowing my specific mutation! I find it interesting because it is 2 genes back from chromosome 15, which causes Marfan Syndrome. The mutations they are talking about in the paper you posted are at 17p13.3, which is on chromosome 17.  Marf is associated with FBN1 (15q21.1, chromosome 15).  So it is not quite \"two genes back\" but it is crazy interesting the overlap in presentation!\n\nNow you are really convincing me to get an array done, lol.", "Can you have marfan without hypermobile fingers?

Firstly, I am not sure whether I have or not. But I have pectus excavatum and scoliosis. My hands are big and My wrist is thin. My arms are long. (I am not sure about this, It is just my opinion.) My face is a little narrow as well. I am wearing glasses as well due to myopic and astigmatism\n\nMy hands:\n\n(\n\nSecondly, I have to mention this. My scoliosis is not genetic. My father has no scoliosis at all. Not to mention he has no heart problem. He is 50 years old right now. He did never have a heart attack or something. My scoliosis was caused by sitting disease. I am sure about this because I used to sit a lot and I did not care about my sit position. I have approximately 15 decree scoliosis although that.\n\nI am afraid of going to the doctor due to they will tell me that I have Marfan. But every day I feel like a freak. I am trying to hide my hands from everyone. Sometimes I want to die. I do not want to live with this curse.\n\nI might have made mistakes. My English is not well, I am still learning. Sorry for my mistakes if I did. I think the best thing would probably be to speak to a doctor about your concerns; there is just no way to diagnose someone over the internet, especially since we are not doctors and cannot give medical advice. Besides that, Marfan is a variable-expression disorder, meaning that it presents itself differently in everyone; there is no one way a person with Marfan looks, so there is every chance that you are simply built on the lankier side. That said, if you are having feelings that you wish you were dead, that is an emergency, and I would strongly suggest seeking medical help as soon as you possibly can. Your wrist is definitely thin, but your hands do not seem to big (to me at least). How tall and how old are you if that is not too much to ask? What is your BMI?\n\nJust so you know, plenty of people have pectus excavatum and scoliosis. It does not always mean they have Marfans. Besides, Marfan syndrome is not always genetic, it can be a spontaneous mutation.\n\nI understand why you are afraid of going to the doctor, but going there is the best way to see whether or not you have Marfan syndrome. If you do, you will get all the treatments and medecine your body needs in order to keep functionning this way even 30 years from now. Marfans are at a high risk of aortic dissection and this is definitely not laughing matter. Please take care of yourself. It is much more likely that you are a nearsighted thin person with scoliosis than you have marfan syndrome with no family history. People with MFS are few and far between, and most of us inherit it. \n\nIf you are really, truly concerned, you do need to stop googling things and talk to a doctor. Always remember there is other connective tissue disorders OR it is possible to have some traits of a disorder, without actually having it. If you are concerned, talk to a doctor. Nobody online can tell you what you do or do not have. Only a medical professional can diagnose you. But if you suspect you have Marfan's, you absolutely need to ask a doctor because of the heart complications that may come with it. But none of us can tell you.", "Bunions and thoughts on corrective surgery? I saw a doctor awhile ago about my bunions and hammer toes and the pain that I have because of them, and the general consensus was that I should avoid having surgery for as long as possible because they would have to fuse the joints to try to prevent them from stretching and the bone from reverting back to bunion status. So, I was just wondering if anybody's had bunion surgery, and their experience from it. Did they fuse joints, how has it affected your feet/pain? ", "Asking for some advice. Hi! Short health info about me before I go on with my story: \n\n- 22 years old, male.\n- 188 cm(6'2\") and 88kg(194 pounds).\n- Had three spontaneous lung collapses(pneumothorax, two in the right lung and one in the left) in the past four years. Pleurodesis surgery on the right lung. \n- I am nearsighted, more so in the left eye.\n- I easily get out of breath/very bad fatigue but I am very active. \n\nStory: \n\nI have noticed during the last year or so that I get some serious heart palpitations and racing heart beats while laying down on my right side in bed. And two days ago I decided to use the helpful tool Google to see why. The first thing that caught my eye was Marfan syndrome. Do you know why? Well, I remember talking with my doctor about it after my third pneumothorax. I believe it was mentioned briefly and they never actually checked me for the disorder. \nSo now it got me all interested. I checked the symptoms and noticed that I do have few \"Marfan\" specific symptoms... like some unexplained stretch marks(never been overweight), jaw problems(especially opening my mouth fully), wrists on the thinner side, nearsightedness.

Does Marfan syndrome vary that much in symptoms? \n\n Thanks.\n\n*Edit: spelling.\n\n\n There can be significant variation in someone is symptoms. I was always told I had \"atypical Marfans\" because while I have a pretty typical marfanoid look (6'4\" ~150 lbs with long fingers and very long, thin arms) I never had eye problems and my aorta is only mildly dilated. After genetic testing they said I actually have a very closely related connective tissue disorder called Loeys-Dietz. The big cardiac problems are the same but there is some minor differences in the other problems associated with Marfans. It is a good idea to get checked and get an echocardiogram to be safe. Good luck. If your symptoms are only those listed then its unlikely that you will be diagnosed with Marfans.

I was abroad in a country without great medical facilities and thought about coming back to the UK because it was weighing on my mind and I wrote on this forum about it. Anyways, long story short, I did come back. Went a&amp;e and the doctor said 1. You have gerd (someone actually suggested this on the post I wrote, so you were right!), and 2. That I did have a lot of the signs. I went to my gp who checked me and said I had all the minor signs but I needed to be checked for the major ones, so he sent me for a heart scan and a transthoracic echocardiogram. I went to the latter today and I am so stupid I never asked the sonographer any questions. They mentioned at the beginning that I would have to wait for the results so I assumed only a doctor would be able to check it or something? Anyways when I left, I got this weird vibe like he knew there was something wrong. I wanted to ask, how have scans gone for people, did you ask questions from people who were not doctors and have they confirmed or denied anything off the record. Did the GP get back quick to discuss results if your heart was like especially damaged or even if was not since this is serious anyway.\nThank you for reading my paranoid post lol", "Can I still be non-marfan?

I also have some ligament problems with one of my clavicles, but that is the only place where I have a connective tissue problem (maybe caused by imbalances from scoliosis?). I can wrap my fingers around my wrist but I cannot do the thumb test. I have not measured my wingspan to height ratio but from what I can tell by eyeballing is that it is pretty close to 1:1. \n\nOther than that, I do not think I have any other noticable symptoms. No one in my close family has been diagnosed with either Marfan or scoliosis, however, my siblings are also tall with quite long and thin limbs (mine are the longest and the thinnest in relation to height in my family). On the systemic score scale I would estimate 3-4 points, but do not know for sure.\n\nI do not think I am particularly hypermobile anywhere (as the thumb test failed). What makes me worried in particular is how I am built.

I have been on bisoprolol since my surgery 8.5 years ago and if there is any side effect, I have not noticed it at all.

I am an 18 year old male, i was diagnosed when i was 4. I do check ups every 6 months and my aorta has been the same for many years. So my question is, will i be able to gain weight around my whole body at some time of my life because at the moment i only gain weight on my abdomen. My doctor told me that i could also go to the gym and even lift weights but with constant breaks. I have been doing it for 6 months now and the progress is little to none. I weighed 125 for about 15 years. Right before I hit my thirties I creeped up to 175. It is all in my abdomen.\n\nGranted my diet consists of mainly microwaved food and beer, so grain of salt and all that. This seems to be consistent for people with Marfan syndrome. As we get older, we accumulate weight in the abdomen. I wish I had better news for you. I think most of us have had worse news.\n\nIt is not ideal, but sometime you just have to learn to accept the things you cannot change. The truth hurts sometimes. I also have social anxiety even though some people told me am pretty idk i feel like a stick when i walk. Am also considering lens transplant to fix my eyes.

I seem to abnormally skinny, I never reached 150 in my life, not even 120, I was 110 once but it was like for a day. I try my best. I eat mostly fatty TV dinners and meat in general but I guess maybe the TV dinner stuff is probably fake and not even real meat, not sure, not to get conspiracy theorist lol. I am 24. And how tall are you? My dad and I both have Marfans and we both gained weight with age more than anything. I went from being super skinny when I was younger (19 now) to about the size of an average woman within about a year. My dad also gained most of his weight in his 20s. It is possible that you may gain weight more with age. But also my dad it is very tall (6\u20193) while I am fairly average in height (5\u20196). I do not have Marfan Syndrome, I have a medical mystery that is like Marfan Syndrome though. I talked about it before on here but basically, I have \"Marfanoid Habitus\". I am only 5'7, and even though I am farsighted and not nearsighted and do not have other Marfan traits like a dislocated lens or aortic enlargement, I have a deformed chest, long legs, long fingers, and scoliosis. I am testing for Homocystinuria and Lujan-Fryns Syndrome, apparently what I have is possibly rarer than Marfan Syndrome. Also how tall are you? I am 6'5\" (~195cm) and in high school up to the age of about 25, I never got heavier than 175lbs (~80kg). Between 25-30 I crawled up to 200lbs. Once I hit 30, it was like somebody just opened the floodgates and I was up to 260lbs before I knew it. Part of that could be the metabolism aspect of it. The other could be unrelated to marfans altogether. I had my gallbladder taken out when I was 25. I had IBS following that surgery and had to change my diet a bit to help with it. Then at age 30 I started taking beta blockers. Weight gain is common on those, but would not explain putting on 60lbs. Really what I think it comes down to is that I just was not as active as I was when I was young, get really bad sleep and have a lot of every day stress. All of those things lead to weight gain.\n\nI certainly eat a lot better than I used to. I do fast and loose CICO dieting and try to stay under about 2300kcal/day. I am only down to 230. When I was in high school, I was the guy that would eat two foot long sandwiches, whole pizzas, an entire lasagna... I was a food vacuum and it never stuck. But whatever the hell it was, it is completely gone now. In some ways I envy you, but I also completely understand where you are coming from. Just be careful when you start to notice yourself putting on weight. You are going to have a hard time putting on weight, but if you are looking to change your physical appearance, you can certainly still get \"cut\".  If your doc has cleared you for activity, keep at it.  Right now, being focused on gains, you may not be appreciating the definition you are gaining (but others will I guarantee it).  Ask your doc about rock climbing.  It is an amazing sport and the marf body type makes you a superhuman at it. Same story. Gained 50-60 pounds at 23-24 and it all went to the belly lol.

If nothing was found in the heart I would not worry too much.  When you say \"heart workups\", what tests are you referring to?\n\nI had multiple doctors do EKGs and tell me I do not have Marfan's... But that is not really a legitimate way to know.\n\nI would they did an echocardiogram though, and did not find any issues that tells you a lot more.\n\nAside from the build, hand and foot size, and pectus excavatum, do you have any other reason to think it is Marfan's? Yeah I mean if you are worried, get it checked. There is no need to keep it in your head. I was worried I have HIV for 6 months before getting tested. I do not have it, it was stupid. My aorta was normal size at 15, so I would not be too sure about that.  Be concerned-ish but do not panic.  The height weight is pretty normal for someone your age (I was like 6' 105 then).  The pectus is a little telling though.\n\nTalk to your doctor and assess.  It may be prudent to just continue monitoring your aorta. You are most probably fine. Height and weight are only a small part of the syndrome. Hell, I know a 5'2 woman who got diagnosed. Ask your doctor at your next appointment to take a look at the ( if you are worried. It is normal for teenaged boys to be tall and skinny. It is normal for them to be a little awkwardly proportioned. \n\nPectus excavatum? A little more concerning. Especially if you are doing sports.

My cousin tested positive for the same genetic mutation that causes Marfans, and no dilation.

Both in terms of how I looked and in desired outcome from going to the gym in the first place. \n\nThen I realized I did not need to look a certain way at all. I mean, be hygienic and take care of yourself of course, but I realized that being funny was WAY more effective than looks when it comes to attracting someone. And as it turns out, being funny is something you can learn to do. So drop your gym membership and sign up for acting and improv. Gain confidence in yourself. Love yourself. Laugh at life and the world will laugh with you. People want to be with others who give them joy. So make them laugh. I am telling you. It is true. Sadly such traits as confidence and being funny really only sparks emotional attraction which is behind physical attraction as a requirement for anything more than a friendship. Ive attempted emotional attraction since forever and for most people it just does not seem to make up for the physical aspect.  Im not saying you are wrong - I am just saying it more so leads to friendships rather than anything more.

Currently undiagnosed, but doctors suspect I have Marfans. I am 20 years old, 5\u20199\u201d, 117 lbs, I have scoliosis, crowded teeth, and mitral valve prolapse. No aortic enlargement thankfully.\n\nSo, what are the odds I can live a normal life? Recently, my mitral valve prolapse has been causing me so many issues. I have this annoying \u201csqueak\u201d that happens occasionally since both leaflets are prolapsing, and it makes me so anxious and causes me to be unable to function for days. I notice that anxiety makes the squeak happen more often.\n\nIt is not ready to be surgically corrected, though, as the leakage is only mild-moderate. I was thinking about asking to go on a beta blocker in hopes that it lessens the squeak.\n\nNow I am terrified I will not be able to hold a job, or get into a relationship, or have children. I am terrified about the future because this squeak makes my quality of life so poor. Is life after surgery any better, or are you constantly afraid of your repair failing??\n\nThank you! hello marfolk!! Heart conditions are scary af but nowdays the medicine is very advanced to treat our stuff. I am 20 and when I heard that I would need to go through a heart surgery I totally freaked out but after researching the procedure I realised that those are some of the safest big surgeries you could have. If you are healthy, have good docs and follow their recommendation, you do not have to worry. \nThe simptom you feel, I believe it is very unconfortable, but if your doctor says that it is still ok and it is not time for an surgery intervention, you are still totaly able to live a normal life (following your docs recommendations). If you do not feel confortable with just one cardiologists opinion, you could go to another one.\n\nCould it be that the main problem in this situation is your anxiety?  In high stressful situations it is common for people to develop chronical anxiety, panic syndrome and other stuff that have symptoms that mimic heart conditions and may cause a suffering that does not match with your physical condition. It is important to treat you mental health just as your physical.\n\nFeel free to ask about anything Normal life is totally attainable. I was diagnosed when I was just a baby, so I do not really know what life without marfan's is. I definitely had to deal with some hard scary truths while I was growing up, spinal fusion at 10, and the impending open heart surgery whenever it was to happen. The unknown was the worst part. I cannot tell you how many times I felt a little weird feeling in my chest, and then my anxiety kicked in and made is ten times worse.\n\nI have a great career in something I am passionate about. I bought my first home. I am in a loving relationship with someone who is \"normal\". I have 4 crazy high energy dogs. I have never been one to really want kids, but we live in a world where there are so many other options aside from traditional child birth (if it is not safe for you). Normal is just a word, and I have found that most people do not think they are normal. I prefer the word weird, I am proud to be weird and different.\n\nI am currently just shy of 29, and I finally had my heart surgery last year. I had got to the point where I was going into heart failure due to my mitral valve prolapse. The doctors assumed I was in heart failure for about 3 months before I had my surgery, and trust me, you will know when something it really wrong. After the recovery, I felt awesome, and still feel awesome.\n\nSince I have been living with the knowledge of having marfan's for quite a long time now, I have had the amazing experience of seeing medicine and treatments evolve for people like  us. The amount of surgeons who are experience in valve replacement now compared to 30 years ago is astounding. I was fortunate enough to pick the hospital to have my surgery at, and I went with Cleveland clinic. Cleveland clinic has an entire department dedicated to marfan's, as well as many hospitals and universities in the world.\n\nThe important thing is to keep following up with your doctors. Monitoring your condition is step one to making sure you catch anything potentially harmful in time. Like with medicine in general, cardiologists also have specialties. I typically go to see a cardiologist who specializes in congenital conditions, as they tend to stay more up to date on what is going on marfan's wise.\n\nAs for the anxiety, this is probably the most important piece of advice I will give. It took me 28 years to deal with my anxiety. In a matter of months, I have lived a happier and less stressful life. If you are feeling any of the things I did throughout my life, I know it is not easy. We live in a world where the importance of good mental health is tucked away in the closet and not to be talked about, and that is a shame. Anxiety is an awful spiral, you feel the squeak, you get anxious, and then you spiral. Is this is? Do I need to go to the ER? What is going to happen to me? What should I do? And then as you spiral, the anxiety makes everything in your chest feel worse! If there was one thing I could go back and change in my life, would have been to ask my doctor for help sooner. After getting a very low dose of antidepressants settled in my system, everything felt better. Medicine might not even be what you need, maybe just someone to talk through it with.\n\nI had a cardiologist tell me once, medicine is about morbidity and mortality. Helping people stay alive, and improving the quality of their lives. People today focus to much on staying alive, and not making sure the quality of their lives are at their best. You are not alone, you can certainly get through any challenge marfan's throws at you. A normal life is completely possible. \ud83e\udd72\u2764\ufe0f Its attainable, I am 20 years old knew about my marfan's since birth. I did not let things like my glasses, height, skinny build, and bad heart stop me from improving my confidence. I am a naturally people oriented person so I never was afraid to talk to girls, I got contacts, started exercising and improving my body within a restricted exercise routine. Improving myself physically was not where I stopped., mentally as well. I have studied different teachings on how to improve myself, how to toughen my mentality and how to control my life. As for work desk jobs are where its at, I am a businessman so I spend my day doing HR for the company I work for. I have a beautiful girlfriend who knows about my marfan's, but does not care since she still loves me for me. It is about confidence, how you view yourself and what you want to do. You can lead a normal life for sure. Do not get wrapped up with what is normal, as there is really no such thing. I am in my late 30s (almost 40), and I grew up with all of the same symptoms, but did not have regurgitation. I went through 2 chest surgeries, and 4 back surgeries.\n\nI was shy  guy who got made fun of a lot because I wore a brace in elementary and middle school, and I had a tough time staying in school, making long lasting friendships and meeting girls, and I did not blossom until I was about 19. I had a lot of depression and anxiety. I was antisocial and I was ok with it. One pivotal moment for me was finding a career that I loved. I found that if I dedicated myself 100% to something that I would be too busy to be anxious or sad.\n\nBeing that I was in a hospital a lot, I started work at a hospital as a nurse assistant, through this job I learned to be confident in myself and talk to people. Helping others has always given me a purpose, and helped me learn how to be social. I started forcing myself to to go social events like open mic nights at cafes, and bars. I then went to college and became a Paramedic, I knew I had Marfans but was undiagnosed and in denial. That lasted until had an aortic aneurysm develop after 9 years of being a Paramedic. I went back to school and got a low impact job working with robotic submarines and airplanes. I have had what I consider to be an extraordinary life despite my disabilities. I have traveled the world, fallen in love, raced cars, jumped out of helicopters, and now run my own company.\n\nMy advice is: do not care what other people think about you, you are an amazing human being who is stronger than most \"normal\" people, because you have had to go through more trials than average person has, or maybe ever will. Getting through tough times makes for better people; try to remember that you have made it this far, and you have a lot further to go. Do not let anyone tell you that you cannot obtain your goals (even if they do require slight modification for your health). Try enjoy life the best you can. If you have not already, make sure that you build a good network of medical professionals, and remember that it is up to you to make sure that you ask questions and feel comfortable. Thank you very much, this definitely helped a lot. Is your valve repair supposed to last a lifetime? I believe the valve repair is. I still have to follow up with my cardiologist once a year. My aorta can still continue to grow around the graft piece they put in, or on the other end of it as well. I believe the biggest concern is if you are not able to have your valve repaired, and instead replaced, then you will have two options. One is a 10-15 year lifetime, and the other in a lifetime long one, but with added medication and regular testing. That is great to hear! I have been monitoring my valve yearly since I was 14, so I am fairly confident we will intervene before it is too far gone to be repaired.

Whatever health related issues the family had were probably ignored.  Marfans explains a whole lot.  My husband's atrial fibrillation, for one main thing.  One of our sons developed scoliosis in his late teens, another has a hiatal hernia, and all of them have long limbs, and lovely, skillful hands with long fingers.  \n\nHow is this diagnosed?  Our family doctor has never mentioned Marfans.  Is this going to make it harder to get decent insurance rates for them later?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  \n This should help you:  Thanks! Get life insurance before now. It is nearly impossible to get life insurance with a Marfan diagnosis.  Not that it really matters, but it is most likely Lincoln had Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 2 and not Marfan Syndrome.

If after an echo, you find that he does have Marfan Syndrome and his aortic valve is at all enlarged, ask your doctor about getting onto Losartan. It is a blood pressure medicine that has the added side effect of drastically reducing enlarged aorta in mice and also in humans. It stopped my brother's aortic enlargement cold. And it even regressed back towards a more normal size. \n\n Thank you very much for this information.   Its been a bit overwhelming.  The good news is that if he is made it this long without major complications it is most likely a much milder presentation than some of the possibilities. Once/if he is confirmed as having it, you can easily do a genome sequence to test your children. Marfan Syndrome is unique to the individual lineage when it occurs because it starts as a random mutation, making it very easy to test the children and grand children of someone with Marfans. The other good thing is that if none of your kids have it, their children will not have it either. It has a 50% chance of being passed down to children. Two of our sons have very long fingers, one has scoliosis, one has esophageal problems, so I am pretty sure.  So, within one family, not all kids will necessarily have it?  \n\nAgain, thanks for this information. No problem, each birth has a 50% chance.

A visit to a rheumatologist is not a bad idea either just to check for potential joint issues. If it  is not out of your price range however then see a geneticist to screen for an FBN1 mutation which is pretty much the best way to confirm or deny marfans. Go to a geneticist and get evaluated, including a DNA test for the \"TAAD\" panel. If you have the clinical features and a high enough score that should overrule the DNA test as sometimes they are false negative. Once you do that, get your kids tested, if you have any.", "What were your optometry test experiences?

I cant speak for the diagnostic process, I have a family history so was diagnosed at birth (later confirmed with genetic testing as a teen) \n\nI do not have lens dislocation or retinal detachment, but some family members do\n\nI am short sighted and have had double vision (corrected ish by surgery) which was caused by muscle weakening around my eyes. My brother currently has no eye issues at all, though we expect he will soon. \n\nMarfans is a fairly variable condition. Severity is very different between people, and people can have very different symptoms, even within the same family. I have extreme nearsidedness. So much so that when I was a kid, an optometrist told my parents they think my lens should be removed because they were so dislocated. My parents opted to just have me wear glasses rather than go through a surgery. I have always been told it appears as if my eye is super stretched out. \n\nI also have had retinal detachments in one of my eyes and the other eye\u2019a retina is stretched but still attached. \n\nI have also had vitreous gel hemorrhages which I do not exactly know how to describe them but from my understanding they are blood spots in the eye that cause a black spot in my vision. Typically the spot slowly fades over several months and then my vision is restored. \n\nI also have many floaters in my eye but this is common in many conditions not just marfans. My brother and I both have confirmed marfan and neither of us have detached lenses (at least yet). Both of us have strange anomalies in our vision that no doctor has been able to place (not even neuro-opthalmologists) so we have both been told it could be a retina defect due to marfan. We both have shitty eyesight, him with astigmatism and me with nearsightedness.\n\nTake from that what you will. Beyond a floater that might or might not be marfan related i do not have any ocular symptoms. I have 7.3 cm aorta root aneurysm, pectus carinatum, hyperflexible fingers, flat feet.

Hope your consultation yields the outcomes you are seeking. The genetic test is the only way to have a conclusive diagnosis of Marfans despite any \"marfanoid\" characteristics you may think you have. I know this because I have had a test in the UK (NHS) and so have my kids. So the test is definitely available and do not let anyone convince you otherwise but as above it is the only way that a diagnosis can be positively confirmed.  All the best. Agreed!!! I am currently seeing private doctors because the NHS was giving me hassle but I will certainly push for the genetic test on the NHS. Thank you for this, I really appreciate this. No worries chap (like literally) as it is all manageable if identified early. My testing was undertaken by Northwick Park Hospital (Harrow). Not sure where you are located but if you need a reference then the one above should prove the fact it is available. Feel free to reach out if you ever need an ear\ud83d\udc4d I am from Newcastle but I will make sure I have that info for reference when I speak to the NHS docs. Thank you so much for your help :) I am in the same boat. Spoke to the genetics but they said they could not diagnose me with marfans through that, they had to look at the ghent critera as well, which i did not fullfill for having marfans I hope we can both get answers. I would rather know whether I definitely have it or not, by getting the genetic test. It would put my mind at ease just knowing. Same here budd!", "Winter Jacket Brands ", "Would a CT scan surely reveal any aneurysm?  it has to be focused on your chest according to my\nmom.  First off they would have to be looking at the right area of the body, so they might have scanned the correct area or might not have scanned the area of the aorta close to your heart.  Even if they did scan the correct area the radiologist that read the scan might not have looked at your aorta area of the scan.\n\nAlso, the CT scan's I have had of my Aorta (to measure any dilation or aneurysm) have involved having an IV contrast in connection with the scan.\n\nYou could ask your doctor whether the CT scan included images sufficient to detect an aneurysm of the Aorta but you should not presume that an aneurysm, or even a dilation, would have been detected in a procedure not specifically intended to detect it.  You can discuss the need of other tests of your aorta with your doctor as well.\n\n\n Oh I was talking about an abdominal aneurysm. And yes, I did have IV contrast as well ", "Is LASIK eye surgery a good option for someone with marfans ? Here is a little background:\nI just had an eye test today and my eyesight has significantly worsened. My left eye is now -2.5 D from earlier -2 D and right eye is -3.5 D from -2.5 D. I started wearing specs only 2 years ago in mid '18 at power -0.5 and -0.75D respectively.My optician has also told me that I might get retinal holes although I do not have any right now. I am really scared that I might become blind within the next few years and this has caused me to consider the option of LASIK. Please advice. It really depends on what ur eye dr tells u. For instance I am 21 and have been wearing glasses since I was 3ish, my vision is way higher in prescription than urs -14.5 left eye and -17 right eye (myopic) if u research lasik info what I have found is they correct up to -14 myopia soo ur well in range, but for people who miss that mark like myself there is somthing called lense replacement. So even if u put it off and ur vision gets worse there always other options. Hopefully it remains at where it is and does not further worsen!! But again talk to your doctors and maybe more than 1 eye care specialist if u have the option. Where I am from lasik costs a bit so it is easy for the industry to pressure one that it is perfectly safe ect so please ensure ur doctors are on top of things considering you have marfans. I am fortunate enough to have an optometrist who is experienced with marfans eye care so if yours isint maybe look into one who is in your city. Best of luck and do not stress out too much!! I am sure you will be fine:) especially considering what ur sight is like at 19. Xox ( specifically warns against doing LASIK.\n\nWhat is your corrected vision? Normally with Marfan your lens dislocates and can be removed and replaced with implants. It is a very common procedure.\n\n (", "Question about lens dislocation I am curious if anybody else has fully dislocated lenses that improved their vision? I was legally blind until I was 21 when my lenses dislocated and completely flipped my glasses prescription from a negative \\~15 or something like that (been a while cannot remember) to a + 11 or 13 or something like that. Obviously it did not improve my memory haha. I ended up with corrected vision of 20/50 in my left eye and 20/80-100 in my right eye (unfortunately it was so weak for so long it does not see too well still thinks appear kind of out of focus just not blurry but I can use it to help with reading...shoulda used the eye patches they gave me when I was a kid.)\n\nOverall it vastly improved my vision and I went from not being able to see someone is face 2 feet in front of me to being able to use my laptop from a reasonable distance, being able to see people's faces from 8-10 feet relatively easily, and a bunch of other cool stuff. This was all without replacing the lens and that seems to be pretty are from what I have heard.  I have never talked to anybody else that has experienced such a drastic shift in their vision so was curious if anybody here had also gone through it? I sometimes take it for granted how lucky I am.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso I am curious if anybody voluntarily had valve replacement surgery, my dilation has been pretty stable at \\~4cm for the past 6 years but I know recovery is a little rougher the older you are. I do not want to wait til I am 40-50 and not able to recover as well but I am also not sure if I will even need it. I am just now starting to get on top of my health and stuff because I have not had much money or insurance since I started college and my cardiologist retired so I have nobody to go to, although he did say I should be good until I am 30 and he suggests and MRI then (so 2 years from now.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry rambled a bit there I have just never talked to anybody else with Marfan Syndrome  as an adult and just found this subreddit so it is exciting. I have not experienced lens dislocation, but on voluntary valve replacement, I imagine finding a doctor willing to perform such a surgery would be difficult. My dilation is stable at 4.6 and they still consider the surgery too risky to perform on a stable patient. The exact thing happened to me. I have one weak eye but my \"good\" eye's lens dislocated enough for it to be mostly out of the way. I went from -15 to +9 basically overnight. My corrected vision went from \\~20/80 to 20/30. I was 32 at the time and could see some things for the first time!\n\nSince then I have had two retina detachments, etc. so it has not been smooth sailing but I am glad my vision is better than before.", "I think I have Marfans. Symptoms that I know of:\n\n6'3\" 155 lbs. 20 M\n\nStretch marks on butt and backsides of hips. (Inexplicable)\n\nVery bendable joints. I can tuck my thumbs behind each of my index fingers' knuckles. I have never \"rolled\" my ankle. I can misstep onto the sides of my feet sometimes and bounce back with no pain. I can do  ( easily.\n\nThin wrists - I can wrap my opposite hand around it thumb-to-pinky easily.\n\nI had a spontaneous pneumothorax last fall.\n\nI am nearsighted.\n\nI am really scared...", "Getting a second opinion The cardiologist wrote me off as none Marfan's because I did not meet the stereotypical phenotype. She also was unaware of many of the diagnostic criteria (Protucio Acetabulae, crowded teeth, hernias, etc...) which leads me to suspect that she did not really know what she was talking about. \n\nMy father likely has Marfan's (nearsighted, flat feet, bicuspid valve, aortic aneurysm) and I have flat feet, pectus carinatum, hernias, poor cardiovascular capacity, very crowded teeth and random stretch marks (I could be missing others). I reckon I have a pretty good roll of the dice when it comes to symptoms but considering that this disease nearly killed my old man and I am very physically active, I would like to set up a regular imaging schedule for my heart, yet without a diagnosis that will never happen. How should I approach seeing other doctors of a diagnosis? My cardiologist was skeptical to diagnose me at first since I only met about half of the stereotypical symptoms used for a clinical diagnosis, so they took a few vials of blood and sent it to a 3rd party testing lab. A genetic test was the only way for me to be 100% sure I had the actual genetic mutation associated with Marfan Syndrome. It may be best for you to go through that same process. It was free with my insurance, but even without it, the nurses assured me the most they would ever seen a patient pay for the testing was about $200 USD. Hernias and crowded teeth are not part of the diagnostic criteria. You could still have it, and they *are* more common in people with Marfan Syndrome, but that, by itself, would not make me doubt the cardiologist.\n\n Just got off the phone with the geneticist and apparently it will be more than a year till I can the test done/get results. \n\nAny other course of action I could take? I am considering just asking my GP for a third party genetics test from the states. Should I just do that? I guess at this point it just depends on what you are willing to pay or how patient you can be. Once diagnosed with Marfans, it is rare that immediate attention is needed. Usually, the cardiologist will schedule annual visits to run an EKG and ensure the aorta has not stretched or torn. I understand you will want to get this done as soon as possible, but waiting a year will only set you back one annual visit in the long run. I feel like I should also remind you that I am 100% not a doctor, I am just a lanky guy with weird connective tissue in his body lol. I happen to be quite wealthy so money is not a concerning factor. I guess I just worry myself because I do quite a bit of high-intensity exercise that tends to spike my blood pressure and from what I have read aneurysms can grow at a rate of \\~.7cm over a six month period (admittedly it was stated that this was at the upper end of the bell curve). Would you happen to know any third party testing companies I could seek out? Invitae seemed to be the only one I could find but their reviews were dismal. I just doubt her judgment on the fact she had no idea what Protucio Acetabulae was. It is included in the systemic score calculation after all and any competent cardiologist/geneticist should be running through that systemic calculation. Update. I got a medical marijuana card for a combination of Marfans, EDS, and a service-related disabity. Idk if it is helping the Marfans-related joint pain but goddamn am I high right now lol.", "Geneticist thinks I may have marfans but I do not fit the physical characteristics at all. Hello. First time posting here. I got referred to genetics for suspected ehlers danlos but the geneticist thinks I may have marfans rather. But I do not look like the typical Marfan features at all so I was just wondering if there are other people who do not? Mainly I am pretty short (5\u20195\u201d female). My arms are longer than my body and my hands are long and I am thin and I can do the finger/fist test thing. I have hypermobile and unstable joints,  brain aneurysms, cavernomas, arterial ecasia, fusion of some of my vertebrae, other vascular defects, mild scoliosis, moderate sponyolisthesis and retrolisthesis in my spine, cervical cranial crowding, flat feet, navicular syndrome, mild Pectus carinatum. But like it is all really mild-looking. Like I am just in a lot of pain but you would not be able to tell. And then the aneurysms are a problem obviously so I am getting brain surgery but they just think there is some underlying issue. \n\nSo i have a brother who does look like he has marfans though but he does not have the hypermobility. He has not had any imaging done so he does not know if he has other issues. But the geneticist wants to test him also. So my question is can it even manifest differently like that within a family? Does that make sense? Yes, it can definitely manifest quite differently even within the same family. In fact, my twin brother and I both exhibit marfan syndrome to significantly different degrees.\n\nIt is a scary time, I know. You are going through a whole lot right now. But hang in there and I think you will see everything will be ok. Find things you love and do them as much as possible. Watching movies, playing game, (ahem, people), whatever. Enjoy life, and then when the answers come, you will have your path. :-) I am thinking gender switches lots of genes, maybe fibrillin is one of them. My brother is long and gangly, like my father and his twin was. I am short, and look quite normal apart from my eyes not working together in the morning (a symptom of Loey Dietz for me) but we both have marfans. He is dying faster than I, as I am just a carrier of this mutation if I were to have kids. \nPlease get your brother to get tested if he has not I will definitely urge my brother to get testing. I had told him when I first found out about my aneurysms because they can be genetic and he got really stressed out about it. So i think I will wait till i get my results back so I do not stress him out about nothing. Now that I am learning more about this I just cannot believe no one has tested him before. He has to wear a brace for his scoliosis and his bones are so fragile they and his teeth just break all the time and a doctor said he had the bone density of an 80 year old when he was 17. And he is just so very long. And I asked him and he said no one has ever suggested testing for a reason why. I am sorry your brother has it so badly. What do you mean by your eyes not working together? I am wondering cause i do not really have any noticeable vision problems but my pupils are often different sizes from one another. Yeah, it manifests differently, even between siblings. It is a syndrome. I would say *maybe* the only way you would get the same symptoms is if you were twins.\n\nI am not quite sure why you do not think you could have MFS though. Because you are 5'5\"? My eyes have been getting progressively worse and worse and it is like when something is in the way of one eye and it is distorting your view making it like like two of something. I went to the optometrist and got told I needed glasses as my eyes had 20/20 vision but they were not working together to look in the same direction haha. It is not noticeable as he said I do not need surgery to make it cosmetically pleasing. I mentioned my eye problem to a doctor when I was in for a heart appointment with my brother and other relatives and she said that it may be another effect of Loey Dietz playing it is part as that is one of the calling symptoms as well. Different sized pupils sounds worrying, so might be worth booking with an optometrist Thank you. Yeah I would be lying if i said I was not completely terrified. :-/  ill update when I get the results back from genetics they said it should be like two weeks. Yeah cause I am 5\u20195\u201d and like while I am thin I am not like THAT thin. Just before my appointment yesterday i literally  didnt know anything about marfans except that it makes people talk and skinny so it seemed impossible. The geneticist said that was not always the case so I just wanted to ask about it here. Tall is just one symptom of many, albeit one of the more common ones. \n\nMy little brother is short and overweight, and he is got MFS same as me, who is more typical in body type (both of us have short torsos and long limbs). A geneticist is a good place to be for both MFS and EDS though- it is fairly similar (yet very different) in a lot of ways. I would say regardless, you are doing things right so far. I have got it, and I am 5'3. For me it is reverse, I have A LOT of the physical signs externally, but no collapsed lung, no lens dislocation, not nearsighted but I AM farsighted, no aneurysm, it is weird. They do not always test for loeys Dietz. Ask for the genetic test. They found ours by accident. Yes you can have it without the physical characteristics, like me :) I only have hypermobility and aranodactilia. Nothing more than that, and here I am, with a mechanic Valve 27 years later after having betabloquers all my life.

It is a pretty recent revelation that only came about because my cousin\u2019s wife\u2019s maternity doctor suggested he get tested for it and he ended up testing positive.

Is that normal?\n\nTLDR: If my grandma and a cousin have Marfan\u2019s syndrome and about half of my family exhibits many of the signs of Marfan\u2019s syndrome, is it normal for doctors to be uninterested in testing any of us for it?

My dad has many Marfans traits: tall, skinny, stretch marks, very long face, crowded teeth, history of hernia, etc.  But not all of the signs.\n\nI, on the other hand, have almost no signs.  The only thing I have is a slightly oblong face (like Blake Lively the actress, I guess?) and some crowded teeth before I got braces, and both of these things have run in the family for generations.  I am actually not even tall, and I am not that thin, and my legs are actually short and thick for my trunk (like noticeably pear shaped and squat).  I guess on a good note, I have great blood pressure.\n\nAt first I assumed there was no way I had Marfans but then I found out it could be asymptomatic!  I am trying not to freak out but now I am also worried that I could already have a SEVERE aortic aneurysm (just because my dad's is mild does not mean mine would be right?)  I used to do a lot of heavy weightlifting, so what if I already have an aortic dilation that is like...8 cm?? (My dad's is 4.3 and it appeared in middle age, but still.)\n\nI am worried about how I am going to give birth safely. My husband and I want to have children and I am worried that will not happen for me now.  Even if it is not Marfans, it is something else I could have easily inherited.  Plus, my husband says he will stay with me regardless but he also thinks there is like a 0% chance that I have it.  If he leaves me, will it be possible for me to date?  Will this be a huge red flag for most people? I have no interest in men other than my husband but if he leaves me I will want to remarry.  As you can see, I am totally spiraling.  My head is just spinning right now.\n\nI am also so worried about the prospect of surgery.  My dad presented it to me like \"Well people with my heart condition sometimes need surgery which fixes you up and it is super easy\" but then I read online that there is a high mortality rate.  I do not want to die before I am even middle aged.  I just do not know how to piece all these things together right now.  \n\n**TLDR: Dad probably has Marfans or something similar, I have no major symptoms of any of this stuff but very worried I am an asymptomatic case and I am worried about dying young or dying in surgery**\n\nSorry to be so dramatic but I have really never had ANY health issues in my life other than anxiety, so this is so new to me and I need to find a way to function!

For now i still dont have problems on aorta and been  having appointments with my doctor, That is really good. Make sure you have yearly echocardiograms, and ask your cardiologist about going on Losartan or Beta-blockers as it has been shown to slow the growth of aneurysms. If you get acne, ask about Doxycycline.   \n\n\nI graduated College a few years ago now, everything was normal for me, I tried to take it a bit easy in sports and I did regular exercise just no heavy weight lifting (I did some light weights though).

I do not usually mention marfs to people but when I do I just say it is a small genetic thing and they take it as an awnser.\n\nIn every moment of transformation in my life I have dealt with anxiety and impostor syndrome.

None of that will be defined by your Marfans, but by what you decide to make of it. Do not pity yourself, is really what I am getting at. And do not feel forced to dress a certain way to \u201chide\u201d yourself. Wear whatever the heck makes you actually happy, and pay no mind to what others might think. My advise; be confident, be yourself, be confident in yourself. Do not let the condition define who you are or how others see you. Do not worry about blending in: odds are if you are not telling people they do not know. Scoliosis is *super* common, too. No one cares as much as you do, promise. Dress how you want, do not hide yourself because you think you have to.\n\nBut make sure you do not fall behind on your meds and doctor's appts just because you are busy! My brother did that and it almost cost him his life. Thank you for the advice Im probably scared on the part where everyone loved me only out of pity... Thank you for the kind advice!!

I have My heart has always beaten really fast or at least since I can remember. The doctor told me to take some tablets for lowering my heart beats per minute (which is around 90), but I do not take them everyday as I should... But no one has ever told me the actual reason why this happens. \n\nI was diagnosed with dilated ortic root years ago. I check every year and last time, I was told it has not increased anymore. They told me that the distance between the points that were dilated before, are now normal, according to my age and height. Since then, I do completely normal activities without feeling bad. \n\nNow its almost 1 am and I cannot sleep because my heart beat has increased and I cannot control it, not even with breathing or relaxing exercises. It has happened a couple of times in the past month already. \n\nTwo of my family members have died of this. One on a really young age like me. \n\nI am so afraid... \n\nCan someone tell me what is this? Why? Is it normal?? Please  Hey there.. I believe you are causing this to yourself. But i also understand that you cant help it! When i started getting the tests for marfans i very frequently had heart-aches, really weird ones that cause me to shit myself.\n\nThis went on for months, and when the DNA tests showed that i did not actually had marfans, it got away. Its all in the mind.\nSince you are getting checked, there is nothing to worry about! Also try talking to your doctor, their words are usually comforting (when they have something good to say) Same thing here but I still have Marfans. Felt like my heart was a balloon going to pop and I was frightened as fuck. But I literally closed my eyes and accepted what is to come n I just fell asleep. Have not had it since . Just me psyching myself out. Dogs heart rate go off like crazy, I am sure humans are similar, and it is all anxiety. I also take pills And everything and it is to locker blood pressure not beats. It is so each beat shoots less blood through so your arteries do not expand. Normal people exercise and their heart beats less and pumps more blood per pump. For us it is the same but our arteries grow in wise where normal people do not. The heart beating less is somewhat a sign of a healthy heart. For us it is what we do not want. But nobody should have their heart racing fast in general. So again just relax , you are young and the human body does extraordinary things man.

You got this Did you measure how much bpms you had? \n\nYou should see your cardiologist if your bpms are abnormal (like, more abnormal than your normal) You need to understand your body, take measurements, and then give the data to your doctors, also you should know when it is an emergency or not. (if you have severe tachycardia for example, you should call for an ambulance), so please speak with your doctor and ask him what is the safe top bpms your body can handle without being an emergency. Then if you have tachycardia (very fast hearth beating), you will be able to know if it is too fast or not to be a real problem. \n\nChill and study, be prepared, so you do not need to panic, but also you know when to act.

Is this a genetic test that you did through a geneticist? What sort systemic score / Z score did the geneticist say you have? The test was done through my primary care provider and sent to a blood testing lab. I do not see anything about a systemic score or Z score in my results. That is good to know. My primary care provider did not seem to know much about the condition and did not test for any physical symptoms. Go see a proper geneticist and get tested that way.

If so, what did they do? What did they ask? Did you get genetic testing or scans ordered? So, I know nothing of the types of geneticists, but typically you are first clinically diagnosed via visual/physical  symptoms (Ghent scale, aortic dilation, eyesight) or, if there is known history in your family (eg, parent to child), you tend to be referred to a geneticist, who then has a specific test done which in the case of specifically looking for marfan syndrome is the TAAD panel - I do not recall what else that finds.\n \n Types of tests to go along with figuring out what symptoms a person has/does not has that makes them more likely to indicate marfans: anything on the Ghent scale, echocardiogram to check for valve prolapse and/or aortic dilation/dissection, retinal/lens detachment, hypermobility, scoliosis, and I am sure there is more.\n\nThe marfan foundation covers this pretty well here:  and has pamphlets and other documentation to bring to a doctor if you suspect you have it, or you have it and there is not doctors who are familiar around you.\n\nTypically whether or not you have it is known because it is a mutation on a dominant gene, each child a confirmed person with marfan has each has a 50/50 chance to carry the same mutation. There are one in four of every diagnosed person with marfans, like on my case, who are spontaneous with no prior family history.\n\nIf someone is found to have marfans, but it is not known throughout the family history, it is not uncommon to test the immediate family members (brothers/sisters/parents) as its a good chance it is passed down, if there is no mutation in a person's parents that has been diagnosed (when a parent is still alive to be tested), and they both come up negative, there is not further genetic testing done as it does not 'skip generations'. I believe there can be different mutation variants in the same family, but do not know for certain.\n\nSorry this got long! I hoped this answered at least one of the questions you posted :) I saw the top Marfan Cardiologists at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester Minnesota.  \nThey said currently Cardiologists are not prescribing Medication based on mutation.\n\n  \nHowever it is very important that you see a geneticist anyways because it is possible to have multiple mutations, or new mutations, or mutations that we know cause certain problems and not others.  \n\n\nThere is evidence that -sartan (Like Losartan or Valsartan) are more effective for some marfan mutation classifications and Beta blockers more effective for others. (  \n\n\n'In this predefined substudy of COMPARE, Marfan patients were randomized to daily receive losartan 100 mg or no losartan. Aortic root dimensions were measured by MRI at baseline and after 3 years. FBN1 mutations were classified based on fibrillin-1 protein effect into (1) haploinsufficiency, decreased amount of normal fibrillin-1, or (2) dominant negative, normal fibrillin-1 abundance with mutant fibrillin-1 incorporated in the matrix. A pathogenic FBN1 mutation was found in 117 patients, of whom 79 patients were positive for a dominant negative mutation (67.5%) and 38 for a mutation causing haploinsufficiency (32.5%). Baseline characteristics between treatment groups were similar. Overall, losartan significantly reduced aortic root dilatation rate (no losartan, 1.3\u00b11.5 mm/3 years, n=59 versus losartan, 0.8\u00b11.4 mm/3 years, n=58; P=0.009). However, losartan reduced only aortic root dilatation rate in haploinsufficient patients (no losartan, 1.8\u00b11.5 mm/3 years, n=21 versus losartan 0.5\u00b10.8 mm/3 years, n=17; P=0.001) and not in dominant negative patients (no losartan, 1.2\u00b11.7 mm/3 years, n=38 versus losartan 0.8\u00b11.3 mm/3 years, n=41; P=0.197).  \nConclusions\u2014  \nMarfan patients with haploinsufficient FBN1 mutations seem to be more responsive to losartan therapy for inhibition of aortic root dilatation rate compared with dominant negative patients. Additional treatment strategies are needed in Marfan patients with dominant negative FBN1 mutations.' I fit the diagnostic criteria except for enlarged aorta. They can see that from my medical record. But, I actually have a cardiovascular problem that can be associated with chronic dissections. They can see that too.  So i need more than a standard geneticist.  I need medical treatment. So, I was assigned a MD (cardio) with a PhD (in cardiogenetics).  I am not perfect Ghent for marfans or ehlers danlos.

I am trying to get help here where my insurance will pay.  Did you get treatment there or just consult?  Did you meet with multiple drs at the same time?  Did you consider it worthwhile? I feel I paid way too much for a echocardiogram, bloodwork, 5 minute appointment with geneticist and longer appointment with Cardiologist there, but they are the best.  \n\n\nIf you are in need of heart surgery then I would recommend it, but I found out my Aortic Aneurysm was extremely mild so I do not need any treatment besides my Valsartan medication. Haha.  Good to know.  Thanks. I will keep them in mind if I ever need  surgery or if I cannot get a diagnosis for my cardiovascular problem here. How was your Mayo experience?  Did you have treatment or surgery?  Did you consider it worthwhile? Mayo is who took care of me my entire life, I was super lucky when I was little to get a referral (this was back in the early 90s when it was difficult to get an appointment without already being established that you have got problems. An orthopedist saw my file and pretty much had moved his schedule around to be able to have a consult with me the next morning, according to my parents). I had nothing but great experiences at Mayo, there was one cardiologist I dealt with as a kid that was just absolutely awful, but he was also someone who could not remember my name when he would dictate to his secretary my notes while in the appointments. I met some of his staff later in life when we worked in the same company and she confirmed that he was just an asshole to everyone.\n\nThrough Mayo I have had: spinal fusion &amp; harrington rod placement (and later removal), shunting of tarlov cyst in lower spine, mitral valve replacement, aortic valve replacement &amp; aortic graft, lens removal, lens implants, CSF repair, burr hole procedure, and sterilization) I might be forgetting something.\n\nI have also heard of some people having a lot of bad experiences with Mayo, but not in relation to cardiology management. When I moved out of state in 2018, my Cardiologist at Mayo referred me to a hospital and cardiologist who had worked/been in school at Mayo, and with my Mayo cardiologist at that.\n\nAppointment times can take a while to get, but if you are in urgent need they seem to be really great at getting you in, or they had in my past. If you live more than 2 hrs away from any of the Mayo locations i highly suggest that you try to schedule your regular checkups in a single day - or you will be driving to and from mayo over a course of 4 days for as many appointments/tests. &gt; mitral valve replacement, aortic valve replacement \n\nThank you for the detailed response and tips.

Do you think learning piano with marfan's is harder or easier? Has anyone ever tried? I never played piano, but i assume it might be easier since with marfan one has usually longer fingers, so it is easier to reach the keys. Besides i dont see how marfan could negatively impact your play. Only that you obviously have to watch for your posture! The best would be to consult your doctor, since every case is unique. Good luck anyway! I do not have marfans, but I have the marfanoid body type (I have a different connective tissue issue). I play cello! I did not realise how useful it was until I was about 12 and saw that everyone else could not do what I can do lol. I am not good at the cello, but it is good fun. \n\nMusic is such a good thing. I agree that the longer fingers should come in handy. I play piano and guitar very badly but I enjoy it.  \n\nPaganini, one of violin's greats, possibly had Marfan's.  \n\n(\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n**Paganini\u2019s Hands**\n\nMarfan syndrome is a genetic disorder changes a person\u2019s connective  tissue, often making them unusually tall with lengthened limbs and long,  thin fingers. Observers of Paganini frequently commented on his unique  hands. In 1831, his personal physician wrote, \u201cPaganini\u2019s hand is not  larger than normal; but because all its parts are so stretchable, it can  double its reach. For example, without changing the position of the  hand, he is able to bend the first joints of the left fingers \u2013which  touch the strings\u2013sideways, at a right angle to the natural motion of  the joint, and he can do it with effortless ease, assurance, and speed.  Essentially, Paganini\u2019s art is based on physical endowment, increased  and developed by ceaseless practicing.\u201d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe was so amazing that people thought he made a deal with the devil.  \n(\n\nWhile googling that I saw that there is a film about it. I will have to check it out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso /u/carrotparrotcarrot the cello is my favorite instrument! I have heard about Paganini's path with the devil before, But I would have never imagined it was for this reason I play piano, bass guitar, guitar, trombone and a few other instruments. I would say that long fingers definately help with piano and bass, the only problem i have had is trying to do barre chords on guitar because of how fexible my fingers are. easier, long fingers.  Myself and both siblings played piano growing up and our teachers would gawk over size of hands at a young age.  That said learning an instrument takes times and just because you have long fingers will not automatically make you Beethoven I have been playing 20 years, been diagnosed for 24. I think it definitely makes some parts of playing easier, but like everything we do, can be overdone to the point of fatigue or injury. \nLmk if you have any questions, I used to teach piano &amp; am also spending quarantine learning songs! Have you tried using your thumb to cover the low E instead of barring all of the strings with your index? Do that, and then you can just more or less form an Emajor/Aminor chord with your other fingers and you have got a barre chord substitute That Is a great idea! I have sort of taught myself to play them normally but i will definately give this a go. Rachmaninoff was the Marf of piano.  Of course we can.

But no seriously is there ANY way to gain an ass or should I just save myself the misery of trying to find out? Ask your cardiologist, and express to them your deep concerns. It is possible something can be worked out, depending on the severity of your Marfans. Having a strong core and glutes helps protect your back - at a Marfan conference this was emphasized by an orthopedic surgery. See about simply doing a small number of squats a day. This was emphasized by my physical therapy team, too. Cannot do the most, but there is definitely stuff we can do. Wait i have a big ass ? Even girls compliment about that.

Thought I would share the cardiovascular one since it is critical info. \n\nMarFact #6: We are going to spend the next few days discussing the ways that Marfan syndrome affects the body. Today we will talk about the cardiovascular system. About 90% of people with Marfan syndrome have cardiovascular problems.\n\nMarfan syndrome causes aortic enlargement, and this is the most dangerous aspect of Marfan because it rarely has symptoms. The aorta is the main blood vessel coming from your heart. When it enlarges (aortic dilation), the walls of the aorta can bulge (an aneurysm), which puts you at risk for the aorta tearing (aortic dissection). That can be deadly (and dissection DOES have symptoms, but by then you are in an emergency situation). Again, there are rarely symptoms of aortic enlargement, so it is vital that a person who suspects Marfan syndrome have one of the following tests to assess their heart and aorta: an echocardiogram, a CT scan, an MRI, or a TEE. X-rays and EKGs will NOT diagnose an aortic aneurysm! \ufffd\ufffd\n\nLeaky/floppy valves, particularly the mitral valve (mitral valve prolapse), are another cardiovascular complication of Marfan syndrome. 60% of people with Marfan have mitral valve prolapse. Symptoms can include a murmur, palpitations, and shortness of breath. Severely leaking valves can lead to heart failure. Symptoms of heart failure can include a new cough, sweating, loss of appetite, shortness of breath (especially when laying down), and fatigue. Depending on the stage and cause of heart failure, it might be treated with medications or surgery. Rarely, Marfan patients may need a heart transplant. #KnowFightWin", "Being overweight with marfans  I have marfans my whole life.

He is a star soccer player and with meds (atenolol), he is doing awesome. Popular kid.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut, that said, he is becoming more and more self conscious about his chest, thinking he will not get a girl (even though they love him now;-)) later in life, even tries to dodge swimming on summer camp/vacations due to the shame of his chest. I think they teased him once or twice in the soccer locker room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI suggested we come up with a certain \"shocker\" that will shut them up and get empathetic towards him, instead of make fun. However, I am uncertain what to advise other than just be cool and funny as you are (he really is great, even though any father would say that ;-)).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, my question to any teen/early 20 y/o: any tips for my kid?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* only 748 members in this group, amazingly low I think he need some kind of pad or straps to make chest look flatter,anything that looks cool,or you can add patch(padding around chest hole inside tshirt) on his clothes to make it look flat It is more for when he is not wearing a shirt, e.g. swimming pool, beach (we live at the beach) etc. I also avoid these kind of places,bcoz of my skinny body.But swimming costumes can help, swimming costume will cover his torso. We call them rash guards here.  Shirt to prevent sunburn.  I think it is good to force them to wear it for sun exposure in general but it also gives them an easy excuse for when they are feeling self conscious - \"my parents makes me wear it.\". Obviously, they do not have to wear it, but they can blame you instead of their own ego if they feel the need. Yeah, I (male) almost always wore a shirt when swimming as a kid, especially if it was around others who were not family. Sometimes even then. Just some kind of summer-ish themed shirt works fine, then the excuse can just be \"Hey, why bother removing it? It stops sunburn!\" if anyone else asks.\n\nThe locker room thing is more tricky.. I was always medically excused from PE, so I participated (or did not) based on how I felt, and by high school, I would often just go on the treadmill for a bit or run around on my own while others did more intense or dangerous exercises, resting as often as needed. Had a cool gym teacher, and never changed clothes in front of others, so I avoided all that.\n\nAs for the earlier comment, be really careful with anything that compresses the chest, because that can totally become a problem. Spontaneous lung collapse is a rare but real thing with Marfan's, after all, and you do not want to hinder bone growth or otherwise make it worse through an otherwise innocent act. I do not really know how to help, but I know that when I wear a bikini I wear a necklace, which takes attention away from the chest. He can try that, like a simple necklace, or just tell him that girls do not mind it, honestly! Best of luck tho Told him yesterday that any girl who thinks that way is not even worthy of his attention. Good thing girls in general are less shallow than boys. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe necklace is a good idea maybe. I hope it works out! Good idea, lots of kids wear a surf/beach/sun rash guard (as IdiotFlotsam named it) here. I will talk this one over with him.

IME, the cooler you handle this, the less interesting it becomes for everyone else. I know this might be tough (at first) for a kid who is shy about his condition &amp; his looks, especially at this age, but you know, it is just how it is, he has this thing, he will live with it, there are people in this world who behave like idiots, and he will have to figure out that people's opinions of him are just that -- personal opinions. Usually based on ignorance, not actual cruelness. So be upfront about it. Be cool. Let him tell them it is part of who he is, but it is not WHO he is. The \"shocker\" scenario kind of negates this whole idea, turning your son into That Boy, which I think would be terrible -- in effect he will end up being defined by having Marfan, instead of being this cool, funny young guy who just happens to have not only a killer smile and insane soccer skills but also some rare condition. \n\nMy daughter is 14 and has Marfan's, with a Haller index of 10, so it truly is noticable as well as affects her health; she will get surgery once she is old enough (in a year or two, apparently), but I am guessing from your post that your son's chest deformity is not severe enough to consider surgical intervention?\n\nAnd do not worry about the girls, they will not mind the chest thing... until they are superficial brats who would bore him to tears with their inane chatter two weeks into dating. ;) You are right, and I tacled that early.

His aorta is a bit widened, but that is also stable now with increased meds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;And do not worry about the girls, they will not mind the chest thing... until they are superficial brats who would bore him to tears with their inane chatter two weeks into dating. ;)\n\nLOL, right. You do not need MArfan for that to happen anyway :) \u201cI was iron man.\u201d So, this is more for you as \"Mom\" rather than your son.\n\nIt sucks, but it is part of it and it gets better.\n\nIt is a thing people will notice, it is a thing that at his age will draw some stupid comments.  But it does not last.\n\nEveryone has their shit.  When I eventually made my peace with mine, I wound up dating folks who very much should have been \"out of my league\".  When you make your peace with something as physically overt as pectus, there is a certain confidence that spills over and people *do* pick up on.\n\nMake sure he loves his body and mind for what it can do.  Soccer, guitar, geology, whatever.  It is not that the comments go away, they just become noise, and that is an amazing life skill that everyone should learn but not everyone is forced to.\n\nI will also add what you are talking about is one of the main reasons I joined the National Marfan's Foundation mentor network.  It is hard enough growing up, but having someone who can say \"Look kid, you will date, and you will screw it up, and it will hurt like hell, but it will be for the million reasons every other human being has screwed it up, with none of it having to do with your fibrillin\" is a really important thing for a kid to hear.  I would highly recommend signing him up as a mentee.  Ideally, he will forma  bond with his mentee that will also help him as he transitions into when he is responsible for his own care.  Being a young adult navigating insurance, routine testing, etc that your parents used to take care of is it is own ball of stress. Not sure if such a thing exists here in NL. Thanks for the suggestions though. Remind him that at some point in the future (if he has surgery to correct this) he will get to have an adamantium endoskeleton. Like wolverine.\n\nChances are, he will have to deal with bullshit stares and ignorant annoying comments his whole life. You cannot change the people (you can educate one, but ten more will take their place). What you -can- do is help support him and build up his confidence so the remarks and attention do not bring him down.\n\nIt is hard to be a kid inside a growing body and really really hard when that body is growing differently than everyone else\u2019s. Cool that he can play sports. When I was a kid, my doctors nixed all of them\u2014 even with beta blockers. So every gym class I was just sitting on the sidelines, pulling up grass. I coped even though it sucked. And I got better at coping. People still stare and say stupid shit. Less so because I am in an eclectic major city, but my experience makes me think focusing on his confidence and not the folks teasing him might be helpful.\n\nMaybe we could pitch on some witty retort that would make him a legend at school and make the haters think really deeply about all their life choices. And i kind of wish I could give you one. But i think that even in that case, the satisfaction of a dope come-back is fleeting. This.  Very well said. Ah, I am sorry I should not have assumed you were USA based.\n\nHe will get some bruises, but with the love and support your giving him he will not only be fine but better for it.  Might just be a bit hard to watch as a parent.  \n\nHonestly, when you think he is old enough, maybe he can make an account and join some of the subreddits here (although Reddit has some truly dark corners).\n\nAnyway, with the serious stuff out of the way, if anyone asks about his chest, tell him to say \"your mums fat ass crushed me.  It took 8 firemen and a team of horses to get her off but I did not die, which is more than I can say for those poor horses\" I have Marfan\u2019s and had Pectus excavatum repair surgery when I was 15. It was a very painful surgery and my main motivation for it was cosmetic, but it actually increased my lung capacity. I totally feel for him that he feels self conscious. Especially at the age he is at, having Marfans can make you feel so different from everyone else. I agree. Too bad you could not do sports. My kid plays soccer 5-6 hours a week for the club, 4 hours gym in school and then the obligatory \"get out and play outside\" time ;-).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am not happy about soccer as he plays a fairly high level, but doctors told me to let him have it as long as it works for him and I of course agree. Many many years ago I started a thread similar like this somewhere else and the key takeaway from that was that grown-ups who knew they had something when they were a child and were not allowed to do anything, wished they did not know and just played (with possible consequences) like regular kids, plus people who did not know and got injured a lot, were happy they had the chance to mingle, even with the injuries. I always tried to keep that in mind. This really hits close to home with me. As a kid, I was always made fun of for the hole in my chest. I had a lot of confidence issues because of it, and I would always wear baggy shirts as an attempt to hide it. \n\nEventually your son will learn to accept himself. It took me until college to really be comfortable with my weird body, and along the way I had some really great relationships with some awesome lady's that gave me even more confidence. Cheers.", "Worried about having Marfan syndrome Hello, English is not my native language, so I apologize if anything is wrong.\n\nSo, recently, I have been really worried that I may have Marfan syndrome. I have always had anxiety issues and this is making them worse. I am 18 years old, my hands are quite big and the fingers are long (it is not an extreme case, but I think it could be arachnodactyly). To make it worse, I have both pectus excavatum (not a severe case) and scoliosis. I am also quite tall (186cm, or 6'1ft). I, however, do not have any vision problems, no joint hypermobility, flexibility or foot problems. No family history.\n\nI am very worried and already scheduled an appointment with a cardiologist. Is there a chance my cardiologist could not know about Marfan since it is rare? Also, how do I talk to him about my concerns that I might have Marfan? Thanks Email the Marfan Foundation at  Amy, the nurse who replies to these emails, is incredibly helpful. She can help you find a doctor in your area that knows about Marfan Syndrome. I have emailed her several times for this same reason looking for doctors for my kids.  I would imagine the cardiologist will have heard of marfan syndrome.  If not once you mention it i am sure they will figure out what needs to be checked (ascending aorta, aortic arch).  \n\nUntil then, do not worry about it, you do not even know if you have it! I am 14 years old, I just got back from the hospital talking to an Orthopedic person about my fractured clavicle, they pointed out my wingspan was very long and talked about Marfan syndrome for a little bit, I measured my wingspan and height and my wingspan is a little over 5'9 while my height is 5'6.5, I also have a deformation in my chest but it does not matter or anything xD", "Question ? What age where most of you on this page diagnosed ? I am a 6ft 6in tall , 58 year old male .. I have many Marfan symptoms / features , but yet Drs say I do not have it .. I am a tad worried now since I have an enlarged aorta and already had a torn retina ", "Mother's with Marfans Are there any women with Marfan's that have had pregnancies that can speak about their experiences? The Facebook group is good for this. It is a frequent topic.  ( if there werent would we be here \ud83d\ude02 I was asking if anyone would want to speak about their experiences. I know that there are women with Marfan's that have had children. Technically though even if all the women with Marfan's never had children, there would still be children with Marfan's because it can be passed on from the father. So thank you for your smart ass comment. Thank you! I considered the risk and chose to get pregnant anyway... Based on the calculation that while Marfan sucks, it has not made me regret being alive. Figured it was likely baby would feel the same way. She ended up not having Marfan, but I was willing to take the risk. She is the absolute joy of my heart. With the important caveat that I do not have an official diagnosis (appts all pushed back because of the pandemic), I think some aspects if Marfan\u2019s (or Marfan\u2019s-like qualities I have) made it easier. \n\nFirst, being tall tends to make pregnancy easier (there is not much difference in birth sizes of babies overall so being tall just means the baby has more space). \n\nPotentially because of the extra flexibility (plus tallness), I maintained my mobility throughout. I was dancing pretty intensely until Month 8, and kept working out (gently) until the birth. \n\nI did not know about Marfan\u2019s then, but I learned the hard way not to go back to exercising when typical women do (at 6 weeks post-birth). The hormones make everything looser, which is even riskier for us. I would recommend waiting until 6 months after the birth instead \u2014 or as long as you can stand it. \n\nI hope that helps!", "MASS phenotype ", "Yeah... ", "Should I be concerned?

I did not see any that scored points. The tests I was referring to were  ( ill try, because i already told my doctor about marfan once and he laughed and started giving me a speech about self acceptance. He maybe right.. but im still abit paranoid because i mostly fit the description for marfan. Well, the tests are quick and easy to do. The thumb through fingers one is how my doctor came to the conclusion about me possibly having marfans so they seem to be at least somewhat medically accepted. Ask him again if you are still concerned. If he does not want to get you tested or wont refer you maybe try seeing a different doctor. I do not know how easy that is in your country but it was fairly easy for me in Canada. for some reason it doesnt let me view your reply Oh, yeah I am not sure a comment must have gotten deleted or something. The test I am talking about are ( Those are what the doctor did to me before sending me for genetic testing. If you can do those than it is a good indication as far as I know. If you can do both of those, or even neither and you still want to find out your doctor should be able to set up a gene test. How much that costs depends on your country. ", "I posted.

I have been told twice that there is zero chance of getting a quote because of my dilation is 4.7mm\n\nAnyone else had trouble? If so, is there anything else to look at like Income Protection - it is a tough pill to swallow as I have got a child too. This may be worth engaging a professional financial planner about.  In all probability it will be a combination of a couple of things.  I am a Yank so these may not be perfect analogs (or not analogous at all).  I would look extrapolate your expenses and enhanced care as best you can.  I know this will be hard as NHS has quite a bit going on at the moment.  I would then look at what programs allow some kind of a safety net (even in the US, people who are simply to ill to work do receive *some* support, catch being you have to be ill enough to not work *at all*, and it is not great support).  That will give you an idea of what the shortfall between what financial level you would like to be at and where you would be if bad things happen is.  I am unsure if you would be able to find an insurance policy to accommodate this.  It may be on you to plan accordingly which is why I recommended a financial planner.  In the US there are a lot of tax sheltered vehicles that can be used for this that help (a bit anyway).\n\n\nRe: Getting insurance:\n\nI cannot comment on life insurance, but I am self employed and have been rejected for key-person insurance multiple times.\n\nIt sucks.  I am barley 30 and I know more about planning for this stuff than I ever wanted to. Idk about British insurance. Scandinavian here.\n\nI know that there is life insurance for handicapped people in my country, and they roughly cost the same as regular life insurance. I will try to Google around, if you have something similar. Thank you for your thoughts - I have never really spoken to anyone else about having Marfan Syndrome so I appreciate the feedback, I also wish I had thought further ahead about my kid (who also has Marfans unfortunately) but we have to do our best do not we! Thank you for your thoughts franzveto, I appreciate the effort! I am in Canada and the only real way to get it is via a group plan from work. The same goes for long term disability insurance - a must have but usually only via work. Glad you are here!  Marfan's for me was mostly a \"quirk\" about myself until I hit my mid 20s.  Some minor surgery (then a big one at 27), I started to realize the financial and logistical burden I was dealing with most of my friends were not.  It can be nice talking here.  I have great, very supportive, friends but sometimes they can struggle to relate.  Plus side was all the medical billing and financial planning advice I was able to give when my friends started having children!\n\nYou may need to meet with a few different financial planners before you find someone you are confident in, but, mechanistically speaking, this is very similar to any other financial goal.  The implications may not be fun but the peace of mind may be worth it.  Good planning already includes things like discussing at home care (and how that interfaces with various government programs), so this is really no different; you just want to make sure you and your family are going to be OK in the event you are not.\n\nCondolences about figuring this out while the NHS has so much \"excitement\".  The US is certainly \"exciting\" as well, but it (hopefully) is going in the right direction.  Hope you and yours are doing OK as we are in the last miles of this weird year and a half.", "20 M.

Hello does anybody else has a constant fear of just dying out of nowhere? Right now my heart exams are okay but every time I feel my heartbeat irregular or I feel agitated I get very worried. This also leads me to very worried about the future. I know average Marfan lifespan is up to 70\u2019s right now but I still see people that die younger than that, e even with treatment. \nI am just worried. It is not constant, but I definitely feel it from time to time. I have survived 3 near death experiences related to Marfan, so it can feel really real sometimes. I do not know if I can offer too much advice, but what is helped me is trusting that my body will tell me if something is wrong.\n\nIf you want, you could talk to your cardiologist and see if they can give you any advice for feeling safer and more comfortable. Medicine is miles from where it used to be, and experts do everything they can to help us. Damn 3 experiences. Did you have an aneurysm?  What gene variant, if you do not mind me asking. Hope it is not one of the wild vascular ones Luckily no! I am getting preemptive surgery for that next summer since I am getting close to 5 cm.\n\nI was (accidentally, obviously) overdosed on anesthetic during my spinal fusion surgery (it was an 11 hr procedure instead of the normal 8). Then on fentanyl during my second VATS lung surgery (to prevent future spontaneous lung collapses). And then I got sepsis from a twisted ureter (made a UTI into a fast spreading kidney infection). Have not been hospitalized since 2019 tho so it is looking up haha &gt;twisted ureter\n\nWell damn, that is a new horror I never thought of before.  I did not either until I learned I had it \ud83d\ude05 Same thing happened when I got diagnosed with Marfan too, did not know it existed until I had it haha I used to get this all the time. Honestly, after having a mate die at 29 of cancer, and after seeing many famous people die (Kobe, XXX, etc) so out of the blue, i realised it can happen to anyone and not just Marfans.\n\nYou just got to make the most of it and live! Well I am religious and somewhat come to terms with, well, suddenly dying. I have made jokes of my condition to ease the worry, probably very morbid to others, but relieving to me. I am 19 btw, diagnosed at 16.\n\nPlus technically we could die any millisecond, so, why worry :D\n\nEdit: And yes I have had very rough heart pains already from stress and high blood pressure, even an ER visit- they said it was anxiety induced and nothing major. So sometimes our hearts play asshole tricks on us (but do not ignore consistent pain or really strong pain, I would see a doctor). - You will be fine bro, it is a crappy thing, but what are you going to do about it y\u2019know? Freaking yourself out (which is very normal) will not make this issue go away, so, just try to breathe, come to terms with it, and live your life while being smart (i.e. do not bench press 200lbs or join a boxing club). Nope. We could go any time from any cause. An old friend and I were actually talking about all the people we grew up with who have died since high school. There were a lot.

Yeah I feel I regularly stress about dying randomly, it gotten to a point were I caused anxiety attacks to occur, though I have not had them for a Solid year now. After reading the other people's comments on this thread, I feel way more at ease to the fact that we are all going to level up from this world, people and idols alike at random points in our existence;  it is 100% fact. Ever since I smoked the green in 2018 I have had a more spiritual idea of the afterlife and my perception of reality, basically just more grateful of the little moments and things.

My fianc\u00e9 does not do well with upkeep on himself, and he works construction. Drives me insane because he is setting a poor example for our daughter while she is enduring all the stuff. But she has her appointments and is up to date with everything but I think it is just forever my anxiety that will be there. Do they really sometimes plan preemptive surgery a whole year in advance? Hopefully! It is a pretty big one so I am going to try and schedule it at my biannual cardiology visit next month. If I cannot, I will just try again whenever they say I am able to. I had my preemptive surgery (aortic root repair with valve sparing)  6 months after the initial visit with my cardiologist. Waiting that long played a toll on me mentally but not so much physically Interesting, do you know typically how long after the initial visit they plan it for? I am assuming it is a case by case basis? I have been singing just hold on we are going home each time I have smoked the devils grass lately bc I am so sure it is my time and I can feel it happening then I wake up. Hopefully I keep waking up. Trying to live 1 day at a time. Not putting stress on my body. Keeping myself busy with things I love. Death is inevitable. Aneurysms will burst.

That is cool you made that group. I have Marfanoid Habitus chromosome 17p13.3.", "doc thought I had hEDS - rheumatologist says Marfan? Confused, help! I thought for sure that I had the hypermobility form of Ehlers-Danlos after it was brought up by multiple doctors and I checked off all the criterion in the latest checklist for it (and then some - including co-morbidities like mitral valve prolapse and POTS). However I am at an age now where osteoarthritis has set into all my joints and I can no longer pass the Beighton test except for my knees (which are severely unstable, along with my SI joints) and pinky fingers. I was 6 out of 9 on Beighton \\~20 years ago when diagnosed as \"hypermobile,\" now in middle age I am a 3. I do however still have the Walker-Murdoch wrist sign and Steinberg thumb sign for Marfan, as well as easily doing the \"reverse namaste,\" so the rheumatologist I saw for hEDS diagnosis is thinking I actually have a form of Marfan. I am relatively tall for a woman (a little over 5'9\"), thin with fairly long fingers and toes (though  definitely not as long as some of you all, people comment on them), and although I look like I have long arms enough for people comment on it, they do not quit reach the wingspan ratio required for a Marfan diagnosis. I have an extremely long torso for some reason, which runs in my family and makes it impossible to wear pants or one-piece swimsuits, but I have never seen that listed as a Marfan symptom. I have myopia (near-sighted). I had severe scoliosis as a child, which is now less severe thanks to a chiropractor and traction chair. I still have cervical kyphosis. I have many tall, thin family members with long fingers - that seems to come from my mother's side of the family.\n\nBecause of the mitral valve prolapse and my wingspan ratio not quite being right for Marfan, he thinks I have a related collagen disorder called \"MASS phenotype\" (which stands for Mitral valve, Myopia, Aorta, Skin and Skeletal features, according to google). The thing is, I am IN SO MUCH EXCRUCIATING PAIN. All. The. Time. I cannot concentrate, I cannot walk without a severe limp, I can only take baby steps to avoid the tearing sensation in my hip joints that comes from taking a normal stride. I cannot sleep because of the pain in all of my joints, I cannot sit for too long because of my unstable SI joints. And I partially dislocate my joints just from lightly stretching, and sometimes in my sleep. I also have dysautonomia (POTS) and I have only seen that associated with Ehlers-Danlos. My initial research into Marfan and MASS is not saying anything about severe pain as a symptom, and I have been having these painful partial dislocations in all my joints since I was 11 years old. Is this something people with Marfan experience that just is not widely known? Does anyone else have MASS form of Marfan? It does not sound like something that should cause such severe pain I guess? Thanks for any clarification you all can give me. I suggest you see a geneticist and get something like a TAAD panel genetic test to confirm Marfan or related disorders. I score full points on the Beighton scale, I should say that while I am diagnosed with MFS I have never been genetically tested for marfan vs EDS or any other connective tissue disorder, but my doctors do not consider it important because they are treating my symptoms, not my disease. Symptoms such as crippling pain from arthritis (including degenerative disc disease), dislocations, chiari malformation and dural ectasia. \n\nChiari malformation, for example, is not *known* to be a symptom of a connective tissue disorder, but mine is directly caused by my dural ectasia, therefore it is a symptom for me. Connective tissue disorders are usually classified as *syndromes* which means that not every patient has the same experience. My own brother is also diagnosed with Marfan, but he has a different experience than I.\n\nIf your doctors are for some reason unwilling to confirm via genetics, they should, at the least, be treating your symptoms, including your pain. I was told at 13 that I probably had it. At the time, my doctor thought a diagnosis was not necessary because we could treat the symptoms without needing one, and it would just add an unnecessary pre-existing condition to my file. So that is how I lived my life until the ACA passed and they did away with PECs. I got a TAAD panel done. Came back negative for the FBN1 marker but the geneticist still gave me a clinical diagnosis for MFS. Two weeks later, Trump gets elected and promises to undo the entire ACA. FML. I get dislocations in my shoulders, hips and jaw. I do not have osteoarthritis but I do have joint pain caused by improper joint support from weak connective tissue. Physical therapy can mitigate some of that pain. It has not really helped much in my hands though. I am also very prone to sprains, particularly in my back.\n\nFWIW I lived for over 20 years with no specific diagnosis. We all just knew there was some sort of connective tissue thing going on, and it was likely Marfan's. The symptom treatment does not change because of the diagnosis. The benefit of having the diagnosis is so that you know what else to look out for, and to keep your doctors aware of it. Since the biggest risk with MFS is vascular, and you already appear to be on top of that, then you are doing good regardless of whatever final diagnosis your doctors land on. I am scared to death of the ACA being undone (unless something better like m4a) is put in its place.", "LASIK Anyone here have successful lasik eye surgery? Hi guys I am someone who consistently is losing their glasses lol. They get pricey when you are vision is like ours. So I have had the idea of getting lasik done for years now. \n\nWondering if anyone\u2019s had any such procedures successfully performed. \n\nAny input is much appreciated! I am pretty sure LASIK is not recommended with Marfans because our tissue is already thin and LASIK thins it even more. I got LASIK about 3 years ago, and it is one of the best decision of my life.\n\nI took a risk because I heard from both the Marfan foundation and from an ophthalmologist that it was not recommended. I still went ahead and did it, and my surgeon and ophthalmologist said he was not worried about anything. A year after the first procedure I got my right eye re-done as part of warranty, and that is been the extent of any issues I have had. \n\nI highly recommend it if you are thinking about it, and your doctors agree that it will work. Do not do LASIK as the doctors at the Marfan foundation have good reasons not to. It includes how our corneas are and also risk to the lens. \n\nMy sister has had three cornea transplants. You get them from dead donors and your body may reject the tissue like what happened to her. \n\nLens implants are the normal treatment method for us. \n\n\n\n I figured but could not find much information on the particular subject", "Anyone with marfans experience frequent nosebleeds? I have been getting loads!  Nope. Are you on blood thinners? I used to get them a lot when I was a kid. Same.  Yes, I get them at least twice a week but sometimes every day.  No, nearly never.\n\nHave you checked your blood pressure? I get them this time of the year, especially when I have a cold. \n\nCombination of drier air, blood thinners, and more frequent nose-blowing.  Used to, until early 20s.. but for me it was more about the weather and seasonal changes.. I doubt it has anything to do with marfans.. Nope! Just beta blockers and Losartan! What about in your twenties? Really! What is your age? I am not on blood thinners though  I am in my late twenties and they are becoming more frequent!  I know this is from some days ago, but thought I would weigh in just to add to the dataset. I do not have nosebleeds. ", "I am really scared.  Hey there, take a nice slow deep breath.  You do not know for sure that you have it.  Lots of people are long and skinny and do not have Marfan's.  \n\nTake another nice slow deep breath.\n\nNow, if you do end up finding out that you have it, It is not as bad as you are making it out to be.   Life expectancy with preventative and managed care is pretty close to average.  You have made it this far without any medication and have had no major complications, that is great news for your aortic strength.  If you had a severe case (one where your life expectancy might be 1/3 of normal) you would have already  seen many serious warning signs.\n\nTake another deep breath.\n\nCurrently you have no control over whether or not you have Marfan's.  Do not waste your energy worrying about things you have no control over.    You are going to the doctor to get checked out, which is all you can do.  \n\nTake a deep breath.\n\nDo not make assumptions about your health, it will drive you insane.\n\nPM me if you want to talk more, I know how much medical induced anxiety sucks.   I have been through the ringer with Marfan's.. but I am still here, and I live a normal life.  In the event that you find out you have it (you might not) you can still live a normal life too. &gt; I am not a hypochondriac, but I am almost 100% confident I have this for sure. \n\nWell it is a good thing you are not a hypochondriac. Would not want to assure yourself you have a medical issue without any prior knowledge or a medical professional supplying an opinion on the matter.\n\nDo not stress, it will not change anything. It may be worth checking it out or at least get a cardiologist to look at your aorta. \nMarfan is not a death sentence, the mortality rate is not unusually high and even if you were to have it, there is methods to have a normal life. relax and go see a doctor.  I am 34 and have it and live a normal life, my brother and sister also have it and live normal lives.  My new born baby also carries the mutated gene.  Yes my mother had issues with it but no doctor ever tested her or even mentioned it to her and before her issues 5 years ago at age 57 and none of us children knew anything about it until after her issue.  My entire family except my father carry the gene and we are very involved with the Marfans foundation, the medical world is a beautiful thing and as long as you stay on top of it life will be fine.   You have a severely reduced life expectancy if it is untreated. Treated and managed, you will live a normal, full life. Diagnosed at 15, turning 25 now, and I have had no real problems. This guy's got the answer, definitely listen to him.\n\nI was diagnosed around 16, felt the same way for a bit. I am 40 now, and despite doing my damnedest to fuck my body up with drugs through my entire 20's, I am still here, and still fine. I have been taking a beta blocker (nadolol) since I was first diagnosed, and recently started on a blood pressure med (losartan), which has a good track record of keeping aortic dilation in check. \n\nHonestly, go to the doctor. They will likely send you to a cardiologist, who will image and monitor your aorta. You are NOT going to have a sudden random dissection, if it is monitored, because they will see it coming LONG before it happens. And take steps to prevent it, and -if it becomes necessary - fix it.  Treatment is getting better all the time.  If caught early enough, open heart surgery is not required.\n\n\n\nDisclaimer:  I do some work for this company. I would never heard of this but often wondered why it could not be done. After witnessing my mother's recovery from an ascending aorta aneurysm repair operation I have been really hoping for some miracle cure or less invasive treatment like this to come along before I need to go under the knife. They tried it in the 80's but they could not make it to fit.  Then computer imaging, CAD and 3D printing came along and made it possible.  But it took a patient's discontent with the established operation to make it happen. How does it handle valve issues? What if the valve needs replacing too? Minor regurgitation can sometimes be dealt with, but in essence the procedure is more prevention than repair.\n\nThe hospitals where the operations are performed are listed here:  \n\nPatients have travelled to London from outside the UK for the procedure. This guy travelled to the UK from Australia before the NZ centre was set up:\n\n", "What to expect from testing I have an appointment with a Marfan specialist in early September, and even though I will be almost 21 by then and I have had MVP my entire life I have never been to a cardiologist. A couple months ago I accompanied my grandmother (who also has MVP) to the hospital for circulatory abnormalities in her arms and legs, and after the doctors saw how hypermobile she and I both are they recommended we get checked out by cardiologists for connective tissue disorders. I also kept being told by my professor to see a cardiologist, because I am in training to be a healthcare technician and whenever my classmates do EKGs on me they always come out saying \"1st degree AV block, rightward axis, borderline EKG.\"   \n\n\nMy family thinks that there is probably nothing wrong beyond the MVP, because my grandmother was a world-class gymnast as a teen and young adult, and has lived into her 70s without serious heart problems. Plus, my mom has no symptoms of anything unusual except the hypermobility (which literally everyone in my family has). My aunt and cousins are all very tall and thin, and 3/4 of them have the bad circulation too, and one of them has the sunken sternum, but since my cousins' dad was also very tall and thin that might just be how they are built? I guess I should add that I can do the thumb sign easily, it is harder to tell if I can do the wrist sign because I have cubital tunnel and a right wrist brace, but I am pretty sure I can do it, but *barely.* Like they do not overlap, they just touch. (Nearsightedness and tooth crowding do also run in my family, but it is not like those are rare.)  \n\n\nI am simultaneously nervous and excited to be screened. I have been dealing with feeling like my body is 85 years old since I was ten, with migraines, fibromyalgia, and bad circulation causing all kinds of cold and dizziness. If they can figure out a defined diagnosis that there is treatments for, and it helps me feel better, that would be SO amazing. But also, I do not want my family to be affected by a disease that will limit their lives at all going forward, one of my cousins is only 7 and she loves sports :(   \n\n\nI guess I am asking how I should prepare? Both for the appointment when it happens, and also for receiving the news, whether I have it or not. What was being screened for Marfan like for you, and learning that you had it? Other than an echocardiogram and EKG, what tests will they do? How long will it take? And since the wait time is so long, does a positive result seem likely enough that I should be encouraging my cousins to get appointments now, instead of waiting for my results, and then they could just cancel if I am negative? Thank you :) ", "How to Increase Height for Marfan's Syndrome? i want to be little bit fat\n\ni already ate 3 times a day and sometimes go outside to jogging, but its still same", "Tips and hints on working out with Marfan Syndrome Hey everyone, I was wondering if anyone could share their personal hints and tips when it comes to working out when you have marfan's.  \n\n\nNow I know we should not be weight lifting heavily and all of that stuff. However, I am interested in finding a routine to make my body leaned muscle (as much as possible within the marfan's spectrum). I hope this thread and the responses serve as a guide for other people looking into the same thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I have questions such as:  \n\\- What diet do you recommend?  \n\\- What kind of exercises to minimize the formation of \"belly fat\" secondary to increasing our caloric intake?  \n\\- What kind of exercises in general to create lean-slim athletic body?\n\n\\-When it comes to weight lifting, we all know that it is very detrimental as the increased blood pressure has very very veery bad effects on the aorta secondary to the mechanical stress, however, this varies a lot based on where we are located within the marfan spectrum (consult a cardiologist first), but essentially, what kind of light weights and routines would be ideal for us?\n\n\\- Are light calisthenics good for us? I really want to emphasize that this thread's purpose is not to endorse or promote the non-recommended activities set by the marfan foundation's guideline. Instead, I want people to talk about what is worked for them and produced results based on their own individual case.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWeight lifting is not recommended in general for patients with Marfans. However, this is on average. Marfan's is actually a spectrum and depending where you are located in that spectrum your limitation are different. So, for anyone wondering please talk to your cardiologist first before indulging in any sort of heavy weight lifting activity. I did weightlifting and my retina detached sooo i am never going to do it again ouch really? How did it happen? How did you notice? How much weight were you pulling? It just happened i had never done weightlifting before but I was doing it and suddenly  my vision started to some black spots and then next day I started noticing that I am having  lightning flashes whenever I move my head so I went to the ER and it was confirmed so I had to undergo surgery and I am still recovering from it even though it happened like 7 months ago.\n\nAbout the weights clearly it was too much as it caused such a major problem haha\n\nPlease be careful while exercising it is really not a joke to do it with marfans. I personally have been exercising with weights that I know I can finish a full \"workout\" with, in short, I try to avoid weights that have me straining really hard, you know how people say you have you give it all you got to get that one last rep going? I never do that as I know it will put a  lot of strain on my heart, if I cannot finish a set, I will move on to the next exercise.  \n\n\nIt takes longer to get results, however it has helped me a lot. I also play futsal even though I know I should not really do it, but I take care and listen to my body, if I get too tired, stop. I was told to avoid Isometric exercises like weightlifting by my cardiologist - it can cause all sorts of things to detach/ burst from pressure- ive also had 2 hernias (very common in Marfans)\n\nfrom my understanding you were lucky to only get a retinal detachment!\n\nBetween the Cardio issues and the Joints i was advised to stick to:\n\n*  Walking - at a fast pace where holding a conversation is difficult but not impossible\n* Cycling - though as i have terrible balance they would prefer i used a static bike\n* Swimming\n\ni think this is probably more restrictive that in needs to be - my doctor at the time believed i was more ill than i was and none of the cardiologists i ave seen since have been as restrictive - but they also said they did not know enough to advise me. Which has been a really common problem for me.   \nEverything says \"Marfans is a spectrum, speak to your doctor!\" but the doctors are rarely marfans specialists - they may only treat a few patients and many of them tell me they just do not know which is really frustrating!\n\n**as a general Marfans rule avoiding contact sports and weightlifting are the main recommendations**\n\nas a child/teen i was told not to do team sports as you may feel pressured to push yourself beyond what you body is capable/comfortable with which could lead to injury\n\nI do like Yoga and i have found myself getting stronger from that - however my POTS (high Marf Comorbidity) makes going from the floor bits to the stood up bits hard. You will need to focus on diet if you want to gain (or lose) mass. \n\nIf your goal is gaining, I would focus on 1) getting enough protein (1g per lb of body mass) 2) getting enough calories (seriously - buy a food scale, download My Fitness Pal, and track everything) and 3) try to accomplish 1 &amp; 2 without resorting to the \u201csee food\u201d eat everything dirty bulk diet. Eating a bunch of hyper-palatable processed foods will work fine for gaining muscle if you are getting enough protein, but you will also likely overshoot your calorie goal, resulting in more fat gain than you wanted. It also might make you feel like crap, leave you nutrient deficient, give you too much of bad things (like sodium or saturated fat), or form unhealthy eating habits. So I would try to have at least 80% of my calories coming from a healthier diet. Meats (and not even necessarily lean ones\u2014fat = calories and you want calories if you are gaining), vegetables, fruit, legumes, nuts, whole grains, dairy if you can handle it. Does not need to be complicated, and if you learn to shop and cook it does not need to be expensive. Protein powders are a great way to get more protein and nut butters are a great way to get more calories if you need them.\n\nOf course, you will not gain muscle if you do not stimulate your muscles. That is hard for people with Marfan; we cannot do the heavy lifting that is great for strength training (due to exponential spike in blood pressure when our bodies are under that much stress). We also cannot do high-intensity low-weight workouts, as that would get our heart rate up. So, in terms of weight lifting, that leaves us doing low speed, low weight, high rep workouts. If you are progressively overloading your muscles via these workouts they will work. They are just going to take a long time and be boring. \n\nI am not sure about body weight exercises/ calisthenics, but I think you are fine doing them to some degree, as you need to be able to support and move your body in real life. I would not have calisthenics be the core of my training program, though\u2014that is too much weight and too much potential stress. \n\nI like swimming, cycling, and rucking for cardio, but strength training needs to come first when trying to gain. I have been using resistance bands (pulling from a door handle and also squats with them) and have noticed some muscle gain on my arms and legs. It is not\nmuch at all but I will take any improvement I can get. Have you gotten any results mass wise? And may I ask how long it took for you? Ive been going to the gym for 2 months now. Dr recomended biking a swimming, so i enjoy the exercycle for my problematic knees and ankles. I have been doing weights and seen results in my arms, but the weights are usually 10Kg dumbbells, or upto 35Kg plates. Pilates. Pilates. Pilates. \n\nI started with no core strength. Could not touch my toes. Start with a video geared toward older folks. Back when in person classes were a thing, I was always the youngest person in the room. The teachers are able to help with modifications. Good youtubers have modifications. Work on your core with very very very gentle repetitive movements. Do not go past your edge. You will get stronger and be proud of 5he work you are doing. GL", "Marfan\u2019s and Weight Gain I have not even tested for Marfan\u2019s yet, but I am 99% sure I have it. I am 16 years old, I am 6\u20192, I have a long, narrow body, long fingers, long toes, flat feet, long feet, crowded teeth, disproportionately long SKINNY legs compared to upper body, stretch marks on back and on thighs, pectus excavatum, small weak wrists, abnormally curved spine, heart often feels offbeat at random times (do not know ab this, could be stress). I find it hard to believe I coincidentally have all of these symptoms and DONT have marfans; actually, the chances of me coincidentally having all of these symptoms WITHOUT it being related to marfans are less than the chances of me being born with marfans. My mom was not tested for it either but she clearly has it being abnormally tall (5\u201910), extremely skinny and has most of the symptoms. \n\nI just want to know if it is possible to gain muscle mass on my body. I hear people saying you cannot gain weight and you should not try (because of the possible aortic complications), then theres people saying you can gain weight, and that they have tried it and succeeded. I am sick and tired of not fitting into pants and clothes. It is not that my legs are too long, it is that they are extremely skinny. I have to buy XL shirts and hoodies simply because my arms are too long for a large, even though a large is perfect for my torso length. \n\nI have a doctors appointment set up in the coming months, where I will get to ask all of these questions, but I have been wondering if my weight gain efforts are all for nothing. Or that I simply will not ever be able to get rid of my \u270f\ufe0f legs and arms.  Age will most likely solve weight gain in the future. Especially if you are eating a high carb diet. Which is not necessarily the healthiest by some standards. But if you are trying to gain mass and muscle then you are going to have a really hard time. Yes people with Marfan\u2019s have a hard time gaining weight typically. Most see this as a good thing lol, but as a lad who is abnormally skinny I completely understand why you want to fill out. Everyone is body is different and reacts different to weight gain and Marfan\u2019s so it is hard to tell really. I want to help you any way I can but you have to realize the most important thing right now is determining if you and Marfan\u2019s, either genetically or clinically, and then treating the symptoms. Your family needs to be tested as well. This is very urgent. You sound like a Marfanoid but exhibiting all those external features does not always mean that you have it, which would be a blessing. \n\nYou need to see someone who is familiar with the syndrome and if you need guidance please go to the Marfan foundation for further assistance. If you have any other questions please ask away.  Are you a male or a female? For a male I would not say you stand out for Marfans by height alone. My little brother was the same height at your age for example, Marfan free. But all the other things make up for your concerns, so it is good you check it out.\n\nI am a female and I am 6\u20192\" 70 kg  (154 lbs), and I started gaining weight the moment I started on my birth control pills, cause they make me crave for food. Think I gained about 10 kg (22 lbs) that year (17 years old), and now it is stabilized. Before I only ate when I was hungry. Now I am pretty much snacking all day (healthy things mostly). So yeah, eating much more and often was what helped me. But those are obvious things that you probably tried.  I cannot really help with the weight gain thing but I Can day that if you need jeans. America eagle sells super skinny jeans in 30x36 for pretty cheap  You can gain *weight* but gaining muscle is something different entirely. Gaining muscle requires eating a surplus + a lot of hard work, and the hard work is what is bad for our hearts and other tissues. \n\nGaining fat just requires eating in excess. Anyone can do that, even a marf. If you \"cannot gain weight\" you are just not eating enough no matter what you think.  Putting on muscle mass is going to depend primarily on the  condition of your heart, and secondarily on the condition of your connective tissues.  You will need an echo cardiogram to check your heart, and you should get a cardiologist to clear you before you try to start lifting big or running distances.  \n\nOn the connective tissues, you will have to be very aware of the strains you are putting on your joints. With that in mind swimming may be the best option.  \n\nI have a relatively mild case that still allows me to be active. I have also done a bulk that added 25 lbs of muscle, so it is possible to gain.  \n\nBut get a doctor's advice before you start pumping iron and downing protein shakes. American Eagle has the best jeans omg How was your TDEE while bulking? Significantly higher?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI ask because my doctor suspects that I might have Marfan syndrome. I am going to the cardiologist tomorrow. I went to the doctor after my inability to bulk. At first I was eating 2500 like prescribed in TDEE calculator. Nothing happened so I was increasing by 250 kcal every two weeks or so and now I am eating 3500 kcal and nothing happens yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have long fingers, very narrow shoulders and long limbs, stretch marks, had my bones broken / dislocated quite often for little to no reason and so forth. I have no problems with vision though. Normally I thought it is just the way I am and I am just eating not enough. But now as I am counting calories and lifting everything seems much more suspicious. I ran between 3500 and 3800. I stopped because my gaining stalled and I could not see putting in 4000 or more every day.   So you needed 3500 to gain any weight at all? It was not \"dirty bulk\" in terms of weight gain rate but more something like \"normal\" people experience with +500 calorie surplus?\n\nAlso - when you built the muscle how was your ability to maintain it? Could you just return to a \"normal\" diet and exercise for maintenance or were you forced to eat so much food on a regular basis?", "went through the aortic surgery and docs fixed my pectus carinatum as a gift  I have marfan and had to do the aortic surgery, before the procedure I asked the surgeon if they could do something with my chestbone (wich was very salient) before they close my chest. he awsered \"we will see what we can do, your heart is the priority\".\n\nI had already gave up on it, but when I woke up it was ALMOST FULLY FIXED. I have not paid for it but the docs told me it was easy to do since it was just the way they closed that made all the difference.\n\nIt may not be possible in all cases, but ask your surgeon if it is not possible too, you never know!!! Where do you live. And that is awesome! Brazil!! That is cool. I was supposed to have both mitral and aortic valves done but apparently I am an arkward person and they only did one.

However, his eyesight is pretty good and he is not very flexible.\n\nOne time I went with him to the doctor, who insisted on checking his thyroid (even though it apparently gets checked every year.) Nothing wrong with his thyroid, as usual. I wanted to ask if he would been checked for marfans but I figured the doctors would have thought of that and did not want to hear from a nerdy dumbass with no formal medical training. So I kept my mouth shut.\n\nAfter the appointment however, I started thinking about myself and how doctors never realized I had Asperger\u2019s until I asked them about it, doctors misdiagnosed pain from my nighttime bruxism as an ear infection and doctors had refused to test me for Lyme disease (which I had) until I explained what it was to them, so just from my experience I have met several medical professionals with tunnel vision. I am not even sure if the doctor would heed my worry if I was to voice it, but I kind of wish I would said something anyway.\n\nHe was 20 at the time of that appointment and is now 21. Is it possible for a lifelong genetic condition to go unnoticed and undiagnosed for over 2 decades? I know the only definitive way to check for a genetic disorder is through genetic testing, but how many criteria must be fulfilled and which is the most important criterion to identifying it? And what precautions (like regular EKGs) must be taken until/unless he can be genetically tested?\n\nTLDR NOT ASKING FOR A DIAGNOSIS, just if it is possible for someone with some but not all criteria to be diagnosed later in life and how important it is to get medical treatment for it. He does not like going to the doctor so I would have to convince him if I think getting him tested is worth his time. More than you likely want to know. As marfans is more or less a collection of issues that when grouped together becomes a marfans patient. I never really listened to my doctors in the beginning but say you have 3 out of the 20 common issues a marfans patient can have. As you do not have 8 out of twenty you are simply a person woth those issues. \n\nHeart murmurs \n\nScoliosis \n\nAcme\n\nAnd other ailments are just simply that ailments and you need to either have so many or be genetically tested to confirm that you have enough of them to make you a marfans patient. \n\nSome of these ailments only come later in life and each person can have mild case of marfans which makes.it a minor inconveniences to extreme that they are requiring surgery at 2 months old.\n\nMost of the ailments of marfans in my opinion are just minor inconveniences. Blindness and aortic dissection seem to be two of the major ones. But many people habe scoliosis or are tall.\n\nAn EKG should be done to check his heart and aorta for ballooning. If he does have a ballooned aorta it should be measured on the ekg to see if it is in a healthy range.\n\nBut again people can have these ailments and not be marfans patients it is only until they collect so many of the ailments that they are marked as a marfans patient. Just to clarify, you cannot see the size of the aorta with an EKG. That requires an echocardiogram. Please have your BF see a cardiologist to have his heart checked. Not just an EKG. Please request an echo or a CT scan. Over half the people with Marfan are diagnosed after death. I have been genetically tested and do not have severe eye or lung problems. He also could have Marfan Habitus and not have Marfan. Even then it is safer to treat as Marfan than to not. \n\nAlso, most doctors I have ever come across I have had to educate on what Marfan is. So, the fact that his have missed it for 2 decades does not surprise me. You may very well end up having to fight or find a new doctor in order to see a cardiologist or get testing. Yes, it is absolutely possible for Marfan Syndrome specifically (and, I am sure, other genetic disorders) to go completely unnoticed for the patient's entire life. There are plenty of anecdotes actually, of basketball players and other athletes literally collapsing on the floor during a game because they did not know they had it. Forgive the example, I am not telling you that to scare you, I am just trying to convey that it can and does happen all the time.\n\nThe reason for this is primarily because Marfan Syndrome expresses differently in every patient. For some, it is downright obvious, but others not at all.\n\nHere is what I would do: If you go to the ( they have a page on (\n\nAnd on behalf of your partner, thanks for looking out! It really is observant people speaking up that leads to people finding out they have it. That is how it was for my brother and I, an observant school nurse spoke up and said something to my mom, who got us tested. You can save a person's life. yes, mom found out at age 58 when she coughed while sleeping and her aorta ruptured 14hr open heart surgery she survived the 5% chance of making it.  She had never heard of Marfan and neither had any of us.  Now myself and three siblings have all been tested and have the mutated gene.  I passed it down to my daughter.  My brother is the only one that doctors thought might have it before the gene testing. Unrelated but hearing a woman dated a guy with his appearance definitely gives me some hope. How old are you, if you do not mind my asking? 33(M) I just made a post on this topic so I will not repeat myself here, but I feel like this is a conversation worth having. A lot of women like lanky guys. The world is filled with lots of people and there is always someone out there who will love you just the way you are.\n\nI am not perfect anyway. I am a foot shorter than him, socially awkward and very nerdy. But he likes my quirks and I like his and that is what love is all about, appreciating each other as you are. I am sufficiently terrified now", "Does taking/eating collagen help? My boyfriend has Marfans and is a member of this community. We were wondering if a collagen rich diet would be useful.

I have a lot of symptoms associated with marfans, and lately I have started getting blurred vision every day for like 10-60 minutes, can that be a sign of marfans? Whether or not it may be a sign, no idea. \n\nBut you should definitely schedule a eye exam as soon as possible. Yeah I am going to a doctor soon, but if it is a sign of marfans, then I would be pretty sure I have marfans, I am 14 years old, 183cm tall, with a 190 wingspan and I have thin bones, so I think I might have marfans maybe Do you get a headache afterwards?

Call your PCP or schedule an appointment with an ophthalmologist I also suffer from migraines, but i get the vision thing every day now, and i only get migraines every other month. But i get the vision thing and i get dizzy and then it just disappears", "Posted in r/tall asking about experiences related to surgery for Marfan's and was informed this sub existed. Glad to learn of the community and want to extend my same questions to all of you. Hey all, originally I posted in r/tall about this but was kindly referred here.\n\nLittle backstory, I am a 26 year old male, from.the U.S. and have been diagnosed with Marfans since I was 16. This past November I had a CT scan that showed my aorta had grown from 4.2cm to 4.8 and and my cardiologist has recommended surgery after my next check up next year to see if I get to a full 5cm dilation.\n\nNow outside of normal fear, anxiety and the odd existential crisis, I find what is causing me grief is that I do not know what to expect or what to do with myself leading up to the procedure.\n\nI have stopped engaging in almost all of my bad habits, upped my workout routine to include more low impact exercise, started to eat healthier and overall started to care more about my own happiness and keeping  positive.\n\nBut I am still very anxious about the surgery itself. If anyone can comment with an anecdote or information about their experiences regarding surgery it would be extremely comforting.\n\nAny information would be useful, such as how you felt leading up to the surgery, lifestyle changes you made pre/post surgery.\n\n\nWhat to expect, what you didnt expect, how long recovery took, the costs related to surgery and everything supplemental, etc.\n\n\nReally anything on the matter that is significant would be useful to me as I traverse the next year trying to be healthier as I get ready for the surgery itself.\n\nThank you for your time. Marfan's Syndrome covers a wide range of conditions, so it is hard to predict where you will fall and how you are body is going to react to the procedure.\n\nIn my case, I recovered remarkably well from my Aortic Bypass and valve replacement. I say remarkably because I thought that, at 32, my life was over, and I was going to be in a delicate state, and pill-dependent, for the rest of my life.\n\nMy surgery brought me a lot of self-awareness and self-compassion. I mean, I am still hard on myself, when I have aches and pains, but  at least I know where they are coming from, and have learned to handle them better.\n\nThis is weird, but something that has made me fell less isolated is following Marfan's related hashtags on instagram. It shows me there are other with this condition who have lives and experiences, and carry on despite the adversity.\n\nKeep on being good to yourself. You are doing the right things. And you are young besides. You will do great. The one thing I would have done differently is be more healthy and fit going in to make recovery all the easier. After surgery you will be weak as a kitten, but that is ok. Just get up and walk around whenever you get the chance. You will be back on your feet in no time. \nIf you ever want to talk about it, DM me. Happy to chat.  Hey man. I had my surgery at the age of 19. I am 28 now. You will do great my friend! Mind over matter. Keep positive. And stay motivated to do the breathing exercises and rehab they tell you to do! Those are so so so important to avoid getting pneumonia and blood clots. It will hurt yes but feeling pain is better than being dead right? My Marfans damn near killed me, I was told if I had not gone in to the docs when I did, I would have had a dissection I would not have made it back from. Moral of the story, never ignore chest pain at any age. I was young and stupid and it almost cost me my life. Best of luck! Please keep us updated on your surgery date and stuff. STAY STRONG! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f I was 17 when I had my first surgery (aortic root replacement)  I did similar things leading up to it, got myself in shape, ate healthy, etc. It definitely helps to be in the best shape you can be.  You may even want to put on a few extra pounds because you will lose weight from laying around and recovering.\n\nMy experience was pretty much ideal, I did not have any complications and was out of the hospital in 5 days.  I think the worst part is coughing / sneezing, because your sternum is broken.  They should give you a firm pillow or something to hug (brace your sternum) when you need to cough or sneeze, which surprisingly helps a lot to reduce the pain.\n\nThe most important thing to remember is this: give your doctors and nurses as much information you can so they can help you.  If you feel really anxious pre-op, tell them and they can give you something to relax you.  If your pain is really bad, tell them because they can manage it better, etc.\n\nSounds like you are on top of everything, you will do great! Thank you for your comment we all could use your advice and show ourselves more compassion.\n\nIt is actually funny I had just learned February was Marfans awareness month and posted on Instagram about it and found so many posts others had made and even had someone relate and talk to me about their experience, so yes even social media is useful. Thank you for your kind words, offer and encouragement!\n\nI am glad people like you and the other commenters are apart of this community. Dude thank you for your encouragement, as soon as I saw the hearts i knew this was going to be an uplifting comment.\n\nAnd knowing someone made it through at 19 and is going strong is a powerfully positive motivator. Hell yeah. Going strong for sure. Take your meds and just be conscious of your health, you will be just fine fam. I know it. Keeping ya in my prayers for sure. \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb Thank you for all of this advice, I will definitely utilize this knowledge and make sure I keep myself and everyone involved aware of how I am feeling before I go under and during recovery. And if anyone has an idea of the cost of surgery, with or without insurance that would be extremely useful to me.\n\nI made a joke after I found out I needed surgery that I would have to crowdfund my surgery and I really hope it remains just a joke.", "Is it worth getting genetic counseling when I have mild symptoms? My father was born with a coarctation of the aorta and died of a ruptured thoracic aortic aneurysm when he was in his 30's. One of dad's siblings was born with a coarctation as well, but had surgery to correct it. Both of them had many Marfan symptoms, but were never officially diagnosed.\u00a0\n\nI have mild mitral valve prolapse, but am short in stature unlike my father. I have a few other mild symptoms that may or may not be Marfan related. Fifteen years ago, I got an ECG and a CT scan and everything came back normal. Lately I have been thinking I need to get my MVP checked again just to be safe, so I contacted my doctor via email yesterday. I asked her about another ECG and possibly genetic counseling to rule out Marfan's. She replied and said she would be more than happy to refer me to a genetic counselor. She did not mention the ECG I had asked her about though.\u00a0\n\nNow that I may actually be getting genetic counseling, I am starting to have some fears and doubts and therefore have a few questions:\u00a0\n\n1) Is it worth getting genetic testing even when I have such mild symptoms of possible Marfan's? Does the clarification of genetic testing really help? \n\n2) Does a diagnosis of Marfan's help with insurance billing (like with ECG's, etc) or does it make dealing with insurance more difficult?\u00a0\n\nThank you in advance for any help or advice. I am no expert but there are a host of related connective tissue disorders and perhaps other genetic mutations that a genetic counselor and screening may uncover. For my daughter the genetic test revealed nothing however she has every Marranos symptom.   So genetics is not a silver bullet diagnosis. But a good counselor may be able to connect the dots that other doctors may have missed.   \n\nI do not know the impact on insurance except that we had to drop Kaiser and go with a high-deductible plan in order to get into Stanford\u2019s Marfan Clinic. \n\nBest of luck.  Wow, such a good point. I had not even thought about other disorders that may possibly be uncovered through genetic testing, but that would definitely be helpful too.\n\nThank you for your reply and for sharing your particular situation, I really appreciate it. It is a common thing that gets said here: if you have symptoms focus on those before the diagnosis.  Does it matter if it is an alligator or a crocodile you are wrestling it in the moment?\n\nThat being said, a GC is a great idea.  It does not sound like you are showing many symptoms.  A GC is going to get into your family history more than a typical doc would, and as mentioned, may be considering other connective tissue dis-orders.\n\nRe: insurance:. I think it makes it a bit easier.  I have never had push back for my annual MRI because it is the only way to monitor my aorta and there is documentation it needs to be monitored.  Without a diagnosis, I am sure the doc could make their case to the insurance company, but it probably makes it easier.\n\nThere are a few things that a diagnosis can complicate, but it is small potatoes.  Im required to get \"key man\" insurance for work, I would like to get my pilots liscence which requires a physical.  Once it is on paper there are things that may come up but it is trivial compared to getting the treatment you need. It is funny you say that about alligators versus crocodiles because I was thinking something similar the other day....that it is not about getting diagnosed with Marfan's. Marfan's is just a label. This is really about my heart. My current thought process right now is to get genetic testing and if I have inherited any abnormalities of the aorta or a connective tissue disorder that can potentially affect my heart, then I need to begin to monitor my heart on a regular basis. Because that is something I have not been doing at all and I am getting a little worried that I have let it go for so long.\n\nOn the other hand, if nothing comes back from my genetic testing, I will be a lot less concerned about my heart murmur in general and probably will not be getting it monitored all the time.\n\nThank you for the info about insurance and thank you so much for your help and advice. There are so many unknowns with connective tissue disorders that it can be really scary sometimes when I think about all of the \"what ifs.\" So receiving encouragement and affirmation on Reddit really helps ease my anxiety.\u00a0 I am short, too, as are most of my family members, and we just keep dying of this shit. Please get what testing you can afford. I would error on the side of caution and have it done. I have never had any health issues related to Marfan but I had a doctor suggest to me that I should be tested when I was 20. I thought he was nuts and never thought about it again until my son at age 20 had a heart attack and is possibly Marfan (they are dealing with his heart issues before sending him to a geneticist). My ex (son\u2019s father) had/has a pectus excavatum but had it corrected surgically before we met so I did not even know he had it until our son had a heart attack. Mind you knowing that we may have passed this on to our son may have caused us not to have him (and I am so blessed to be his mother) Instill wish I had known -for the simple fact that I could have gotten him treatment early-before he had heart problems. He also has mild scoliosis, he wore braces for 7 years, his vision is gradually getting worse, he had stretch marks on his back, he is 6\u20196 170. \n\nMy son does not want to be tested so his dad and I will probably have to be. I keep telling having the test will not give you to disorder.  My grandfather and mother had similar cases to your father. My brother is short and pudgy, I am tall and slim. *Both of us* are diagnosed. \n\nI would say it is worth it even if you are 100% positive you have no symptoms but MVP. Even if you do not have Marfan you could have a similar condition that could cause problems for you as you get older which also needs to be watched, and though you do not have strong symptoms now, establishing a network of care and a plan could be vital to your survival.  The alligator/crocodile thing is a good analogy because it works both ways.  There is differences in how you would fight one vs the other, but first priority is not getting bit!\n\nYour strategy sounds good.  To put your mind (a bit) at ease, a heart murmur is probably not dangerous without symptoms.\n\nYour family history gives you reason to investigate some things, but you should not be panicking.  They will size you up.  What kind of doctor have you been talking to?  A cardio or your GP?\n\nA lot of connective tissue disorders are \"do not panic, but do not neglect it\" kind of affairs.  Try not to do the \"what if\" to much, you will drive yourself nuts. Recently I have been talking to my GP about all of this, and she is been straightforward with me saying that she only wants me to see specialists and not her. So that is good. She is in the process of getting me set up with the genetic counselor right now. Then if need be, she will refer me to a cardiologist.\u00a0I feel like for now this is a good game plan.\n\nIt is good to know that a mild heart murmur probably is nothing...I can only hope. But hopefully the gentetic testing will help shed some light on how concerned I really should be about it.\u00a0\n\nYeah...I will try not to overthink the what if scenarios!! Easier said than done, but I will try. :-) \n\nThank you again, I really appreciate it!  Thank you for your honesty. You are so right, this is something that always needs to be taken seriously. I am sorry your family members keep dying. Every single day I think about my dad and wish he was still here. He was walking around fine one day, then suddenly he was just gone. He was so young too, and practically had his whole life ahead of him. I miss him so much. These disorders are not a joke.\u00a0 Wow, thank you so much for sharing your story. This is what I need to hear. Because I have moments when I start thinking to myself, \"Am I overreacting about all of this?\" From what I am hearing from everyone is comments here (including yours), I cannot be too cautious. It is better to get tested just to be safe. Thank you.\u00a0 Excellent thank you for this advice. This was something I have been wondering all along but cannot seem to find any definitive answers for on the internet...could I be fine for 40 years with my MVP, then suddenly start having problems later on in life? Even my GP did not seem to have an answer to that. So I appreciate hearing that yes, it is very possible. Which means I am even more sure about the need to get genetic counseling, which I definitely will do. Thank you again for your advice.  Totally!\n\nBecause you are anxious, I just want to give you a heads up.  They will likely order some tests and imaging to make sure everything in the short term is ship shape, after that it is not unusual to get a lot of half answers.  Maybe you have got signs for X, but some for Y, but Z better explains...  Important thing as we talked about is monitoring (if it is even decided it is important).  I am just pointing it out so you do not get to stressed if you do not get a black and white answer.  \"Not sure of exact diagnosis\" is OK if they are watching the right things or have reason to believe things do not need to be watched.  It may take a while for an exact diagnosis and that is just fine.  Remember most diseases were categorized by symptom before we even knew what DNA was (interesting aside, we knew about time dialation and had proved the speed of light and speed limit a full half century before we knew why you looked like your parents).  Hell, Marf diagnosis originated at a time when organic chemistry was still defined as \"chemistry done with the excretions or extractions from meat\".  The ball and stick model of organic compounds was 50 years out still.  Point is, as powerful as genetic testing is, it does not always mesh 1:1 medicine.  It is only very recently that we have come to understand the root cause of things, but we have been monitoring and treating for much longer.\n\nFor reference, I never got the genetic testing.  I may not even have \"marfans\" (although I check a lot of the usual boxes).  I was satisfied we were hunting the beast well, be it crock or gator.\n\nFinally, if they do recommend any kind of annual monitoring, stick to it.  For years I had annual imaging, and for life reasons I skipped 1 year (had to reschedule and just kept pushing out).  Come to find out during that 2 year gap my cardiac output was half of what it should have been.  I did not feel any symptoms at the time but post surgery I could tell how sick I had been; it was like a new body.\n\nSo yeah, a lot of this stuff comes down to: \"Do not panic, but do not write off\".  Fun is not it? Yeah, lots of fun! Lol. Interesting history, btw. But this is very helpful. I am glad to have a head's up about what to expect and that I need to be ok with grey areas. It sounds like it is a process and/or a journey and everything will not be figured out in one day.\u00a0  Yes I wish I had listened to the doctor when I was 20 but ultimately I am so thankful to have my son. He is such a gift and blessing.

I am a 22 f with Marfan. I also work in the field doing biomedical research on the disease. First and foremost, please do not be scared. Marfan itself is quite rare, and is even rarer for those whose parents are unaffected (like yourself!). This is just my advice, but I would trust your GP. If your aorta looks good, that is really all that matters. The only \u00ab\u00a0scary\u00a0\u00bb part of MFS is the chance of aorta rupture and if yours looks good, you have got nothing to worry about. \nIf you would like an affirmative yes or no, there is a genetic test that will tell you definitively. It looks for mutations in the FBN1 gene and is therefore specific to Marfan. \nLong story short- do not worry! Trust your doctors. All medical doctors who have made it through school know MFS and know what to be on the lookout for. I promise! Hope this helps. Thank you so much!", "I am a Marf with Type 1 diabetes, but I can still do stuff.

I decided to search up why and Marfan came up , I do get random chest pain , went to hospital last year got blood and and ekg and chest X-ray , everything normal , are these signs of Marf ", "Can I go to the gym? Hi, all my life (I am 25) I have avoided all exercise but 4 months ago I started going to the gym to try to gain some muscles and improve fitness since despite being a normal weight I am and always have been exceptionally unfit. About 2 months ago I started to seriously suspect I had Marfans (I have many of the features of it). When I started to suspect it I stopped all cardio and started only going 2-3 times a week (before I was going 3-4) but 4 weeks ago I started getting chest pains (right where my heart is, very isolated pain, brief but painful) in the gym, so I stopped going after a week, and since then I have not been going but I have been getting the pains seemingly randomly throughout the day, sometimes they are quite severe, and about a week or 2 ago I had it where straining on the toilet was causing pain on my heart and the harder I strained the more it hurt (I have chronic constipation) and the next day it hurt almost constantly for about 4 hours. I ended up going to a doctors clinic but the receptionist sent me to an emergency room where they did ecg/bp/oxygen% but that was all normal. After that episode I have been so tired I have been sleeping up to about 80% of the time but in the last week I think I have been getting less pain and am able to be awake a bit more.\n\nYesterday I was finally able to see a doctor (due to moving recently I had not been able to), and he seemed to think it was definitely worth following up and has now referred me to a genetic clinic for testing. So I guess it is just a wait now until I find out.\n\nHowever... I really do not want to lose the (admittedly small) amounts of muscle I have gained over the last few months, so I really would like to go to the gym. I have read that doing large sets of small-weight reps is nearly as effective as the standard of doing smaller sets of heavier weights for building muscles, and that this may be less-unsafe with Marfans, so that is what I would be doing. But I do not know if its a good idea, I worry that with the pain symptoms I have been having (if they are related to Marfans) then I may have already seriously damaged something by using the gym and that next time I go everything will just explode... I would definitely speak to your doctor before doing any sort of physical activity, given the happenings of the last 8 weeks. It sounds like there is already some concern for a larger medical issue here, and to me, it does not seem safe to continue the activities that first prompted the visit to the ER without a doctor's okay. Everything online says that light exercise is encouraged.  Things like competitive sports, heavy lifting, and other high impact/intensity activities (boxing, etc) are no-nos.  (I only recently learned this and it is kind of turned me on a head as a former athlete).  That being said, I would wait to do anything until you hear back from your doctor. Thanks, yeah the doctor did say I should probably not go to the gym for now until I know about until we find out if I have Marfans. I have never been into sports so I will stay away from those anyway. What do you think about hiking? The town I recently moved to is surrounded by (small) mountains that it is very common to hike up Thanks, I think I will follow yours and the doctors advice, though I do not yet know for certain that going to the gym prompted the pain symptoms, they just coincided and I speculate that if it turns out that I have Marfans then that could be the link Pretty sure stuff like that is fine as long as you are not overexerting yourself.  The main thing is to not put extra strain on your heart.  Listen to your body and rest when you need to.\n\nI have known I have had Marfans for awhile now and have had to make a lot of adjustments to the way I work out.  I played soccer and danced until I graduated high school and then went on to do Krav Maga and boxing in college.  Even though I have known I had Marfans for awhile, I had no idea so many kinds of exercise were off limits because I do not have any heart problems yet.  I have found that stationary bike and outdoor biking are great, low impact alternatives to running.  I also continue to do light weights. It is frustrating not to be able to do the kinds of exercise I want, but there are alternatives", "Possible marfan, please help! Need guidance!  Your post has been removed: please see rule 2. \nPlease visit the Marfan foundation page (linked in sidebar or top) who can help you.", "Mitral Valve Prolapse Hello everyone. \nI just would like to raise awareness of the phenomenon of malignant or arrhythmic MVP in the framework of Marfan syndrome (there is also a post currently on this subject in the subreddit mitralvalveprolapse). This is a risk that the cardiologists are starting to identify now so if you have MVP, just ask at your next echocardiogram that the doctor take a look at this particular situation (and in particular if there is a mitral annular disjunction). I had my mitral valve prolapse repaired 20 years ago this month.\n\n10/10, glad to still be alive. Nice! of course, not all MVP are malignant, there are precise criteria which are starting to be well identified. The degree of regurgitation (and therefore the need to repair or replace) does not play a role in the phenomenon. How do you get your cardiologist to go to the extra mile to find your diagnosis?\n, I have been told by that I have mitral valve prolapse , bfid pwave and that my left ventricle is slightly enlarged but its all TRIVIAL and is not the cause of my chest pain \nMy aorta is in within normal limits and my gene came back saying \nmutation of fbn1 of uncertain significance \n\nBTW chest pain is there everyday It varies in intensity,  I have lost my capacity to walk up the stairs without me gasping for breath \n\nInstead of trying to found out what is wrong with me I recieve a perfunctory nod\nAnd am assured the echo has not raised any concerns I would be you, I would ask for a second opinion from another cardiologist. I do not understand that one leaves you breathless after a flight of stairs or with your questions without answer. \nOn the other hand, for malignant MVP, there are signs on the echocardiography (for example the pickelhaube sign) and on the electrocardiogram (at least on the 12 lead recordings). it may be best to refer to a recent publication that talks about all of this? Or a summary of this phenomenon like this one:  Thanks friend , that was very informative , my doctor has never checked for that \n\nI thought what was wrong would be so apparent because how intense my chest pain \nBut my cardiologist comes of more as a bully than someone who is concerned  about why I feel debilitated , \n\nI work at the hospital, which is quite ironic because I cannot get a cause for my chest pain \nI work as part of the water safety team and am now in the middle of saving money to go see a Doctor privately,  \nI am from London so if you have any suggestions for a good Dr who exausts all possibilities to find out what is wrong , that would be appreciated I am sorry to read that even while working at the hospital, you cannot find help for your situation. I cannot advise you of a doctor because I live in Paris. In any case, I wish you good luck for the future. Thanks its okay\nGood luck to you too Agree. There should be Mitral Valve Prolapse awareness month. Some people are dying with MVP as well.", "need some advice so i am 18m and 6\u20193 155 pounds. i have never been formerly diagnosed with marfans but it is likely due to me having a tall skinny build. i have long arms and a slightly caved in chest. i am also nearsighted in one eye. i am worried about my aorta. i skateboard very hard on a daily basis and i am worried it could rupture. i never have had my heart checked out. how common is this at my age and should i slow down on the exercise?

Seeking professional advice is the way to go. should i stop exercise. i have been having shortness of breathe since july and i have been to the er 3 times in which they said it was asthma or anxiety each time. i had chest x rays and ekgs done everytime. i am worried it could be a aortic aneurysm from what i have read. I used to skateboard a lot I feel you. It is a high impact sport and could damage your aorta besides other stuff (eyes, junctions, etc.) if you have marfs. If your are worried and suspicious about marfs the first thing you should do is schedule a cardiologist and ask for an echocardiogram (and of course speak about your concerns.\nIf you have conditions it would be great to go to an specialist and make a genetic test for it but I know this can be expensive (in my country it is around 500 dolars)\n\nI am glad that you think about your health while young and if you indeed have marfs you will be able to prevent most of the downsides of this genetic condition so keep chill and listen to your doc.\n\n\nIf you have any other question feel free to ask.\n\n(sorry about the format I am on cellphone) You should do an echocardiogram as well. so that a cardiologist can see your valve diameter to make sure it is I am the normal range to prevent anerusym stuff.

I thought it was normal for everybody to do it, until I found out it was not Yea, I am kind of shocked that others cant I can do it but I have very pronounced aracnodactylia so no surprises there. But my mom has no Marfan's and she can do it too, is this really that strange?? Can you guys bend your thumbs your your wrist. I would take a photo but I am by myself and it requires both hands Yea apparently being able to do this is extremely uncommon Almost, I am probably about 1/2 inch away from being able to touch my wrist with my thumb Yeah, basically the highlight of my childhood party trick\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Ooh. You should try measuring your arm wing span tip to tip and see if you are longer than tall. A ratio of 1.05 times the height is pretty unusual too Yep. Mine was bending my fingers behind my hand like a reverse fist. Me too. But only in the past couple of years. Prior I was able to hold my thumb flush with my wrist. I can do both the thumb and wrist signs easily. Genetic testing ruled out Marfans. Do you have lots of other marfans signs? Yeah, there is clearly some CTD going on. 6 points in the systemic score, stretchy skin, some hypermobile joints (4/9 in the Beighton criteria)... I am currently awaiting the results of my whole exome sequencing. Interesting. Any idea what it could be for you? It was initially suspected I might have Loeys-Dietz syndrome (I have a bifid uvula and the typical translucent skin), and I was tested for that as well as Marfan just in case. Tests came back negative for both. I was sure I had Loeys-Dietz, now I have no idea lol. No heart issues (as of now at least) and no history that we know of CTDs in my family. Good luck on your search Yes on one side easily and on the other side it is mildly uncomfortable Yep. I can bend all my fingers forward to my wrist. The index is a little difficult. HEDS can have translucent skin and marfanoid features I am well aware, however I do not satisfy the diagnostic criteria (not that I agree with them but w/e). Since my mother has a Beighton of 9/9, however, I might settle for an unofficial (self-)diagnosis of hEDS in case my testing comes back inconclusive hahah. I can do it with all of my fingers. I can also do that thumb wrist stretch thing with ease. I can do that with ease. But I cannot bend any of my fingers backwards as such. Thumb will go to a max of 90\u00b0. Fingers, about 70\u00b0. Yep, can do that and with an inch of free space over the wrist to spare. Can also bend my pinkies flat against the back of my hands, bend my thumbs backwards across the backs of my hands, and touch my thumbs to my forearms. Can dislocate my shoulders at will and used to be able to pop my kneecaps in and out. No pain with any of this. Always thought they were cool party tricks. Diagnosed at 14. No problem there! Gezz. You are way more bendy than I am. Isnt that common for Marfans? Yes Late to this party, but I can do this, I am gona say the overlap is around 1.3-1.4 cm. I am a 24 yo girl. It bothers me that there is not a more exact way to verify this sign tho, I guess I found ONE publication stating something like the overlap has to be &gt;2cm to be considered abnormal. My doctor said my hands have the \"typical\" Marfan's look, however I cannot make them overlap by 2cm.\n\nHere is the thing though: apart from these signs and joint hypermobility, I do not have anything yet that screams Marfan's, no aortic dilatation/lens dislocation/history of aorta related complications in family, so my doc said it is unlikely I have it, and a couple users on this reddit seemed to echo that view. Do you have other physical traits? Like longer wingspan than tall, or near sightedness? I am in the 6 week waiting period for gene results. I have a lot of different signs to a mild extent I guess. My height is 167.6 cm, wingspan is 169..but longer torso than legs..have myopia with -1.5 D power..a lot of stretch marks, very mild scoliosis. Also have mildly stretchy skin in some places. But definitely have a very pronounced wrist sign and the typical tall and lanky look. \n\nGenetic testing is really really expensive here (3rd world country in Asia) and I cannot afford it unfortunately but my doctor said it is not necessary. What signs did you show to qualify for genetic testing? Wrist sign. Height 72.75\" wingspan 76.5\". Hypermobility, -4.75 nearsightedness, chronic pain through body and joints, and crowded teeth. Seems like a lot. Have you gotten an echocardiogram? I really pushed for one, but I have sinus tachycardia, so I guess it made sense anyway. \n\nFrom what I hear it is more important to keep a check on your heart and aortic root than to find an exact name for your condition. It is possible to have a negative genetic test and still have aorta problems. I am only days into this. I just found out marfan's is a thing and I have symptoms. I will push for a echo as well. I have not had one and it should be a simple and quick thing to verify my heart is well. You should be prepared to advocate for yourself, but a word of caution: do not fall into the medical article rabbit hole online, they usually report the most medically interesting (read severe) cases. I made that mistake and developed a really fatalistic outlook for a few days. It is really all about catching it early, which you have, regular monitoring if required and managing symptoms if and when they appear. :&gt; \n\nAll the best to you!! Thank you for the encouragement. Here is to both of us having a long and healthy path ahead. Do you have issues w your sight or hearing? Stickler syndrome patients also commonly have bifid uvula and other CTD symptoms. I do not (and afaik these tend to manifest pretty early on in Stickler's). I also lack the typical facial features (aside from the bifid uvula I guess), so I clearly do not pass the clinical criteria. Hopefully I will have my WES results ready before the end of this month along with some kind of answer. Shit, are you diagnosed? I could not do the thumb sign but I can do this so I am getting scared that I have this again I am not. I am in the waiting period. I have lots of other signs tho: 76.5\" wingspan vs 72.75\" height. -4.75 eyes. Crowded teeth. Hypermobility. I cannot do the thumb sign however. I have pretty good eyes, do not think I have crowded teeth, no hyper mobility, and I was just able to do the thumb sign but I do not know if I was doing it right, and I can do wrist sign, wingspan is about equal with height. Maybe I do not have this and my fingers are just long as fuck Yep. There are so many things we can do that others cannot. I am still surprised when my boyfriend comments on me doing something he cannot.The other day he giggled when I put deodorant on both underarms using my right hand. Right hand to left armpit, normal and easy. Right hand to right armpit is apparently weird. I always ask \"you cannot do that?\" and he demonstrates that he cannot. For me it is just what I do. :Shrug:", "Getting screened for Marfans in a few hours - wish me luck! Hi guys,\nI am getting screened for Marfans in a few hours and I do not know what to expect. I have Pectus Excavatum, Scoliosis (50c cobb angle), flat feet, and a skinny build. However, I am not super flexible and my eyesight is fine and I do not know how my Aorta is. \nWhen I got an echocardiogram the guy said my Aorta looked ok, and I have had an MRI (that no one has looked at yet). I also have had pretty bad Tachycardia since early December last year, and is showing very little signs of going away. \nAnyway, I am not to worried about the appointment but wish me luck!  Best of luck. Hope it all goes well! Good luck!!\n Hope everything goes well! My husband went in today as well.  A little late, but best wishes to you! Thanks everyone for your kind wishes. Basically the result was that they do not know. I am not really that flexible (apart from my legs), my eyesight is fine, I have a skinny and lanky build, I do have a sunken chest and a really bad scoliosis (50c cobb angle), but my Aorta turns out to be fine. Because I am 16, they did not know whether to calculate my aorta size as a child or an adult. If they calculated it as a child, it would be massively wide and a real threat. If they calculated it as an adult, it would be perfectly normal. They calculated it another way and it is perfectly fine! It will need to be monitored, but is unlikely to change.\nThanks again everyone!  So you do not have it? No, I do not :-)", "Mechanical heart valve and blood thinners! Hey all!\n\nThe time has come where I will need surgery in a few months - the Dr says that he wants to try for a valve sparing root replacement, however he says there is a food chance I may need the valve replaced if the surgeon thinks so, even though my valve is functioning fine. I am assuming the worst and prepping myself for a valve replacement.\n\nMy question is: how is life on blood thinner? Do you need to limit your diet/alcohol alot? Is the valve loud? Can you still sleep properly?\n\nYour input is greatly appreciated! Minimal maintenance for me. Albeit cardiologist says I am pretty stable compared to most. Key is to not do swings in alcohol or food habits. They adjust your warfarin levels based on what the measurements tell you. I was given an option for porcine or mechanical but it was no question to me as I do not want them to have to go back in and replace the porcine valve after a decade or so. No thanks. Thank you very much for your response! Do you find the valve to be loud at all? I have had mine for 25 years. No major bleeds (knock on wood) but I have known people who have had them. One was not monitoring it and using a lot of alcohol and the other was using another drug that caused her blood to be thin.\n\nMake sure you keep your diet the same and physical activity. Get to know which foods are high in vitamin K and be careful with them.\n\nIn terms of the sound, you stop noticing it. Other people sometimes hear it in a quiet place. For what it is worth, I was told the same thing and they were able to spare the valve just fine. I bet it will all work out.  Best wishes on a smooth surgery and a speedy recovery! Mine was spared, initially. After my first surgery I had a stroke and did not end up doing cardiac rehab because I had to learn to walk and talk again. 10 months later I had to have my valve replaced. I was told it happens like 10% of the time. The doc matter-of-factly said he was doing a mechanical since I am young (31 at the time) and had already had my chest opened twice in my life. It is not that bad, you just have to be consistent with your vitamin K to keep your warfarin the same Not really. Sometimes it will click like a cheap watch but most of the time very quiet. I have ever felt better since I had the operation. I am glad you have not had any complications - do you need to get the INR checked at an institution? Or are there options to check it at home? Thank you very much for the supportive words! I hope mine will be spared too - just preparing for worst case scenarios, that is all :) I get it checked at a lab. Mine has been stable so it is once a month. There is a home testing device you can get - Coaguchek I think one is called.  I do not have it. Thank you very much for the insight! It is good to get an idea of what I might be up against. Again, appreciate it! Thank you for the reply! It sounds like once you get into the groove of things it is not too much of a hassle... I appreciate the input! I had mine installed in 2001. I monitor my INR levels myself (I am supplied with the equipment and measuring strips by my (Danish) hospital), and have had only minor issues in that regard (I got appendicitis, and the surgeons had to wait until my INR was sufficiently low before proceeding to open me, which did complicate matters). I have a fairly stable diet, and my INR usually stays within 2-3.\nThe only serious problem I have had with my valve was developing endocarditis, which is lethal, if not treated. I spent six weeks of IV antibiotics at the hospital, and have not had any issues since. Same situation with me as well. You are doing the right thing preparing for the worst and educating yourself but I hope the best for you! What were the symptoms of endocarditis and how did the diagnose it?? My valve has not acted up in the two years I have had it and I monitor my INR regularly, I am not a huge drinker but I  have gotten strongly wasted on a couple occasions which ended with a considerable hangover, but my INR stays well, you can allow some few stances of excess if you want, either way I was never the type to get blackout and I do not plan to start now.\nHope that helps It is good to plan, but I am crossing my fingers for you!  I had a successful repair, but I wanted to mention that you will likely feel much better (albeit after feeling worse, obviously).  I do not think doctors mention it because they do not want to over promise, but the reality is your ejection fraction has been dropping a day at a time, and you have learned to deal with symptoms without realizing it.  With a new or repaired valve your heart does not need to work as hard and frequently this leads to noticeable and positive effects.\n\nAlso, if you have not prepped your home for recovery a few things:\n\n1) Try and find a hospital bed for home or at least put your bed on risers.  Being able to \"swing\" into and out of bed is excellent.  If your insurance does not cover a bed, if you can afford to float the cost of one on craiglist you can sell it for near even money when you are done.\n\n2) Similarly, try and put things like clothes and stuff in the shower at a height you can reach while standing.  This is really only necessary for like the first week or so, but it is a simple thing that helps.\n\nGood luck! Thank you for sharing! That is good to know it allows some slack for drinking. I too am not a big drinker, but it would be sad if I could not get tipsy occasionally when catching up with friends! I guess I will just have to see how my INR acts! This is amazing! Thank you for this!! I will look into the bed situation for sure! \n\nAnd any bonus I get from this surgery will be most welcome :) I had a high fever (40\u2103+) for a couple of days; I called my doctor; and he sent to the hospital, where they checked my infection levels (very high) and did an echocardiogram on my heart, detecting something on the valve. I was immediately put on strong antibiotics, which took care of the fever in a few days. The remaining six weeks were mainly just boring (though I can certainly do without venous cannulas for the rest of my life), but the protocol for putting endocarditis down is strict. You bet!  For the bed you really do not need anything fancy, but something that can \"sit you up\" is realllly nice. If you are traveling for the procedure, the hospital may require you to stay local for a aprox a week after discharge, but not in the hospital.  They can help you arrange for a hospital bed wherever you are staying during that time and navigate insurance (a bed rental falls under \"durable medical equipment\").\n\nAnd again, you will not need any of these things very long!  But I found taking some time to make a \"nest\" was really helpful.  It is something you can understand and control :).  It is just kind of nice to have in the back your mind you have got a nice space to come back to.  Hot glueing string to my remotes so they did not fall off the bed was overkill but it gave me something to do lol.\n\nOne other thing I wish people mentioned, I have said it on here before but keep repeating it for anyone going in: you may experience \"the blues\", even after you are physically feeling better.  It is a natural feed back loop: your healing heart signals your body to be sedentary, the only way it knows how to do that is to bum you out.\n\nIt is not really severe, but it can outlast a lot of the other physical symptoms.  So you may be back to work, your life, etc and not actually realize you are still healing.  It is worth mentioning to people you are close to you may not be quite yourself even after youre \"back to normal\".  Good news is it does get better.  Unlike regular depression, the cause is the surgical trauma, so as that heals, the symptoms tend to lessen.\n\nI hope this does not scare you, again it is not world ending, but it is important to acknowledge so you can know it is normal, it is temporary, and to be easy on yourself.  You may consider talking to someone and possibly meds, but youre looking to deal, not adjust to a \"new normal\".\n\nSo I can elaborate if you want, but I do not want to overwhelm.  It is one of those \"statistically significant does not imply severity\" things. I second the needle aversion, after my aneurysm I was hospitalized for six weeks as well and developed flebitis from being pinched all the time, and my veins somehow got \"hidden\" from the experience, nowadays whenever they are going to put a needle in me nurses have a real hard time finding the veins, I have heard heroin addicts develop this condition as well, which is why they end up injecting their feet and eyes, it is messed up that I now have the same problem. Wow, I was not aware of the depression aspect, although it would make sense that you do go through something like this - this is very useful!\n\nIf you do not mind, could you please elaborate on what exactly hurts post surgery? Is it all movement? Bending down? Can I still walk and get around normally? Happy to!  Like I said I just do not want to overwhelm.\n\nSo, the day of/after is kind of hard to describe.  It is difficult, but to the point it does not totally register.  You have also got IV drugs for a while and damn are they magical.  So, it is the part that sounds the scariest, but it is over quickly and there are so many people making it as easy as possible.  But yes: generally speaking if you are not moving you feel fine.  Walking sucks but it is really important to do.  Basically, you will be in and out of this high, being really mellow, sitting really still, occasionally punctuated by nessecary unpleasantness like checking drainage etc.  When I look back, there are things that *sound* scary to describe that I do not remember scarily.  A specific tip I learned: 1) use your drug pump as much as you want.  They use the data to form a pain management plan, not to \"cut you off\".  2) I had inflammation at my drainage sight that was giving me pain.  Getting what was basically and ibuprofen helped me more than the pump, and it was my nurse that caught it.  Talk to tour nurses about what, specifically, hurts.  There are different pains for different causes.\n\nThat time out of the hospital but not home yet was hardest for me.  You still feel like crap, your drainage tubes may not be out yet, and it is your care network not the hospital taking care of you.  At this point you will still be trying to move as little as possible, but generally OK if you are not.  You will need someone to bathe you and you will not really care who it is.  But it is not miserable.  I have a distinct memory of trying SO hard not to laugh watching Martha Stewart cook with Snoop Dogg on TV with my mom.\n\nBy the time you are home home you are walking slow, but it does not really hurt.  Big body movements hurt but you are generally OK.  Sitting down to poop is not great, and you cannot \"bare down\" so it takes a while.  You will watch Netflix and play video games, but be comfortable in a lot of postures.  You will do a weird side bend to get things off the ground, or just leave them, but its more \"not worth the effort\" than real pain. You are basically a sloth.  Moving slow but generally OK.  You will start to feel a bit stir crazy, start pushing yourself a bit more.  You are starting to feel well enough to be more annoyed at the fact you cannot do what you want than anything.  I am not sure your situation, but cooking (let alone grocery shopping), laundry, etc would be rough for that first week.\n\nEvery day you will wake up feeling markedly better.  Every day you will notice there are postures and movements that hurt yesterday and do not now.  It is really remarkable.  There are hold outs.  Sneezing sucks.  Laughing's rough.  Weeks 4-8 you will find stuff here and there (like checking your blind spot while driving) but it is the minority. \n\nSome of this changes if you are not going to be living with anyone and need to be self sufficient rather quickly. Once again, thank you! This has been incredibly helpful! I developed hard veins during my hospital stay, but that happily reversed back to normal after a while once I was released. My father had his valve replaced after having an aortic aaneurysm when I was a kid. \n\nI can answer some of your questions. \n\nThe sound of the valve:\n\n Sounds like a small tick. I can hear my dad's if the room is dead quiet and I am a couple feet away.\n\nBlood thinners side effects:\n\nMy dad says it is  a pain when he clips himself shaving because the blood does not clot up and scab.\nAlso, the older you are, the harder it will be to, well, get hard.  (This had caused some big issues for my father's relationships) Blood thinners are something you need to be careful about, though they will help you a lot, specially if you choose the mechanical valve, vs the pig skin one , they will increase your chances of bleeding easily, bruises etc. My sister opted for the pig Valve, however the doctors were able to repair her original one and she was able to have a normal life without medication for almost 20 years. There is no change to your diet unless you have other problems like high blood pressure or diabetes.\n\nGood luck on your surgery and have a speedy recover!", "Hey have someone here have had the scoliosis surgery? If so how have it been since then? I am 18 And have scoliosis but I refuse to do it because im afraid I will not be able to go to the gym any more or play sports It depends what vertebrae are getting the rods. I got every thoracic vertebrae fused T-1 through T-12 when I was 15. And I have still got my full range of motion. I ached for months afterwards but now at 21 there is no problems whatsoever. I would recommend talking to a doctor about what part of your spine would be fused and how that would affect your ability to be in sports or exercise. And remember to ask if it will be affected, your doctors are trying to help you and they will take into account what you want when recommending procedures, you just need to let them know. I had it done 30+ years ago with no major problems after the first couple of years. \n\nIf your scoliosis is bad enough it can cause serious health issues. At the minimum a lifetime of pain. I have met people at the Marfan conference who chose not to have it and very much regretted it. Did T3 to L4 and no problems since, got it done 6 years ago when I was 15. Recovery was kind of brutal and I have only had minor issues since then but still unsure if the rods are to blame. Generally speaking it was beyond worth it considering how bad my spine was b4. Best if luck! Xox My son is 17 and had his in October and he was back at the gym in about three months but was limited to body weight only. He just had his six month check up and everything was good. I cannot remember what restrictions he still has. (Only one parent could go with him due to COVID-19.) He will have a full release at a year. I had it when I was 14, which was 24 years ago. I have a Harrington Rod from T-11 to L-3 I believe. I had a 50 degree curve that kept curving despite wearing a back brace. Now at 38, I can do pretty much everything. My back does not have the range of motion others have, which I notice when doing yoga, but i cannot imagine what my life would have been like if I had not gotten it fixed. I need mine done terribly.  But where they would send me is our state's covid hotspot.  And it is compromising my lungs, so that is bad.\n\nHow much range of motion should I expect with cervical down to lumbar? Not really a counterpoint to this, but I also had it done 20+ years ago and I currently suffer severe chronic back pain. Now, perhaps I would have been worse off had I not got it, very likely, so not complaining. All I am saying is, do not do what I did and go through life trying to be like everyone else thinking your back is strong. Be gentle to yourself. Do not lift heavy things like an idiot.\n\nSide note: The surgery looks different now, I believe, so it might be an improvement from when us old fogeys got it. Real talk, there is more to life than sports and the gym. They are not more important than your well being. Explore and find other things to enjoy. You will be glad you did down the road when you are too old to do those things anyway, but now suffering with severe chronic pain cause you did not get it taken care of. I had it done at 12, I am 22 now. Honestly I still have a lot of back pain, but as a lot of folks have mentioned I do not know how much worse the pain would have been if I had let my spine keep bending. \n\nSide note: Although there is some pain, I still go to the gym sometimes although it is still advised you take it easy. \n\n\nIMPORTANT: The taking it easy at gym/sports has to be done regardless of the surgery, since what is really in danger is your heart, not so much your spine. Sports may aggravate your heart condition even if they do not affect your back. Always consult your doctor on what sports are appropriate and at what frequency :) Stay safe! You should have it done. You wouldnt be able to breathe properly without due to the distortion of your torso putting pressure on your lungs.I cannot stress it enoufh. Your reason to not do it, if a medical professional had advises you to do, is ridiculously stupid.\n\nAs for me, I do have some difficulty bending forward. The amount of things I can lift would be the same. However, I live in a third world country, so for me it was a ridiculously dangerous procedure that had a load of complications including at least two infections and a massive reduction in weight. But you should be fine if you are in the first world, as my younger cousin had it in America and turned out fine.\n\n And I do not go to the gym because of marfan in general. Which brings me to the next question: why are you going to the gym? Do not. Hi OP! \n\nI had the surgery 13 years ago at the age of 12 (thank god I was tall) and it was life changing for me. Even if the procedure was difficult because of the severity of my case, it is so much worth it.\n\nFor me, I can walk long distances without having any back pain, which I am really greatful for. I have lower back pain if I stand up too long, which is probably due to the remaining scoliosis and I guess marfan in itself. Other than that, I can bend forward as much as I want, because my surgeon decided not to block my lower vertebrae. It is something you can discuss with your surgeons ahead of the process. \n\nRegarding the gym, I would guess that it is likely that you lose some flexibility. If you have a bone graft, you will probably feel it when you extend your arms, but of course it varies for everyone. The gym is primarily dangerous for your aorta since lifting weight puts pressure on it, so make sure you discuss that with your cardiologist. \n\nGo for it OP you will not regret it and the sooner the better to recover fast. \n\nBest wishes hey im 18 at the moment and i have been with a chiropractor for 3 years now and at the moment I do not really feel pain at all but the way my torso looks is with bothers me, last time i had x rays done i had a 43\u00b0 curvature that was like 3 years ago as well, later this month i will be taking new ones and if the curvature has not been corrected at all i will b taking the surgery \n\nsorry for the grammar English is not my primary language Good luck! Having the surgery will save you tons of trouble in the future! I had two spinal fusions because of my idiopathic scoliosis, located in the lumbar region. The first one was when I was 17 and another at 19. The second surgery was because I complained of having immense back pain, and a year later they realized that I had 3 rods broken because I started competitively swimming again after my first surgery, even though I was cleared to swim again.\n\nIn my experience, I was a college athlete that just became an athlete. I have a lot of pain, but I work out almost everyday and run 3 miles. They say the key to not having back pain is to work out and have abs. It helps a lot with my pain, and when I do not work out I have even worse back pain. I do not know if surgery was meant for me, but I know several people who have had it and they have never had any pain. The only major thing you cannot do is twist to a 180degree which no human should ever do to begin with. It will not effect you going to the gym after 8-9 months. I still do not lift extremely heavy weights but I weigh 115 pounds and can do 65+ pound squats without pain in my back. I am more cautious of my back, and sometimes I simply cannot do a certain task, but it does not really hinder your ability to play sports or go to the gym after 1 year.", "Accutane and Marfan\u2019s Has anyone taken Accutane? Any negative side effects other than what is expected? I did for awhile, worked well, no issues other than the normal accutane stuff (dryness, etc) Yes, and no, in that order. Had three courses in my early teens (curse you stubborn acne!) and eventually was successful, and with no additional side-effects than the usual listed ones. Late to the party (just discovered this sub today). I did took accutane when I was freshman in HS, maybe a year or two before I was diagnosed.  My side effects were not awful. Aside from the dry skin, mood swings, etc. I had moderate back pain.  Though since I was not diagnosed, it is hard to tell what how the accutane and marfans interacted", "Do I Have Marfans?

Do I Have Marfans?\n\nAlso, I have had genetic testing done, and it demonstrated that I do in fact have Marfans. This corroborates diagnoses by a cardiologist, geneticist, and my own GP. Does that mean I have Marfans?\n\nIf I do have Marfans, will I have to give up my job as a professional skydiver? Should I quit fighting yacks? Would it be beneficial for me to start jousting?

Take it slow and **make an exercise plan with your cardiologist.** I would say give swimming a try, its low impact and hopefully wont hurt ur lower back. Personally I do compound exercises and recently got into skipping - skipping is hella good to burn some weight. But at the same time I am personally trying to build muscle so idk how helpful compound exercises will be for u but hey muscle burns fat so could be worth a try- like lunges, squats, triceps dips (which are some of the basic ones I am sure uve done b4). Also really really focus on what you eat, if u really clean up ur eating habits u will deffo see the weight go.

If you just do something for 1 week and then give you should not expect to see results. I saw good results after around 5 weeks :D, Goodluck! Fuck them if that is true. When I was younger I went through that shit too. Dont stress it In my mid-twenties I stopped caring so much about what other people thought about my weird body. Met a really hot girl shortly after that, we have been married 12 years now, confidence counts a lot more than looks. Being tall will get you far my friend, that and confidence... Embrace it Definitely feel this. I found that wearing clothes I feel really confident in helps with these feelings, since it is something I can control. Slenderman can be hot too!

I was fatigued, light-headed, had stomach pains. I am 5'11,\" male, and I was probably 125 pounds.  One of the first things he did was mention Marfan syndrome, and he measured my arm span.  I do not remember the results.  He did not pursue Marfans.  I think he just kind of gave up.  Around this time, I saw a lot of doctors who got stumped.  They did a million tests for all kinds of things.  Eventually, they found I had hypothyroidism.\n\nOne of the tests was an echo.  They did not mention it was because of Marfans.  It came back normal.\n\nI went to the doctor a year ago, and my weight was 130, and he commented on it saying I seemed skinny.  I told him I was always skinny and he did not say anything else.\n\nI have started lifting weights last summer, and I am 150.  This winter, I was shoveling and my heart felt like it was tightening.  It could have been my pec muscle.  I am just wondering, if you have an echo come back fine does that mean you do not have marfan syndrome?  I am seeing a new doctor because my old one moved.  Is it silly to ask my doctor about the possibility of marfans (my thinness + this heart tightening)?  I do not have flat feet or eye problems.  I do have a very thin wrist, and very long fingers.  Neither of my parents have been diangosed as Marfans, although my mom was thin most of her life.  I do not know my paternal grandparents. Nope. My echo cardiograms have always come back normal. I still definitely have Marfan's. By all means, mention it to your doctor as a possibility but do not work yourself into a tizzy with self diagnosing.  Initially, with no family history and no aortic involvement, you would not be diagnosed with Marfan. However, you could have a related connective tissue disorder, such as Marfan Habitus. \nNow, your echo is really old and things do change. It is may be worth having another. You can also request genetic testing, a TAAD panel is best, if you and your doctor feel you are concerned. You can be diagnosed even without aortic issues if your mutated gene matches someone else's who is diagnosed. \nAnd of course, it is possible there is nothing related to connective tissue disorder at all, but the chest pain is definitely worth checking out. You can also show your new doctor the Ghent criteria for diagnosing Marfan to see if it is a possibility. \nHere is the website for the criteria and explanations on how it all works. \n Marfan's or not as others have mentioned, talk to your doctor and a cardiologist if you are concerned.\n\nBeing thin and having put on some weights I will also say having muscles grow and strain can feel odd after being in the same body so long.  However, while I am not familiar with hypothyroidism, being chronically underweight can manifest some heart issues.\n\nAn echo can measure you are aortic root size, but as others have noted, this can change over time.  There is also other things a cardiologist may want to test for using an EKG or similar.  Long story short a check in is not a bad thing, especially now that it sounds like you have got a handle on something you have been struggling to put a box around for some time.\n There are all manner of things that could be affecting you, it does not have to be marfan. \n\nBut no, you do not *have* to have the aorta problems to have marfan.

After a long time of being teased and tormented by others because they did not understand my invisible illness and the debilitating effects of it I attempted to find someone who would employ me and join society to the best of my ability. Luckily an outsourcer call center hired me and I worked long enough to lose my disability for wages earned and then lost my job. Next my health progressively became worse and I eventually needed surgery for my heart. This happens while I am trying to go back to college and I end up having to drop out. I end up with medical debt and college loans but \"fortunately\" my health became poor enough that after a 2yr uphill battle of reapplying for SSDI I was awarded a meager amount each month of about $570/month but with the bonus of having insurance. Unfortunately it was not enough to live on, I decided, and was forced to again try to get employed. To my luck a temp agency hired me but only if I worked full time at $10/hr. I was desperate again, made the same mistake, and by the time my term was up at the temp agency I had set the wheels in motion to lose my SSDI once again. I wisely decided to find a job that would be under the wage/hours necessary to keep my SSDI and was hired at a hospital at a desk job to cover as needed for a couple hours so the other person there could go home earlier. Yet the catch was I had to do full time training for a few months and then the other person quit, leaving me again in a predicament. \n\nSo now I have finally had my hours reduced in the hopes I can keep my SSDI but I am still $16 to $400 over the limit of $1090/month if I get 3 paychecks in one month. The only thing I can think of is maybe I can claim some sort of work related expenses but have no idea what can be considered as any person who has answered my calls at the SSA office tells me I cannot qualify for exemptions like mileage costs for my vehicle because that is for people in wheelchairs who have a special van or something and that I need to \"stay out of trouble\".\n\nPlease help if you have any insight into this kind of issue. I am sure there are some sort of work related expenses people with Marfan's could claim that I take for granted and stubbornly work thru it.", "Is it possible to have some of the more obvious symptoms but not have Marfans? 18M, 193cm, 76kg\n\nI have severe scoliosis, long limbs, large hands and feet, thin wrists and ankles (I fail the wrist test), clavicular connective tissue problems, and flat feet.  \n\nIs it possible to have these symptoms but not have Marfans? Yeah, i could be wrong but this is my take on it. Marfans is just a collection of different issues and if you have 8 or more of them they wrap it in a pretty crappy bow called marfans. If you have concerns, please ask a doctor, not /r/marfans\n\nThe marfan foundation has a very informative website  that addresses these concerns, and can connect you to medical professionals who can help answer your questions.\n\n The only way to really confirm marfans is a genetics test for FBN1 mutation. Alright, thanks You can have a marfinoid habitus and not have the mutation. Here is the Wikipedia list of other conditions that have the look of marfans but it is not marfans.\n\n\n\nI recommend looking at the NHS pages for those conditions as well as it helps you get an idea of what they involve. **( \n \n &gt;Marfanoid (or Marfanoid habitus) is a constellation of symptoms resembling those of Marfan syndrome, including long limbs, with an arm span that is at least 1. 03 of the height of the individual, and a crowded oral maxilla, sometimes with a high arch in the palate, arachnodactyly, and hyperlaxity.\n \n^(( | )( | )( | )( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5) You also have to look at one of your parents. Because that is where you got the gene, so, if one of your parents has suffered from Marfan type symptoms, that would also be a clue. But, the genetic testing is what is the gold standard. I see. From what I recall one of my relatives (on my mother's side) have slight scoliosis, but no one has diagnosed Marfans. My mother has the same type of thin wrists that I do, but not large hands. My siblings are also tall, but I have the thinnest limbs in relation to height out of us all, and I am the only one with scoliosis. It is really hard to say, I will probably just try for a genetic test Marfan's has more deadly symptoms. My dad went through several mitral valve replacements before he died, and he also lost his eye as a child. You would see kyphosis more than scoliosis, have a positive thumb sign, and feel your joints dislocate. Like, my metatarsal joints dislocate all the time, and damn, does it hurt. I can bend the tips of all my fingers back 90 degrees, and so could my dad. There are Marfan variants, but you would still have to show the major symptoms. Up until recently, Marfans did not survive much past 70 due to the heart dissection issues. Thank you for the information, and I am sorry you are in pain. Hopefully you are still doing fine. When you say you can bend the tips of your fingers back 90 degrees, do you mean manually with your other hand or by flexing the finger? I can bend the tips of my pointer finger and little finger (not sure of the English names) back almost 90 degrees if I push them with something, but not by flexing the finger on its own. Yes. I have a degree if thoracic scoliosis , mild ples planus, thumb sign, dolicostenomelia, pectus excavatum, lower rib flare and I can fully wrap my pinky and thumb round my collateral wrist entirely covering the finger nail. I do not have Marfan syndrome though as my aortic root is probably only upper limits of normal and fbn1 test showed no known causative mutations. All first degree relatives are deceased so cannot check them, although my maternal cousin is rumoured to have Marfans. I probably have MASS Phenotype which tends to have aortic stability although my geneticist disagrees as he says my mitral valve is normal so cannot have it. MVP is not in the diagnostic criteria for MASS however so stuck with uncertainty overall. It is common with connective tissue disorders to struggle with medical opinions... Interesting. Thanks for sharing. Also, do you think a positive thumb sign is a big deal in getting diagnosed? Because that is something I fortunately do not have...  I mean I can press all of my fingertips back 90 degree using another finger.  My thumb also curls back 90 degrees. I also can bend my fingers using the top joint only, and so could my father. It was our \"shared party trick\" that we used to do at the dinner table, but we never thought it was odd. It looks like this: \n\nMarfan's also means that you have weak blood vessels, so you bruise easily, and I get broken blood vessels infrequently in my smaller toes that will hemorrhage spontaneously. It has happened on my ring finger as well. Also quite painful, esp in the toes, and the whole toe joint will turn purple and I have to ice it. It is like stubbing your toe really hard. I really have not figured out why or when it happens. Marfans are really nearsighted, and suffer from lens dislocations. I also have poor response to anaesthetic or pain medication, and I recall my dad having the same problem, as he required multiple open heart surgeries, and complained quite bitterly about the pain although he was on opiate pain medication. He needed to take quite a lot after his surgeries. \n\nMarfans also suffer from fatigue. I remember being in high school wondering why I was still tired after getting a good night's sleep. Vigorous exercise really tires me out, like if I go waterskiing, I need a nap afterwards. I quit drinking because I do not tolerate alcohol well, and the one drink that I could tolerate would make me feel exhausted by the time I got home. Thanks for the help. I will go see a professional. You are welcome. Honestly, I hope you test negative and just have some scoliosis. and flexible joints. Nope I can do both thumb and wrist signs and currently do not meet the criteria for Marfans. I have had an echocardiogram and cardiac MRI both with good results and the genetic test with no known causative mutation (which was only offered as my Ghent score is 4 or more) However it cannot be unequivocally said that I do not have Marfans as clinical signs are not static and the genetic test is not 100% certain. If your GP refers you for investigation the first step is usually and echocardiogram followed by Ghent scoring. Not quite true, the mutation is only one of the criteria. You have to have 2 \u201ccardinal features\u201d (family history, FNB1 mutation, ectopia lentis, and aortic root dilation.) When I was first officially diagnosed eight years ago I only had the second two, plus all the classic Marfan\u2019s traits. Just last year they discovered a previously undiscovered intronic mutation in my FNB1 gene that probably accounts for my family\u2019s symptoms.", "So i went to a specialist to see if i have it After all the tests, checking my whole body, heart, features and eyes, they told me i dont qualify for marfan, after checking the points of this \"list\", does that mean im a marfanoid? I really have a lot of marfan-features but not enough to qualify, can i live my life normally? I would like to climb/swim and lift again :). Hey, so the fact that you are able to have muscle tone is a pretty big sign that you probably do not have it. \nBecause it is a mutation of fibrin, it affects all of your connective tissues. It does affect all of us differently, but lack of muscle tone is fairly consistent.\n\nJust a non medical two cents\n\nA genetic test would confirm. Going into your post/comment history, I would be more concerned about limiting activity due to the severe issues from your past eating disorder. \n\nRegardless of whether you have marfan's or not, you are going to have restrictions because of your valve replacement. Hello, thank you for answering, yes its true, i fought a looong time with this eating disorder, but i beat it, i can eat without feeling guilt or bingeing. Im aware of my restrictions because of the valve. But the point is the restrictions from marfan are A LOT harsher than those from my valve. Marfan's is a spectrum. Restrictions are based on familial/individual mutations and symptoms, often managed by a geneticist and the rest of the team. Yes without being cocky, im somewhat muscular and have never been really \"skinny\", the dna test is quite expensive in my country and the docs said it would be a waste of money, because my case is clear.?\nI still have shortness of sight, longer limbs, hand and wrist sign, flat feet etc. I had enough features that the docs had to check everything to come to the final conclusion that i dont have it. Is going private an option for genetics? I know the NHS will cover it if they believe there is a strong family indication. The NHS screen if Ghent score is 4 or more MASS Syndrome is also a thing In total i would have enoigh point to be considered marfan, but some feature were too \"mild\" to be calculated into the score. I looked it up and the giveaway for mass is mitral valve problem, but i only have bicuspid aortic valve. So i dont have mass-syndrome Bicuspid valve can also give some problems, ask your doctor about it You can have 50% of Marfan which is only some physical features, meanwhile you have no internal features. Due to this you most likely will be able to live your life as any normal person will (just one thing, your children may have this syndrome, since you are a Carrier of this gene. But that would only be 50%).", "Help using an INR home monitoring system Let us start by saying that I live in the United States, and I have no health insurance.

Life, when you cannot afford health insurance, is peachy.\n\nI just got a used CoaguChek XS system, but I have never used one, and I am not sure what kind of test strips I need to get. I see two kinds: \n\n* the CoaguChek XS PT test strips \n* the Accu-Chek Active test strips. \n\nIs there a difference between these two? I would prefer to buy the Accu-Chek ones, since they are significantly cheaper, and it seems like I will not have to go to sketchy ebay to buy them there.\n\nAside from this, do you have any recommendations about using this ?\n\nThank you! Hi there, I cannot help you directly with your query I am sorry - but I am sure it is frustrating and worrying at the same time.  \n\nAre you able to consult a pharmacist to work out the difference between the two? (I imagine that would come at no cost?) Also, you would not necessarily be obligated to buy them from said pharmacist - so I guess you could still buy online?\n\nAnyway, all the best! Contact the manufacturer. It probably means that the Coaguchek ones work with the same branded machine.\n\nWhen I was in the states and did not have insurance I am pretty sure the INR was &lt;$50 out of pocket. You can probably go to a clinic to get it setup too.\n\nYour INR can swing around and have pretty serious consequences. Mine was stable for years until it went to 7+ and the lab called to get me to go the ER. My mom's just went nuts out the blue recently too. My wife, who has a blood condition and takes Warfarin too, had some life or death blood clots.\n\nMy intent is not to scare you for sure. I have been in your shoes (one of the reasons I moved back to Canada).  Hi. I use the CoaguChek XS machine, and I am (by the Danish state) issued with CoaguChek XS PT test strips. Hey, thanks so much for your reply! Thanks for the input. I tried that, but they asked me if I had a prescription for it, they said that otherwise they are not allowed to give \"medical counsel\" about this.  How are you liking the Canadian health care are it relates to Marfan's disease? \n\nWhat you do you mean that the INR was $50 out of pocket? Are you talking about an INR lab test?  Yes, $50 out of pocket but that was a long time ago. \n\nMy healthcare here is excellent. It is difference by province and I live in a big city. \n\nHopefully you can get some decent insurance for yourself or get into a career where you can move to somewhere that you can.  Yes, it costs me $68 for the INR lab results.

I am around 6'1 and still growing and need a good computer chair because the small cheap one I am using now really hurts my back, around $350 would be a good price point. My chiropractor said that lumbar support would actually hurt my back and make it worse because of how naturally stiff and twisted my spine is. I tried lumbar support and I highly agree, its extremely uncomfortable for me. That is pretty much the only thing it cannot have. Thank you! So I do not think it will help cause it is $500 but I have a secret labs chair and the lumbar support is retractable but it is pretty nice honestly I have seen those for around 400, so it is not a bad option, thank you. Yeah just make sure you get the titan instead of the omega cause it has a taller back to it", "Sex and marfans  First and foremost I am looking to talk with someone about their experiences with sex as a person with Marfans.  I know this is a personal topic so I do not expect anyone to post anything publicly (unless you want to), but if anyone is interested in chatting please feel free to hit me up.\n\nBack story about me:  I am a 35 year old male and I have been with my girlfriend for 4+ years.  Our sex life has always been a rocky road due to the fact that before her I had no sexual experience and she had a much more lengthy history. She has been very patient with me but naturally there have been frustrations due to our different levels of experience. The more often these frustrations come up the less I believe them to be related to my lack of experience and more due to the fact that I am physically limited because of my Marfans.  I also feel as though it is a combination of both. I certainly know that with any physical activity I am limited, but I am trying to gauge the extent to which I should expect to be limited.  I realize that Marfans affects people to varying degrees as far as their quality of life goes and it is difficult to compare my situation to others.  Recently I began wondering if the beta blocker I take could be adversely affecting me in this department and if switching to an alternative medicine would benefit me.  \n\nIn conclusion any advice, resources or personal experience sharing would be greatly appreciated.  Again, not expecting anyone to share publicly.  My mind is a bit all over the place with this concern right now, but I had to start somewhere.  Thanks in advance. Doctors are still investigating whether or not I have it so take what I say with a grain of salt.\n\nI think you should see your doctor about this, perhaps it is the beta blockers but you really should not switch medication like that without getting a medical opinion.\nAlso I do not know if you are on any other medicines but if you are it could be those. For example: In my early 20s I went on an SSRI for a couple of weeks and it was a total boner-killer and I basically couldnt orgasm at all (I stopped it because of that). Maybe there are some medicines (viagra?) that your doctor can prescribe you to help as well.\n\nAlso I have read that sleep apnea is present in about 2 thirds of marfans patients, so maybe you have sleep apnea and it is sapping your energy and stamina, if so there are treatments for it (cpap).\n\nI have a pet-theory that marfans gives you an above average penis size (due to the tissues being more stretchy and they can expand more). So I say to make the most of what you have got, if you do. In my last relationship I didnt have a lot of stamina to do endless cardio for hours on end in the bed, but it wasnt necessary.\n\nWhile we are on the topic of NSFW theories, another one I have is that marfans often lets you do autofelatio, can anyone else corroborate that lol? I am on a couple different medications, including a beta blocker and I have never had any issues at all. Given that, I do not know that I can be of much help other than recommend reading r/sex for tips on how to get your freak on and keep her pleased.\n\nPersonally, I like to try to make a lady finish or at least get her well on her way before I even put my gentleman sausage anywhere.  Takes the pressure off and makes it nbd if you get a little too excited too quickly \ud83d\ude09 Drugs can definitely play a factor, of course you will have to discuss that with your doctor. In my early 20's I was on the beta blocker atenolol, which I attributed to difficulty climaxing, now I am 38, take metoprolol and an ARB, and have a very active and good sex life with my wife. Thanks for the response.  I suspect I probably do suffer from sleep apnea.  Gf complains about my snoring often and I often feel tired in the mornings after a regular amount of sleep, like I am waking up frequently.\n\nAnd I understand that being double jointed certainly would aid in autofellatio but unfortunately I have rods in my spine due to scoliosis. Haha! That info is much appreciated. I will talk to my doctor pretty soon here so I will discuss some possible alternatives to my beta blocker. I definitely recognize my shortcomings in terms of stamina because of Marfans and make an effort to please her in other ways to compensate. Married marf female with my husband for 15 years. It is becoming a challenge at times for myself because of issues with numbness and de. I honestly think that whatever the issue, just be straight about it. Sincerely. Your goal is obviously making sure your partner is satisfied right? Ask her?  Hopefully she will do likewise. \n\nI get a bit hung up with some of the numbness and weird marfy bullshit I have been experiencing but honestly my husband is super patient about it and really it is pretty awesome finding new ways of doing things 15 years later. \n\nSo yeah. Pillows..bars...whatever you need to do what you need to but just talk about it. Good to have someone like that in your life.  We communicate very well and have taken steps to introduce toys and things that help us out.  I have to say my girlfriend has been super patient with me throughout our relationship, but is not always keen on spelling out what she needs me to do.  Part of the turn off for her is my lack of intuition and leadership in the bedroom, stemming from my lack of ability and problems with performance. CPAP is life changing. I had no idea what I was missing out on in sleep quality. I am dealing with low testosterone and blood pressure meds.  Makes life a bitch, I usually do not have enough energy to get through the day.  Make sure you do not stress your heart and blow out a blood vessel. People have mostly all said what I planned on saying, but I am just going to reiterate the c pap stuff. It changed my life Haha I dated a guy with marfan\u2019s and he could do that too. He thought it was because of the scoliosis though. It was hot AF though, but he said it did not feel very good cos why would it when it is you haha. \n\nI also definitely support the larger than average penis size theory. Hmm well I do not seem to have any scoliosis. Yeah it definitely does not feel anything like as good as when somone else gives you head. I would say it is somewhat comparable to masturbating with your own hands, a lot more effort though.\n\nI wonder if Marfans makes you .ore likely to be a grower as well. Mine's a real grower, definitely way smaller than average when flaccid but when erect its just under 8\", it is kind of funny because I always go in the cubicle in public toilets because of that. It sounds very likely that you do have it, please get it investigated and ideally treated with something like a CPAP (which has huge benefits). I am also getting it investigated (have the same symptoms as you, but also headaches and waking up with my throat closed shut).\n\nWith regards to autofelatio: Do not worry you are not missing on much there haha... Yeah it is probably not a good idea for your spine in any case. Perhaps you also have sleep apnea if you lack energy and have low testosterone levels, these would be symptoms of that. Can confirm. Have a large penis. Can autofelate.\n\nMarf AF. I know this is old and I have not read through all the comments but my bf has marfan and he started taking betablockers about 3 months ago. \n\nThe doc said that it can affect your lust for sex.

Only some of the people are very tall with Marfan as it effects the long bones in some but not all. He is impossibly skinny and that is a sign of Marfans.

Do you guys have any opinions? Thanks Exposure to cold water can increase heart rate and blood pressure, so that is potentially a risk factor. I have never talked to a doctor about it but I normally take cold showers myself. Can I ask why you are thinking of takingthem?\n\nPersonally, I have been practicing the Wim Hof method for several months.

I monitored it for a few years but honestly just never thought about it.  I have had a few careers and am about to retire after 20 years in law enforcement. \n\nMy pain and posture has gotten a bit worse every year.  Recently my dr ordered another ultrasound and found my aneourysm has grown.  I do not know the measurements because I have a follow up.  But he asked me about family history of marfans. It is the second time in my life I have heard of it because my kids dr believes he has it since he has some symptoms. I never thought of it.  I just lived my life doing all kinds of dumb shit.

I am with you bro, you do not know that you have to have surgery for sure, and there is meds now that can help slow aneurysm growth if it is not too far.

I started my first day at my university while still in stitches.\n\nI am just under 40, but my advice for retirement and if you have surgery is: \n\n\\- Know that it is ok to ask for help - if you do have to get surgery, talk to a few doctors, find one that you are comfortable with and ask lots of questions. Ignoring it wont make it go away.\n\n\\- If you do have surgery, set yourself up for success by having you bedroom / are that you will convalesce set up with chairs that are easy to get in and out of, put a TV or a computer near by, and make sure you have easy access to a bathroom.\n\n\\- Do not ever stop moving, when you slow down, the pain goes up. Go for regular walks and light pt.\n\n\\- Get a few low impact hobbies to pass the time and keep your mind focused on something -  When I was a kid I loved model airplanes, when I got sick, I started building and flying airplanes and drones and that is been a great way that I can be low impact and still do some public safety work.\n\nIf you need someone to bounce ideas off of, or ask questions, feel free to PM me. Thanks! Anytime. And I mean it.", "Is this marfan syndrome? ", "Revised diagnostic criteria too stringent? So according to the latest diagnostic criteria for Marfan's, in the absence of a family history you have to have aortic root dilatation atleast at the sinus of valsalva or ectopic lenses AT MINIMUM to get diagnosed as a Marfan's patient. Skeletal signs and joint hypermobility have been referred to as \"soft signs\" that do not carry as much weight. \n\nMy question is, are not both those findings age dependent? And therefore, is not it risky to rule out Marfan's from an adult marfanoid patient without family history based on their absence? What if these patients develop those signs later on and are oblivious about it because they think they have been \"cleared\" from having the disorder and do not have regular monitoring?\n\nI am curious about your opinions on this. \n\n(Background about me: I am a 24 yo female, I was evaluated for Marfan's due to arachnodactyly, thin build, flat feet, joint hypermobility, mildly hyperelastic skin, sinus tachycardia and striae. My echo came out clear as did my eye exam, and my cardiologist said genetic testing was not warranted.) Idk much about medicine and honestly have not looked over marfans criteria as I was diagnosed at birth -im the only one in my family with it. After reading what u outlined, I agree that this amendment is too strict. I feel like marfans is already on the lows (as so many dr.s are unfamiliar with it), so by emphasizing factors that adults mostly face with marfans that could be a dangerous combination for brushing people off that are much younger and suspect they have it. --- especially in countries where medicine is not as advanced and all that. It would definitely be too strict in my case. I knew I had it since high school, but could not get any definitive diagnosis from a doctor. No family history, echo was fine. At the time, I only demonstrated skeletal features.\n\nThe first thing I did after college graduation was to use 23andMe to find the specific SNP in question and mentioned those results to my doctor (and then I had to have more expensive genetic testing to officially reconfirm what had just been shown, lol).\n\n~5 years later, my aorta still falls within the normal range, but that is probably because I made the appropriate lifestyle changes back in high school. \n\nIt seems dangerous and backwards to wait until problems emerge to test, especially with how easy genetic sequencing has become. But that seems to be how doctors want to handle it. Doctors do recommend repeat testing in younger patients. However I have been reading papers that state if no dilatation is found by adulthood, \"reassure\" patient. I mean..it just seems a bit irresponsible, no? How did you know you have it? Would you mind sharing what your indicative features were?\n\nAbout the waiting until problems appear to test: I KNOW RIGHT. My cardiologist recommended even the first echo begrudgingly, kept saying I probably do not need it. I do not get it at all.. Yes pretty irresponsible\ud83d\ude2d esp because your heart can develop or progress to have major problems in very short spans of time:(  this may be a stretch of what many will agree with but I do not think having such confined parameters of what constitutes one having or not having marfans helps. Like that fine line seems crazy as something as like this - whether you have all or many of the ailments, will only bring you further health consciousness. Opposed to being like dw u just have marfanoid habitus. But that is just my 2 cents. In my case it was mostly my bodily proportions, pectus excavatum , severe micrognathia, very underdeveloped and weak muscles, early stretch marks emerging around my legs, mild scoliosis, hypermobility of the arms. I have also always had lung issues (blamed on asthma, even when my asthma is clearly controlled), and I could just tell my joints were not exactly built to last. At the time the joint pain had not started, but I could feel pressures on them that just were not correct, especially my knees and hips. I also have tachycardia but I did not associate that with Marfan's at the time. I have since learned I probably had an unacknowledged arrhythmia.\n\nThe thing is, all of those symptoms were relatively mild compared to textbooks cases. I would keep getting told it was \"borderline\" and to just get my heart checked every couple of years.\n\nI think that most doctors know very little about Marfan's syndrome aside from the more severe cases that are iconic for Marfan's syndrome. Also, my parents were dead set on me just having depression and would tell the doctors that before they examined me, so that probably also skewed their perspective.\n\nRegardless, you should not put yourself into a situation where you sit around worrying for years if you are unsure. Your cardiologist should not brush aside your concerns. If you feel like you received inadequate care, I recommend trying to find a specialist well acquainted with Marfans, or at least a different cardiologist.\n\nAs an aside: all of my female friends have constant stories about doctors downplaying their visits and being reluctant to run non-invasive tests. My mom experienced the same even with a terminal illness. I (M) and my male friends have never experienced in adulthood. You should never feel like you are not being taken seriously in a doctor's office.\n\nOn the other hand, do not resign yourself to having Marfan's syndrome if you are not absolutely certain, and be sure to listen to doctors if they do their due diligence and still conclude everything's fine. There is a lot of Marfan's anxiety going around lately, and a lot of those people are completely healthy. Even genetic tests may not ease their anxiety, because there is still the occasional case caused by an undiscovered mutation missed by genetic testing. Just do your best to keep yourself grounded and on the right path \ud83d\udc4d That is what I am most scared about tbh..that I will develop complications suddenly when I am least expecting it. \n\nThe best wishes for you. Living with any chronic condition, marfan or not, is tough as hell. I have normal body proportions, which is why my doctor was even more adamant I did not need testing. My fingers and hypermobility look pretty damn typical though. But I hear all the time about Marfan's patients who were short, or stocky or..yeah. It just seems that genetic testing is the only truly reliable test for marfanoids like us.\n\nIt is not that I think I was not taken seriously, just that the diagnostic criteria itself seems a bit..risky. \n\nI would personally take the collective anxiety as a collateral of more people getting in the know about these disorders, which is a good thing! It is definitely hard to keep myself grounded in the presence of so much anxiety, but hey! I try. And thanks a lot! According to several studies published on NCBI, most marfan syndrome patients develop aortic dilation early in life. Furthermore, things like hyper mobility is found on 1 out of 20 people making it rather common, therefore it is a \"soft symptom\".\n\nFurthermore, aortic dilation(in early age and/or an abnormally high Z-score) and lens displacement is almost trademark of a connective tissue disease, so specificity is high for these two symptoms.\n\nYou have to remember that, at the end of the day, marfan syndrome is a spectrum.Interestingly, when talking about variable expressivity (the degree to which a phenotype is expressed by individuals having a particular genotype) we used marfan as the example lol.What this means is that, while you might have a positive genetic test (FBN1 mutation) you might not express the whole genotype in your phenotype (physical traits) such as aortic dilation, but you might have the other \"soft symptoms\".\n\nEdit:I am a med student who also has arachnodactyly, pigeon chested, tons of skin stretch marks, double jointed, long arms (although my heigh and arm span ratio is not enough for the criteria), very skinny (130lbs) and tall (6'0).\n\nHowever I have had three echoes done - age 18 normal aorta -&gt; age 23 normal aorta.Also an angiography CT scan - normal results.\n\nSo, I guess we are in the same situation. Welcome aboard this ramshackle boat. I had pretty much accepted an alternative exclusion diagnosis (hEDS) when I dug a lil further and found ( paper. \n\nWish I could find more studies on borderline cases like ours, though I guess they are not considered clinically as important as the textbook ones (with good reason).\n\nIt is just..the total uncertainty about the prognosis, you know? And having no idea what to expect..will my aorta stay normal? Will new \"hard\" signs appear? Will they appear in two years or ten? Should I restrict activity should I not? I am not finding much literature on folks like us. &gt;alternative exclusion di\n\nohh interesting study - full text: (\n\nWow, so the sample size was 160.(100%)  \nOut of 160 -&gt; 115 developed aortic dilation. (72%)  \nOut of 115 -&gt; 78 were below the age of 19 (68%)  \nOut of 115 -&gt; 37 were above the age of 19 (32%)\n\nOut of the initial 160 -&gt; 76 had an initial healthy echo (48%).Out of the 76 who had a healthy initial echo -&gt; 45 stayed healthy (59%) &amp; 31 developed dilation (41%).\n\nHere is the interesting part:\n\nout of those 31 of the 76 that had an initial healthy echo and then developed dilation -&gt; 24 (77%) developed dilation before age 19 and 7 (22.6%) were after the age of 19. I do not think it is too strict, as the disorder has become somewhat fashionable to claim to have. The overwhelming rareness of the disease in people without family history *and* without aortic root dilation *or* lens dislocation is extreme, especially when compared to the prevalence of people with hypochondria. ( I see. Thank you for that insight. \n\nI just feel like it is a little hard to be certain about how \"overwhelming\" that rareness is, seeing as there are conflicting reports available in the literature, and very little literature available on the prognosis and long term outcomes for borderline cases.\n\nHowever, I do not see why anyone would wish a disorder upon themselves to seem \"fashionable\" especially when the diagnosis is associated with lifestyle restrictions, difficulty getting medical insurance, and unfortunately, social stigma. I also think it is rather too easy to dismiss someone as a hypochondriac, when they are seeking specific answers about very real physiological issues they experience, if those answers are inconclusive or not readily available. That made me chuckle. I do have a therapist, thank you for your concern! :D I have had the exact same experience as you! Now diagnosed with joint hyper mobility syndrome Hi! My diagnosis atm is hEDS. I have not been given those alerts by my doctors tho, thanks for tipping me off haha :'( I was told my skin does not stretch enough to be EDS and I am not bendy enough, I used to be but I have disclocated my knees etc so often that they are quite stiff now. Xx My skin is stretchy on my eyelids, volar surface of arms, sides of neck and chest. Not extremely stretchy, but it is noticeable. I am an 8/9 BS, cannot do the palms to floor coz super tight hamstrings.\n\nI have never dislocate but can sublux at will. Case in point, I used to pull my fingers to make them sublux at the knuckles and freak out my cousins till I heard one really should not be doing that shit. :| The doctor only tested my hand skin for stretch, huh.\n\nYes omg I used to love doing that w my fingers! I am a 7 BS because my knees do not bend backwards Z scores are not really used with adults but a z score of less than 2 is normal. \n\nHonestly with the prevalence of other hypermobile conditions I am not sure I understand why some people are convinced that they have Marfans when they do not have any of the symptoms specific to it. (Marfanoid body type \u2260 Marfans). If you have had your eyes and heart tested and you are still worried, do the genetic testing. But honestly, disagnostic criteria exist for a reason. There is no such thing as a mild case or borderline case with a genetic mutation. Either there is a mutation or there is not. A lot of the symptoms that you listed are not linked to Marfans either. My diagnosis is hEDS, which is a diagnosis of exclusion. The point of this post was that I am sceptical about how reliably Marfan's can be excluded based on the absence of heart and eye issues in a young adult.\n\nReason for scepticism: Tho I would really like to believe that there is no such thing as a mild case, there are multiple references to \"incomplete forms\" and \"forme frustes\" of Marfans in the literature and reports about patients with Marfan's diagnosed rather late in life after some catastrophic event, which would still be \"mild\" cases compared to those that show symptoms by adulthood. \n\nMy worry boils down to the lack of statistics on the incidence of marfanoid features especially arachnodactyly in patients with hEDS/JHS or resources on monitoring and long term prognosis of Marfanoid hypermobile patients specifically. I do not think those who are diagnosed later would be considered mild \u2014 just undiagnosed. I have not yet heard of anyone who has had Marfans ruled out only to have an aortic dissection later in life and be given the diagnosis. (Not that they do not exist) But as you said hEDS is a diagnosis of exclusion\u2014 which means that the doctor needs to exclude Marfans in order to get to an hEDS diagnosis. The Ghent criteria does give some leeway there. I am wary of doctors diagnosing hEDS without running genetic tests. I mean atleast assigning genetic testing more weightage in the criteria would be a safer approach and prevent erroneous ruling out..right? For eg. with the Ghent criteria even having the major criterion of a positive genetic test would not diagnose me as a Marfan's patient because you need 2 major criteria, while I only have involvement (not major criteria) of skeletal, ocular (myopia) and skin (striae) AS YET. \n\nIf one was to develop major criteria later in life, their non fulfilment of Ghent would become fulfilment. So they would go from being \"not a Marfan's patient\" to \"Marfan's patient\" despite having already been evaluated for it...\n\nDoes not that just seem a little unreliable? I mean that is when it comes down to genetics, which is pretty strong in the testing. The main thing is your heart though. A z score of .45 is tiny. I do not even know how you get a score that low. Without meeting literally any of the significant diagnostic criteria I do not know why you would be convinced you have it. Because of the hypermobility of large and small joints, stretchy skin, taller than average height, joint pain, tachycardia, chronic hypotension, other issues I have mentioned above..\n\nAnd the GP who first suggested this to me said my \"hands have the exact look of someone with Marfan's\".\n\nI get where you are coming from, though. I was just told by my mom's specialist at the Mayo Clinc I need to be genetically tested (we had a general evaluation as a kid, but there was no genetic test at the time) I display some but not all characteristics of having Marfans. \n\nBut when they genetically tested my mom it took several times to locate her marker for Marfan's because while she has the genetic marker, it is in a place they have not previously found it before. It is closer to the Ellers Danulos (sp?) So now they are saying while I (as well as my sister and aunt) dont fit that stringent criteria they want all of us genetically tested. My parents do not have any symptoms of any connective tissue disorder, but my paternal grandmother had long arms and fingers like myself. She had a history of heart problems but nothing specific to Marfan's afaik, but given that my parents show no signs at all, doc said it is pointless to have genetic testing since I would not fulfill the criteria even with a positive test. So while he stated I \"might have\" Marfan's, he would not recommend testing, and I am left with a huge lot of uncertainty.\n\nHow is your heart? Are you getting monitoring? What other signs do you show? As far as my heart goes, I have not had it checked in a long time, but I think it is ok? (I have actually been pretty sick the past 2 years because doctors would not listen to me I had a very blocked/ infected sinus cavity I needed surgery to fix) my heart did fine when I was under and I had no issues.\n\nMy issues:\n\n- extremely hyper mobile especially in my spine and hips- I have been through over 8 rounds of PT to help strengthen my back and hips. But my hips still get pulled out of alignment, as well as my spine (I will develop scoliosis temporarily) when my back muscles seize up. \n\n- longer arm span than height\n\n- weak eye muscles and nearsightedness but my eyes arent flat like my mom's are.\n\n- sometimes my joints just give out and I fall down (more so as a kid, but still happens occasionally) \n\n- above average height, but not Marfans tall ( I am 5'9\" my mom (who has it) is 6', her dad who passed away from it was 6'8\")\n\n- many of my joints chronically \"pop\" out of place and I have to pop them back in. Your issues sound a lot like mine. I too have taller than avg height for an Asian (5 feet 6), arm span about 1-2 cm longer, and the extreme hypermobility especially prominent in my hands and fingers. My spine is so flexible I can twist my upper body around and face behind me and then some with my legs fixed (I know that is a creepy image).\n\nIt would be interesting to know about your genetic markers, esp. whether you have the same one as your mum. When you find out, perhaps check back in and let us know if you want? It would help out a lot of people like us in this diagnostic no mans land.\n\nI hope you get some answers soon. :) Yes. Definitely. The signs and symptoms on the ghent criteria are too stringent in my opinion. For example, I have Marfan Syndrome, I have known all my life I have Marfan Syndrome. But my ONLY signs are stretch marks, being 6'8\" and having dislocated lenses. I do not have flat feet, do not present the thumb or wrist signs, do not have strechy skin, do not have joint issues. I never fit into a clinical diagnosis until my Aortic Root grew to over 40mm.  \n\n\nHOWEVER - There ARE additional features of Marfan Syndrome which have been clearly shown in scientific studies, for example, Sleep Apnea.  \n\n\n (   \n\" Thereby we identified the following features: (1) bicuspid aortic valve, mitral valve prolapse, pulmonary valve prolapse, tricuspid valve prolapse, (2) heart failure and cardiomyopathy, (3) supraventricular arrhythmia, ventricular arrhythmia, and abnormal repolarization, (4) spontaneous coronary artery dissection, anomalous coronary arteries, and atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, tortuosity-, aneurysm-, and dissection of large and medium-sized arteries, (5) restrictive lung disease, parenchymal lung disease, and airway disorders, (6) obstructive- and central sleep apnea, (7) liver and kidney cysts, biliary tract disease, diaphragmatic hernia, and adiposity, (8) premature labor, and urinary incontinence, (9) myopathy, reduced bone mineral density, and craniofacial manifestations, (10) atrophic scars, (11) caries, and craniomandibular dysfunction, (12) headache from migraine and spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leakage, (13) cognitive dysfunction, schizophrenia, depression, fatigue, and pain, (14) and activated fibrinolysis, thrombin, platelets, acquired von Willebrand disease, and platelet dysfunction. \" So among the features discussed, valve prolapse, cardiomyopathy, ventricular arrythmia, obstructive sleep apnea and liver or kidney cysts seem to be the most specific to Marfan's. Very interesting article, thanks for sharing.\n\nThe cardiomyopathy sign stood out to me since I have impaired diastolic relaxation secondary to tachycardia. My grandmother had heart failure, though she survived three heart attacks and died in old age.  \n\nIf you do not mind me asking, how old were you when your aortic root was discovered? Did you have normal results when you had echocardiograms done before?", "(NSFW) is masturbation safe  Talk to your cardiologist if you have concerns about any physical activity.", "23 and Me detecting marfan gene? New to all this, sorry. My dad had marfan. He had a ton of heart issues that were left until too late and he died at 48.  I am 27 and only now learning stuff about the condition. My kids are all seeing cardiologists due to heart murmurs and the doc told me I should get tested for the gene to rule out marfan. I do not have great insurance(medicaid share of cost) and we do not have a lot of specialists in the area. I was wondering if any mail order genealogy tests could detect markers for marfan? Sorry if this is a dumb question. Unfortunately no. They can give you your genome but I am not sure we are smart enough to interpret what the data says. Ah. Damn. I guess I will have to track down a genetic counselor. You can download your DNA file from 23 and me and then upload it to Promethease. For $12 you can get super detailed info on all sorts of diseases. I believe Marfan was in there but you may want to double check. Awesome! Did not know that That price tells me they are selling your dna specific details to other companies though sadly Might, not guaranteed.   As I understand it, \"Marfans\" can be any of many possible mutations / defects to the fibrillin gene.  A genetic test could screen for *some* of them.   You ( and your Father ) could have a less-common, or unknown to science variant. So many variants. I believe I am one of them. My cardiologist was able to take a blood sample and send it off for genetic testing (I am UK though)\n\nBut on the balance of probabilities if your dad had it and you and your kids meet the Ghent criteria you have almost certainly got marfans (though I guess your dad may have been diagnosed based on symptoms rather than genetics so there is a small chance he had a different, similar, condition to pass down) I have done this. It did not show up for me. I also did a complete DNA sequencing package from ( \\- it also did not show up there.\n\nI asked my Geneticist and he said that most of the time the Marfan mutations will not show up because detecting some mutations require a specific process.\n\nMy mutation only showed up from the report of the genetic test that my geneticist ordered. 23 and me uses a \"chip\" that only looks for known, common variations in a tiny part your DNA.   Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) is much better and can be done for as little as $300.   I had it done, it shows that my mutation is NOT on FBN1 (Marfan's), but on FBN2  (( ).

I am very open with my marfans honestly. It is typically talked about on a first date if not the second for sure. That is just me though.

It can be really nice to share some of the mental burden of worrying about your health.  If he responds negatively he is probably not worth staying with. Anybody who would change their view about you over something so insignificant as having Marfan's probably is not worth keeping around. This post is old so hope it went well though.

It is likely that you all are tired of the weight posts, but I am really curious as to *why* it is difficult for us to gain weight? Do we have higher metabolism? Does it not sit well on us? What components are there? I think it varies by person.  I have Marfan Syndrome and I am almost 30 pounds overweight. With age, it definitely becomes easier to gain (for some of us at least). For me it is definitely metabolism. I have been 115 pounds since I was 17 which for my height is SEVERELY UNDERWEIGHT. I have never dipped under that in 4 years and have had no health complications because of it. I figure that marfans affects so many aspects of the body there is no reason to assume it would not affect metabolism. Tall people who are still growing have difficulty gaining weight, so reddit's primary demos of teens and 20 somethings skew a bias. Tall people in general have to eat *a lot* more to put on weight, so if you are 6'5\" and the rest of your family is 5'8\" and below and you are eating with the same habits, you naturally will not gain weight.\n\nMarfs have difficulty putting on *healthy* weight, too, because it is dangerous for us to exercise a lot.\n\nMarfs do not violate the laws of nature. If you are not gaining weight, you need to eat more. (Mandatory \"Metabolism does not work like that\" notation- if you are underweight you have a slow metabolism unless you have something wrong with your hormones as well like hyperthyroidism.) Well, I am 5'8 and I tend to struggle with my weight quite a bit. Can you clarify on the metabolism part? I find it intriguing. I am like 6'5 and 150lbs (68kg) so I kind of know a thing or two about not being able to gain any weight. I have even gone as far as trying protein powders and some other things which also never worked. Seems to be no luck with weight gain so I have just accepted it. Honestly I eat normally (three meals a day with snacks and dessert) and I have been typically between 100-105 lbs (I am 6\u20192\u201d) for the past 5 years (since I stopped growing). It is a confusing phenomena! I was painfully skinny as a child - knobby knees and elbows... But I agree it is easier to gain weight as you age and your metabolism slows down. My thing, though, is that I feel like I have weird fat.  Some people have nice, sorta firm, pudge. I do not know how to describe mine other than as, um, watery. Or something. It seems a lot less dense than other people's fat. I tend to be skinny with squishy or droopy pudge. Gross. Late to the thread...

Wrost case scenario it is MVP(Mitral Valve Prolapse), but I highly doubt that. No Marfan's here btw. Just look like it cause I am tall and lanky.  Heart palpitations are not necessarily Marfan syndrome related. That said, it is something you will want to address with the cardiologist. If it is something like atrial fibrillation, there is a risk for blood clots.  I had the same except they did diagnose me with Marfans. I did have to undergo surgery for my heart at age 18.

My main concern is daily joint pain and the feeling of unsteady joints in my hips, knees, and ankles, does anyone else experience this?  Yup, it is extremely common +1, my ankles hurt daily. I go to concerts very often n my knees will hurt from standing. I also play guitar n have for 8 years n my hand will get achey. Also my feet cramp up from standing a lot too. I do not know if this is all related but I for sure know I have marfans n it is common Very much so. I suggest asking your gp/family doctor for a refferal to a pain management specialist. ", "The other day I was daydreaming about a life without marfans. Do you guys think it will be curable in the future? I know right now there is not a cure and maybe there will not be ever but maybe it will. I wanted to ask anyone who has asked this question to a geneticist, is it possible to change one gene in an alive human being? Or I am just dreaming. \n\nThx for reading With CRISPR, I think it will be curable one day. But that is not going to happen in the next couple decades. I sometimes have dreams that I get abducted by aliens. They show up, get rid of marfans, straighten my back, fix up my heart and then send me back to earth lol.  \n\n\nYo aliens where are you, I am sure you can help out me here.  \n\n\nI do believe it will be curable in the future though. Here is hoping future generations will not have to deal with this crap. i do not really see how you could change marfan without fundamentally changing us - while it does not affect everything, the code for it is in literally every one of our cells. i hope the individual treatments for the issues it causes improve though I do not think it will ever really be curable as the damage has already been done from the minute any of us are conceived. The treatment plan for marfans as it currently stands is to treat the symptoms. Even if you somehow cure marfans then you will still have to treat the symptoms and the deterioration that comes with them. Our aorta would still grow, valves will still leak, eyes would still have the lenses dislocate, joints would get worse and scoliosis will not suddenly get better.\n\nTechnically marfans is incurable. I think that it is going to get to the point where having typical Marfan Syndrome is just a minor inconvenience with medication and monitoring. (Unless it is multiple mutations).  \n\n\nFor example, we have the development of PEARS - Surgery that covers the aorta with a mesh, nobody who has had PEARS surgery has had any aortic growth after the surgery.   \n\n\nThere are further tests being done with -Sartan medications and beta blockers and other drugs that will likely be able to slow the growth of aortic aneurysms to the point of almost stopping the growth.  \n\n\nLens removal in my opinion is the best way to deal with the dislocated lenses, I just wear ProClear Multifocal XR contact lenses and did not get an implanted lens. I can see nearly 20/20.\n\n  \nI think in the next few years, geneticists will collaborate with cardiologists to better classify Marfan mutations and prescribe certain medications depending on the exact mutation classification.  \n\n\nAs for joint issues, I am not sure as I have never had any Joint issues can be fixed by a rheumatologist and physiotherapist. Orthotics are quite good with physiotherapy and worst case scenario surgery. \nI would not say curable, but I think it will be eradicated!\n\nI am sure there is already a test that can check for it but I would imagine in future every disability will be tested for and if positive, people will terminate it.\n\nI know a lot complain about destroying a life but disabled people are becoming increasingly disadvantaged! In the UK, the government is doing its best to push disabled off benefits, jobs are impossible to get\u2026 \n\nso if you have a choice of bringing a child up, watching them struggle, get bullied, constantly hitting brick walls because of a disability, or ending it, what would you choose?\n\nAnd sadly I only see things getting worse in future. I am just glad I grew up before the social media pressure because I dread to think how bad growing up is now. Actually, I am a student who is doing genetics bachelor and I can say that I have some thoughts how it can be cured. Aorta for example and Len's luxation (if we change FBN1 and make him to do normal volume of fibrillin - in theory the symptoms will be cured).  Now we have some good results with spinal muscular atrophy and etc. There is an article about crispr-cas using in mouse's aorta. (It is a long way to go, but I hope to change something during my master degree for marfan community)", "On vacation and scared Hi, I am a 20 year old male and after a restless night while on vacation where I heard clicking noises coming from my chest (which I now remember have had a couple times before) and some googling I discovered I most probably have mitral valve syndrome. \n\nAfter some more anxious surfing I came across Marfan syndrome and I seem to resemble some symptoms:\n\n-very skinny/thin (6 foot 130 pounds/183 cm 59 kg)\n-Flat feet\n-Most probably mitral valve prolapse\n-Used to have very visible stretch marks on thighs for no apparent reason, now they have become less visible.\n-Another than the father of one of my grandparents having died of a bursting aorta, I do not seem to have anyone in the family with any obvious symptoms.\n-Eyes are fine\n-Fingers and limbs are not especially long, just thin. Hands are pretty small actually\n-No chest deformation\n\nSince I am on vacation right now I will not be able to visit a doctor anytime soon, so I would appreciate it if someone could give me some insight into how probable it is to have Marfan syndrome with these symptoms. \n\nI am getting very anxious and do not want to unnecessarily spoil the vacation for myself and the people around me, so if it is improbable I have this condition I would appreciate the relief :) \n\nSorry if this subreddit is not meant for these kinds of posts, but it is just so much in one day, from never having to deal with health issues to probably having some heart disorder and maybe also Mafran. So I really needed to share this with some people that know what this condition is about. Thanks in advance. A lot of people with marfans have joint hypermobility. Google Brighton scale and see what you can do out of that. And if you cannot do the marfans hand signs I think it is prob unlikely. Take a deep breath and relax. You are going to be fine. Do not spoil your vacation. Obviously, if you feel you are in immediate medical trouble, you should stop what you are doing, vacation or not, and see a doctor.\n\nBeyond that, there is absolutely nothing that worrying about having Marfan Syndrome is going to do for you while on vacation. If you cannot do anything about it until you get home, then do not worry about it until you get home. \n\nHakuna Marfana.\n\nWhen you DO get home, go see your doctor and voice your concerns. They will help you get to a place of knowledge.  That is sounds great, I am embarrassingly inflexible for my age. Cannot even touch my feet without bending my knees :')\n\nMy thumb does not stick out of my hand. I can (barely) reach my thumb with my pinky around my wrist, but this might as well be because I am skinny. \n\nI cannot do anything of the Brighton scale btw, is this something almost everyone with Marfan can do? Thank you. Reading your comment made me feel relaxed for the first time today. I will try to not worry until I get home, though I am not exactly the type of person that is good at that. I think the elbows commonly do not hyperextend in marfans but the rest there is some. If you cannot do the signs and have no hypermobility I would say your fine. Talk to a doc when you get back about that clicking. Mitral valve prolapse is not a life threatening condition as far as I know, so try not to worry and enjoy your vacation! I have diagnosed Marfans and I can do Barry anything on the Brighton scale, so I would not let that be the end all be all.  Like everybody says, enjoy your vacation for now and sort things out later! Everything will be ok! Thanks for the reassurance, I really appreciate it. I will get to the bottom of this, but your comment gives me a lot of hope.", "Gen 1 and gen 2  I tell my little string bean that we have the same heart. She is the sweetest little trooper. That certainly is an aww picture. Are you both diagnosed with Marfan? You have way more \u201cmeat\u201d on your bones than my son. I am, we are waiting for his official diagnosis. He is only 3 but he is the height of most 6 year olds.  I have worked hard for that meat. I am 6\u20194\u201d and 195. Five years ago I was 165. It is a slow climb but I am fortunate to not have any restrictions. That is awesome you have been able to gain weight. I have not been diagnosed but my son has. I was 6\u2019 155 for most of my life. Then the 50\u2019s hit Gaining weight has not been an issue. My son is 6\u20196\u201d 175. I never thought anything about it as his dad and I are tall and our parents are tall.

But I was 6\u2019 in the 6th grade.", "Had Aortic repair surgery done back in '14 I have been back to work for a year now and doing well overall, but over those three years and more recently I have noticed some social anxiety issues that were not quite as prevalent pre-surgery.\n\nI have looked up some ( and while I think my memory has certainly taken a hit, it is nothing as severe as in that article.\n\nSo what I am asking is kind of complicated, but am I correct to suggest that the surgery is related to the social anxiety, and has anyone experienced anything similar? It is possible that it could be due to surgery, but it is more likely it is unrelated. I have something known as situational depression- sometimes it just...pops up. Change in weather, change in routine, etc. \n\nSocial anxiety, or any anxiety, can start at any points in a persons life and there does not necessarily HAVE to be a cause. That is a big misinterpretation in the mental health community- there does not have to be a trigger, bad situation, or in this case, a complication. \n\nI would recommend seeing a therapist, at least for a beginning appointment. They can help bunches, truly. Whether it is post op complication or not, it is good to get some help on the matter. \n\nGood luck!  Bit pooped from work but this has been helpful now that I have had time to absorb it.\n\nI have been waiting to arrange something with a therapist but my work takes me away from home and with little time in between to do so. It is going to be another month still until I will have the time but it is absolutely what I want to do and would prefer it to a prescription.\n\nMany thanks! I think this is pretty common.  I took part in a follow up study being conducted by the cardiac unit of the hospital I had my surgery in (it is affiliated with a major Medical College) and the study was focused on changes in mental state (anxiety, depression, etc).  I cannot comment myself as I have had some depression issues due to events in my life unrelated to the surgery and my health. Well, if it is at all a factor I think I can try to manage with the anxiety until I can consult a professional.\n\nThank you for the info &amp; I hope you are doing well. I have had 3 big surgeries now (2007, 2014 x2).  After my two most recent, I swore up and down that I had some kind of POCD or something.  I think my long-term memory is worse than it was, but funny thing about long-term memory.. I cannot  remember how it was before the surgeries, so who knows!\n\nAs far as social anxiety is concerned, I got over my social anxiety a long time ago and have not looked back since, although for me it was not as much of an anxiety issue as it was a confidence issue.  Maybe you are a little less confident in yourself post-surgery?  It is totally understandable, I know I was for awhile.  You feel weaker, you feel vulnerable, etc.   &gt; I think my long-term memory is worse than it was, but funny thing about long-term memory.. I cannot remember how it was before the surgeries, so who knows!\n\nI should not be laughing at this. This is a terrible thing to find amusing. Just as well, I can indeed relate.\n\nAnd you may be onto something with the confidence issue. I know I have had small issues with being self conscious and it may be that is what is increased since the surgery or is at least another factor. But I am not a doctor.\n\nSpeaking of which, good to know seeing a therapist was helpful, I do have a plan but I will have to wait until the middle of September.  And I can manage until then, especially with the helpful words.\n\nThanks.", "DAE feel indifferent about if they die or not? ", "Wiki What happened to it?

While most of us are not doctors, I am sure some are, whether it be physicians or psychotherapists. Yes, nothing can substitute a visit to the doctor, but all of us might not have equal access to advanced healthcare nor the means to get it for ourselves. Besides, the lived experiences of people who have been diagnosed or going through the process could be very helpful for those just starting out on the diagnostic journey. As for redirecting people to marfan.org I have personally reached out to them in the past and never heard back, I suspect because I do not live in the US, but I am pretty sure other people have had similar experiences. Thoughts? I agree. Reaching a doctor is not a given for many people, and it can take time.\n\nPeople are often just looking for opinions and immediate feedback. It does not mean they are using this subreddit as a substitute for asking a doctor. It just means they want advice from people who have been through the same thing *in addition* to advice they are going to get from their doctor.\n\nAlso, doctors are not necessarily very knowledgeable about Marfan Syndrome. My PCP was not. I learned more from this subreddit than I did from her. Soon I am being referred to a cardiologist, but I had to schedule it over a month out. It is not ideal, but right now this subreddit is my best source of information regarding Marfan Syndrome.\n\nMy main point is, **shutting off this subreddit to any medical advice whatsoever is harmful because it discourages people from looking into whether they may have Marfan.** I think the job of this subreddit should be to be receptive to people's concerns and guide them in the right direction. We should be able to give advice here as long as we acknowledge that a medical professional's input would be preferable. We can offer input while still encouraging people to talk to their doctor.  You can tell people your experience and what you do personally, this is not giving medical advice. Generally most of the posts I see on here asking if they have Marfans, the people need to see a cardiologist/geneticist either way. Your comment got automoderated because you used the magic evil phrase \u201cdo I have m...\u201d lol. Sorry I took so long to notice. Approved. Here is the thing: some people ARE using advice here as a substitute for medical advice. And  we cannot regulate some people but not others.

I was diagnosed at... shit, 13? 14? Over 20 years ago, in any case. I do not have numbers, but I would been told for years that my aortic dilation was borderline, some dr's did not even really consider it dilated. \n\nWell, because circumstances, I went years without an imaging. Got one at the beginning of this month, and the dr got back to me today. Aorta is currently 4.5cm, which is borderline \"needs fucking heart surgery\". He said if it would been 5, or closer to, he would already be making arrangements. As it is, he is having me meet a heart surgeon and is going to attempt to start me on a new blood pressure med (\"attempt\" because I already have pretty low BP to start with). \n\nI am freaking the fuck out, fam. I would always hoped in the back of my mind, with the earlier measurements, that I would be lucky and never need heart surgery. This makes it pretty much goddamn inevitable. Possibly soon, depending on the rate of dilation. I do not heal well or quickly these days, getting older. Had three hernia surgeries the other year because it would not heal normal like with other people. \n\nShit. I am just freaking out right now. Sorry for the shit post, but I had to vent somewhere. Trying not to be visibly shaken here at work. Fucking shit, you all. My older brother had his aortic valve replaced at age 46 and is kicking ass now six years later. I know it is not the same procedure, but they also had to deal with a large aortic aneurysm so he had to be cracked open too.\n\nIs your doctor up to date on marfan's? Is there a specialist you can see? One who has a lot of experience with marfans patients?\n\nMy best advice is to listen to your body. Always. Do not ignore congestive heart failure signs... breathing issues, super bad fatigue, chest and back pain. Swelling in the ankles. \n\nStick to guidelines,on exercise.\n\nIf you drink alcohol, consider pulling back hard. It only exacerbates things. \n\nHang in there and be your own advocate. Do not be afraid to get a second opinion. \n\n So glad you are okay. =) Thanks for the encouragement and the advice! Yes, my cardiologist is awesome and is on the ball with the marfans stuff. He is actually a new cardiologist as of last year (I had not been in a couple years, and my old one was not there anymore), and I am super happy with this guy.\n\nUpdate, I am on Losartan in addition to my nadolol, because it is supposed to be very effective at reducing dilation, or the rate thereof. I am a *little* less freaked out, because I found my old medical records, and found that the dilation was less borderline than I would thought - it has not grown THAT much on the last 8-10 years as I thought it had. Looking forward to my follow up this year, hopefully soon. Got To keep an eye on this shit now.", "Can a parent carry the gene for marfan without showing symptoms?  Yes I am not sure what you are asking. \n\nYou can have mild symptoms or do not look like you have it, but still have it. Then when you have children 50/50 chance they will have it too. \n\nOf you do not have marfans, you wont give it to your children. Marfans is not presented in recessive genes. \n\nFor example my sister do not have marfans, I have. Her children are healthy and there were no chance of them having it. Yeah, my mom did not have any heart issues, but she carried the gene with little to no symptoms Not really. You can have a very mild case of Marfan and so not show any outward signs of the disorder, but it is an autosomal dominant genetic mutation, not a recessive, so there is no such thing as a \"carrier\"; you either have Marfan or you do not. The Marfan Foundation talks about it a bit on their website,  They are a great resource for any questions that you may have. I would not say no chance. After my father was diagnosed, my entire family, including my grandparents, had their blood drawn and tested for marfans. My father was the only to have it (besides myself) and both of his parents tested negative.", "Need advice for 10 year old I am hoping to get some tips for raising a boy with Marfans.  He is 10 and this past year has been rough for him.  I think it is mainly PE and recess at school that leaves him feeling bad about himself.  I feel like he could use some sort of extra help/encouragement.  Any ideas? As in not being able to participate in those things?\n\nGrowing up with marfans is rough. It makes you look different. That alone is hard to deal with. Kids can be quick to use it against you. What helped me was finding hobbies I was passionate about. I loved playing video games. Eventually I discovered the drama program at my school. That was such a huge thing for me. I could get on stage and make people laugh. It gave me confidence in myself. Soon I went from being an outsider at school to kind of a celebrity, it was weird. Anyway, find a passion. Geek out on it. Get good at it. It will give him confidence. I would recommend talking with the PE teacher about other things he could do during the planned activities. For example, my teacher would always let me keep score while the other kids played. She made me her right hand which actually made me feel special... Thanks!  I will try to get him involved in other things.  I think PE and recess is hard because he is noticing he cannot do the things other kids do.  Like they were doing a circuit training kind of thing and he just sat at the sit up station for the entirety of PE because he could not do one.  It is kind of his fault for not talking to the teacher about it or just saying screw this and moving on but it still ruined his day.  Maybe PE is just very in-your-face about his limitations. Great idea. Thanks!  Ive heard of many people with marfans turning to music. This being that its a great way to express yourself, also long fingers make for great musicians!!! Marfans has always run in my family. Finding something he loves will boost his confidence in other things. Just, as you know, always encourage him. I remember doing this exact thing, drawing and getting creative. Eventually I got into the high school production of the Pink Panther, and I fell off the stage. So much for being careful with PE and Marfan lolll My elementary school gym teacher did the same thing for me. ", "marfs and capacitsm? Hello everbody I would like to bring a discussion about some subtle or direct discrimination that we marfs suffer and I would like to listen what are your thoughs on this topic.\n\nSo we got a lot of stuff going on with our body that makes us feel things that other people do not. Back pains, breath shortage, we avoid carrying heavy weight. Since I am a child I carry this stigma in my family that I am the lazy one because I do not lift up the bagage on trips or I have to do the dishes in a span of 1 hour because I need to rest my back after 20 min standing up. I remind them about my condition and they accept it but it is a recurrent thing that makes me think that there may be some misconceptions behind it.\n\nThose events happens in my inner familly and I still consider very them super supportive after all.\n\nIn this new year I had the misfortune of having one of my spine related pain/spasms attack and while the champagne popped I was on the floor crying and writhing in pain. My family inner circle know about this issue that I have and helped me but some outer members were starring in a judgmental way untill someone said \"Oh! So that is how you get attention\"\nI was pissed of course but I do not really care for this particular member so I just kept it for me.\n\nbut those were exemples of a subtle and a direct expression of discrimination, do you guys experience this? would it fit in the \"capacitism\" label?\n\n I would like to reafirm that this is a place of acceptance and validation. I remember in my swimming class years back all the guys would look at me like a freak and my friend at the time would always say \"wtf is wrong with your chest?\". I always just chalked it up to being greatly underweight, but thankfully I was never bothered by it and the teachers were very understanding of how I struggled with physical exercise. Same cant be said about gym where the teachers pushed me to the point of passing out and almost sent me to the principal for \"faking it\". \"You are not fat, you can run a mile\". I also ended up breaking my ankle because of that class and had no health insurance to cover it. Wish at the time I could put a name to my condition but I just thought it was normal and sucked it up. \n\nI hate the misconception that just because somebody is skinny they can handle rigorous physical activity and if they cant they \"need to eat more\" and \"stop being lazy\". Eating are not going to fix the carinatum and heart problems as much as i wish it would Preach. I am 42 and have dealt with similar unsolicited commentary through the years from family, friends and strangers alike. It took me years to realize how inappropriate it is for people to always feel the need to comment on someone is body, life choices, health, etc. I have set up boundaries now with people and if someone says something I no longer defend or explain I just say something like \u201cthat is interesting you would say that\u201d and just walk away or change the subject or \u201cthanks but I am good\u201d and again just walk away or change the subject.", "Running with Marfan's During a routine physical to run cross country, my doctor had raised concerns of Marfan's, and I plan to get tested sometime in the next few weeks. I have been running competitively for over five years and have never had any issues, nether have I had any remarkable symptoms. But recently reading over the signs of Marfan's, most of them are prominent with me. I was just wondering what are my options to possibly continue running should my test come back positive. Thanks in advance. I was diagnosed 4 years ago when I was running 30-50 mpw and have been able to keep running since.  My dr said that because I already had a running baseline he encouraged me to continue and maintain regular echos. \n\nI will say I have encountered new difficulties with the ligaments since then and have been doing PT for 18 months.  I will be lucky if I have more than a few years I am capable of running but it is only due to pain in my joints from the hyper mobility. So, NAD, of course. \n\nI have had mitral &amp; aortic valve replacements and an aortic graft, I have crap lungs (restrictive lung disorder), yada yada. I was looking into jogging at one point for health, since cardio! My cardiologist at the time said it was fine, and that so long as I was able to hold a conversation while jogging it was perfectly fine. I was warned that it might be hard on my joints (it was, until I got proper shoes) but beyond that, if I know I am pushing my limits too far I should pull back a bit. I am regularly monitored via echos and whatnot, so it was not a major concern.\n\nEveryone is situation varies- but you should be fine. Sorry to hear it.  I have found an elliptical to be easier on the joints if you are looking for a cardio substitute though obviously YMMV.\n\nedit:  If you do not mind me asking, what do they have you doing for PT?  I may start another thread, but I recently started, have been having good results, but worry they are taking the marf into account properly.  Are you doing any core/upper back exercises? Thanks for the suggestion!  It is nice to have alternative options moving forward!  \n\nThe issue I have been dealing with has been in my knees where under certain situations my knee extension will result in some sliding instead of a rotational movement. We think this is exacerbated by very tight hamstrings and hip flexors so the work is to stretch those while also strengthening the same in addition to core stabilization.\n\nI am lucky that I found a PT who considers Marfans in her treatment plan, since too much stretching has negatively affected me.\n\nWhat is your PT for? My hamstrings were/are like steel cables before I started lol.\n\nI am doing a lot of core stuff to help with posture/breathing.  After chest reconstruction (to be able to perform a MV repair) I adopted some real bad habits during recovery that kind of built up over the years.  PTs been great to help figure out what is scar tissue getting aggravated (and ok to push through) vs. \"bad sensation\".\n\nI know my PT did their homework, but I like to verify lol.  Anything you adopt as habit ads up.\n\nAsk your PT about the elliptical but I liked it!  Because it is continuous you do not have the \"shock load\" that running can have.  You can also set your own pace as well. Best case you do not have to change anything it might not be great for you but if you love doing it it could be worth continueing, worst case you have to change from cross country running to just jogging but really the whole spectrum in between could be a possibility depending on how your echo goes and how your joints hold up but hard to say until they figure out where your at.", "tall and skinny, weird deformities So i am really, really, worried i might have this or atleast a variation of this.

My feet are actually small for my size, and i have high arches, so that is a good sign right? I am currently 180lbs, (down from 210lbs) i used to be a gym rat, working out 4-5 times a week, eating tons of food and giving it my all, but i really started getting extreme fatigue after workouts, i would get, breathlessness, confusion, anxiety, and a whole giant list of symptoms, i thought i might be having heart trouble or maybe a respiratory issue, i have been tested for everything, from diabetes, to asthma, and so on.. I got EKG's which came out normal which was a big relief, but i still feel something is wrong. I was going to get a chest Xray, but the insurance never pulled through with authorization on that, i just never followed up.. Heart problems do not run in my family, but i am worried i might have a heart problem so i stopped working out all together. My doctor basically thinks i am crazy and does not take me serious. I lost so much weight as soon as i stopped working out and eating big.  \n\nI honestly have always felt just something \"off\" about my body, it is just so abnormal and different. I was reading up on a lot of the symptoms of marfans and i have basically almost all of them.

I have a high palate, crowded teeth, and an overbite, but i think that is from sucking my thumb all the way until a few years into grade school. I also mouth breathed a lot in childhood, which definitely has an effect on your face. I am extremely flexible in my hips, legs, and back. I used to wrestle and highschool and my coach would always remark how abnormally flexible i am. Like i was able to get out of holds in ways that were just strange... i have extremely long legs and arms, my pelvis is out of alignment. Yet my spine is straight, i do not have scoliosis. I showed this to my doctor and he just said \"hm, that is weird.\" he also wanted to xray that, but it never happened. I also have always had pointed/crumpled looking ears. I have had them since i was a kid, and it honestly makes me definitely feel like i have a \"syndrome\" I was reading up on Beal's syndrome, which is a variation of Marfan's and my stomach SANK when i saw \"crumbled ears\" as a symptom. My niece who was just born a couple months ago has the EXACT SAME crumbled looking ears as me. Like exactly the same on both sides, leading me to believe it is some weird genetic thing i have, not just a fluke.. ", "My experiences with heart surgery. Hello.  I am currently recovering from my sec ond surgery on my heart.  This time I had my aorta valve replaced.  My previous surgery was to repair an aortic root aneurism.  I thought I would share my experience with the surgery, and the recovery to help any of you who have yet to go through the procedure understand what happens during the process.  \n\nPreparing for the surgery\n\nFirst if you can, and your Doctor gives you the go ahead.  Try to be in the best shape you can before you have the procedure done.  I was not in the best physical shape before my first surgery, and the following recovery was much harder on me.  I was very weak, and it took me longer to build my strength back to normal.  I had a few months to prepare before this surgery, and I used that time to build my my heart strength by doing a lot of walking.  Nothing strenuous. Just 30 to 40 minuets of walking a day really helped me out.  I am farther along in my recovery compared to last time because my heart was stronger and more able to bounce back from being cut on.  \n\nThe surgery, and your hospital stay.\n\nThis part is the most harrowing, but you will be O.K.  When you first wake up after the surgery you will be in the ICU, and you will be hooked up to a lot of machines that are keeping you alive.  You might be hooked up to a breathing tube when you regain conscious you might not.  If you are still hooked up to a breathing tube it is not that bad and you will be under the influence of so much pain medication that you will not care.  You will also have a catheter inserted and many different I V's inserted in various areas of your body. You will also have two drainage tubes inserted in your chest, and wires inserted in your chest that are attached to a temporary pace maker. It is an odd feeling having machines do all the work of keeping you alive.  It is the ultimate experience of laziness.  You do not have to do anything. Machines do it all. Once the ICU team decides you can breathe on you own. They will remove the breathing tube.  This is not as bad as it sounds and is over quickly.  You will then be breathing pure O2 for awhile. Some things I experienced that i feel are worth noting.  I was very thirsty during this time.  I could not get enough water,  They had to restrict my water intake because I was drinking so much. Also I had some bad experience with nausea.  I do not know if your experience will be the same as mine, but I thought it worth mentioning.  Once you have been breathing on your own for awhile you will be discharged from the ICU and placed into the cardiac recovery ward.  You will be in some pain.  The pain is odd.  You would expect that the pain would be in the area where they cut you open, but I felt the most pain in my shoulders and back.  They will keep you well medicated, and trust me it helps.  They also encourage you to let thr before it gets bad than it is to help a person who is suffering from a high level of pain.  As the week goes on the nurses will slowly remove the various tubes and wires attached to you, and your body will slowly return to normal.  It takes time for your body, for lack of a better term, reboot.  They will remove the catheter and you will have trouble moving your bladder at first, but keep trying it the waters will flow, you will bowels will take some time to get moving as well.  The pain meds they have you on slows down the process. Do not be shy if you need something to help the process along. You will be encouraged to walk around and you will have a physical therapy nurse to help you along.  Near the end of your hospital stay they will remove the drainage tubes from your chest, and the wires that where connected to the temporary pacemaker.  They will then observe you to see if any compilations arose from the tube removal, or if you picked up any infections during the hospital stay.  They will also keep an eye on you to see if any blood clots have developed.  If everything went well you will be discharged from the hospital and return home.  \n\nRecovery at home.\n\nThey will discharge you with a bunch of meds. to take over the next ten days, and you will still be in a fair bit of pain for about a week or two, but it subsides quickly.  You will also feel weak.  You will sleep alot and your sleep pattern will be very erratic for the next few weeks. You will slowly return to normal as time goes on.  You will not be able to drive a car for a mo th as your breast bone heals, so have someone lined up to help you with you day to day tasks and do some food shopping for you.  Get some rest and work on building up your stamina back up, but do not overwork yourself.  Keep it slow and steady and you will be back to normal in no time.\n\nI hope this helps somebody who has questions about valve replacement/aneurism repair surgery.  I am sorry if the formatting is off.  I am typing this on my phone. Once I get back home. I will edit this into an easier to read format. ", "Bracers. Hello. Have you ever had bracers to change your teeth and chin? I am planning to get it, but I am afraid about my eyes and back because bracers can influence on them (in my opinion). What do you think? I am not asking for medical advice, I need your experience. I am going to ask my doctor later. I had braces twice and the only thing that happened is that I developed Torus mandibularis which is some harmless bony growths under the tongue. I have sight and back problems but they are not related to the braces, so do not worry about that. Braces didnt cause any problems for me but if your teeth are very crowded like mine were you may need surgery to get some removed, something to keep in mind Get braces. I had a really bad over bite, now my teeth are straight and I am confident about it. Braces do not affect your eyes, back, or anything else. What happened with you chin after getting your bracers done? In the 1970s (USA) - dentist recommended removing two teeth in the front lower jaw (eye teeth maybe?) - I cannot go look right now.  This was my spouse and the reasoning was to relieve over-crowding.  The result was a flatter front jaw, no more over-crowding.  Problem solved.  He was told that they would not have recommended it for a female patient due to the more squared looking jaw.  \n\nDaughter had braces, no removal of teeth other than wisdom teeth.  No complications. How exactly can braces affect your eyes?? Or your back?? I am so confused I just asked. Any powers to your body can effect your retina. It is just a suggestion, I did not ask my ophthalmologist yet. \nAnyway, I asked for experience. It is better to know others' stories. Nothing I have had braces and everything turned out fine. No changes to my back or eyes, my ophthalmologist had no concerns about it affecting my eyes (very high risk for retinal detachment normally) and my rheumatologist had no issues with it either. Why would it be a concern? I had a significant overbite (i.e., I could bite my palate) as a child. I underwent surgery to reduce crowding, and had braces for a few years. It pulled my front teeth approximately 1 cm. I suffered no issues, and have had well functioning teeth since. I had 2lots of braces\n\nThe first set moved my bottom jaw forwards allowing me to chew properly (I guess this affected my chin slightly by moving my whole bottom jaw forward where it belongs?) And then I had to turn a key to widen the roof of my mouth\n\nI then has my teeth straightened with train track braces\n\nI have never heard of braces affecting the eyes or the back", "Well, its time Just hit 5cm. Doctors seem to be a little gun shy, but I understand. I havent been told my official surgery date yet, but in the last month I had a TEE and an angiogram, so yay for that. I am 42, I was diagnosed at 24ish while i was still active duty (kicked out medically in 04) and we have just monitored it. I am not horribly tall (6'3\") and not horribly skinny (old fat man is up to 210), but I have every other indicator (feet, teeth, chest, aneurysm, etc)\n\nAnyone have any advice about the surgery and the recovery? Anything I should expect? I work in aviation so I am probably up for a career change.. lol. Any advice or insight would be appreciated! 1) My mum had temporary surgery induced psychosis after her surgery. So, first advice, if you think weird stuff try not to panic too much, it is normal. Maybe pre-warn your friends that you are going to be generally grumpy and off for awhile, but if they are good friends it should not matter.\n\n2) Hospital is boring as fuck. I am not sure what would be appropriate but think of things to take with you for when you feel well enough, or have stuff ready that family/friends could bring to you. Also, hospital food (at least where I am from) is crap. My mum was not interested in fancy food, she liked (nice) bland stuff.\n\n3) the hospital can also be a bit grimy in some spots. If you are bothered by that have a friend do a wipe down of your stuff for you. Top tip: if you have a tv next to your bed, they usually do not clean that or the remote. \n\n4) Arrange a smooth ride home. Jolts and heavy turns cause pain.\n\n5) Consider doing a big clean of your house before you go for the surgery.\n\nI cannot think of much else because I was 12ish at the time and I think a bit traumatised from it all, I genuinely cannot remember most of the stuff that I did to help. Good luck On the subject of comfy pjs, my brother had me go buy him a bunch of button up shirts prior to coming home from his emergency valve replacement. He could not lift his arms to put on a pullover shirt until his chest wall healed. \n\nAnd pre-cleaning my house before my last major surgery was a lifesaver, especially since I also dealt with post-op depression. I also bought paper plates/bowls and paper towels, which I normally do not keep in the house, to cut back on chores.  I had my aortic root surgery in November 2017. Male, 29 years old now.\n\n- Luckily, I had no issues with the procedure. I hope yours is smooth too.\n- Recovery was relatively smooth. The #1 thing I can recommend is not push yourself to do anything. Let your body heal, just chill. In your days in the hospital following surgery as well as your few months at home after, just chill. You will start to feel stronger day by day, but listen to your body and do not ever over-exert yourself, if you can avoid it.\n- This will sound contradicting, but make sure you still maintain some activity levels during the day. I started with a few 3-5 minute walks in my first few days back home. Extend those 5 minutes by another minute every other day, or every day if you can. Soon you will be measuring by distance and not time. But it is important to keep your mind motivated to want to walk around, it helped me.\n- You will be laying down a lot resting. Start a new book. Netflix will be your best friend.\n- Talk to your doctors/nurses in the hospital. If you have any questions at all, they will knows answers.\n\nBest of luck, you will be fine! IDK your living situation, but for me having an understanding and helpful roommate was a lifesaver. \nAlso, if you have doors that stick badly do not close them.  I got myself stuck in the bathroom until my roommate got home. Mainly just try to relax and take it easy. \n\nHave a small pillow to hold onto when you cough or sneeze to protect your sternum. They will give you an idea when you should get up and around. Try to walk a bit each day when they say it is okay. Do not push yourself too hard though.\n\nListen to what they say about how you should live after this. Reduce your salt intake and eat healthier. You have the rest of your body to take care of now.  Thank you so much for this post. I am having this surgery in 2 months time. Best of luck, you will be fine! PM me if you have any questions about anything related to the surgery or rehab!", "How many of u do not have any aorta dilation  Touch wood, me!\n\nYearly scans where moved to every 2 years, then every 3!\n\nPlenty of collapsed lungs until I had a pluerectomy though.  &gt; 3!\n\n3! = 6\n\n Do u have long legs and arms, hyper mobility,extreme skin elasticity I fall into this group, a couple collapsed lungs is the most I have had to deal with Lucky I should clarify my aorta is 5.4cm, so it is dilated but has not changed over the past 2 years we have been monitoring it. My entire heart is fairly large, the specialist was not too concerned saying it is almost proportional. If your heart is large then aorta should be large I think that is normal Math jokes are most welcome here. Yep. I do (along with severe dural ectasia) but my little brother does not.

", "22 Weeks Pregnant: Dr.s suspect baby has Marfans. I went for a Fetal Echocardiogram this morning, under the impression baby may have a slight/mild heart defect. After the test and speaking to the cardiologist, he says he has reason to believe that our baby boy has marfans. I had never even heard of this until today. He said it is too late and dangerous in my pregnancy to do an amniocentesis to know a diagnosis for sure. He told me to go home, research it, and decide with my husband (who was not allowed at the appt w me due to covid restrictions)  by the end of the day whether or not we will terminate the pregnancy. The doctor was not overly thorough with his explanation of MS and left me w the impression it was a devastating condition that most people would choose to end their pregnancies over. That is not an option for us. We do not want to do that and will not. However, upon researching some more, i am feeling a little less scared. Would anyone here with MS be willing to share with me their experiences with marfans? I am just a scared first time mama-to-be who has so many questions and is so new to this. Thank you! Hey OP, I have marfans and was diagnosed when i was about 13 years old. Now there are mild to server cases but i do not believe it is a death sentence for a possibility. Many millions of people are living with heart conditions just fine.\n\nAs well look at it as a dice roll if you will. While there are 30 or so different conditions that come from this like scoliosis,  or a heart murmur,  or skeleton fingers. These alone are standalone conditions that are easily lived with.\n\nIf you have any direct questions i will gladly answer them. As for terminating over marfans i would say no, even though there are other medical conditions that i would say maybe better for the family to terminate during. Marfans exists on a spectrum.  It can be incredibly dangerous,  or it can be relatively mild. Your son might have all the signs,  or only a handful.  \n\nIt runs in my family.  I know of 8 in the past 3 generations.  Mostly ours is mild.  Our most prominent symptom being the dislocated lenses,  and with modern surgery even that is not much of a hindrance.  \n\nI cannot say he will be fine,  I cannot know that.  I can say that for every child I have (one so far) it will be a  coin flip as to whether they get it.  *And that does not worry me.* Even if my next child has a severe case,  they can still lead a life full of love,  friendship, art, and intellectual endeavour. \n\nI hope your son does not have Marfans.  If he does,  I hope it is mild.  If it is not, I trust that he has loving parents who will show him that his physical limitations need not limit his ambition.  \n\nBest of luck. It is certainly made life more challenging but never to the point I wish I had not been born.  The physical limitations and self esteem issues that come with it certainly impacted me and contributed to some depression as a teenager but coming out of that now I have a pretty much normal life.  I am not miserable because of Marfan\u2019s and as disorders go it is not too bad.  The main health risk is the aortic dissection but to my knowledge it is not a huge risk if the proper precautions are taken.  I took blood pressure medicine for a while just as a precaution and was not allowed to play rough sports (football, basketball, etc).  The main expense for my family was I had the pectus surgery (hole in the chest) in high school which was an expensive surgery, and that may be something you as a parent would have to anticipate in the future.  Other than that I have been able to have a normal life and your kid will probably too.  If you have got any questions I can answer as best I can. Thank you so much for your response! I was so taken aback by the doctor asking me on the spot just 30 seconds after telling me baby MIGHT have marfans, if i would like to terminate (also my husband was not even there with me). It was so shocking.\n\nI am happy to hear this is a livable condition and it feels good to hear some honest and real feedback from someone who lives with it, rather than a doctor who was so wishy-washy with the topic and barely answered any of my questions. I left that appointment knowing essentially nothing about Marfans, only that he thought it was a terrible thing for a baby to have. \n\nI really appreciate your response I am sorry that you have such stress in your pregnancy. First pregnancies are the hardest. You just do not know what is going on with your body and the responsibility can be overwhelming. \n\nMy youngest son is Marfan. We found out about a year ago when the doctors called and said he had a heart attack. Before that he was just a normal 20 year old. Yes he is tall and skinny but I am tall and skinny so I did not think anything about it. \n\nWith that said I wish I knew when I was pregnant or at least when he was little so I could have cared for him better. We all think our children are perfect and when they are diagnosed as having something less than perfect it bursts something inside or us. It is not easy but as soon as you accept it, educate yourself on it and understand that your baby is still perfect for you you can rest easier. Being a mother is never easy but you have leaned so much and you have so much time to learn about this and to learn how to support your child. The thing is that no one is as perfect as a mother thinks they are and most mothers do not have the understanding of how their child needs their support. You have this and your baby will be just fine. \n\nI really wish I had known when my son was in my womb. Right now he is in denial and will not do anything for himself and he is an adult. I do not have any say over him. \n\nAnyway try not to worry too much about this. Learn as much as you can and give yourself full permission to love, be excited and dream about your baby\u2019s future. Nothing has changed except you now have more information to be a better mommy than you did before. Hugs and prayers for you and your family.  PS my son was 9# 11 oz at birth and 27\u201d long. He was a big strapping boy. Try not to fear. While there can be server cases a shitty dice roll lets say. For a person to even be categorized as being a marfans patient they have to show something like 8 different conditions. Now my information could be off as it has been a long time since i talked to a specialist on it. But having a possible heart condition just aimply means your baby would have a heart condition. \n\nSo while there are like 30 possible things to have to be considered marfans. Your baby could have one of those and at that point just be a baby with a minor heart condition. \n\nNow there is genetic testing that can show a marfans patient but for like me. I have 15-20 vision which is way better than my wifes 25-20 but according to your doctor i should have been termd over a minor thing.\n\nAgain if you have any questions please ask and do some research but i dont believe having a heart condition is a death sentence. This cardiologist was the worst. I was devasted at his suggestion to terminate, and the minute i got home and did some proper research (he was useless and barely explained it to me at all despite me digging for answers) i realized that it is NOT an option for us to terminate. I do not believe this is a death sentence either, but I was definitely questioning what our babies quality of life would be. \n\nAt this point in time, the only thing the doctors are seeing that make them suspect baby may have marfans is the heart issue; they never told me baby would likely need to show a few more symptoms to be classified as having marfans. I think i need new doctors haha. He made it sound like this condition was life ruining which after spending the night researching, i am learning that is widely not the case. \n\nthank you so much for your response No probem. So for me growing up my entire family was tall my mom is 6 even my dad is an inch shorter. My oldest brother and me traded off who was taller but since finishing growing up im 6 7, oldest bro is 6 5 older bro is 6 3 and little brother is 6 2.\n\nI rode bmx bikes and had dirty bikes, when i was officially diagnosed we got a chest protector and i just made sure i did not get into fights. \n\nMy joints hurt but some of that is on me from carrying 200 pound football players on my back and jumping my bikes off some huge ass ramps. It seems we are usually tall and skinny for most out lifes i did not break 100lbs til 10 grade. I was called anorexic dven though i would eat dinner at a friends house in the summer to go home an hour later and eat another full plate of food.\n\nA genetics test would be your best bet once born. Jst think of having a stay at home gamer or builder over a dangerous football player. As well while growing up take them in for a EKG every year or two to check the size of their aorta. \n\nBut i am married, finishing my bachelor's degree in like 8 weeks. Where are you located?  This will help me figure out how best to find you help.\n\nAll right, here is what I know from experience.  If the doctor sees something and has that much confidence in a diagnosis of Marfan, your child would then fit the criteria for neonatal Marfan syndrome.  This has an average life expectancy of 2 years.  That is not saying that all cases will die by then, only that most will.  I survived (was diagnosed at birth.)  My son did not (diagnosed shortly after birth.)  I am still alive at 38, though I have quite a few health problems.  As Marfan has variable expressivity, you can have everything from mild to death sentence, and often you do not get warning if it is going to kill you.\n\nI cannot make the decision for you.  But if I had it to do over again I would have agreed with the doctors about terminating his pregnancy after seeing all he went through before he passed.  I do not get to dictate anyone's morals.  I just know I wish I had made a different decision. What were his reasons? How far along were you? I cannot see how they would be able to determine that without a genetic test. There are tons of things that could cause a congenital heart defect. The doctor sounds a bit nuts to be honest unless he can lay out the details with you and they are credible to someone who normally diagnoses Marfan - like a geneticist. You should consider reporting the doctor's behavior to their supervisors. That is really, really awful, to tell you in that way, not give you any more info, and casually mention that you have to decide whether to terminate by the end of the day! You absolutely need another doctor! Actually, what you should get is a second opinion based on the report from the scan, or whatever. That ridiculous doctor sounds like he thought it was marfan - but he also sounds super uninformed. If there is something there that is worrying, you want to understand what it is, and what are the possible things it could mean. Even if you do not want to terminate regardless - you would want to be prepared (which that awful doc was not helping you with!). Ask your OB for a referral for a second opinion - and make sure your OB knows what this first doc did.\n\nBest wishes to you and your growing family, mama! You got this - whatever \"it\" is! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f I am a pediatric genetic counselor who specializes in connective tissue disorders like Marfan syndrome and stories like this make me wish wholeheartedly that everyone seeking prenatal care had access to a genetic counselor. It sounds like you were given very little information with which the doctor asked you to make a very big decision, which is disheartening and I am sorry they did not do a better job of giving you the detailed information you deserve. I do not have Marfan syndrome myself but I am very familiar with it and would be happy to answer questions about Marfan syndrome for you from a medical provider\u2019s perspective. But to be honest, I think it would be most ideal to get you in touch with a prenatal genetic counselor who could sit down with you in person (or via a telemedicine visit given all the changes during COVID-19) and spend adequate time with you to address ALL of your questions and concerns. That is the whole purpose of our job as genetic counselors! And there is A LOT to discuss in these types of scenarios. If talking to a GC sounds like something that might be helpful for you, you could start by asking the doctor if they have a genetic counselor they could refer you to. Or, if you would not mind sharing with me what city you live in, I could try to help you find one nearby. \n\nAlso, depending on what was identified on the fetal echo (I imagine it was aortic dilation and/or mitral valve abnormalities), there are a number of connective tissue disorders related to Marfan syndrome that it could also be. And there is no way to confirm any connective tissue disorder (if it truly is one) without genetic testing. I agree with the other commenters that Marfan syndrome is certainly not something that is lethal in infancy or childhood (except in extremely rare cases that are very severe), but it can come with a number of medical concerns that are important to follow closely over one\u2019s lifetime. So even if you do not want to see a genetic counselor or geneticist now, I would highly recommend having a genetics evaluation once the baby is born to confirm or rule out the diagnosis and refer him to the right specialists if need be! Diagnosing a connective tissue disorder earlier in life can have very impactful benefits. \n\nIf reading more information online might help quell your concerns, I would highly recommend the Marfan Foundation\u2019s website for reliable information about Marfan syndrome - they have tons of great information for families online.\n\nI apologize - I feel like I am spouting off with a ton random information here, but if you would like help finding a GC to talk to, I am happy to do my best to help you find one! I am a 42 year old male with Marfans, outside of taking medication daily (beta blockers), poor eyesight (remedied with glasses / contacts), and some back issues from scoliosis I am an otherwise healthy and active 42 year old with a wife and two kids. I even run regularly (with my Dr\u2019s blessing) and was training for a marathon (again with my Dr\u2019s blessing) before things started to get locked down due to the pandemic. There are various degrees of Marfan Syndrome and I am fortunate to have a mild case relatively speaking but with treatment and monitoring people afflicted live a relatively normal life. your cardio sounds like an ass.\n\nI am going to completely side step the termination issue.  There is a lot of reasons for one to have on either side, but you are correct.  Marfans is not something like Tay-Sachs, which is always fatal and incredibly painful.  Marf may suck sometimes, but I like to think I have done some cool damn things in my life.\n\nThe thing about Marf as you read conditions, many of the corrective options have a very high success rate.  Aortic ruptures sound terrifying (and are) but that is why we get monitored.  Heart surgery is no picnic but the numbers are amazing.  As /u/rafri noted below, dudes joints hurt from lifting stuff a doc would say he is not supposed to.  We all cheat.  We all hurt a bit as we get older but we are all pretty normal.\n\nFor me the hardest part (and the part I think about when becoming a parent) is more associated with managing a chronic health condition.  It can be financially draining, if you are in the US you will have to meet with the school to set up an IEP (and different schools will do a better job support your vs. their interests in that).  Picking doctors (as you learned they are not all perfect).  All of us on this thread struggled with body image issues when we were younger.  But if you look around you will find here who write/act, biochemists, office workers, hell there was a dude on here who sold fireworks... you know: normal people.  Dating in your teens kind of sucks but it starts to even out when you get to college.  Both you and your child will have a bit of baggage, but there are upsides to that.  I own my own business in a highly technical field.  I am not sure I would be as stubborn or resilient if I had not had people telling me my limitations and learning they were wrong since such a young age.\n\nI do not want to paint to rosy a picture (or minimize anyone else struggle who may be reading this).  It is all on a spectrum.  And post surgery my chest can hurt often, I have to lie a certain way in bed which makes it difficult to share, but I DO still share it and I have an excuse for both hogging the bed AND getting a snowblower because I am not supposed to shovel.  I call that a win/win/win.\n\nAnd for the record, it was recommended my Mom terminate as well. total non-sequitur, and not OP, but did you keep at riding?  I have a dual-sport now and I swear being a light guy on a dirtbike at young age gave me really good riding habits; you cannot muscle your way out, you have to learn to ride the bike. I do not have it but my spouse, child, and several inlaws do.  No eye problems but heart problems and dislocations of the patella are the major issues my loved ones deal with.  Before having children, every one of these people debated having children at all due to the likelihood of passing it on.  Everyone had a normal childhood, participated in sports (moderate), etc.  The oldest is in their 90s now, so I would say lifespan is not effected here.  More caution about risks and a good relationship with medical professionals who know about Marfan and life is pretty good. No, we grew out of them as time went on. My family has hereditary Marfans, even the worse case doesnt make life unbearable. I was diagnosed in the womb with a heart murmur caused by a hole in my heart and genetically tested soon after birth to confirm. My the hole closed up by the time I was 6. I went to the doctor more often and was more aware of my body than most kids but I had a good childhood. Yes there were unique situations that most kids would not have but you will be able to handle them. My best advice is as your boy grows, listen to him about his body and get a doctor that understands the condition and listens to you. Hello u/pemlakhek I am a 46 year old lady with Marfan's. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI fully believe in a lady's right to choose. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBack in 1973 medicine was of course different. I was literally born with extra long fingers and such. Have the wacky looking photo to prove it. Do not care. I have my younger brothers newborn photos too, mine is obviously unique looking. LOL. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy eye sight has been a hot mess since ever and always. I have not yet had a retinal detachment but did have the lens in my right eye play out one time. It looked like a contact lens that got messed up. So, I am mindful of my right eye. The signs of a retinal detachment are really obvious and later on down the line you and your husband might have to gently speak with your child about it, like when they are maybe in Elementary School or what have you. I just assume that the more the youngster comes into their own with reading and writing, the more you all have to be mindful of their eyesight, but I am obviously not a doctor of any sort. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was formally diagnosed when I was right at 12 years of age. I was all super duper long on all fronts, right? Had 32 inch long legs. Fingers as long as that of a pianist. Armspan of a young Michael Phelps.  Just all that. Went to a little clinic to get a quick physical for some sports team and the doctor just called things as they saw fit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy endurance level is leaving me the older I get. That is alright, though. I am pushing 50 after all. I was going to mention neonatal Marfan Syndrome also. My son was diagnosed at 12 so his is on the less \"extreme\" end but I have heard neonatal Marfans can be rough. Sorry you are dealing with this and the cardiologist sounds like an ass. Marfan syndrome as many of us have it is not worth terminating over, but neonatal marfan syndrome is considered the most severe and is known for... not having the best outcomes even today.\n\nI could not be certain what your doctor is saying your baby could have, but good luck. You seem to have gotten a lot of good replies already, but if you have any specific questions I would be happy to help. I (38m) was born with Marfan\u2019s and diagnosed when I was just 2, after it killed my father, he was just 25 at the time. That led to some issues growing up - for starters, I did not think I would live as long as I have and I was not allowed to play sports.  \n\nNow, thankfully, the surgeries that may become necessary for Marfan\u2019s patients have very low mortality rates. It was much worse back in the 80-90\u2019s than it is today.  I had surgery in 2014 and recovered nicely, with the aneurysm repaired, I should have a normal life expectancy. \n\nI never wanted kids, but then I met my wife, and had one anyway. My fear of passing it on came true and my daughter was born with Marfan\u2019s, she is 9 years old now, tall, skinny, exceptionally smart, and quite healthy. So it is not as big of a deal as it used to be. It does require annual cardiologist appointments and that is expensive but we plan for it. \n\nDM me if there is anything you want to ask. I am so sorry he scared you like that. The reality is however that a lot of doctors still are not that familiar with it and may not fully understand how manageable it is. Your child will likely need regular check-ups and glasses, but the degree of how severe it is varies. It is good that you are informing yourself, however, so that you are ready when you note certain things like for example spontaneous pneumothorax (which I had twice at 15) and can stay calm about it. \n\nOne thing that I would recommend though is definitely try to engage your child in activities outside of team sports. I did not have a full diagnosis until I was about 13 and had always loved playing sports so learning about it then and being told I could no longer play was devastating for me. I essentially went through a grieving process at the realization that I could not do what I always loved. That can be hard for children who will see many of their friends doing things he/she cannot. At the same time though, we are not entirely fragile. A little cardio within limits is still good. Just make sure your child is aware of their limitations and be there for them emotionally as they navigate their understanding of what this means for them. \n\nAlso life expectancy for Marfan\u2019s is about 70 right now and as the years progress there will be newer medical advancements that should make it easier to treat. That is actually wild. Get a new Doctor, if that is the kind of on the spot treatment plans he offers. I am serious. \n\nI have Marfans (3rd gen) and am pregnant, and given that my baby has it, termination would never cross my mind. I mean, it is a pain in the ass, but since I have been monitored all my life it is far from debilitating. So I was more likely to get scoliosis or a dissection or have a Congenital heart defect? *Boohoo. * I was exposed to the best specialists in the East Coast *with Medicaid* and decided *I* wanted to be a doctor myself. I graduated HS 3 years early bc instead of participating in gym class I volunteered in my school library, and got ahead. I would not get rid of my disorder given the opportunity.\n\nAnd btw: without a history of MS, spontaneous generation is incredibly rare. Your doctor is incompetent. Get a new doctor.\n\nEdit: I did forget to mention that I do acknowledge that some cases are worse than others, but I still would not consider it a death sentence, even if it was a definite diagnosis. I am so sorry you went through that.. I do not really understand how he was able to determine the baby has marfan from an echo.. do you or your husband have it? I spoke with a high risk pregnancy clinic (forget if that is what it was actually called) both doctors told me marfan could only be detected in a fetus by cvs and that it would be highly unlikely for even any heart issues to be detected as they develop as the baby grows.. I have always been told with marfan they would let me decide if I want to do the cvs and decide whether to continue from there.. \n\nAs someone else said every case is different, at least in my own family our symptoms have been the same through generations the real difference being medical advancements and simply knowing about it / being able to monitor and be proactive if possible. Im completely pro choice, but could not fathom a doctor or expecting mother to want to abort a baby with Marfans. My 10 year old Daughter has marfans and is a very normal smart ass little girl, the absolute love of my life and your child will be too. Yes you have to watch out for a few things, but those moments are so few and far between in   life compared to all the great times you will share... I am so sorry you had to go through that, that is awful. I am 16 with Marfans and although I have been through a lot it is more than a liveable condition and I have a good quality of life. As long as you get the services you need to monitor stuff like that the heart, and if your kid needs supports in his shoes, things will be ok! For me as I have grown older and learnt about my condition I can manage it, I take one small medication a day for my heart and on a day to day basis that is all that I have to do! The hardest thing to deal with for me day to day is the hypermobility and fatigue I sometimes get. The hypermobility means I get strained joints very easily, and I often injure myself, however most do not last for more than a few days, and I have now learnt to take care of them and treat them to the point it is just a bit of an inconvenience! The fatigue is annoying, I cannot do massive hikes, but I can go on a countryside walk and thoroughly enjoy myself! My Marfans is definitely not mild, I have severely flat feet, a heart defect that will require surgery at some point, have already had back surgery. But learning to manage it and having good services means I am not even nervous about having heart surgery. I do not think my Marfans will hold me back! I hope the pregnancy goes well!", "Went swimming without covering my pectus in any way whatsoever for the first time ever and it felt so good! I (f20) have always felt insecure about my chest deformation and having very small breasts. Always having a hard time finding the right swimsuit/bikini style for it to be almost impossible for people to notice. I mostly failed at it so I ended up just not going swimming. \n\nDuring quarantine, though, I had a lot of time to think about my body and about the things I can change and not about it. I felt like I was already missing out on many things I would love to do because of my Marfans. So why not try to go and start something I was always recommended to do but never did out of fear?\n\nI am still trying to embrace and accept my body as it is. It is tough, but I am trying to accept the fact that a radical change would be only possible if I was born again...\n\nSo I went and bought myself some training swimsuit. Kind Of tight, but that is okay. People stared at me as soon as I stepped out the dressing rooms, so what? They always do anyway. \n\nAnd that is it, friends. I had a wonderful time enjoying myself without any limitations. Swimming comfortably just like everyone else.\n\nI share this only cause I hope it might encourage someone to do something without feeling ashamed of their bodies. It takes time, I know. But it is possible and you can do it too if work on it. \n\nWish you all a good night/day! Dude this is awesome. I am so happy for you. I know it seems like such a little thing but this is huge. As a guy who grew up swimming in shirts I felt like I stuck out no matter what. I am in my 40s now, which is the ripe old age of no longer giving a shit and now I finally swim without a shirt. So I can happily report that it gets easier as you get older. Keep on owning your body, dude. And thanks for bringing that confidence to the community. Wow! I wish I had that kind of confidence when I was 20! You are amazing!

Is it too risky? Or should he be okay if he takes it easy?", "found out i have marfans. feeling kind of lost when i was 16, i was tested to rule out marfans syndrome after my cardiologist had concerns about my elongated and slightly enlarged aorta. during the exam, the nurse said i have a low probability of marfans, due to lack of it in family history. my legs and arms are longer than they \"should\" be, but i played it off as family genetics (i am on the shorter marfans side, 5'11.) they still proceeded with the tests and i never heard anything from them again and the cardiologist never mentioned it during yearly checkups.\n\nwell. fast forward 7 years. last week i found out that actually, the tests came back positive. got to love the old good nhs, forgetting to inform me about it.\ni went to see a new gp over something minor, he wanted to prescribe me meds so he looked into my file after asking me for illnesses, and asked why i didnt mention having marfans. i sat there like \"?? i do??\" and then the doc proceeded to show me the file where it clearly stated that i am in fact positive. \nit took me a few days to settle with this knowledge and i finally mentioned it to my best friend, who also, coincidentally, has marfans. \n\ni know it is not the end of the world, that it probably wont change anything (in fact, it makes sense why my cardiologist always requests additional testing, i never really questioned it though) since my heart issues are monitored already, but it feels very... different. especially considering how little resources there are about it, its kind of scary. and lonely.\n\nas i was wiritng this, i had an update: it turns out my father probably has marfans too, he is 6'8 with both relatively short parents, but soviet union healthcare didnt even question this lol. Welcome to the club. \n\nAll I can say is that if you have gone all this time without any issues, you are probably okay. Be happy the NHS, even with all its deficiencies, is there for you, in the US you would be starting a GoFundMe account just to get your yearly check-ups. thank you!\n\nand i am happy, despite this whole situation, that i get all of it for free. i am really lucky and greatful, even if i worded it a bit bitterly, because i cannot fathom the struggles of those without free healthcare. It did not sound bitter, no worries. I am having to get tested soon. \nBut you are very lucky that you found out about it when you did. \nMy little brother passed away from what we believe to be Marfans. It was sudden and a huge shock.

After getting diagnosed in my young adulthood I was shocked but at the same time relieved. I have been trying to find ways to cope, since I cannot gain that much weight. I tried working out in the past but it was not a common thing, I only did it here and there, I think working out would be bad anyways due to the sensitivity of the aorta, plus, I am not into working out hardcore anyways, I never really was, but I tried it out in the past on very rare occasions. I am mostly into cardio. Also, I was always effeminate as a male, so I am not into getting muscles anyways. I learned that is not important, eating healthy and eating enough is important, even though I cannot gain that much, so, what I do is, I try to cover up my body with long sleeve shirts, even in the summer. Also, because I am effeminate, I crossdress, in fact, it is the #1 reason WHY I crossdress, because society teaches you a man is not suppose to be skinny and frail.\n\nSo I reject my gender role as a male or at least, as a masculine male.\n\nI think society forces men to be a certain way and if YOU want to follow that role, go ahead, but I just do not BELIEVE \\*I\\* have to, but at the same time, I still try to be healthy with food. Again, I only care about food, NOT toughness.\n\nAlso I have made a few songs about Marfan Syndrome and issues relating to it, such as the aorta.\n\nI have been having heart complications in my young adulthood, however, no aortic dissection or rupture yet, just, other stuff like irregular heartbeats and palpitations.\n\nMy body made me not want to gain muscle, however, I WANT to get more meat on my bones if that makes sense?\n\nLike, being muscle-less made me HATE the idea of getting buff, however, I am not CAUSING my body to be like this, I just want more fat on me, not muscle.  \nI am 108 pounds, and my dream goal is 150.\n\nI eat 3 to 4 meals a day, sometimes I eat 3 to 4 MEATS a day.\n\nSo, a quick recap: \n\n \u2022 I wear multiple layers of clothing to cover my body.  \n \u2022 I crossdress to cope with my weight. (I only crossdress at home and take photos online, kind of like an E-fashion model.)\n\n \u2022 I have made music relating to Marfan Syndrome and issues relating to it.\n\nNow I want to know, what do YOU guys do to cope?\n\nIs it similar?\n\nOr different?\n\nMaybe I could try out your coping mechanisms, or you could try out mine.\n\nTake care.  \n Hey I am glad you are finding ways to feel better within your skin. I am a woman but I was able to gain weight on the atkin\u2019s diet. I ate high fat/high protein-low carb diet. I ate 7-8 times a day. I played basketball so I had good muscle tone. Luckily I do not have heart problem.  Also like to add I spend a lot of time sitting around so you would THINK I would gain weight eating a lot and sitting around but I can only gain so little. Try eating every two hours something. I struggled with being too skinny too but I found I could keep weight on by eating more often. I played college ball so I burned about 5000 calories a day too. When I started Adkins I was 6\u2019 and weighed 129. I was able to get to 145. Now I am 50 and have problems losing weight. Life is weird.  Maybe eat 5 times a day and continue to drink that 1,000 calorie drink more than once a week, and continue to sit around while still getting some exercise. I was diagnosed at 5 and also feel the irregularities and palpitations. I am 6 foot 8 and I weigh 200. Pretty skinny but only recently have I been putting on weight. Used to skate alot bc I did not have transportation and only did 2 years of physical fitness in school which was in high school when I was skating. I was very sensitive about my indent in my chest and would wear jackets. But then I came to realization that if people were gunna say something they knew deep down they would be ignorant bc i do have a condition. Not that id guilt them or even bring it up but it was part of me. I only started feeling better In highschool bc alot of things came into sync. In pe I tried my hardest , which was not probably good , but I did so well. I finished first for many mile tests and many sports we played. A small achievement in retrospect but for me to succeed w a condition nobody knew about made me feel amazing. However I am somewhat charismatic so I never really was picked on, also considering my height over everyone and growing up in my town. I only ever lacked muscle similar to you. I am 21 now actually today coincidentally and I picked up a security job and quitt now I deliver pizza. Both were not physically demanding so I just recently starting going to the gym to stay In shape. I believe I am gaining weight bc I do not do anything physical and I believe that is worse than doing physical things health and aorta wise. Of course not pushing myself for obvious reasons. But to sum it up. Everyone has something wrong if you really look at it. Like even tom cruise has a middle tooth. Life is about experiencing every bit. If I were born not even 100 years ago I probably wouldve been dead considering medical understanding. The gift of not only being alive but to understand myself and be thankful of the circumstances available that allow me to experiment life to what I feel is pretty much its fullest extent. I am glad you find ways to cope. I feel after overcoming that, you are able to overcomb any time of pain. For me I felt like I was in the rawest sense a fuck up like down to my genetics. And I feel the lesson is to understand that this IS the lesson if that makes sense. I wish you well Believe it or not, people online either, do not comment on my weight or if they do, it is compliments, mostly from males, lol, but I do not mind. I seem to be VERY attractive to people. I also seem to have soft youthful skin despite being 24. I do not look like a 24 year old male at all. I once met someone with klinefelters who looked like me, but again, they were not marfan's, they were klinefelters. I find that interesting, how we were both youthful looking, smooth skin, yet, we had different conditions. I think my condition messed with my mind, I kind of, uhhh, accepted my self, and fetishized it in a way (non sexually), as in, uhh, I just use my body for show, mostly online, like again, I post photos of myself online, I do not mind doing it online, but not really in real life. Someone said I would be perfect for a Slenderman cosplay, I should cosplay as Slenderman, and any tall thin fictional character that is out there. I should (somehow) cosplay as an alien. Lol. I just get on with my life and not think about it too much. Self-medicating with cannabis for the pain helps me get through my days with a smile on my face. Is that cannabis prescribed or is it recreational?", "Gene results, Fbn1 mutation of uncertain significance? Also when you have a genetic test for Marfans do they also check for loeys-dietz and Taad because of the similarities or do you have to take a genetic test separately I thought genetic testing would allow a diagnosis to finally be made \nBut apparently uncertain significance  means it can be found in people with marfan syndrome and alo the general population \n\nThis does not sit well with me because I get really bad chest pain \nThere is a mitral valve prolapse , but my aorta is within normal limits \n\nI can do all the hand signs,stretch marks in the lower area of my back, deep eye set, high arched palate,  flat feet , crowded teeth\n\nBut I am still undiagnosed \nAnd have not been given any medication to help with the pain \n\nI just do not understand", "Aorta size?? I had an echocardiogram and doc said my aorta was 3.2 cm is that normal for 35 year old male at 6ft4? He said he will make app for mri soon... Said something about upper limits size My understanding is 4.5 is generally the threshold for surgery in Marfan's. I sat at 3.9-4.0 for 10+ years no problem. \n\nJumped to 4.7 between end of 2019 to end of 2020, so just had surgery 2 weeks ago.\n\n33M for reference. Also, even though mine was stable for years, they still did a MRI every couple years to be safe. They are more detailed than an echo. But also more expensive...\n\nAs always, I am not a doctor, and this is not medical advice. lol, i was at 3.2 cm at like, 15. i think that is actually fairly normal. \n\nbut, per the sub rules, that is not medical advice, and i have no idea if that is actually the real average of folks Were you on any medication? Which surgery? How was the recovery? Losartan. I have never felt like it did anything vs atenolol, but dr claims otherwise of course. Post surgery they have added a newer beta blocker in addition to losartan. \n\nAortic root replacement via open heart surgery. Kept my valve. \n\nFirst week was total ass. Heart was fine but everything else gave me trouble, biggest being a collapsed lung and terrible nausea from the anesthesia (24 hours of barfing anything and everything). They hyperextended my neck to intubate me so had extreme neck pain immediately after. Had bad reactions to oxycodone, I would rather be in pain than take that stuff again. There were a bunch more little complications that resolved around day 6 in the hospital. \n\nHave a couple lingering issues but nothing major, all being managed by new prescriptions. Excluding coughing/sneezing/laughing, really do not have much pain. Only painkiller is 2x recommended dose of Aleve, which they want me on for other heart related reasons anyway. Post surgery you cannot drive, lift anything heavier than a gallon of milk, or use your arms to lift yourself, so adjusting to that. Do not have much energy but getting better daily. Taking walks 2x a day every day and trying to go further daily. \n\nOverall, once I got past the complications it has not been as painful or bad as I expected. I figured there would be a lot more pain. Daily activities are more challenging because of limited range of motion, limited energy, and lack of use of arms so as to not damage the incision. But things getting better daily. I do not wish it on anyone but if you have a more complication free surgery, it probably would not be that bad. I got the gist from the surgeon and my cardiologist I had more issues than most people do. Just kind of unlucky I think. They initially told me to expect around 3 days in the hospital but it ended up more like 7. The lung collapse took forever to get back to normal. I believe it is fine. Just take usual precautions if you are a marfolk because I have heard some stories of people who had marfs and did not have a dilated aorta until they started doing heavy exercises like wheight lifting and it spiked. Congrats on getting through all that. What is your z-score? Im at 4.4cm as a 6\u20198 man. Most of the dissection risk charts i see start at the low end at 3.5cm, so I would guess you are on the edge of the normal range. They usually check your size against age height gender and weight. It also depends where they measure it. Not a doctor, not medical advice. Btw why do you say yoi do not think losartan did anything I would it was stable for ten years? I guess there is no way to know if it would have been anyhow without meds Mine was 48 MM age 23 had the surgery 3 days later released week later driving and employed. Because on atenolol I felt like I had a rev limiter (like a car). If I did anything physical my heart would only go so fast or work so hard. After the \"threshold\", that was it, you just got more winded/tired if you tried to keep going. \n\nOn Losartan, I could not tell the difference whether I took it vs days I forgot. It let my heart race and beat hard if I did anything physical. I always felt like it was only a matter of time before something happened since it did not feel like it limited heart rate or intensity at all. \n\nI read somewhere recently there is a huge number of known fbn1 mutations that cause Marfan's, and they can cause variations in things with the disease. I have not talked with my genecist again yet but I am curious if certain mutations take to certain drugs better than others. \n\nUltimately I think it was stable for the first couple years of being on Losartan because I was inactive/sedentary. I started mild cardio and mild strength exercises (like 30lb max) in the fall of 2019 through March 2020 when the gyms closed. I was careful to never do anything that felt strenuous. I read that mutations in different spots on the gene react differently to medicines. Specifically, taking losartan for at least one type of mutation didnt have a noticable effect.\n\nAlso from what I understand losartan is meant to strengthen the aorta wall by a different mechanism to just lowering BP. ie its not the BP lowering that reduces the aorta growth. Im on telmisartan at the moment and I basically didnt notice any change except for feeling nauseous for a few days after starting it. My experience was very similar. Aorta was 3.9 /4.0 my whole life from 19 years onward back in 2003. 2018 hit and suddenly I am swollen to 4.8/4.9 and I have the aorta and chest surgery. I kept my valve. 8 days in the hospital and terrible lingering effects for me. I did not realize they hyperextend your neck but I had horrendously bad neck pain for a long time after surgery. Was so nauseous immediately after surgery because I was allergic to the anesthesia also. Puked so many times after waking up. Highly un-recommended. 0/10 stars. And suffered from dizziness for over a year and a half after surgery. No one knows why but I made it. It sucked but I am alive. So but to answer your question your aorta appears to be in the normal range for everyone. Hope you get the help and treatment you need. Why telmisartan vs losartan? Any studies on it? Umm doc says losartan not available in my area/country, thinks that given it is a similar molecule it should still work. I see &gt;I did not realize they hyperextend your neck but I had horrendously bad neck pain for a long time after surgery\n\nThey told me I was a difficult intubation, and I had spinal joint pain in the neck area, so I assumed it was a case of hyperextension. It felt like if you laid on a table with your head hanging off the end and just left it dangling for a while unsupported. I jumped to conclusions but I do not think I am wrong. \n\nI did the same after anesthesia. Dry heaving with a fresh incision, 0/7 do not recommend. Wet heaving was bad enough. I could not even keep ice chips down. \n\nSorry you had to deal with dizziness. The rest of this crap is hard enough without stuff like that. Geez. I am restricted from driving for a month and on disability from work for at least 6 weeks. Yes that is exactly my same experience. My vertebrae in my neck hurts so bad. Just like when you lay wrong on a massage table or sleep wrong and your neck hurts. It is better now. But I am glad to hear you are strong and a warrior. Keep fighting the good fight brother. Dang how did you get disability I got denied. Dr filled out paperwork and faxed it back to my work's disability claim person. Other than complaining about who signed it initially, they took it no issue. I filed for state disability should I get a doctors form from my lawyer and have them fill it out? I am not familiar with the state disability process. If you have a lawyer that would seem like a good place to start if you made a claim and it got denied. \n\nMy work has a disability program so I just had to follow their process. Last august my aorta root was measured 7.3 cm. I am 64 and probably had this aneurysm for the last 50 years. The limit for surgery is set as 5.5 cm. With your size i would just monitor it. I had surgery once it was established that my aortic root  had dilated to 6cm.

Marfan effects 1 in 5,000 people so unless you and everyone you know are related or have very very very bad luck, no. You are just tall and skinny. Lots of people are just tall and skinny (my father included). However that does not  mean you do not  have it. Google other markers and if you meet enough markers find a doctor who is aware and knows how to treat you accordingly. The most important thing is your heart and I am glad you have an appt. If you you are eventually diagnosed with Marfans, going to the dentist will create it is own obstacles. Just educate yourself and find a good physician. i have flat feet and long arms but i do not think my wingspan is longer than my height. i can barely touch my pinky to my thumb around my wrist i really have to try. also my fingers are pretty fat and are not too skinny. the only markers i have is a slightly caved in chest, tall and skinny, near sightedness in one eye and flat feet. i do not really fit any of the facial features.

Make sure you get your hearts checked regularly \u2665\ufe0f  Glad to see you are doing well! You go girl! I had a dissection a few years back. Definitely one of the worst/craziest things you can go through. Glad you made it. is it like a constant pain? I always feel like I will not know because I always have chest pain Oh honey you will know. It comes out of nowhere. I felt an explosion of fluid in my chest just as I felt like someone physically impaled me. I was making woman in labor noises. \nI have chest pain too but nothing like this. Was yours like a small rip or a big one? That sounds awful, glad you are ok! What did the dissection feel like? Big. It was the thoracic section. Tear was from my chest into my renal artery. Oh damn. Does that mean the inner wall was torn for a while and the blood was separating the other layer all the way down until it broke ? I guess you could not feel the inner layer break? It started as a soreness between my shoulder blades like a slight cramp and then just evolved into the worst pain I think I have ever experienced. It was like my heart was trying to tear it is way from my body in any way it could. I could feel it pounding in my chest, back, throat and head and there was just this insane sense of impending doom as I could not breathe or barely even move through it. In comparison the surgery scar, 500 IV stabs, tube insertions/removals, crippling want to just go home have no comparison lol I just kept making an awful keening noise inbetween trying to tell my boyfriend I was going to be okay as he drove me to the ER. I do not know which one of us I was trying to convince more Yikes that sound terrible. Glad you are good now! How long did the soreness between your shoulder blades last before it evolved into the more severe pain?  It was a full throbbing like I needed to stretch really well and then just it of no where it was just an explosion inside me. Yikes. So did you get your heart or aorta checked previously? Or was this the first sign of trouble for you? Yes, I was genetically diagnosed at birth for Marfans and my aorta was watched very closely as I got older but when I moved out I could not afford insurance/appointments so it fell to the wayside. My aorta while it was being watched never went above a 4.0 thanks for sharing your experience and glad you lived to tell it. I am a bit late, but is there a way of knowing that your aorta is expanding without going to the doctor? I am extremely paranoid about this, I have checkups once every 6 months but I am terrified of doing exercise of any kind as I feel I will just fucking die if I strain even a little. It is extremely frustrating :/ Hi! Unfortunately, my surgery was an emergency and I believe I could have saved myself a lot of trauma/pain if I had been seeing a Dr. more often. There were not any signs that my aorta was getting worse that I can pinpoint and until the tear happened (while I was not even doing something super physical) I thought i was pretty healthy heart-wise.", "Grateful for this sub I came across this place tonight and I feel so weirdly at home right now.

Also I do not have a 100% diagnosis like genetic analysis\n\nI have had a lot of issues with exercise and would love to hear other people's thoughts\n\nI am 21, tall (5'11) and skinny. Like many here I wanted to gain weight. I started going to the gym 3x times a week and eating a caloric surplus \\~3000 while carefully recording.  This is actually a lot of food and much more than many dudes eat.  I managed to go from 135-&gt;150lb in a couple of months at about +1lb/wk. I felt great and felt better about my appearance too.\n\nI never really noticed much change in muscle.  I noticed lots of knee clicking during squats, collarbone slipping during bench press, and back pain while doing curls.  I always tried to be super safe, used proper form and even switched to alternative exercises.\n\nStill things did not work out too well. A few months in, I started getting bad pain near the stomach. This was bad enough to wake me up in the morning and keep me up at night. It turned out I had developed a duodenal ulcer.  I went on triple therapy (very strong medications) to get rid of h.pylori and then for a few months used proton pump inhibitors. Felt terrible the whole time with pain and the meds led to gas and nausea. Nonetheless, I managed to get through exams and classes and do fine.\n\nMy ulcer soon healed and things were looking better.  I think even though its needed for weight gain, eating a lot caused the ulcer. Perhaps there was more acid produced or maybe the sphincter leaving to stomach was weak. This kind of puts my dream of gaining weight  to an end. I lost all the weight I gained over the due to the whole ordeal (back to 130) and wont be bulking again. \n\nA couple months later I started experiencing pain above the stomach. After an endoscopy, it was confirmed that i had now had a hiatal hernia. This is when the connective tissue of the diaphragm weakens and the stomach bulges through.  Now i have some acid reflux pain randomly (minor compared to the ulcer) but need to sleep on 20cm elevated bed and greatly change my lifestyle. Fatty and spicy foods are uncomfortable but I cant eat large portions nor stay hungry as both are painful. I also need to eat dinner 3hrs before sleeping and drink no more liquid after that time. Hernias are not really solvable without surgery and I need to learn to live with these stomach issues.\n\nLife is not terrible, but I definitely get jealous/angry seeing all the muscular dudes out there. But you learn to accept it. I would recommend finding friends who are supportive and having supportive family also helps. For me the worst part of was that my mom would still bring up being skinny on a regular basis and keep telling me that most of my issues are \"non issues\".\n\nThanks in advance for any advice and I would urge everyone to be really safe about exercise. For Marfan patients we need to be really safe about our joints, and try to be extra cautious.  I can only imagine the pain you have gone through. \nThank you so much for sharing your experience. I am 31 now and have had reflux since my early teenage years, due to a hiatus hernia. \nThere are a few things I have found out over the years, which help me most.\n\n1. I try to not eat later than 6 p.m.. this is by far the most important point. It improves my quality of sleep dramatically in addition to not getting heartburn at night.\n\n2. My number 1 heartburn remedy is a green granny Smith apple. This seemed to be counter-intuitive as the Apple is sour. The seem to be something about that texture of the Apple which calms down my stomach. So whenever I feel that I am starting to get heartburn I simply it a small apple and that usually resolves the problem. \n\n3. And I obviously try to avoid all foods that trigger heartburn for me as much as I can. \n\n4. If I get strong heartburn my oesophagus seems to be inflamed and I noticed any small quantities of stomach acid immediately for a few days. So I sometimes take proton pump inhibitors for a week or two until the oesophagus has healed up again.\n\nI hope that helps you.\nTry the green apple, this was an absolute game-changer for me.", "can we feel any discomfort when affected with aortic aneurysm  Obligatory:  See a doctor if you are concerned.\n\nI have not had an aneurysm, but from what I understand, yes, you should be able to feel it, especially if it is major.\n\nA minor aneurysm is generally not incredibly painful, but is persistent and may be dangerous.\n\nIf you are curious in general, I am sure some folks will chime in, but if you are asking because you are not sure if YOU have an aneurysm, the answer is that you need to go to the ER.  You may be medically fine but that is the only answer an untrained, non-medical professional, or even a trained professional, can give without being able to evaluate you in person. Usually not unless it is dissecting. An aneurysm just existing does not feel like anything. I suppose if it was huge and affected blood flow maybe? But generally you have to have a scan to know about it Thanks I experienced shortness of breath more easily. But generally no. It is dissection that you are more likely to have discomfort or pain. The dangerous thing about aneurysms is that they are mostly undetectable without imaging. Many people with them live their whole life not knowing until it goes.\n\nWe all may have other problems (many have mitral valve prolapse of varying degrees, for example) that are more likely to cause discomfort. My problems personally are caused by palpitations and irregular beat. Thanks I have got one right now (47mm) and I do not feel any different. I only know about it because of the scans. You will only feel pain if it dissect or rupture, and from what I have read it is the type of pain you really will not be able to ignore anyway.

How do I tell if it is a Dominant Negative or Haploinsufficient mutation? I got my Marfan Genetic testing results today. I do have Marfan Syndrome, as I suspected and was clinically diagnosed with.\n\nMy mutation is:\n\nGene: FBN1  \nHGVS cDNA: c.4096G&gt;A, heterozygous  \nHGVS protein: p(Glu1366Lys)  \nLikely pathogenic\n\nDoes treatment differ depending on the Specific Marfan type 1 mutation?\n\nI am asking this as I read a study that says \"We recommend to analyze and categorize the\u00a0FBN1 mutations in all Marfan patients by genetic specialists to predict individual losartan effectiveness\"....\"losartan therapy significantly reduced the aortic root dilatation rate in the haploinsufficient patients, whereas only a modest insignificant reduction was found in dominant negative patients\"\u00a0\n\n(   \n\n\nThis other study seems to show how they classified the mutations into 2 categories (DN and HI):\u00a0  \n(\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am not sure which category my mutation falls into. \n\nDoes anyone have any insight? The treatment stays the same regardless of your specific mutation. What is often done these days is a combination of Losartan + beta blocker, but your doctor should know what to do. Your genetic report is saying that in position 4096 of your fibrillin gene a guanine DNA has been replaced by an adenine DNA leading to the profibrillin protein having a lysine residue instead of a glutamate in the 1366th amino acid position. Basically, one amino acid has been swapped for another. This would be a missense mutation and likely means that a protein is produced, but the functionality of this protein is questionable. It is really hard to say though with just the genetic sequence. I suspect that this represents a Dominant negative mutation, but without doing an actual study of what proteins your body produces it would be very difficult to know one way or another. There was a presentation on something like this in the E3 summit by Hal Dietz. There is an idea that another gene (MAP3K4) could make the difference between Marfan cases , at least in terms of aortic involvement. You can register and view the recording here: ( Thank you very much, I suspect that it is a Dominant Negative mutation as well. I am going to ask my cardiologist whether a beta-blocker should be added along with my Losartan. Thank you for bringing up this conference! Had no idea it was going on. Here is the talk in question by the way:\n\n(\n\nSessions are still ongoing. Really interested in the one tomorrow afternoon about exercise. Nobody really treats Marfan, per se.  They just treat the symptoms, as far as I can tell. Well it is not treatment in the sense that it \"cures\" it, but we do often take stuff like Losartan and/or beta blockers in order to slow the growth of our aorta. You are right that they just treat the symptoms.", "Googly eyes has joined you. Hi guys,\nI am 25, male from Canada.

I had heard that anything stationary like planking is bad for us, but cannot find too much to back that up. If arms are a problems and knees are a problem, which I imagine are more of a problem when putting your weight on them, then the first things to come to me are situps and maybe bicycles( the calisthenic not actually riding them). Will try to update if I think of more.  For me I found anything in water to be by far the best for me in terms of exercise. You choose the resistance you want by the amount of force you decide to exert, and it helped me in so many muscle areas and angles I did not even know where gravity was literally too much and only resulted in what felt like tearing muscles outside the water. I was able to strengthen them and for some even proceed in training outside the water afterwards because it helped that much.\n\nThe ease of doing excercises in a pool was a blessing for me physically. So if you have access to a pool, or someday if you can get access somewhere (harder during covid but still possible through friends, family, neighbors, etc), I have found no better way to exercise this marfan body than in water. And when you get tired, the water is literally right there to catch you and you just relax into the water and float away lol Avoid any weight lifting/ staining of any kind. Sorry I am stuck in a rut and done have workout ideas for myself anymore :( Generally heavy weight lifting is not good - but plenty of light exercise (my cardiologist recommended 30mins 5 days a week for me), but good to check with your Dr.   \n\n\nI have never had issues with my elbows or knees myself, except reduced elbow extension. weight lifting is fine as long as it is light and you are going at a slower tempo with attention towards breathing Normally swimming is recommended.

Does it mean you cannot see anything? Well Pectus is something new. I have always been really thin but with muscles. Especially my arms are really thin and my hands kind of big. Well I do not feel I have breathe problems or anything like that. Just some visual symptoms. I am 5\u20199 and weight 51 kilograms I was about 4 years old and the nursery workers identified that I had to be really close to thongs to see them so much parents took me to an opticians who then referred me to a ophthalmologist where they saw that I had dislocation in both my lenses. At year three, a young doctor realised that I had dislocated lenses. I was diagnosed when I was three with LDS(similar to marfans), but I was already being monitored, because I was strangely thin and could not walk well. And what is dislocated lenses. Do it happen in both eyes? One of the main symptoms of Marfan is that we have weak connective tissue (hence the common aorta expansion). This also means that the tissue that keeps our lenses (and retinas) in place can be weak. In my case, both my lenses were dislocated (and were removed), and both my retinas eventually came loose (one of which was reattached, and has remained so since the early eighties). How old are you now. And how are you? Was dislocated lenses the only symptom? I am 49. Symptoms relating to my eyes were the main concern during my childhood. Later, in my late twenties, my aorta expanded, eventually reaching a diameter of 55 mm, and I underwent aorta/value replacement surgery at the age of 30.\n\n10 years ago, I got endocarditis (a risk, if you have an artificial heart valve), but I evidently survived that (after 6 weeks of hospitalisation).\n\nIn the past five years, I have undergone treatments to prevent osteoporosis, as there is evidence that we are susceptible, possibly due to our rapid growth in our teens.

First it was my long appendages, then it was my hypermobility in my joints, particularly in my knees, and then it was my noticeably terrible eyesight (and that my lenses were visibly jiggling in my eyes). I was diagnosed at 18 months (but it took going through quite a few ignorant/dismissive doctors before Marfans was considered an option and more internal issues were discovered).

Anyway, the problem is that I really have serious anxiety about doctors. Even just ringing up to book the appointment makes me feel physically sick. This also is not helped by a very bad experience I had a while ago where one particular doctor made me feel so awful about making an appointment for some cardio issues I was having, refused to book me in for tests and then actually told me that I was too young to have anything wrong with me.

You might get more response over in /r/Anxiety  But I also do not like going to see the doctor.  And Marfan's is not something that you get when you are older, so you cannot be too young to have it.  As far as things that help, I do not know. I have a slew of things I do for anxiety in general and I apply those to anything medical as well.

I can totally empathize with how you feel about doctors.  I have an artificial heart valve (due to Marfans) as well as artificial hips so I have spent more than my share of time in hospitals and I absolutely loathe them.

I  have a very mild case of scoliosis, i can do the wrist and thumb  thingy, my knees are very flexible and have pain if I run over 15 min. .  My \"Wingspan\" is bigger than my height. I do not have weight problems,  im taller than my family but im not thin (im very active and have a  rather muscular body) My feets are flat and caused some problems in my  life. And besides all these problems i have a mild leaky aortic valve  but my aorta root is perfect and healthy and i go for check ups  regularly. I do not have eye and skin issues. Considering i have all  these conditions im thinking that i might have marfan syndrome or a mild  case of it? I already reduced weight lifting and only lift light  weights which i can lift at least 15 times so i dont stress my aorta and  started swimming. Should I go see a doctor? And is my workout safe  enough? (I do not hold my breath, i only restrict myself to  mashine&amp;isolation workouts, so no compund lifts, no heavy weights,  if i start to strain i stop immediately).\n\nThank you for helping :) &lt;3 I would say go see a doctor anyway, it will give you answers so you do not need to keep asking yourself. And of course, it is very good to know if that is the case so that you can take precautions for the future. As someone living with Marfans my advice to you is to 100% visit a GP. You should ask for a genetic test that will confirm without doubt if you are living with the condition. More importantly the interaction with your GP will ensure you are plugged into the right specialists that  can monitor you depending on what symptoms you exhibit. The most important one of these is the continued monitoring of your heart health. When I was younger I was referred to a specialist clinic because of my height (as I was taller than most). I underwent a week of various testing and assessments and at the end of if they said whilst I exhibited certain marfanoid characteristics there was nothing conclusive to say I had it. I was also referred to a Cardiologist for good measure and after a few appointments I fell of the radar. 20 plus years later I was about to undergo a minor ear operation and as part of the pre-op assessment they did an echo of my heart. It was at this point it was established my aortic root was dilated to 6cm ( well beyond the threshold for elective surgery). Essentially I was a ticking time bomb. The penny then dropped for me and I know I had marfans and subsequent heart surgeries sorted out my aorta. First one was a valve sparing op which was unsuccessful and then I had another op to replace the valve and root outright. So as I have stated.above please refer yourself to the GP and get on the radar as this condition effects people in different ways. It is a spectrum of things that may/may not manifest themselves to a greater or lesser degree of impact. Hope this post helps you and all the best. Yes, go see a doctor. Doctor knows best. You have already gotten wonderful advice in this thread!\n\nGo see a doctor just to be on the safe side with things and please do not worry in the interim. Do please be careful with the summertime heat if you do not mind my saying.\n\nI am 47 and was diagnosed when I was 12 but am not a doctor or nurse or anything of any sort. However, my maternal instinct makes me think that you should maybe just stay with swimming a bit with your buddies or what have you until you go to a doctor. you totally should go to see a doctor but by the sounds of it you probably do have the condition, I once read that 90% of people with aracnodactilia are people with marfan\u2019s syndrome. I went to the gym for a few months last year and did 15 reps for everything without feeling like i was about to die and my aorta has stayed stable, you should still ask a doctor if that is okay in your case tho :)) Quick question because the doc said i might have marfan. How do you work out, what restrictions do you have, because im very active and i dont want to give up everything :( as long as i can lift light weights with high reps im happy (15+ reps) Thank you for answering went to my doc and might have it, i will visit a specialist soon. It still scares me, online information only demonstrate the worst case scenarios :/ Thank you for answering &lt;3 you should also check in with your doctor about that. but from what i have seen here and what doctors have told me 15 reps is okay as long as you do not feel like you are completely out of breath; still, doctors know best Glad you went to the Doctor \ud83d\udc4d Try not to be scared and be as brave as you can be. It is manageable if identified early and there are many proactive things that can be done to help. Not everyone has the same symptoms or characteristics and it is truly a spectrum of things.

Please do not take what i am about to tell you the wrong way, i am basing this on how i felt it helped me understand the condition even better. \n\nMarfan\u2019s syndrome is a genetic disorder but if i recall correctly about 25% of it can develop suddenly (so to speak). Having family members with it can definitely help in knowing your likelihood of having it, but on the flipside, not having family members with it tells you that you need to get them diagnosed (if there is a confirmed Marfan\u2019s) in order for them to take precautions for their own health and life. You will be saving them from loads of long term issues. \n\nHope this helps No I do not have any family members with it.. I am the tallest in my family at 6 foot 4  my father was bout 6 foot when younger I have 1 sister she is tall for girl but nowhere near me.. Just very concerned lately and worried to be doing heavy excersise or work at moment have done lot of hard labour over years and afraid in case I do have that I done 2 much punishment to body .. Like can the tell for definite if do not or do have it? I see. Yeah that is a very concerning thought. One way to definitively tell if you have it or not is to go for genetic testing. Look for marfan\u2019s and other similar conditions like ehler-danlos and whatnot. You could ask your local hospital for advice on where and how to get that genetic testing done", "It is so hard to see my boyfriend in pain The subject basically says it all.

I know you all understand the Marfan better than anybody, so I guess I just wanted to reach out to people who get it. \n\nIt has not been hard in the sense of putting a strain on our relationship or anything like that- it is more that seeing someone I love so much in constant pain hurts on a level I do not even know how to describe. I know that this is a valid and normal way to feel, but it also makes me feel like a jerk because his Marfan is not about me. I am not the one struggling everyday to do things that most people take for granted. I do not think that seeing him hurting will ever be easy, but the reality is that his Marfan is only going to get worse so I know I need to find a way to cope with that fact.\n\nI do not know that I am looking for any super specific advice or anything, but I am so open to any and all insights folks may want to share. He is stuck with me for the long haul, and I just want to make sure I am always being the best partner that I can be through it all. I do not think you need to do anything; love and patience are plenty. As the person who is dealing with pain, let me say on his behalf that in addition to the pain is the worry that we are being a burden on our partners. We are well aware of the toll it takes on our partners, the pain we deal with. It does not just impact us, it impacts you as well and that is a source of anxiety and stress for us. So simply reassuring us that you do not think of us as a burden to you means the world to us. When we take longer to do things, when we do not feel up to going out, all those moments please just remember and be patient with us. Some day your patience is going to wear thin. You may not think it now, but it will. And that is ok, we will understand. It is frustrating. It is annoying. It is ok to be frustrated. Thanks for being a good person who cares. Thank you so much for saying all this. You put it perfectly - I never ever want to make him feel like a burden or have him worry that he is taking a toll on me. Of course there are moments of frustration but at the end of the day it is all worth it. Keep accommodations in mind for him and be inventive/ creative with things to make tasks as easy as possible for him and not straining. My mom suffers from chronic pain and we have to work together a lot to make arrangements. Also, maybe have friends over at your place (taking appropriate pandemic precautions) for keeping him company if you are away working / on his low-pain days :)\nEveryone has their own preferences and way of doing things, so his may be different and not include any of these examples, and there is an age gap, but my mom has a fanny pack that she puts small things in to bring up and down the stairs because she cannot go up and down them everyday to get things the way we do. Like contact lenses and a book etc. \nHer pills are arranged to morning vs night for down/upstairs. \nShe has her own belongings in odd places in the house so she can reach them the easiest. \nThese are just some examples of what my mom does :) And maybe talk to him about getting a wheelchair accessibility pass for the car so he does not have to walk too far when he is parking in public somewhere. Spot on. Already, I think you have done a great thing for your partner and your relationship in general by seeking advice on how to navigate these waters; seems to me that you are a very caring, compassionate person. As someone in a similar spot, (my husband has Marfan's, I do not) I would offer some advice - give yourself some grace. That was the hardest lesson for me to learn. There are going to be days when you do not respond perfectly in a stressful situation, and days when you do not want to go to the ER yet again, and days when you are frustrated because you wish your partner were capable of doing more around the house and that is okay, it really is. My husband and I have been together 11 years, and at the time we got together, he would already had a large spinal fusion, aortic valve replacement and root graft, and lens replacement surgery. He already had some physical limitations at that point, and those limitations have gotten more severe as the years have gone on; we have had to learn, together, how to adapt. Patience, grace, and honesty, I think, are the key things that have helped us. The honesty one can be pretty tricky for both parties, but it is a really important thing, I think, to be able to say, \"Hey, it seems like you are overexerting yourself lately and I am worried it is making your pain worse. Can we talk about it?\" In our case, my husband has/had a tendency to push himself too hard because he a) does not want to feel like a burden and b) wants to feel \"normal\". We had to have several difficult conversations around this, and ultimately, he came to understand that doing things which exacerbate his pain levels only make the overall situation worse. I do not mind doing extra housework, or handling all the grocery shopping, but I did not like having to spend hours in the ER because he would pushed too hard when he knew better. I second the sentiment above, that it is okay for your patience to wear thin, it really is. Be kind to yourself, and keep those lines of communication open.", "I did a thing today, and looking back at photos I found that I feel \"normal\" in my \"abnormal\" body. It actually made me uncomfortable to see the disparity between the idea &amp; the reality. ", "How much weight did your cardiologist (or ones you have talked to) say is safe to lift?  According to my cardiologist, a good guideline to follow is to imagine that if something was twice its current weight, would I have to strain to lift it? If so, I should not lift it. I was always told never more than 50 lbs which I always took to mean carry 50 lbs is 22.7 kg but that means we cannot even lift ten pounds which is unrealistic in day to day life.  It has to be challenging enough that I can finish a workout without straining myself too much. Things like \"pushing to finish the last rep\" is something I avoid, I also cut workouts if I am not feeling 100%.\n\nYou got to limit yourself a lot, and it will take longer to see results, but it is possible as long as you are careful and check your heart often.

I know we are not supposed to hold out breath while lifting things..what about just holding your breath for 5 seconds inbetween your in and out breath while in a meditation? that should be fine. \n\nthe lifting things is because isometric exercise increases blood pressure, putting a greater strain on the aorta. Holding your breath whilst lifting is known as the Valsalva manoeuvre, this is used to essentially allow you to strain more and lift more. the risk isnt actually increased by holding your breath, its that if you are holding your breath in order to lift then you are straining too hard. \n\nMediation is very different and should not be causing you to strain!!

The doctor who is referring me suspects MFS because of our outward features. I do not think either of his parents was suspected to have it, so he would be the first in the family. Thanks again.) Its probably a blood test! Nothing to worry about! Genetic testing is just one part of a comprehensive plan.  If a single test comes back negative, you need to work with your doctor to continue other avenues to investigate.  Things like a \" a \u201cslit lamp\u201d evaluation to see if the lenses in your eyes are out of place\", time with a genetic counselor or even a complete evaluation by a Marfan clinic.    \n\n\nGenetic tests are not 100% accurate and there are still some unknowns out there.  \n\n\nDo not stress about it but be sure you stay actively involved in all of your medical decisions.

Who do you guys \"check in\" with for that?  Just your GP?\n\nThanks for any help! Your GP will refer you to ortho probably for X-rays or other tests If it is something simple like getting a referral for physical therapy your GP will probably be good enough. If there are aggravating conditions like obesity he will probably refer you to a nutritionist, and or endocrinologist too along with an specialist to check the pain itself \nIf you want to jump straight to specialists there are a few you could try.\nPhysiatrist for muscle pain and weakness,making a rehabilitation and exercise regimen etc; orthopedist to check if there is anything wrong with hardware and adjacent level syndrome/arthritis progression , neurologist if you have nerve damage symptoms, disproportionate weakness or sharp \"electric shock\" pain.\nBut the best person to see who the best doctor would be for your case is a medical professional so I recommend you do not skip the GP visit. I see a neurosurgeon and a pain management specialist because mine is both nerve and arthritis related, but my scoliosis is pretty mild.\n\nIf you have severe scoliosis or severe arthritis but no nerve issues I imagine you would get a referral for an orthopedic surgeon instead. In my experience the tests happen first, then the referrals happen depending on the need. It will depend on what sort of back issues you have, but a GP is a good place to start. If you have bone/physical structure issues (scoliosis, disc degeneration), it will likely be a othopedist &amp; xrays. If it is something like dural ecstasia, it will be a neurologist &amp; CT/MRI scans. If it is weakness of muscle, you might see physical therapy. \n\nJust depends on what sort of flavor of back problem you have. A good place to start (at least if you are in the US) is a GP, as most insurances require a referral to a specialist in the first place.\n\nBest of luck! Awesome thank you! That is helpful thank you!  It sounds like  an Ortho thing.

Also physical therapy people if they are experienced.\n\nOne thing I feel very strongly about and want to guard against is chiropractors, or any other \u201cexperts\u201d who claim to be able to manipulate the spine to make it better. \nI have been to them in childhood. They did not fix anything and may even have made things worse. The thing is when you actually have serious issues with your spine then anybody who may claim to be able to \u201cmove it\u201d or otherwise manipulate it can make it worse. Chiropractors are sneaky as well. They can do things to people\u2019s spine and body which can give a sensation like things are \u201cbetter\u201d. It is done not due to chiropractic \u201cknowledge\u201d but often despite it. For example many of them begin their sessions by giving the patient a strong intense massage. Massage itself can make the spine feel better since it increases circulation and makes muscles more relaxed. But you can get good massages from massage therapistsz", "Anyone here ftm trans? My parents are very worried about me starting HRT and getting top (bottom too possibly but very far in the future) surgery considering the fact that I have Marfan syndrome. Just wanted to chat to someone in the same boat to see if it is possible for it all to work out. In relation to my heart I have a normal aortic root and a slight MVP, so my cardiologist is not too worried about hormones. In terms of surgery, I am a very poor healer and take a long time to recover from surgery, as well as tending to scar quite poorly and I have very elastic skin. Was hoping for some info from someone going through the same thing to maybe reassure me or let me know if possible issues I am going to have. Thank you! The only thing I can think of is that it may make your future heart surgery a bit more complicated but that would be no different than anyone else you had breast augmentation surgery.  Good luck! Nope. I was born male. I am 24. However, I was considering becoming a trans girl so I can fix my chest into breasts but I dropped the idea. I have gone through a bumpy ride trying to figure out my gender identity. I never did HRT or surgery, but I have thought of it. But even though I never did HRT, I seem to sound and look like a genderless 18 year old, so I might naturally be lacking in hormones even though my sex drive is fine, not sure. Due to having physical health issues, not sure if estrogen pills or testosterone pills will help me. Despite the high pitch voice and lack of body hair, I think I am fine for now. As for you, I am not sure what you should do. I did read a story of a guy who fixed his chest deformity, not trans related but I guess it can be done safely to fix a chest I guess? I also heal slowly and have elastic skin, and my aorta is also fine! (For now at least.) Around 4 years ago, I asked myself how to learn about something in this day and age with fake news, propaganda, echo chambers, and so on.   I knew nothing about transgenderism, and it was being talked about more.  I decided to use this as a subject to test my idea of how to learn about a controversial topic today.\n\nI read information from as many different types of sources as possible, right-wing, left-wing, centrist, blatant propaganda, more fair sources, primary sources from trans people (YouTube videos where they are speaking to the camera in their home vs. being filtered and edited through the media), primary sources from people who regretted being trans, feminists, anti-feminists, TERFS, anti-TERFs, people who hated transgender people, pro-trans activists,.  As I was reading, I weighed everything I read against everything else I read and came to a conclusion I, as a result, feel confidence in.\n\nI do not recommend anyone identity as transgender as a result.  I could go into why but I know I will not convince you.  I know I might be making you angry by saying this.  I am not trying to. \n\nAt the very least, even if you are going to do this, consider reading a range wide of information, including by people who regret being transgender.     I do not like how their voices are silenced and dismissed by many trans activists for political reasons. Hi there, OP asked for medical advice on surgery - not your opinion on transgenderism. It is not your decision and I find it disrespectful of you to challenge a decision on his identity that he has made. This comment was completely unnecessary of you. Just wanted to let you know that while you recommend I do not identify as transgender, it is not a choice. Trans people have existed throughout history, and will always exist, please look at the science rather than the media and activists either way. The assumption I have not weighed up the choice of my decision to transition is false, I have thought of very little else for just shy of a decade, and any decision with the level of consequences as this is not one anyone should take lightly. But please do not recommend an identity, it is not like picking out a new haircut, it is not a choice, it is only the decision to live my life as myself. Thank you for your support Thank you for your response! Thank you for the information, best wishes! I would be more worried about the HRT honestly than surgery. You are an actual twat I hope you know that. You are treating transgenderism like it is some kind of political identity leftists take up and it shows you are definitely not as informed as you say you are. \n\nThere is no option of choice in identifying as transgender, like homosexuality someone is either born trans or they are not. \n\nSo according to you OP should read up specifically on examples of trans regret? You mean that 8% out of a 100 that regrets transitioning should be heard more frequently? Even if most of the 8% regrets transitioning due to surgical complications?\n\nYou are not a medical professional, you do not get to give out this advice. \n\nTL;DR: Kindly sod off. \n\nSource: ", "Looking for someone who is had the same surgery CW: surgery, aortic issues\n\nHey everyone;\n\nI have got Marfan Syndrome, and have had one heart surgery back in 2015.

But I have always been thinking of it as a \u2018one and done\u2019 thing so it is something I can cope with. But thinking about the fact that things can still need repairing is so anxiety-inducing. I feel for you and hope you find what you are looking for and hope you have a speedy recovery. I hear you; I was hoping for the same.

AMA Hey everyone,  I am a 24 year old man, I had my aortic root replaced in 2007, and this past year my entire aorta after the arch dissected and I had surgery in February to repair it down to where the kidneys connect to it.  Now I am having the rest replaced all the way down to where the aorta splits into the iliac arteries.  Hopefully this will be my last aortic surgery.  I wanted to post this here in case anyone has any questions, I know I had a ton and was very scared leading up to my surgeries so please do not hesitate to ask anything.", "Boyfriend has Marfans. How can I help him? My boyfriend (early/mid-twenties) was diagnosed with Marfans when he was 17/18. As far as I know, he is never looked into any possible treatment options. I understand that with Marfans, you can only really treat the symptoms; but I also know that he needs to go to at least a GP, if not a cardiologist. He currently does not have health insurance and I am so terrified that if something serious happens, he is not going to go to the ER because of the medical bills.\n\nHe is so wrapped up in the possibility of him dying in a few years that he is frequently depressed and anxious, and it just keeps getting worse. He is such a beautiful person, inside and out, and I feel that he deserves to feel happy and he deserves to be as healthy as he can be. \n\nI keep trying to persuade him into getting (or letting me get) himself a health plan during open enrollment. I keep nearly getting through to him, then later the conversation is revisited and he thinks it would be a waste of time and money. Maybe I am being selfish, but I really hope not. \n\nI guess I just do not really know what to do or how to get through to him? Men respond well to worst case scenarios in terms of thinking through risk/reward. Explain that the cost of health insurance is drastically less than the cost of any number of medical issues related to marfan syndrome to be treated without medical insurance. Make it real specific, if he experienced an aortic dissection and had no health insurance it would likely ruin him financially for years, the cost of healrh insurance ensures that will not happen as there is a cap (out of pocket max) that will not be exceeded no matter what. Coming from someone you ignored it and put it on the back burner for 10+ years I would give anything I could to go back in time. Cause I am about 2months away from getting my aorta surgery. And the past couple months of finally knowing I have been super stressed and depressed. \n\nHe needs to understand that he needs to keep track of the aorta. If he ignores it and it ruptured you have a really bad chance for a happy ending. \n\nIf I can help in any other way let me know Move to a country where seeing a doctor and getting treatment as a right, not some privilege. In india i can visit quality cardio for under 10$. I visit cardio every 6 months or so to check anything wrong with aorta. I am also visiting a multi specialty eye hospital, and fees just cost like 1.30 usd. I have never thought of trying to explain it that way or give that scenario. I will try it, thank you! Thank you so much I would love to do so, it is just not in our finances currently. Though that does make me wonder about the possibility of going to another country for a procedure if he were to need one. Thank you! The real reason for insurance is regular monitoring to detect an issue before it is an emergency. My wife nags me constantly to see various doctors and I have not only come to terms with it but secretly love it :) good luck I am married to a man w/Marfan Syndrome; we have been together 10 years, married for 9. I can say with confidence - the monthly cost of health insurance is much less than the bills that will show up if/when he has a dissection (my husband had valve replacement surgery because that is what was going to happen if he did not) or a spinal issue (my husband had his first fusion, 18 inches long with three titanium rods bolted to his spine, when he was just 22), or any number of other things that could happen. There have been years where my husband's medical bills totaled well into the six figures before we were even halfway through the year. And as far as having a primary doctor - your boyfriend needs one, like, yesterday. I get the depression and anxiety, my husband has fought with it for years, but going untreated with only worsen the situation. Believe me, I have had that conversation with my husband on more than one occasion, and it is never fun, but it is always worth it.

So i have always observed my arms and fingers were disproportionately long.  Recently someone on a social media site upon seeing ( said they were \"also a marfanoid zombie\".\n\nDo I necessarily have the syndrome if my body type fits into the habitus?\n Have you seen a specialist? That would be the best way to determine whether you have Marfan Syndrome or not. Marfanoid habitus is describing the physical traits of Marfan. The specialist will help you know exhibit the symptoms you have internally. \nHave you visited the Marfan Foundation website? That is also a huge resource. marfan.org While not as definitive as seeing a specialist, these two tests are considered pretty solid indicators:\n\n( Positive for both Go see a specialist to confirm, but that is good indication. The biggest danger is if you have heart issues (which the vast majority of marfans patients do), and do not treat them. Last I would heard, life expectancy with zero treatment is 40, at the outside.  I had no idea the thumb thing was abnormal until just a few years ago. It kind of blows my mind watching my SO try it, and it is not even close lol And would an EKG show any indication of defects or does it requite more detailed tests?  Lately I have been dealing with high blood pressure, and I do not see what could be causing it because I do not smoke, I do not drink, I do not overeat, and I exercise regularly High blood pressure could be coincidental genetic, hard to say. \n\nEKG would not tell enough, though it would pick up any issues and EKG is capable of picking up. \n\nThe big issue is aorta size, and you will need either an echocardiogram, an MRI, or a CT to image it properly. 5cm is the outside range. And, as I discovered this year, 4.5cm is when they start talking about impending surgery. i often think wow people have such short pudgy little fingers lol my main issue is i think they have me down as a hypochondriac in my case file.  i have been referred to psych over expressing concerns about heart palpatations before. I do not even notice mine are unusually long until I see them on video. Does not help I tend to do things with my fingertips lol Idk how they work for anxiety, but that is because I have been on a beta blocker for... 26 years? Something like that. I literally do not know what my physiology is like without it. \n\nLosartan is a good med, they are saying. Noticable improvement in slowing aortic growth over just beta blockers. I am currently on that and nadolol. And an anti-arrhythmia. And a statin because, while my cholesterol is technically in a decent range, my cardiologist would like to see it a bit lower because marfans.\n\nThe heart palpitation thing.. I used to go to the ER for chest pains and shit long ago. But unless you are having a heart attack, it generally nothing they can see. So it just costs money, wastes your time, and - like you said - makes you look like a hypochondriac. :/ I might make an appointment for it, but I will probably wait till I have anxiety medicine in hand before I do so, bc I expect to be challenged or told I am hypochondriac over it all. I have not and would worry I would be dismissed, bc I have recently been to the doctor over numerous different complaints from requesting a screening for neurodevelopmental disorder, to having sharp pains in my lower abdomen (which they literally told me to go to the ER for bc insurance wouldnt approve the ultrasound) which turned out to be constipation, to pains in what feels like the gallbladder area, to concerns over heart palpations, pain in between the connective tissue connecting the ribs to sternum, to trying to get anxiety meds.  I think i am noted down in my file as a likely hypochondriac.  So i expect a conflict over it which is why i am just going to wait until i get my anxiety medication before requesting the appointment to talk about marfans.  I have briefly looked at some websites.  I dont have a couple things like flat feet, crowded oral maxilla (to my knowledge, tho fwiw i did have an impacted wisdom tooth, and somewhat of a cross bite, but did not need braces or anything like that).  But I do meet the Steinberg and Walker Murdoch signs.  I see people out in public who are more obviously marfans than me.  But again growing one of my nicknames by bullies was \"spider legs\". Being labeled hypochondriac is very common to those with genetic disorders. Connective tissue causes so many problems over the whole body, its easier to think we are nuts than to diagnose. If you happen to be in the bay area, I can recommend someone who would take you seriously.  Are you meaning SF bay area? I am positive for the two signs above, also scoliosis/lordosis, crowded teeth, small chin, double jointed, extremely thin, long limbs and digits, and for a few years now, chest pain on exertion. Do you know of a doctor who can diagnose Marfans here? I do, if you pm me your info I can put you in contact.

So this is a very trivial issue but since it is now snowing where I live I have started to notice this problem more. \n\nDoes anyone else have trouble finding good gloves that fit? My hands are so thin and my fingers are longer than average so standard gloves just end up being way too wide or too short for my fingers. Has anyone found a way around this, apart from getting custom made gloves? I usually buy men\u2019s gloves when Women\u2019s do not fit? Maybe I got lucky in the hand department. Finding a large enough size has been my only problem, and the extra large usually work. They usually have abundant small &amp; medium sizes, but few large &amp; extra large.\n\nOn a post not too long ago someone posted about custom clothing and someone listed a link where they would probably have what you are looking for. Certainly. I have just gotten used to having my knuckles well up on the glove. I am a lady who wears men's gloves but where I have been living for some years over in Memphis it does not get ice cold for very long. \n\nThree winters ago it actually snowed for a couple of days in a row and I bought a pair of men's thermal gloves from the Bass Pro Shop. That shop might work for you, OP because they seemingly cover a lot of sizes. Skiers and such wear the ones I am making reference towards. \n\nWith us, gloves and watches and bracelets and rings are always quite something. I can only fit children's watch band sizes and such lol. Are mittens an option or do you require use of individual fingers? You could also do convertible mittens where you can move from having a mitten to having fingerless gloves. \n\nI very rarely need my individual fingers, so I usually always buy mittens (or make them), if I am having a moment or a year where I do need my individual fingers, I buy/knit convertible mittens (typically buy as I do not often make myself things when knitting/crocheting).\n\nHope this helps! Yessssssss! Lol, this post is so relatable. If I need a good fit, I usually just buy mittens, even though I hate them and wear them when I really have no choice (like during snow sports). Ohh this is a good suggestion thank you! Would convertible mittens be an option that would suit you better? Its what I do, but I also do not like gloves (and love mittens) but you fold the 'mitten' back to end up with a set of finger-less gloves so you can use your fingertips - however in snowsports, I am not sure having exposed fingers is a great thing - but may be worth looking into? My entire life. Yep lol I am female and usually have to get mens ones and just deal with the fact that there is extra material. Though I got really lucky a few years back with ones from Target that fit like a dream, then I lost them \ud83d\ude2d Yes! No one who says the phrase \"fit like a glove\" has ever brought a pair of gloves \n\n\nI usually just put up with it,but I did crochet a pair recently to my exact size! Oh that is a good solution! I might have to learn how to crochet just to do that now haha Thanks!

The benefits outweigh the risks and complications are rare. Fully vaccinated Marf here, I am good. ask your doctor just to be sure! The Marfan foundation says we are good to get it. Go do it, as getting COVID is a far greater risk to you! I am double vaxxed. Not a doctor but I would guess the stress of covid on your body is worse than the vaccine. I know it can cause swelling of the heart. \n\nI am vaccinated. Zero side effects to the vaccine. Talk to your doctor if you are concerned. Do not base anything on 'heard'.   Use the search engine for anything important.   If possible, use math.   For nuclear power plants, use probabalistic risk analysis. The side effects of the vaccine are much less severe than getting the \u2018Vid. Get the vaccine. My cardiologist said get whatever covid vaccine you can ? I did use a search engine and why its rare it seems to be prolific to those that are in the young demographic My cardiologist said they did not like what they saw in VAERS regarding AstraZeneca and Johnson and Johnson.  They would prefer I wait to see about Norovax but said if I can stay home full time they would prefer I do that but if I have to be in the world pick Pfizer or Moderna because we are not pinging in VAERS as often with those two Which vaccine did you get Which one did you get Moderna I got pfizer", "Think I might have this, just finding out after 25 years I have always had an abnormal number of problems with my body.\n\nI had really bad kyphosis that had to be corrected with a spinal fusion.\nI was awfully nearsighted and got lasik, my eyes are kind of receded into my face a bit.\nMy face is kind of long, but not aggressively so.\nMy chin was receded and my ears were huge so I got a chin augment and my ears pinned.\nI have flat feet so I wear orthotics.\nMy teeth are messed up and I am getting them fixed with orthodontics.\nMy chest is protruded outwards slightly.\nI am relatively tall (6\u20190).\nMy hands are massive.\nMy limbs are unusually long relative to my torso, but not unnaturally so.\n\nFor awhile I thought I just had a series of unrelated bad genetic lottery issues, but I always thought that was odd because my parents were fine. A random pharmacist in Mexico today saw my wide neck and huge hands and told me to look up Marfans Syndrome and I am kind of shook. Obviously I do not know for sure until I get a DNA test, but this would explain a lot. I am no doc but some symptoms match marfan. Only a genetic test will tell.\n\nI am glad that you have got your eyes on it early cause it is kind of common to discover it late in life and in worst cases people find out they have marfs only after serious complications or even death.. And it could be easly avoided just taking some precautions.\n\nThe main risk that comes with marfs is the cardiovasculary conditions. Due to lack of elasticity, often some major aortas/valves tend to loose themselves and it can cause some serious stuff like aortic dissection (very bad). If you are suspivious you can have it, the first thing you should do is schedule a cardiologist and ask for an echocardiogram. Also avoid impact sports and getting exhausted while exercising. \n\nI am not trying to scare you or anything but this are common worries with marfans that are easy to avoid. Despite of any diagnostic you will have a normal life, if it confirms marfan than you will just have to see a couple more docs than usual and avoid certain situations like contact/extreme sports. Yeah that is what I am thinking. Kind of like being predisposed to cancer. If it does end up being Marfans I will more be mad than anything that nobody, including the spinal surgeon who partially corrected my kyphosis, caught it.\n\nI really appreciate the advice, talking with my primary care soon to get the genetics test. Signs and Symptoms of connective tissue disorders can vary greatly,\n\nI have confirmed Marfan (FBN1 mutation) If I told you what signs and symptoms I had from your list it is only\n\n\\-Slight scoliosis   \n\\-Slight overbite (chin too far back)  \n\\-Very tall (6'8\")  \n\\-Big hands  \n\\-unnaturally long limbs  \n\\-Dislocated lenses in eyes leading to nearsightedness   \n\n\nI would recommend you go to a geneticist and a medical expert who is familiar with connective tissue disorders - as there are quite a few different connective tissue disorders.", "What does an aortic dissection feel like? Curious what one feels like. Just incase I have one and need to run to the hospital.", "Another BMI question Hi everyone,\n\nI am 22M with mild(probably) Marfan syndrome. I have got the whole pack: scoliosis (2nd grade), chest convex (barely visible, but all the doctors always ask about it, mild case as well), Mitral valve prolapse, TMD and of course quite flexibel joints. I have seen already many posts about the weight and why ist it that difficult to gain something. I would like to tell my story about it and then ask you all a question. \n\nI am 6.2. with the weight of 61 kg (just a year ago i was 64). I was always happy about the thing, that i can eat whatever I want to, and gain absolut 0. But then, as many of us, I have started noticing things, and decided to become a school jock. Sweet Jesus, it took me like 3 years. I have been training 3-4 times a week and ate a quite a lot, counted all the calories, that I consumed and so on. But the attempt was unsuccessful. Well once I actually did succeed and gained like 5 kg during 6 months. I was amazed, but then i suddenly got a flu and was sick for a week and a half and lost 6 kg. I cannot express my dissappointment at that particular moment, when i checked my weight. Anyways after this I have decided, why should I even try and eat 3000-3500 Kcalories per day. I just will not have such an Apollo body.  Whatever. \n\nBut more and more common I face the problem of my BMI. For example if I would like to get the job, I have to do a medical for this job. My BMI is out of healthy range and it will be much better if I can get like 5-7 kg. I am pretty sure, that it will help the immune system as well. \n\nSo did you succeed with weight gain? If so, what was your story and how much time/energy did it cost? And do you really know any six pack Marfans, do they even exist? My brothers and I have mild marfans. We all had 6packs at one point (one brother has a beer gut now).  We have never been buff, but we are lean and wiry. \n\nI have managed to actively gain weight. I went from iirc 124 lbs to 150. It took several months of constant overeating.  Towards the end i stopped trying to gain because it was too much work. 124 lbs is the weight of $4951.18 worth of Premium Glass Nail Files...  30 pounds is the weight of $1197.87 worth of Premium Glass Nail Files... i have been overweight in the past and gained/lost weight very easily but since working out 5 hours a week my metabolism has changed a lot and it is getting harder to gain weight. I have never counted calories but I spent two weeks eating twice as much as I was and lost 2kg (one each week). Last week I basically forced myself to eat every time I was not sick from how much I was eating (at least 5 meals a day) and managed to gain just over 3kg in 7 days. Probably not the healthiest but it does help me out regardless, I am way heavier already though; I am (19F) 194cm/6\u20193-6\u20194 and weighed 83kg on monday Unfortunately I have the opposite problem. Not being able to work out with any real intensity certainly does not help. That said, I would defer to a medical professional on this one, or a highly educated personal trainer.

Since I have some symptoms related to. I am being tested by my GP in first round. She told me that she would measure my armspan. Do she even know anything about Marfans. Or do I need a specialist? I am 18. Male. \n\nThanks I think that if she still suspects Marfan after doing some basic tests, she will refer you to a specialist. They are the ones who can order an MRI and genetic testing that would confirm it. What if she does not? Why if I only have some skeletal symptoms? You need to have a full workup including an echocardiogram on your heart. Usually you would be referred to a geneticist for this. A DNA test can confirm as well.  It may just be a formality that you need to see her first to get a referral. Do not be afraid to advocate for yourself and insist that you would like to speak with a specialist/geneticist/cardiologist if she does not refer you right away. GPs are not always well-equipped to test for or fully educated on genetic disorders. In my experience, they only know about some of the superficial symptoms you can see e.g. armspan, wrist test, scoliosis, etc. Marfans can also be clinically diagnosed without a positive DNA result. My GP looked at my skeletal symptoms (like my gangly body and my wrist-thumb signs) and my family history and then referred me to a cardiologist.\n\nIf your GP does not see enough cause for concern with your current physical status, you probably do not have anything to worry about. A lot of young men your age are tall and slim because they are still growing. This is generally with family history, though. OP does not mention a family history. I am getting tested next Monday. Best of luck man! I believe that in the absence of a familial history of marfan's the diagnostic criteria narrows down to:  \nBoth a score of 7 or more in the ghent nosology list + aortic root dilation (z-score greater than 2 which takes into account aorta size relative to BSA) and/or lens dislocation.

Their symptoms are mild, though. I(39m) was told that with my fake aorta (and medications) I should have a \"near normal\" life expectancy.

Hiya, that is quite outdated\n\nif you are diagnosed and attending your regular check ups you can expect a \"Near Normal\" life expectancy of about 70\n\nthis because it allows doctors to treat you before your aorta dissects, obviously individual circumstances will affect this. \n\nUndiagnosed marfans patients do tend to die younger, because they are unable to take preventative measures such as beta-blockers/Lostartan and their aorta is not being monitored. \n\nmy grandad died at 41, his identical twin brother is 63 and still alive and relatively healthy. 42 and still going strong and my dilation has been unchanged since my 20's. I do however maintain a healthy lifestyle, am an active runner, was diagnosed in my teens, take my medication religiously, and get a yearly checkup (was every 6 months until my late 20's). So I think the best takeaway with regards to life expectancy is regular checkups and maintain a healthy lifestyle; my cardiologist has told me to expect an average life expediency so I think that 35-50 might be a little outdated or apply to more extreme cases. I am 56 with few symptoms. I passed it on unknowingly to my son who has heart problems which is disheartening but I am thankful for my son. Currently the only problem I have is with my joints. I have arthritis and joint deterioration that is compounded by my double joints. You cannot have hip and knee replacement and have the usual results when you are double jointed. I did not know this when I had my hip replaced but learned the hard way with 3 hip dislocations. (Not fun) but ultimately I believe that I should age well, I just have to be more reserved physically (I will never be able to run or jump again.) Marfans has different symptoms for everyone. You cannot put a number on it because it depends on the individual. Hey there. I was wondering what limitations you have with a fake aorta? Also, how was the recovery? My doctors have not changed any limitations since the surgery, they still recommend low impact exercise like swimming/walking, no weight lifting etc.. When they separated my chest it weakened my upper body by a lot.  I found I could not do some things I once could, such as push-ups (not recommended anyway. ) It was painful and took a couple months to recover.", "anyone a heavy drinker? ", "do people really grow until 30? i have read online that people with marfans  grow until 30 but none of my doctors have mentioned this - does anyone know if this is true? i do not really want to get any taller i am not going to lie My growth plates closed when i was around 17 and i have not grown since. i have never heard this\n\nmy cardiologist said that people with Marfans typically start puberty earlier and thus stop growing younger\n\nI stopped gorwing at 11 (F) and my brother stopped around 14 I am 16 and I just stopped growing. I was 6\u20195\u201d at 15 and that was it. I am 13 y.o., 1,83/1,84m tall. I do not know if to tell that I have stopped growing because it is slowing down. My height has increased by A LOT on early 2020, where in late 2019 I was around 1,65/1,70m tall. I grew until 27.  Only 1\" from 24 to 27, but still grew it.  Feet did not  stop til 30.  We are all different.  It is  not a normal thing but it can happen. interesting! i went through puberty later than most. i.e I got my period at 16 and stopped growing around 18 I looked this up because I was not sure if my cardiologist was just full of shit. A 2002 study found that the growth spurt and pubertal skeletal maturation occur early in Marfan syndrome.  ( \n\nAverage age of first menstruation in marfans is 11.7 (2 years younger than general population) and the peak of growth spurts was about 2.4 (male) Or 2.2 (female) years younger than average population \n\nObviously these things still all have a range, and there seem to have only been a few studies into this so who knows!", "Any other guys here feel kind of shitty about not being able to bulk up? I am thin and practically underweight for my age and height (not anything to worry about just under 140lbs), which sits on my mind A LOT when doing stuff... \n\nThe ribs showing, elbows sticking out, and thin legs really fuck with me; I legit almost do not wear short sleeve t-shirts or shorts because I think I would look weird to people (especially chicks... \u201cWhat girl would want a guy who has the physique of a twelve year old?\u201d sincerely, my brain) as being an 18 year old. \n\nI tried weight lifting (against both my mother\u2019s and doctor\u2019s words) to bump up my arms and chest muscles, I tried push ups, and carrying heavy stuff... All that happened was heavy breathing and me grasping at my neck and chest as I felt my blood pressure fuckin\u2019 skyrocket. But, in those moments I did not see any improvements besides basic definition of certain muscles (which I maintain through drumming). So I highly do not recommend it.\n\nYeah, I guess I am just pissed about the whole body image thing. I absolutely get your frustration. You are smack in the middle of the time of life when you come into your physicality and so naturally it is damn frustrating having the will but not a way to push yourself. And it is cold comfort I am sure, but I can absolutely promise you that it will get better. In a few years you will come to realize that your physique, in the grand scheme of things, is not important. Even when it comes to finding someone. Be healthy, yes. Absolutely. But you will come to find that being happy with yourself and enjoying yourself is far more attractive to others. For me, I took acting classes. I sucked. Not funny. Try hard. And one day it clicked: when I stopped caring how I looked and started having fun, so did the audience. I learned how to be funny and yes it is a skill you can learn. And it is so much more attractive than any physique. Hang in there, you will figure it out too. Maybe not through acting or anything but one day it will click for you. Love yourself. Speaking as a guy in his mid 30s, I get how you feel. In my 20s I was super bummed out about the prospect and always \"looking like some gawky teenager\". \n\nThen I learned to love the look that I have and leaned into it and had fun with it. I will never have a beach body, but I am healthy, fit and I look as good as I can make myself without putting myself at risk. That is what makes me happy these days, just being as fit and healthy as I can be. Are you diagnosed with marfans via gentic testing? On occasions when my friends are talking about how bulked they can get, yes. I mainly worry about being healthy in the terms of what food I eat, and activity levels. I remember always wearing long sleeve jackets and sweaters in my either grade year because I did not want people to see my ridiculously slim arms. Nowadays its not that severe, I found a friend who has helped me be more secure with myself. The more I am typing, the more I am relating to your question, no matter how hard I try, nothings changing. \"Its like content that is locked behind a pay-wall, but excludes Marfans\" Yes That is what I am thinking of, just making sure I am healthy. Thanks for the kind words mate! Not a guy but I do lift but very intelligently and safely and have been getting good results in just one week so far. Did your doc advice you against ALL weightlifting? And how is your aorta? It is generally safe for us to lift light weights - medium weights (with medium it is more so if your heart is stable and even then it is only up to half of your body weight) but with high reps until near failure / failure so that it equates to a heavier weight in volume. I follow two routines for the upper body and lower body and because it is lifting I am also on a bulk and people have complimented me and said i look fit. I genuinely believe it is possible for most marfan patients if they do it intelligently all the way through. This means: start a light weight that does not make your heart / blood pressure jump like it did, do high reps on a routine that targets large muscle groups, go on a bulk diet, and always go to or near failure on the last set and once you hit 25-30 reps on each exercise in the routine you can go up 5lbs and repeat the process until 30lbs if you are going by conservative cardiologist recommendations. I am betting that you started out heavier than what you needed to begin with. OH also: you are going to need to breathe out when you are lifting and breathe in when you release the weight down or whatever and then to breathe in and out deep during 2 minute rest times in between sets. This all will take a dastardly long time so it is best to wake up early and do it then before the day starts. It all sounds cumbersome and it can be but if you want safe, visible results, it is what must be done. I am a strong supporter of safe lifting for us because the quality of life that we have in our default physiques is not usually very high. And the comments about accepting yourself only goes so far in the real world where people shatter that confidence regularly. The tools are there - they are just tiring but worth it. I lifted 3lb weights; my doctor says to try your best to not lift anything over 10lbs... They messed me up haha.\n\nI might try when I am a bit older, maybe while going to college, for the time being I am focusing on the academic side of things, such as finishing high school, tinkering, learning to drive.\n\nI thank you for the lengthy post though, means a lot! Haha awesome, do your thing, all you have is time around those ages. You are most welcome Actually, I think I got some asking \"How do you stay so *thin*?\" . . . like I was hiding some great diet secret.   Even my Mother was, \"He must have a hollow leg.\"   After many years have managed to gain a few pounds, but still far from bulky. I get told \u201cyou need to eat your ribs are sticking out\u201d or get called Jack Skellington... I eat A LOT, but I stay at 130-135lbs.\n\nOn the bright-side I will probably never be \u201cfat\u201d or obese haha Please do not worry about needing to bulk up to be attractive to women. PLENTY of women are attracted to tall, skinny men and not into the whole stocky, neckless, bulging vein bodybuilder thing. Sincerely, -A Woman I definitely had the same frustrations about body image at your age.  It really deterred me from pursuing the ladies. As I got older I came to the realization that society has set this general standard of male attractiveness. I am currently 35 and have been in a relationship with a real beauty for about 5 years.  I seriously look at her and wonder how I landed such a cutie.  She much prefers the skinny gaunt look to the buff dude.  She is kind of punk rock so shes into the glam rocker types.  She gives me confidence to take my shirt off at the beach and look at myself in the mirror and like how I look.  Also, I found that I filled out a bit naturally as I got older.  Main takeaway, do not let your body image discourage you from dating.  It did for me and I regret it.  You do not want a girlfriend who is obsessed with a Grecian god physique, they are not any fun, and you will never live up to that standard. Woman \u2122  Not a guy, but still feel shitty i cant gain much muscle. Whole life people point out n comment on \"how skinny i am\" etc. Over the years its bothered me less but still feel down about it now and then. Skinny lady here.\nMe relating: I get told to do squats and all kind of garbage by men. (Including my long term boyfriend!). I hate squats! Fuck squats! My knees are not going to do it. \nKnow. Your overall physique WILL NOT CHANGE. Do not follow gym people on social media. \n\nI have made peice with my body through flexibility training. I was not able 5o touch my toes but classes  youtube and PT have helped me feel healthy \n\nSure, it is not \"macho\" but it will be attractive to a health conscious woman.\nPro tip:  I live in a place where cannabis is legal. I like to take a weed gummy and put on music and stretch my muscles. Say nice things to my body.  im 24m w marfan, and have done bodybuilding for 3 years in the past. im 6'1'' and was around 158lbs, i was able to bulk up and increase my muscles mass very very noticeably, my biceps grew from 34cm to 37cm and I was not even doing my best. At age 21 i was  almost 200lbs and it was the peak of my body. i was really strong and finally felt like i could face anyonep physically. now after a few years i had to starve and lost all my muscle mass. i did gain fat tissue back though. needless to say that i did had to go through alot of pain, both in joins, asthma related to fatigue and high blood pressure, but its worth it imo", "Found out about having marfan a few months ago and my life is turned upside down I am in my 20's and few months ago I had a chest pain and decided to go visit a cardiologist recommended by my family doctor.He took a few tests mainly ECG and 2d echo.The report came and i was diagnosed with Mitral valve prolapse.I do not have any typical marfan features like flat feet, scoliosis,near sightedness but i am extremely skinny so he told to do the hand sign and wrist sign both were positive.I am on beta blockers for the past few months and i have to take them till I die and was told to not to strain my body.In my school days i was quite athletic and participated in many sports and i still play in weekends.After finding out that i cannot do certain things normal people can do,i was quite depressed and i cannot share it with anyone since no one in my family has this disorder or have knowledge about this condition.There is so many fun things i cannot do due to this condition.I found this reddit after just typing marfan and this is the only place where I can vent. Hey there - like you, I found out about my disorder (Loeys Dietz) in my later 20s. Also like you, no one else in my family has the disorder, so I was alone in this experience. It was tough to come to terms with when I was diagnosed. I have always been tall and slim and I felt lucky to have the body type I did. It was tough to realize that I was not necessarily lucky to have this body type, but it was actually the result of an unfortunate genetic disorder that would force me to live life differently forever. And then I was told I would need open-heart surgery in a few months to replace the aortic root. It was all a whirlwind and I felt lost.\n\nLong story short - it gets better. I hope you surround yourself with friends and family who care about you. One thing that helps is to explain it all to them, to everyone. That way they understand what the disorder is what you are going through.\n\nYou can find ways to stay active. I hike more, bike more, but like you, I had to stop high intensity workouts and stop playing sports. Just listen to your body - you will know when you are pushing yourself too hard.\n\nWishing you the best. Reach out if you have any questions! Share it with your family and close friends. The people that love you will be there for you. You may need to help educate them. Things are easier to deal with the right support. I have a friend who is in the medical field and he is the only one I have talked to.I will wait to tell others after graduation,I do not want to ruin the last few months of our college life with sad news.Hopefully it does not get worse on my next visit to the cardiologist. Glad you found us. I know how you feel, and it is tough, but let me give you a little bit of perspective which will hopefully help. I have said this elsewhere, but I will risk repeating myself. You have always had this. You were born with it. The only thing different now is that you know about it, and that is an incredibly empowering thing. Because now you can protect yourself. It is hard coming to terms with not being able to do the things you used to. But as any aging person will tell you, that is a natural part of life, and if it was not now that you were dealing with it, it would be at some point. In fact, in many ways, Marfan Syndrome can be a 'get out of jail free' card, and the amount of things you cannot do pales in comparison to the amount of things you can. You will not miss them once you find that thing you love. I used to work in Hollywood and were it not for Marfan Syndrome I may never have discovered computer science. It is SO MUCH better of a fit for me. No matter what, I promise that you will quickly adjust to the knowledge. And to echo someone else, definitely tell your loved ones. Having that love and support is important no matter what you are dealing with. And you have it from us, too. Glad you are here. Thanks for the advice,I do not know what future holds but reading some of the posts here have helped me to come to terms with the reality that I cannot live my life like how I used to. I am going to echo what /u/EvilSchwin did, but want to emphasize:  you have always had this.  You are more \"normal\" (whatever that means) than not, there is just some things to watch out for.  Real talk upfront: you will likely endure just about as many years on this planet as anyone else.  Even in the event that you may (eventually) need surgery, they have insanely good outcomes doing the same surgeries on very old people.  It is scary to think about but the numbers are quite good.\n\nThere are some limitations you will have to be aware of, but you are by no means a shut in.  One of the \"skills\" you learn with a chronic condition is reading between the lines.  There are rules the doc will give you, for good reason, but you will find a lot of us \"cheat\" a bit.\n\nYou cannot weight lift.  You should not join any contact sport teams.  Pickup game of basketball with friends?  OK.  Flag football?  Probably every once and a while fine.  I used to climb in regional competitions, I currently ride a dual sport motorcycle that I haul through mud and rivers.  This is not medical advice: everyones case is different, but you have ultimate say and you should ask around.\n\nI get the impression you are in the USA, I strongly recommend looking into the mentor program through the national marfan foundation.  It can be a bit awkward at first, but it is worth putting in the time to develop the relationship.  It can really help you keep perspective.\n\nI have said it before and I am sure I will say it again:  Marf is a lot of \"hurry up and wait\".  There are some big things to watch out for, some day to day that can be annoying, and you will learn more about managing doctors and insurance than you ever wanted to know.\n\nEnjoy your last semester.  You likely still get to do all the stupid shit that is not healthy for anyone period.  Just watch for recreational substances that affect heart rate (cocaine is a hard no).  Be aware that pot is a vasodialtor and in conjunction with your beta-blockers may hit you harder; do not drive or partake anywhere other than home (I have had stuff literally drop my BP to the point where I lost vision if I did not eat/drink enough that day).\n\nFinally, re: you are upcoming cardio appt.  With an initial diagnosis, they will be running a lot of tests.  The thing is, they know what the problem signs are, so they check them.  This means a lot of routine monitoring, which can be a nerve wracking non-event (again, hurry up and wait).\n\nThe silver lining to all of this is that these are life skills everyone needs.  By the time you are pushing 30, most of your friends will have some kind of medical something or other they are dealing with.  By about 25 or so being the kind of partner that has managed this kind of thing is actually a huge plus in the dating pool.\n\nIt is a lot to take in, and managing healthcare while you are adapting to the next chapter of your life is stressful, but you got this.  Take your pills, see your doc, come vent here as needed.\n\nHell, you have done great so far and you only just found out... Is your friend your age?  Be warned new docs can be like the walking version of WebMD (\"Headache?  Possibly cancer\") haha.  It is an **excellent** resource to better understand things just remember to breathe.", "Aortic Disease caused by Nitric Oxide over activation. ", "Do I have a form of Marfan Syndrome? Probably unlikely, but want to make sure. Recently visited the ER due to some chest pain and other symptoms symptoms, and they suggested I may have MFS.

However, I do have pectus excavatum, am very slim, have abnormally long arms, and some difficulty in my eyes as of lately.

My parents are 5\u20197\u201d or so and I have noticed that I have been getting pretty tall as of lately, and have grown a couple inches.

Even so, it was reassuring to get an ultrasound of my heart and aorta to show they were OK.

How do you guys deal with this?

I checked my aorta when I was 18, the diameter was 36 mm. That was fine, my doctor said. Anyway, that is 3 years ago now. I moved to a different country and did not think so much about it. Because I do not have an actual diagnosis, just some unspecied connective tissue disease because my aorta, eyes and lungs are fine. Now I am in the system in the new country and I will check it again next week. They have also already sent a blood test to check my DNA. Okay, where am I heading with this... I wonder if it is physically possible with a couple of mm change in three years. I like to think that my heart will stay \u201cnormal\u201d my whole life, but the doctors where I now live are a lot more realistic than in my home country. So did anyone in here have perfectly fine measurements up to their teens (or older), and did it change later in life?  Until recently Marfans had a life expectancy of mid 30s, mostly because of recent advances in heart surgery. I suspect most people were okay until a few years before that. Most likely you are fine. You think those who died in mid 30s had perfectly fine aorta, with no sign of enlargement, until only a few years before that? I know that is basically what you wrote, I just always thought it could be enlarged for many many years. I am just really curious about what is possible and not when it comes to \u201cspeed\u201d of the enlarging of the aorta.  Thanks for your reply.   As far as I know the growth is fairly slow when it occurs so if you were fine a few years back and young I do not expect you will be in life threatening danger at this point. Other than that I am not sure about the speed of the enlarging. My girlfriend is 21 and has Marfans but, no signs of enlargement yet so it varies from person to person. Wish I could help more. I also do not think I would be in danger at this point, but kind of a bummer if I find out it is at an early stage of aneurysm and I was not that lucky after all. We will see. Thanks for your help, you saying the growth is fairly slow is what I needed to hear.  just get tested and keep monitoring it,  not sure where you live but the advancements in modern medicine are awesome and as long as the doctors catch it early they can fix it with out open heart surgery.   Thanks, I did not know about that. Sounds great. I live in the Netherlands, I think they should be up to date.  I did not have my surgery (or diagnosis) until I was 38! I had an echocardiogram when I was about 32 (for unrelated reasons) and there was a little something on my aorta, but nothing to worry about. They did not even mention it to me. But my surgeon used to to compare with the recent echo. It was about 5 centimeters when I had my surgery, so it took about 6 years to reach a critical size.  Mine went bad when I was 20. Within six months of an okay echo it was bad and I required surgery, in 1994, with a mechanical valve. It was \\~5cm a couple of months before surgery and \\~8cm the day before. I am surprised I did not have a dissection.\n\nMy dad did not need surgery until he was about 50 and he died about ten years later in 2006 of a massive heart attack. He had the David procedure by, I believe, Dr. David himself. Short answer, yes, mine changed later in life but I had a definite diagnosis as well as a family history.  Would recommend clarifying the diagnosis first as Marfan's issues may not even be relevant to your situation.  \n\nI was diagnosed with Marfan's at 6, no cardiac involvement. For unknown reasons, my cardiac status was never monitored until I needed clearance for a non-Marfan's related procedure at 38 yo. I was diagnosed with a mild aortic aneurysm which remained stable for years.  This changed relatively quickly (over a period of 1-2 years) and I had to have surgery c. 52 yo. \n\nWhat I have learned is that Marfan's is dynamic - things change as you age, just like all the rest of your body.  But you are not even sure you have it, so I would pursue that first.  Also, please know that even if you are diagnosed with Marfan's, it does not mean you will have cardiac involvement - several of my family members also have Marfan's but do not have cardiac issues so it is not inevitable.   Your doctor will be the best person to advise you. Good luck! I hope your DNA blood test comes back with good news.   Thank you so much. I would love to think all my strangeness is unrelated to Marfan\u2019s, but I am really not satisfied by the work they did in Norway. At least they found a mutation, so they checked my heart every year to make sure. It would be incredibly sad if I get kids in the future that indeed will \u201cqualify\u201d for Marfan\u2019s. If I then knew I had Marfan\u2019s I would not get pregnant the regular way. Really hope they will answer all my questions in my new country :-) but genetics can be complicated I understand..  Thanks for your reply. I am sorry to hear about your dad.  Interesting, thanks for your reply.  I did not have insurance until I was 27, so that is when I was diagnosed with my 4.7cm. I suppose if I was checked earlier I probably would have been diagnosed, so it probably does not count. \n\nIt has not grown since, though (now 32), so that is snazzy. I am able to hold off on surgery because my aorta *is not* growing, so I can focus on the fact that my dural ectasia is pulling out my brain.  Thanks for your reply. I am really sorry to hear about your dural ectasia. Must be horrible.  Mardan syndrome? Do not know yet. Hopefully not, but it is the only thing that would explain why I am this tall. As the females of my family are 5\u20198\u201d, the males 6\u20190\u201d - 6\u20191\u201d and I am 6\u20192\u201d.  This has got me researching into the matter. I cannot seem to find the 'normal range' for Aortic Root Diameter anywhere, all I am able to pull up is that it varies with age, height, and gender, and that the critical point requiring surgery is 5 cm. I am thinking of having an echo done since I have been suspecting Marfans for a while now but I am not sure how to evaluate the measurements. Yeah, this is really confusing me as well. I know now that my aorta is measured from 34-36 mm depending on the doctor, and they tell me it is normal. I do not understand what they mean with that considering internet sometimes says normal is under 3 mm. Guess it is because I am tall then. \n\nSince I do not have many symptoms apart from my height, my arm span length helped me score some extra points. Do you also have much longer arm span than body length? 3 mm?! No way, that is just physiologically impossible. You might find this ( useful, it should give you a better idea about the whole matter...I just cannot seem to figure out how the graphs with the grey rectangles work! &gt;.&gt;\n\nHow long is your arm span length compared to your height? I am 6'7\" and my arm span is like 6'9\" , what is that considered? I am guessing the 'leakage in one of the valves' you are referring to is mitral valve prolapse? Because I have that as well. Also ( is a very neat scoring system that may help you. I meant cm of course, lmao. My arm span is a bit more than 6\u20195\u201d and I am 6\u20192\u201d. I am 188 cm and my arm span is 197 cm. Insane I know. I think my doctor added on half a cm just so I could score on that, so you really need to have extremely long arms to score. I already got the diagnosis some weeks ago thanks to my DNA test. In centimeters I am 201 in height and 207 in arm span, do you know what the threshold is? I cannot seem to find it anywhere, I have read around that your arm span could be different from your height, give or take 2 inches (5 centimeters) or so. I dunno.\n\n\n&gt; Cause I barely qualified using the scoring system, which was really annoying considering I know what I look like is not a result of my family.\n\nSo do you mean that whatever physical features you have that may be inherited, should not count towards the systemic score? Because almost all my features could be attributed to either parent. I do not however have any positive family history of Marfans. Sorry, I do not know. Probably could find it if I googled. \n\nYes I mean that. Unless your parents also have Marfan. If my parents looked like me I would never think anything was wrong to begin with to be honest. I do not look like any of my parents, and the things I did score on were definitely stuff they do not have. Like long fingers, flat feet etc. My mom is 5\u20198\u201d and my dad is 6\u201d. No one in my family has Marfans. It is funny because the features I have got from each parent, put together, is very indicative of Marfans, but none of them have the 'full package' on their own so to speak, only I do. \n\nThat would be a very important caveat for the whole scoring system if true, are you certain about it?. No, I am not certain. I just think the chance of you having this spontaneous mutation, when the symptoms you have are inherited from your parents, is very small. It could be one of your parents have it too. I would also still try and find out, specially since you also have the leakage stuff that I do not remember the name of. ( a good test, would you mind telling me how high you scored? Here is the thing, I have a positive wrist and thumb sign on one hand, not the other, so I am not sure how to calculate that. Also I am not sure I can quite tell if I have just flat feet or Hindfoot...\n\nIf I were to give myself a 1 for the wrist and thumb, just for the sake of argument. And at least 1 for flat feet. I would have a 7 total score.", "Ah yes, from 38bpm to 180bpm in the same day while doing *nothing.* Here is a few snapshots of that week.

Just been thinking and I realized given our very similar body builds(tall/skinny) it could work out quite well relationship wise if people with Marfan's dated other people with Marfan's. thoughts? :) Allow me to be a counterpoint. I actually did date someone with marfan syndrome before I met my wife. I enjoyed the relationship while it lasted; it did not work out, though. The reason was that as I got to know her I did not feel like she was the right person for me. We looked at life differently, so I broke it off. I was fine with how she looked, but honestly that is not what attracts people. It might get someone is attention, but in the end it is who you are that attracts people. So no, there is no reason a relationship between two people with marfan syndrome would work out any better than not.\n\nHell, if anything you are just putting life on hard mode, building a life with 2 people with a crapton of medical bills. Just one is enough. American? You guys need a proper healthcare system to replace your current protection racket. My wife would disapprove. \n\nAside from that, I would like more kids, and 2 marf parents seems like a bad bet. I agree with your point! I would like to date someone with Marfans if I ever meet someone who has Marfans and is compatible with me. I think having marfans will just make them more compatible with me. I was once told by a doctor that having a child with 2 marfans parents would not work, that the embryo wont survive or something..... Was long time ago. But then again i dont know if i want children so i would be fine with it..... Yeah exactly the same here. I just do not know anyone else with Marfan's basically. How tall are you BTW? Well for starters, not everyone with Marfan's is tall and skinny. I am only a couple inches over average and overweight. I have often wished I had the \"typical\" model thin physique, because for many years I thought that would make guys like me, or doctors take me more seriously. \n\nThat said, it would not bother me to date someone with Marfan's. It is not a deciding factor for me. I am not that tall. Just 5ft8in. haha i agree! America healthcare sucks", "Concerned about a friend - and about getting any UK doctor to pay attention Hi, so basically (apologies for this post being the same as a lot of others) I think I know someone who has some kind of connective tissue disorder, particularly one that sounds a lot like Marfans. He has:\n\nVery soft, stretchy skin. He can pull the skin on his face outward really far compared to a normal person. The skin on the soles of his feet is also ridiculously smooth, yet he walks around bare foot a lot.\n\nHypermobile joints. His whole family are prone to it, apparently. He can get both legs behind his head without any discomfort at all, aged 22. His joints also click a lot - fingers, jaw, feet etc.\n\nTall, skinny with long limbs (not sure if they are long compared to his height - would have to measure).\nA protruding sternum. It kind of pokes out on one side.\n\nEye problems. He is short-sighted, and has had some kind of odd lens problem from birth - I cannot remember exactly what it is, but I know that the doctors said it was unusual. Something to do with veins in the eye. His whole family have glaucoma and eye sight problems.\n\nStretch marks on his back, hips and shoulders. He says this was from when he was chubby as a teenager, but I do not see how simply being chubby would give you fat shoulders. They have now faded.\n\nHe has also had random chest pains for years every now and then, and has high blood pressure. His teeth and back seem normal. Rather than having flat feet he also has very high arches. He is never had any medical problems as far as I am aware - just these physical traits.\n\nThe problem is that a UK GP will take one look at him asking questions about this and not take it seriously, at least not where we live. They will just think he is worrying too much, especially as he has no known relatives with the syndrome (though he never met his dad) and the tests for it are inconclusive and expensive in some cases. This concerns me due to his occasional chest pains. If it were not for this problem I would not be posting for a second opinion.\n\nThanks for any help/tips.", "Anybody feel ugly because of their marfans? I am super skinny and feel inferior. This is going to sound like some cliche bullshit, but it is honestly true: No one is going to love you until you love yourself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYour post made me curious so I took a peak through your history. You seem like a good person, but you also seem to be way too harsh on yourself. I get not liking the way you look. But, I once heard something that made a lot of sense: You are probably not your type. But I swear to you, if you find a way to be, not just comfortable, but happy with yourself, someone else will, too. As a male, people want to date me all the time, but it is not women. Sure, when I was young and could not get a date I thought it must be because I was scrawny and ugly. \n\nI was wrong.  The reasons I could not get dates were: too shy too flirt, too naive too realise when girls were flirting with me, and a lot of time spent awkwardly brooding. I arguably became less physically attractive in my 20s when I went bald, however I had much better luck dating.  \n\nMy advice is first ditch any forever alone/incel type forums you frequent.  By definition, no one there has advice on building good relationships. Then focus on getting out and having fun.  Do not worry about flirting with women, just chat with both men and women about things you are interested in.  Listen, ask questions, listen to the answers.  Being  able to hold a conversation goes a long way.  \n\nYou are young, you are not Forever Alone.  You are just Alone So Far. Good advice right there. You really should skip those forever alone/incel places, it is full of negativity and self-pity, which will only keep you down. Go out, meet people, try and be happy. Your worth as a person is unrelated to your relationship status. I agree with others posters - you HAVE to ditch the forever alone/incel nonsense, man. Would YOU want to date someone with such a flagrant absence of self worth? You seem to be stuck in a loop of self hate, which always becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.\n\nTime to change something up. Yes; I have had some romantic interest from people and that is people I was shocked to find want to have sex with me; I was slightly less willing, I have hard time performing because I usually get very anxious about how I look and so on You can either...\n\nA: Blame your problems on your looks, wallow in self-pity, and definitely not get laid.\n\nor\n\nB: Work on what you can improve, build your confidence and charisma, and maybe (almost definitely) get laid.\n\nSource: Tall, lanky, barely average-looking dude who can get laid fairly easily. I hate my hands and wrists more than anything. I have been hiding them under long sleeves for my whole life even in the summer It is up and down for me. My face actually looks decent, but I have that Marfan body. 6'6 and 175 pounds. Also, acording to my surgeon who has done pectus for 35 years and has a surgery Method named after him, I had the worst pectus he is ever seen. A gigantic, asymetric mess with 0.8 cm or a third of an inch between sternum and spine. That thing was huge psychological burden... I did not go to a swimming pool or the beach throughout puberty and akaways wore baggy stuff, because with anything too tight my absurdly big rib Flair was visible.\nIve had surgery 4 times now, and my chest is still caved in a bit, but it looks soo much better now... Like a case of very mild pectus. What Is also cool is that my scars are healing very well and are bsreky visible after 2 years. Shoutout to my skin.\n\nI still struggle with my weight though. Bones sticking out, being able to count ribs, crap like that.\nAfter I got rejected by a girl I fell in love with, I could not help but started lifting. I know I should't, but I just had to do SOMETHING. Taking Charge of my destiny. Also, I am so tired of looking the way  I Look I just do not care anymore.\nI know it is not 'good' for me, but I also Drink and smoke weed and my Aorta has been stable for years... My dad has Marfans (was diagnosed at age 37 when I was born) and he drank and worked out until he was diagnosed. He even worked in construction 2 Summers, and was lean and athletic, but never skinny af.

I feel ugly and unlovable!", "Instead of the negatives of Marfans, What are some of the positives? ", "Could I have Marfans? ", "Should I be worried? Recently I had some random pain on the left side of my chest and went to see my GP and because I have some symptoms of the Marfan syndrome. My GP send me to the hospital to make some X-ray photos of my heart and it all looked normal. Said the pains could come from the connection from a rib and my sternum? Thing is, this is a couple of months ago now and I still get those random chest pain on the left of my chest.\n\nI am a little bit worried that despite it not being visible on the X-ray I have Marfan syndrome. I am very tall 6'6 almost 6'7, 165 lbs, nearsighted, can easily do both of the hand tests and had crowded teeth (fixed now). But besides that I am not hypermobile, do not have stretch marks, do not have Pectus Carinatum Deformity, my chest is symmetric and never had a pneumothorax. \n\nBecause I already went to my GP once and he said I do not have Marfans because the X-ray did not show any signs I cannot go to him and ask about it. But I do not really think the X-ray alone can exclude that I have Marfans? Should I be worried?\n For what it is worth, I also thought I was not hyper mobile until I realized I was confusing it with flexibility. I would have said I was not hyper mobile a few months ago- ends up I am.  I also thought I did not have any pectus deformities because all the photos I saw online showed issues in the same center chest area, I did not know my ribs sticking out in my upper chest was a different version of the same thing lol.  So really just research as much as you possibly can, make sure you really have a full grasp on all the different characteristics and after doing that you may become more confident in either not having it or going to see a specialist.

Been diagnosed since I was 3 and am 19 Sunday  You cannot be diagnosed or rules out on an xray alone. Is your height normal for your family? Which hand tests do you mean?

", "Diagnosis changed, looking for community or similar case. 12 years ago I was diagnosed with Marfans, at the time I guess that is what most people with my symptoms were told they had.  I recently had children and was re-referred to genetics and now I have been diagnosed, more appropriately I guess, with a relatively new syndrome (discovered/classified/whatever 2010 I believe), Loeys-Dietz Syndrome.  It has some of the same symptoms, but has a few additional problems it puts on the body.   \n\nHas anyone else had a diagnosis change from Marfans to LDS in the past few years?  And if they have, is there an online community for questions, conversation or support?\n\nI guess just as a final note, if anyone has not seen their specialists since 2010, you may want to look into some of the differences of LDS vs. Marfans and schedule a conversation with your doctor if you have concerns.", "New to this and at a loss for words. I am not really sure what I am feeling right now. Stress, anger, fear, or some combination of them all. I just found out my daughter (3yo) has Marfan syndrome, as confirmed by a genetic test, and that I have a 5 cm dilated aorta after being told my whole life I was not Marfan positive despite the suspicion brought on by ectopia lentis, flat feet, long arms, legs, fingers and toes. I found this out in the same phone call after work. In fact recently I bought a bunch of weights and an Olympic bench because the cardiologist said I was fine. \nBelieve it or not, I am much more worried about my daughter. I do not know what kinds of things to look for, such as chest pain, etc, and I do not want to not be able to walk her down the aisle because one of us is dead. \n\nAm I right to be this overwhelmed and worried? Am I overreacting? I have lived my whole life knowing it was a possibility, and since my little girl started squinting while getting read to, I have had my suspicions. Does uncertainty concern anyone here? Does anyone have a kid who has Marfan syndrome? What should I really be worried about. Sorry for the rant, just needed to vent.  It is normal to feel overwhelmed and worried.  Is it right?  Not really, in my opinion.  You are definitely overreacting here, which again, is totally normal for someone in your position.  You will start to see this once you have some more time to digest things.\n\nYou and your daughter are going to be fine.  Neither of you is going to die, because you know about your condition.  That is a good thing.  People who receive monitoring and treatment for Marfan have a normal lifespan.  The marvels of modern medicine!\n\nNow you should go about trying get educated.  Meet with your cardiologist to discuss the health of both your daughter and yourself.  If you do not trust your cardiologist, find one who you do trust.  Maybe even consider looking to finding one who specializes in Marfan patients- I know there are some out there.  Contact The Marfan Foundation with any questions you may have- they are a great resource.\n\nAs far as what you should be worried about, people with Marfan generally need to have checkups with a cardiologist on *at least* an annual basis.  In these checkups they measure your aorta using an echocardiogram.  If yours is truly 5cm, that is close to the threshold for elective surgery.  I would talk to your cardiologist about that immediately.  If you do need surgery, do not be scared- it is extremely safe when done electively, with essentially zero mortality or serious morbidity.\n\nYou will also need to talk to your cardiologist about restrictions; people with Marfan generally have to dial back on exercise and especially weightlifting, at least until they get their aorta fixed.  Your cardiologist may also give you some sort of medicine to slow the enlargement of your aorta, delaying possible surgical intervention.\n\nBut one thing not to do is panic.  Again, Marfan is entirely treatable through modern medicine.  Lifestyle changes, monitoring, medication, and surgery all help Marfs to live *normal lifespans*.  I think that is a key point- because you know about the condition and can address it, it *will not* cut your life short.  Just talk to your doctor and figure out the best plan of attack for both you and your daughter.  It is going to be fine.  \n\nIt feels like a huge deal when you first get diagnosed, but over time, you accept it and realize that it is by no means the end of the world. &gt;You and your daughter are going to be fine.  Neither of you is going to die, because you know about your condition.  \n\nWhile I agree with 99% of what you said, and 100% of the spirit of it, I am going to have to throw a dose of reality on this one. \n\nI was diagnosed with Marfans around 25 years ago, I am 40 now. Yes, with treatment, it is mostly livable, absolutely. \n\nBut I have had more surgeries than I have fingers, and I am running out of toes. I have come close to dying on more than one occasion for different reasons, it would have only required one thing to go differently. \n\nYou cannot assure someone they are going to be fine like that. I mean, 5cm? To my understanding and my cardiologist, that is not threshold. That is surgery, very serious surgery. I am at 4.5 myself, and terrified at the thought that open heart surgery has become inevitable. I was hoping to hold down the dilation enough that I never had to deal with that. Did not fall that way.\n\nSo, OP, yes, most of what he says is spot on. I am probably being pedantic by even saying this. I am just a realist. You will probably be okay, mostly. Your daughter will probably be okay, mostly. I just shy away from certainties because of my experiences. This is fair.  However, I will add that everyone is mileage will vary.  The condition is one of variable expression- everyone experiences different symptoms.  There are definitely people who is Marfan affects their quality of life and leads to many operations.  There are also others who experience only the heart problems and do not suffer from the orthopedic and other issues Marfan is linked to.  It is really a spectrum.  But in general, I believe you can have a long and fulfilling life even if you suffer from Marfan Absolutely. And like I said, I agreed 100% with the spirit of what you said. I was just being pedantic, because aspie lol. \n\nMy experience has not been *bad*, just surgery laden. I have learned the two can be separate things. My life does not suck, it is just been... eventful. Yeah, my cardiologist said 4 to 4.5 is the threshold for elective surgery (remember, a normal person's aorta is no bigger than 2cm), but it goes patient to patient. I am at 4.7cm, but since I have not grown for a few years my team considers the surgery (which the user you responded to said is \"safe\") to be more dangerous to my health than the aneurysm. Every surgery is serious, and anything dealing with the heart is a very big deal. \n\nI feel like this person is blowing so much smoke up OP's behind. No, OP should not panic, yes, it is possible to live a mostly okay life with Marfan, but seriously... a 5cm aneurysm is nothing to scoff at and people still die from this even when they are being monitored. OP needs to take this seriously.  Thank you. I was trying to be gentle about it, but yeah. There is a difference between encouragement and flagrantly false hope based on nothing. It really bothered me. 5cm is right around the threshold, the real determining factor is growth over time.  OP has a 3 year old daughter, so i am going to ballpark his/her age around ~28.  28 years and only growing to 5cm is pretty damn resilient, mine was &gt;5cm by the time I was 17.\n\nI am a realist too, and a bit pedantic as well ;) Well, I mean, if we want to get *really* pedantic, 30 seems kind of old for a 3 year old. While not saying it is the best decision, I know plenty of &lt;25 yo's with toddlers. So that would be bad growth ;) 30 is correct. I went through marine corps basic training and have been in a traumatic roll over vehicle accident, so all things considered, I have been incredibly lucky compared to many people. I am also 6 feet and 210 lbs.  I have a David procedure scheduled in September-the CT surgeon is out of the country until then, but it is something I am definitely taking seriously. I am on 2 BP meds and on disability from work and the most physically demanding thing I have done is pulled a few catfish out of the water. ", " Normal aorta and no eye problems. However, rheumatologist still cannot rule out Marfan.

She could not hear any whooshing at all, and me being the paranoid person that I am, I had her check several times in a quiet room. \n- My dad, who is 75, was diagnosed with an aortic aneurysm a few years ago, BUT he smoked for 60 years, and that is a fairly common complication in lifelong smokers. He does not have the Marfan's look at all, and has no other health issues or symptoms typically associated with the disorder. Joints are fine. Did not develop myopia until he was in his late 60's, etc. No family history of Marfan's or unexplained early deaths on his side. Aside from getting a tumor on his tongue from smoking, he has been healthy as a horse his entire life. \n\nNow for the complicating factors:\n\n- No joint problems or hypermobility whatsoever. I saw a bunch of flexibility tests for Marfan's online, and I cannot come close to doing any of them. If anything, my joints are inflexible. I would say my joint health is better than average for people of my age, and I have never experienced a single issue with them, which is somewhat unusual for someone who grew up playing tennis on hard courts every day for hours. \n- Aside from myopia, I have no other eye issues, which was verified by the eye surgeon who performed my lasik procedure several years ago. Vision has been stable for years. He did the retina test during his post op checkup. \n- Normal hand and foot size for my height, if not on the small end (size 11 feet). My 5'7\" wife has hands that are almost as big as mine, although her hands are pretty large for a woman of her height. \n- Cannot do either of the hand signs. Not even close on the thumb test. I read that 90% of people with Marfan's can do these, but I am not sure if that is accurate. \n- High arches and normal rear feet. \n- No family history of Marfan's or of anyone dying early or unexpectedly. \n- No heart issues or episodes that I am aware of. \n- In spite of having scoliosis, I do not deal with any back pain. \n- No stretch marks anywhere on my body. \n- No lung issues, ever. No shortness of breath or being winded by routine tasks. \n- No chronic pain anywhere in my body. \n- I have always been told my doctors that I am in excellent condition for my age, and will regularly go on intense road bike rides at near full exertion for several hours. There has never been any indication that there is a problem, and I can do things like this and recover quickly. I did a Spartan Super (10 mile mud run with obstacles) a few months ago with no issues, and several 100 mile rides over the last few years, just to provide a little more info about my physical conditioning. I hope this does not come off as bragging, but I do not know anyone in my circle of friends or acquaintances who is as physically active as I am. \n\nI have an identical twin brother with a similar build who also has scoliosis, but no chest abnormality. He has led a similarly active life, although not quite to the degree that I have, and has had no heart or joint issues either. He had a doctor mention Marfan's to him 10-15 years ago (again because of the tall, thin build and scoliosis), but he went to a cardiologist who performed an echo that showed no abnormalities, and who told him that he did not have Marfan's. He left it at that, and did not investigate the matter further. We are mirror twins, and his health history is similar to mine in just about every way. \n\nI am aware that these things can exist on a spectrum, but what are your thoughts? Would it be unusual for both of us to make it this far without any issues, considering how active we both are? I am a little bit of a worrier, so obviously when the doctor said those words, I was very concerned. I know you guys are not doctors, but you do have personal experience with this that is relevant, so I am curious to hear what you think.  \n\nBtw, between the two of us, we have four children, none of whom have any health issues that would raise suspicion of Marfan's.

Is it exclusively the hypermobility and length of the thumb that is tested? That is, if I by both force and manually (With my thumb muscles) cannot get past my ulnar border of my palm, the test is negative when I clutch my fingers?\n\nMy follow-up question is this: What if one can forcefully push aside your fingers while you are doing the sign, with your other hand? You basically shorten the span of your ulnar border as the little finger is pushed over more and more over the thumb. The thumb is still in the same position (maximally pushed into the palm). Although, isnt this \"cheating\" to achieve a positive sign? How much can you hamper with your body, as in manipulate it, without affecting the diagnosis? \n\nHere is a link to what I mean:  I wonder the same thing Idk, but it should be easy and without force. Yeah the second picture is with great force, as in manipulated with my other hand, pushing each finger more and more across the thumb. The thumb is pushed as far as it can in both pictures, hence no difference in position between the pictures. Borderline hurts in the picture where I have my fingers pushed aside. It should not hurt.\nI can do it without my other hand easily. When you do it, do you just push the thumb into the palm as much as you can, letting your other fingers just clutch the thumb without moving them sideways? No, i just push my thumb and pinky together, and put the others over my thumb.\n\n\n\nSort of like that. Again, no force at all or help from my other hand. Oh, wow! Okay, no I thought it was that you just push your thumb into your palm as much as you can and then let the other fingers rest upon the thumb! I do not clutch or hold my thumb at all. I see, thanks for your description, means alot Yeah... They can give a half point for this sign if it is very close, it is not an exact science. I see, its just odd that some state that it should be very easy and no forced action should be applied to these tests. Others state the opposite. Very confusing. Better off going to a doctor I suppose, rather than be anxious! I mean my fingers dont seem that long to me. Do they? It seems to be a hypermobility thing, rather than length. As far as I know, this test is specifically for the confirmation of very long fingers? Maybe I am wrong though My thumb looks exactly like yours, both the with and without force pics. I was scored as clearly negative, no thumb sign. When my sister and my daughters do it, it looks totally different, the thumb just flops effortlessly across the hand and sticks way out. It seems to be their joint at the base of the thumb, by the wrist, that has more mobility, so that the next knuckle lies in the middle of their palm. Okay, I see. It is SO not cool that there is so many mixed messages going on regarding the criterias that need to be fulfilled both on and off the internet. Like, how do \"normal\" health care workers that are not specialized in rare diseases get informed on which sign is positive for a specific individual? Anyways, thanks for clearing this up (knowing that you have gotten a clear negative for the sign with similar \"properties\" of your hand as mine). I haved decided to visit a leg. Doctor which specializes in cardiac related stuff and see how that goes. Hopefully we thoroughly go through all the systematic scores and if I pass ill see if I can get myself heart-tests (EKG, Echo etc.). I dont know, no one in my family has it albeit putting together the properties of my parents, makes one a little worried but at the same time perhaps its just things Ive earned from them hahah.... Very very frustrating. (Tallness from mother side, paleness from both sides, visible veins from moms side, slightly smaller jaw from dads side, bendy fingers from moms side etc.).

Only recently have I been told about Marfan Sydrome, and I am getting genetic testing as I do not fit the diagnostic criteria yet (no cardiac symptoms atm). I am 21, and really think that this fatigue is impacting me pretty bad, especially with my uni studies. So, do you guys struggle with fatigue as well? even when you did not have aortic dissection or other heart problems present? I want to know if this is common, and how you guys deal with the fatigue if it effects you. I have recently been using energy drinks as a crutch to help with doing uni assignments, and am considering getting caffeine pills to help with the fatigue, with the downside being the occasional tachycardia occurring because of it.\nCheers guys, much love  My screening was,unimpressive. I was on the line, genetic testing took me over the line into a formal diagnosis. \n\nI also have an autoimmune, so I have attributed my fatigue to that. I have never heard that marfans can cause fatigue, but will look that. It would explain a lot. I allow myself small naps here and there. Exercise too (limited). I do drink caffeine but nothing crazy. What autoimmune?\n Yikes, been a while since I have been on Reddit! Huge apologies. Autoimmune urticaria... essentially, my body thinks it is being invaded by allergens, so it attacks itself with histamines.

Recovery is has honestly been great. I had an echocardiogram this past Friday. I had a follow up appointment and my rEF is still (30-35%). So it has stayed like this for quite a while. It is a bit discouraging that it did not improve, but hopefully things will get better. I had an on-x mechanical aortic valve along with the aortic root conduit implanted. Hey there fellow on-x valve haver! :) I have the same valve and root replacement.    \n\n\nI posted in another thread in this reddit but I have a ring made of the material and a tattoo of it too!   \n\n\nrepost of the same pic from an earlier thread:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n All the best chap! Hope your recovery goes well and take things easy. I had AVR in 2008 and have a St Jude's valve after the my first valve repairing op in 2005 went sour. The fact you have had it done is most definitely a good thing and it will be manageable moving forwards. One insight I will share with you from my experience is that post surgery during recovery my concentration was blown to bits. And whist I thought hoovering up all Amazon and eBay could offer would keep me occupied it was far from the truth. When I returned to work it took me ages to get back to focussing on things. And whilst this may/may not apply to you my surgeon told me that it is perfectly normal. All the best in your recovery. What is rEF? The only thing I could find is maybe something related to heart failure?\n\nI am about at 7 weeks post root replacement also. Kept my valve. I expected recovery to be much worse. They only did one followup appointment at 2 weeks post op. \n\nI have been in cardiac rehab for two weeks with one week to go. Its basically like sessions with a personal trainer. It is been helpful, I need to work on stuff like flexibility and upper body anyway. The guy has been great in terms of tailoring the exercises to my needs and what equipment I have access to. As well as making sure nothing is strenuous. I am hoping the exercises help with the new lower back pain I am having post-surgery. A week in the hospital bed did not do me any favors. rEF is reduced ejection fraction. Earlier this year I learned I had Marfan\u2019s and heart failure. My mom went down to 15 EF.

Her doctor told her she should not put too much stress on her heart because she has a higher chance of aortic dissection.\n\nI also read this article that says while on beta blockers someone with marfan syndrome should not let their heart rate exceed 100 bpm as its can put her at a higher risk.\n\nSo, I guess my question is what can she do as a low intensity exercise, but still get good exercise?", "I have marfan may be I just had 2 time spontaneous pneumothorax 1 month ago. And had to insert chest tube 2 time In one month. Doctors are saying I have marfan syndrome. But none of my family member have it.

I want to know does it feel pain during pleurodesis surgery? Do anyone have any experience? And what about heart surgery? Does it feel pain too. \nI am 21 years old. And I do not have any heart problems yet alhamdulillah. I am using reddit only because of it. So that I can connect people like me and know more about it. I cannot speak about pneumothorax (collapsed lung) because I have never had this.  \n\n\nIf doctors are saying you might have Marfan syndrome, they should definitely refer you to a geneticist for genetic testing. About 75% of Marfan cases are inherited, but 25% of cases may be spontaneous (new) mutations.\n\nFirst step, visit your family doctor/GP, ask to be referred to a geneticist who can test you for connective tissue disorders (including Marfan Syndrome)  \n\n\nSecond step, if you have not already, is ask your family doctor/GP to be referred to a cardiologist. The cardiologist will likely order an echocardiogram (an ultrasound of your heart) to measure the size of the aorta/aortic root.\n\nIf you are diagnosed with Marfan syndrome, you should ask the cardiologist if you should be taking any medications for it (ask them about -Sartans like Valsartan or Losartan, and ask them about Beta-Blockers). My father was the first one known in our family to have marfans and I inherited it from him. I have had heart surgery and it went better than my expectations but it hurt, any cough or sneeze was extremely painful. The doctor recommended hugging a pillow when I lay down and that was helpful advice. Your doctor should be referring you to a cardiologist asap for screening of your aorta. Left untreated an aneurism may occur and can dissect and be fatal. On medication and with regular check ups you will live a full life though. Thanks brother... I had diagnosed a echocardiogram. Doctor said that my heart is okay. All I am afraid of is surgery  is those surgery very painful? Thanks brother. Is there any possibilities that I have the syndrome but actually do not have the marfan? Cause none of my family member has it. You could have symptoms similar to Marfan's but not have it, that is a possibility.  There are other similar conditions to Marfan's, a genetic test will sort out which it could be.  Marfan's effects people differently, some may never need surgery while some unlucky few may need many. Symptoms vary widely, it can cause problems in different areas of the body such as eyes, heart, lungs and joints. \n\nThe important thing is you are being checked for it now. If the doctor says your echocardiogram looks good,  that is good news for you, as you probably will not need surgery on your heart anytime soon. I was 33 when I had heart surgery. My aortic root grew from 3.6cm to 5.2cm in just a few years so it is important to have regular echoes. Hope that answers your question. \n\nI wish you a speedy recovery with the lung surgery. I was in a really similar spot as you, had spontaneous pneumothorax, needed chest drains, and had something similar to pleurodesis myself, with a few extra steps. It was worth it. \n\nOf course it was painful, feels like your chest is burning the entire time as it settles from the surgery but i definitely would recommend the surgery. \n\nIf you are willing to go through the pain of recovery from the surgery (mine took about 2 months), then i say go for it. The pain will subside bit by bit, with each passing day. Take your pain meds according to your prescribed schedule, maintain the lung physiotherapy daily (most important step), and regain your daily function slowly by doing little activities like walking around the house or such. Whatever you do, good luck and i wish you find the answers to this confusing period in your life Did you feel pain during that pleurodesis surgery brother? Was it mild or unbearable? Thank you so much brother \ud83d\ude0a If your doctors said your heart is okay, I would not worry too much about heart surgery. Not every Marfans case results in heart issues. You should continue to get proactive echocardiograms, though. There are also a series of closely related syndromes, like Ehlers-Danlos and loeys-dietz. Marfans is often confused for Ehlers-Danlos, which iirc is more common (and iirc loeys-dietz is much less common.)

I had various orthotics as a kid, but today all they could offer was little in shoe things, I would have to go NHS to get anything more substantial. The podiatrist (who has personal experience of hypermobility disorders and also obviously extensive professional training) said that due to the severity of my functional deformities it is unlikely that anything would be able to fully correct that, all they could do was provide support where my ligaments cannot, but that ultimately it is unlikely that anything enough could be done to stop my joints and feet deteriorating. I have definitely felt noticeable deterioration in my joints in the lower half of my body over the last 9 months, and hearing that this may not be able to be fully corrected and may continue to get worse has made me worried for my future. I did not really know that Marfans was degenerative, I guess it makes sense in my case as I constantly put stress and injury on my feet at legs, but I just was not aware I guess. I do not know what this means for my future. Any adult Marfans who also grew up with extremely flat feet and generally very hypermobile joints, how has this progressed during your life? Does anyone use mobility aids or orthotics? I am one of three in my family to have Marfans but definitely the most severely affected, so I do not know anyone else in this situation.\n\nThanks, I just want to get an idea of what I am looking at or what people with a similar presentation to me have experienced as they get older. Similar story for me. Saw an orthopedist (again) last week, and to sum it up, surgery would be useless since my joints would just develop new issues a couple months later, as they cannot change the fact that the tissue itself is too stretchy. \n\nI am 30, and was always extremely hypermobile, but the joint pain began being a daily issue 7-8 years ago. Since then, it is only been getting worse, and there is not much I can do to fix it. I vape weed for the pain, as I do not want to get onto opiates, and that is pretty much it. I saw a physiotherapist and that helped for some of my shoulder issues, but other than doing some exercises to try and strengthen the muscles around your joints, there is not much to be done other than to learn to live with it.\n\nSadly, but understandably, most of the research around Marfan is focused on the heart issues, as it is the most life-threatening part of it. There is been some work done on pain and the psychological impacts of living with this syndrome, but it is still a relatively ignored and unknown part of the disease. Hi there, I am UK too so have to deal with the NHS. I have also had sudden deterioration too in the last few months and what they offered me was physiotherapy and custom done insoles to try and help with the pain which I got through referrals from my GP. Personally for shoes though I recommend a good pair of sturdy boots, they make me more stable and help cut down a bit with the pain which is brilliant when they are combined with the orthotics. Unfortunately I cannot say anything about getting older as I am the same age as you. I would also if at all possible discuss it with your rheumatologist at your next appointment (if you have one as a part of your checkups) as it is their job for things like this and can help more with finding the specific problem areas. I had inserts in my shoes when I was a kid for my flat feet but I was also in a back brace so my parents let me give them up. I have been fine with my feet overall. Yes, some shoes cause my feet to hurt but not good quality ones. They have to have some arch support but not too much basically. \n\nGet some good shoes and take care of them, basically. I have Red Wing boots which are great, plus Redback Chelsea boots. For sneakers I find Adidas works the best. Ya man it sucks but these are the cards we were dealt, I am 23 and in daily pain, spent years self medicating with opiates and heroin/fentanly but it actually made it worst towards the end dude to the way I would pass out or being on my feet stationary for hours on end in a daze\n\nMy mom has been on disability for like 12 years now since she turned 40 because of Marfans, I do not really know what I will be doing at that age since my orthopedic issues are more severe and I am much taller than her but I make the best with what I have, I am not actively using substances besides thc and kratom regularly.\n\nHonestly I just live my life and if I die from a aortic dissection tomorrow then so be it, I do not want to die but if I am meant to be here for 25 years or 80 years I would probably pick 25 since the later half of that will be spent in pain but I will let nature take me out, unless the climate crisis gets too fucking wild then I am just taking myself out on my terms when I see fit It is heart breaking to hear about the pain that many people with Marfan syndrome have to go through. There is a lot of diversity of people's signs and symptoms etc - for example I maybe have mild back pain from mild scoliosis and a lot of really stiff muscles - but I have never had any joint issues or joint pain, but I also do not have any hyper flexibility/stretchy skin. My feet are not perfect but they are not flat. I do still have the typical cardiovascular issue of having a dilated aortic root though and had dislocated lenses in my eyes.  \n\n\nI do hope that you are able to find relief from the pain and find ways and things you can do to at least help with certain issues.  \n\n\nI guess my recommendation would be to try and see another doctor to see if they recommend something for the pain, and hopefully you do not have to be prescribed any harsh opioids. Maybe ask about medical marijuana for pain, or even just CBD?   \n\n\nMaybe there are special shoes or socks or joint support coverings that you could wear which could at least help a little bit.   \n\n\nI personally take a trans-resveratrol supplement - although I do not think it would help with pain If you take note of your yearly measurements of your aortic root from your yearly echocardiograms, you will know the point where it will become life threatening. When you know the measurements and exact issues you will not have to think of your heart as a ticking time bomb that will just one day explode - the aneurysm grows over time and there will be plenty of warning signs for the cardiologist to see and they can intervene before anything disastrous happens.  \n\n\nWhile obviously Marfan syndrome is a genetic condition and there is nothing we can do to change our DNA - there are definitely medications that can help, and supplements that can help, and exercises and surgeries that can help. We can personally learn more about the disease, read other peoples experiences, see different and new doctors, try new things that these doctors recommend.  \n\n\nYou do not have to suffer mentally and physically every day - there is no magic cure but there is plenty of things we can do to better manage the pain and other issues. Sorry to interfere. \nMy 10 year old daughter has marfan syndrome. we discovered it last July. I read a lot to try to find if natural supplements might help her cardiovascular and skeletal health a bit. i am interested in your point of view, zyloman. I allow myself to leave you a private message if you do not mind so as not to pollute this post. I suppose everybody is different, my dad, sister and son has marfans, and I seemed to get the brunt of the physical problems before them and from a young age.  I was born with a club foot on one side, and an long flat foot which is a bit knackered on the ankle, and knees started dislocating at 8 year old.  Then I started having sciatica type pains in my hip at the groin and all through my childhood was spent going to physiotherapy either to try and strengthen the nearly non existent muscles in my legs etc, and shoe inserts which never work.  By the time I was 13 I would had 5 operations on my left foot, breaking bones and resetting them, cutting tendons etc, where as these days they bind them and it pretty much ends up normal, and I have always felt angry at the way that orthopaedic doctor butchered my foot, I do not blame my parents at all, they got told and thought they were doing the right thing and hoped it would make it better.  I am pretty certain all that surgery has accelerated everything else a lot quicker, for example, at 23 whilst I was pregnant with my second child, they told me I needed my left hip replaced as they were both bone on bone, I think it was called protrusio acetabulum but I hung on until I was 32 even though it was agony, but I was worried that being so young, I would have had to have more than average people do as to wearing them out faster.  I have had my knee done to stop it dislocating, had 3 more surgeries on foot, and now need another, then right foot doing to try and stabilise the ankle.  Heart wise, I have been on beta blockers since I was 23, and have a leaky mitral valve, and just these past few days, I have found out I have got left ventricular dilation and also an overactive thyroid!

LDS is VERY similar to marfans, thus posting here. (Also, no LDS sub...) \n\nAnyway. One of the most startling parts of my diagnosis was my aortic dilation. When I was first diagnosed, I was around 3.3 centimeters. That was around 4 and a half years ago. It grew for awhile, until it reached about 3.8 cm. It stayed that way for two years.

From there, healing has been FANTASTIC. All my nurses and doctors were very impressed with my recovery. \n\nThen this past Sunday, I had to return to the hospital due to chest pains. They found some fluid in my lungs and around my heart. Suddenly my great recovery was not so great.\n\nI was all cleared to go back for the fall semester, starting August 27. But now it seems it is better for me to hold off. I suppose it is better- my campus is a lot of uphill, a lot of walking. Walking around Walmart is even too much for me. \n\nBut my college is my home, my sorority is my family. It is a safe place for me, one I was counting on being in for the last 4-6 weeks of my recovery. \n\nMy dad just completely confirmed I will not be returning for the fall semester, and I am heartbroken. I am angry that this is happening to me, that I am sick in the first place, that I needed this stupid surgery. I am angry and upset and I just needed to rant/need some support. Also, maybe some other good reasons why staying home this semester will be good for healing, so I can reason this in my head. \n\ntl;dr: Surgery complications mean that my plans to return for the fall semester are now cancelled. Feeling shitty.  I feel bad for ya, friendo. You will do fine if you have survived this far. \n\nTry to do some online learning. It will be easier for stem subjects, if that is your interest. Find something creative related to your field and make some stuff to pass the time. that is really tough! can you try online classes? Maybe some of your sorority sisters can come and visit?  We with connective tissue disorders were just kind of born lucky, I guess.   But you do not have to lose the connections to those friends. \n\nIt is okay to be angry.   Life is unfair, and it is frustrating.   But holding on to that anger is no good for your health.   You are lucky to live in a time where your aortic problem could be found.  Where it is (hopefully) not going to kill you at such a young age.  There is a lot of life to look forward to, and taking it easy now means everything for your future.   Pamper yourself.   Relax.   Read.   Watch movies.  Write everything you are feeling.  Eventually everything will be okay, and this moment too shall pass.  This was incredibly comforting, thank you.  You are welcome :) &gt;  Some other good reasons why staying home this semester will be good \n\nThe rest of your life?\n\nThings could be worse.  I have two relatives that died during an aortic dissection.  Another relative also had a dissection and survived but the trauma caused by the dissection resulted in them becoming a paraplegic and they have lost the use of their legs along with other related disability complications that will be life long.\n\nAfter all that I had a surgery similar to yours and recovered.  It is unfortunate you are having some recovery setbacks but things could be much worse.\n\nFollow the advice in the other comments to get a jump on your studies and to keep in contact with your friends and sorority sisters.  \n\nAlso work with your doctors to maximize your recovery and get strong again.

I have never heard this. But as someone with Marfans and OCD that causes intrusive thoughts this scares me. \n\nOf course I am aware my intrusive thoughts are false but someone with schizophrenia thinks those thoughts are very real. I know this probably will not happen, but what if one day I act on these intrusive thoughts (things like wanting to hurt myself by jumping into traffic or thinking that everyone around me hates me). \n\nBut I have lived with ocd for a long time and have the tools to manage symptoms fairly well. I am going to do a little more research though. There is no family history of schizophrenia but I am also the only one in my family with Marfan Syndrome, so who knows. wow i also have OCD. i was diagnosed around the age of 14 and have been living with it since. No but I have heard an association between Marfan and Aspergers My brother and I also have OCD and I have noticed a tendency in many posters here toward disordered eating and pro-Ana (eating disorders are strongly related to OCD), but I cannot help but think this is correlation rather than causation. \n\nWe live very close with death and hurt, we are told to be cautious and mindful, such messages get drilled into our minds constantly... and there is a high loss of control in the lives of chronically ill people. It just kind of... makes sense to be at least prone to anxiety. There is higher than normal rate of schizophrenia with Marfan patients but it is still not common. There is also higher than normal rate of anxiety + depression in Marfan patients. I searched on Google Scholar and there seem to be quite a few case studies about it, maybe there is something more conclusive you can find, I just scrolled through the first page. No, but as someone else said, now that I think about it that is scary. Because I can get a little crazy sometimes. That makes so much sense My grandfather was schizophrenic and we think my uncle (her son) had marfans There is actually an extraordinarily rare disorder similar to Marfan syndrome called Lujan-Fryns syndrome which can cause mental health problems like schizophrenia.

The link appears to be dead", "How common is it not to have many outward physical signs of marfans? Okay so, my boyfriend is 6'4\" and has a slender build. Last night we are hanging out with my friend who works in medicine. My boyfriend mentions to her that one side of his chest is slightly bigger than the other, and she casually says, \"oh it is probably marfans.\" And then said she assumed he had marfans and knew, but this was the first time either of us even had heard of marfans. \n\nHe does not have long fingers, long hands, his feet are long for his height and neither are his arms. His mom and dad were not tall and we do not know of any family members he has with marfans. The only signs I have matched up to what I have searched is curved spin, being tall, crowded teeth, and having an aysymretic chest. \n\nI am a huge, massive, hypochondriac and now I am really freaking out about him having it. He is scheduling an appointment to get looked at and ask about it, but maybe those few things \n\nShould I be panicking? I keep reading about heart problems, people not knowing they have it, and all of that. Is having a few features that line up with marfans worth flipping out over? He is of course getting checked regardless, to be safe, but I feel so worried and am just looking for some first hand experience. First, try to relax about it. That is the first step to tracking down any potential medical issue.\n\nIf there is a concern that your boyfriend may have marfans, he should speak to a doctor about it and see if he can get a referral to a specialist such as a geneticist or a cardiologist, so that they can take a look at his cardiovascular system - just as a preventative measure. Yes that is definitely the plan! He is calling tomorrow to get a checkup since he is overdue, and from there request referrals. It is just jarring to be hanging out and have someone just casually mention your SO may have a scary genetic disorder, especially when you are a hypochondriac. I am try to get myself to relax though, I know panicking is pretty pointless.  \n\nBoth him and his sister are very tall and slender, but neither parent is tall, but I know marfans can arise spontaneously right? Sorry if any of this sounds uninformed I just found out about this last night.  No need to freak. Nowadays Marfans is treatable with proper medicine and checkups, and it is definitely not a death sentence incase your mind went to that first. \n\nIf his body is not too outwardly Marfans-y, then his symptoms hopefully should not be too bad assuming he does have it (not counting for any aortic growth tho). I am not a doctor so take my words with a grain of salt, but I have got a similar body structure to your BF and that is been my experience with Marfans. Overall tho I would say not to worry too much and instead focus that energy on getting in to see a specialist. I am trying to not get too worried, and focus on that. Do you have long arms, feet, and hands? He does not have any of that really he is just tall and slender, but I know outward symptoms seem to very a lot based on what I am reading and seeing. He is going to a doctor soon to try and get referrals for proper diagnosis. I would say I have long arms, but that is it. I am very tall and (usually) slender and my feet are normally sized but like you said, symptoms do vary. My mom has it and she is like 5\u20196\u201d so you cannot always go off these visual signs. The asymmetric chest is definitely noteworthy though - I have never seen it in anyone else besides myself, and if it is significant enough to notice then that could be a sign towards Marfans. But then again I am rarely checking out other people\u2019s chests so idk, it could be attributed to something else.\n\nGlad to see you all are going to get it checked out soon though - hope all goes well I never notice it unless he points it out, and he says no one has mentioned it unless he is wearing a very tight shirt so it would be something easy to miss on someone. Thank you, I hope it goes well too. Well, ok...do not freak out. There are many tall, slender people who do NOT have Marfan, just as there are many people with Marfan who do not fit the \u201cpicture.\u201d My son\u2019s chest is symmetrical and he only has very mild pectus excavatum. It is a syndrome, so there is widely varied expression. He is already scheduled an appointment with a pcp, so that is great. I also recommend a dilated eye exam because you do not need a referral for those, and lens ectopia is another hallmark of Marfan.  Also, Marfan is not a death sentence. Please do not freak out right now. Yes, many people with Marfan are spontaneous mutations...as in, neither parent has it/has passed it along. I will tell him to make sure to ask for that test. I am trying not to freak out. I am a huge worry wart so it is a struggle, I am just playing worst case scenarios in my head even after seeing the life expectancy is very good. He is 23 and never had any doctors suggest he has it, but I know it often goes unnoticed. Hey so, I am also a medical student\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSee, the marfanoid physical appearance is soo common in the population. Heck, there is a condition known as marfanoid habitus, in which the patient shows a looot of physical characterstics of marfan's but does not show the more detrimental effect (i.e aortic dilation).  So he just might just be typical skinny guy. In any case, if you are too worried about it, talk to him, and try getting an appointment with a cardiologist to get an echo.   \n\n\nEssentially, that is the most important screening test for someone with suspected marfan's, an Echocardiogram. Your friend may have been a little tongue in cheek, Marfan's and ehler danlos have become popular diagnoses in the alternative medicine communities.\n\nLike someone said earlier, even if he does have it, it is unlikely to really change his life much. Marfan's treatment has really gone leaps and bounds He is planning on getting a checkup and requesting a referral yo a cardiologist for an echo, I am just all panicky in the mean time, though reading this has calmed me down some.\n\nHe does not really have abnormally long hands or fingers, in my opinion his feet are normal for his height. We checked his wing span and his arms are like an inch longer than his height, so he is not really lanky. He does have crowded teeth, he is tall, he thinks a doctor mentioned a curve in his spine during an x-ray as a kid, and he has a slightly uneven chest as in one side sticks out a bit more than the other side if that makes sense, though when I looked at marfans it did not look like that it just looked like a caved in chest. \n\nHe does not have a family history of heart issue that he knows of, neither of his parents were tall, but he and his sister are both tall. Fingers crossed it is nothing and my friend was just seeing something that was not there. I know I am so abnormally worried, I have been a hypochondriac since I was a little kid, ugh. \ud83e\udd26 Sorry, I know this is from 90 days ago but I am browsing and stressing out about my little 13 year old (latest post). He has the tall, skinny body, the convex chest, and big feet. It is possible that this could be marnafoid habitus? Is this more common than Marfan Syndrome? He is getting tested very soon. Thank you Heey sorry for the slow response. Well, it could be, but what I meant in my comment is the physical features that resemble Marfans.   \n\n\nA spontaneous mutation to cause marfan is really rare, but also possible. However, the convex chest or pectus carinatum has been found in many studies that it has a high specificity for marfans, that is, a lot of people who have marfans present themselves with the convex chest. Which is why When you see this feature in a tall skinny person, you recommend getting them screened for marfans. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nbut convex chest can also be seen in the population as well. Do you, his other parent, or any family member have a convex chest? It couldve been inherited. \n\n  \nIn any case, the most important thing is that he gets screened for marfans.   \nAnother thing, a lot of people tend to forget that marfans is actually a spectrum disease. This means that some people have a very mild version of it where they inherit certain features but never develop other symptoms.", "left side chest pain Hi guys, posting this from a throwaway as i do not want to alarm some people who know my reddit account.\n\nSo i am a 19 year old guy suspected of having marfans syndrome no confirmed test yet i show a lot of the skeletal symptoms. However, recently a few times a week i feel a brief sharp pain in my left side of my chest just below my left nipple. Should i be concerned about this and for any that have had heart problems in the past, what did they feel like.\n\nI do have an echo-cardiogram scheduled for 2 weeks time. \n\nThanks If it were serious issue you would know it; you would not be casually posting on Reddit.  Just try to ignore it for now and see what the echo says Yea that is what I have been trying to do for a month now, just it is been getting more frequent  I know it is tough, try reminding yourself that worrying about it will not help, it is what it is and you will find out for sure in a couple weeks.   I have this exact same problem sometimes too. It just hurts to breath in. Might be 2 different issues. If it hurts to breathe in and hurts on the left as they described then it is most likely a lung issue. (I get similar sharp pains in that location from asthma)", "Mass Phenotype After being told my cousin had Marfan's and realising that pectus excavatum (which I knew already I have) is potentially a sign I was referred to a cardiologist and geneticist as per the standard procedure. \n\nAll cardiac results were thankfully good (although one cardiology letter I was copied into noted slight aortic dilation at 3.4cm which seems to be nothing to worry about) \n\nClinical genetics evaluation noted  a Ghent score of 4 with dolichostenomelia, a degree of thoracic scoliosis, pectus excavatum, mild ples planus,  positive thumb sign, stretchy skin. It also stated negative wrist sign however this confused me as I thought it was positive given my thumb fully covers the entire finger nail of my fifth finger. \n\nFBN1 screen was negative with \"no known causative mutation found\"\n\nI queried with the geneticist the positive wrist sign in a letter and questioned whether this would indicate MASS Phenotype as the Ghent score would be &gt;5 and Marfan.org seem to indicate this as a positive differential diagnosis when Ghent score is 5 or more. \n\nThe geneticist stated that MVP is key to MASS and as no MVP was detected I would not have MASS and therefore future periodic screening is not required. The MASS factsheet on marfan.org seemed to state that MVP \"may\" be present with MASS and that scans every few years are recommended although I appreciate I may be misreading this.\n\nAdditionally to confuse matters the clinic seemed to indicate that they had seen my maternal cousin however they have no record of a confirmed diagnosis of Marfan in my family, but due to data protection were unable to discuss my cousin's records. The family tell me this is not true and that he is 100% confirmed and his sibling had to be screened who was thankfully given the all clear. Unfortunately my cousin has fallen out with the family and is uncontactable for now to clarify things.\n\nI know most of this is good news but I am left with doubt in my mind, especially as my mother passed away at 26 and there was an inconclusive post mortem for cause of death and her father died from a heart attack and emphysema albeit older at 75 but I recall reading that lung conditions like this are linked to connective tissue disorders.  \n\nI do not know whether to just forget about the whole affair (I am 44 so would most likely have more symptoms by this age) or ask for medical records with a view to a potential second opinion just in case but I feel I wasted enough people's time already.

The facebook groups are pretty full of it, and i moved to reddit specifically to join this marfans group.  \n\nso i very much doubt that it is you, but maybe come back after you have a diagnosis from your cardiologist, and then we can go through the ups and downs of what its like to have this disease. i understand that. i have several illnesses and a rare disease that has affected me and disabled me since i was 12 years old. the same issues you mentioned come along with those and those communities as well. but it shouldnt be because of that, that it is okay to come at someone with hostility when they are just asking for help to prepare for a doctor appointment. \n\nthey saw my comments on another persons post, and then came to my post from that just to specifically say some condescending shit after they already did on my other comments. i have been diagnosed by my primary. but i understand with research that there is more to properly/officially diagnosis and that is what i am on to. \n\nand to say all that when i likely have marfan as well is fucked up. cause guess what? i have dealt with the exact same things you mentioned. so that person saw my comments, saw whatever else they wanted, and then came and judged and was hostile for no reason. \n\nsimply could have asked about my heart issues, i am diagnosed hypermobile, could have asked about my vision problems, family history, anything. i am really just tired of people being rude in small communities where it should be accepting, when i just try reaching out for help with things. i will come back when i get the \u2018official\u2019 diagnosis then and then what? i will be treated with respect?\n\nand sorry if i am being hostile myself now i am just annoyed about it forreal. they asked nothing, just judged. What are you on about? You need some anger managment buddy, calm down he was not hostile at all? You say you hate exams, well he is responding by you better get used to getting examined (Diseases or not pre-Marfan diagnosis). All he/she says in summary is: Go and get it checked out and be ready for some visits in plural. there is more to this than that one comment because they came from another post where i commented to mine just to say some condescending shit. it wasnt helpful what they said and did not answer my question. im not angry but good one lol. it is annoying to be asking for help and then have someone judge and assume things and act like you have not been through anything, or like you do not have what you have. oh and i saw your thumb sign question. that person believes you are faking it and trying to find something wrong that is not there. so lucky you did not get negative and rude comments on your post about it like the other post where that person commented It was negative haha.. well exactly then Your atittude was negative, that is what I am trying to say. For your sake change the way you commune with others. Its rather unpleasant. Have a nice day. lmao you did not even see the shit they said before this. and to not even know but speak on something is ignorant. maybe you should work on yourself and learn to gather info for understanding or just not say anything. you just wanted to add to it for drama. i would not say the shit i did or feel annoyed like i was for no reason. they were talking shit and being rude towards someone else and myself on another post, after judging and assuming things. so then they came to my post to say condescending things. \u2018if you have it\u2019 and not even asking anything, just judging. they are an ass but because i have somethin to say on it i am angry and this and that. pathetic af but ok My man, you need major help and all I just did for a minute straight was to pray that you come to understand your stinky attitude. Have a blessed life and may you live one hell of a happy life. act better than me all you want, but calling someone \u2018buddy\u2019 and saying they need anger management and trying to act like the person is crazy is all extremely fucked up or at least condescending which is all uncool. especially making mental health issues like that something to insult about. but yeah sit and act like you were trying to be chill and friendly, if that makes you feel better about yourself. i am also a female Your ability to make up a persona for someone is astounding. Female or not, I wish you all the best. I am taking you very seriously, and hence my advice for you is to seek help because you are angry. Very angry. And who knows, perhaps 2/3rds of your mental issues would be relieved simply by you seeking help for your major anger? ", "Is There Any Point Visiting A Doctor For Diagnosis If I Suspect I MIGHT Have Marfan Syndrome, Even If It is Not Affecting Me Negativley Right Now? I am 23f, And I just today stumbled across Marfans Syndrome on Google. \n\nI Somewhat surprised to find I have many of the key signs for it, as do a few of my family members. However, I am not really sure what I am supposed to do about it, if anything. I have Never experienced any of the negative affects, I do not have joint pain or vision problems. For that reason, I am not sure there is be be any point getting diagnosed when it is not affecting me, I feel I might be wasting the doctor's time.\n\nA bit if background, my Mum did once say to me in that we may have some genetic condition running through the family which causes long thin limbs as we all have. I Cannot remeber what the name she said was but I think it began with 'M', so maybe this is it.\n\nSo anyway, what should one do when they suspect they may have Marfan Syndrome? Go to a G.P. and ask him/her Live a good life, do not stress, get your heart checked if you are concerned or there is any history of congestive heart failure or dissection in your family. (Not a doctor) I take fish oil, multivitamin and coq10 for heart and cardiovascular health. See a cardiologist.  You likely will not feel any aneurysm-related symptoms until it is too late. I second this advice, i felt great up until the point I required heart surgery. If you suspect it, go see a doctor, they will want tests, get them. Better to know than die of something they could have fixed by age 25 not knowing. If you have it you need to protect your heart with meds ASAP. You also need to other things like checking your eyes on a regular basis. Thirded. You should regularly monitor your heart if nothing else. Im like your mom. One doctor suspected that I had Marfans and I did a heart ultrasound thing but they didnt find anything and that was 6 years ago. I never heard anything from the doctor since.  Im 19 now Correct answer. A cardiologist should send you for an echo to make sure your aorta is in good shape. It is worth looking into seeing a geneticist as well. There are other, lesser known syndromes that look like Marfan's (e.g. Loeys-Dietz) but have different treatment and surgical recommendations. Fourth.  There is a lot of other stuff, but heart is by far the most important. Makes me wonder why I was not tested sooner in life.\n\nAs I said in the post, two different doctors told my mum she might have it. Considering the complications it can cause, you would think they would have said, ' You might want to get your kids tested if they are showing signs' \n\nMy mum years ago mentioned in passing to me that she thinks their might be an hereditary disease in the family and that I showed the physical signs, but that was it, nothing about potential heart issue or seeing a doctor", "Marfan skeletal signs and no marfan If a person has \"mild\" external/skeletal Marfan symptoms like the thumb-pinky overlap on the wrist, long&amp;thin limbs, hammer toes, over average height, unexplained stretch marks, protruding ribcage, mild lordosis, scoliosis, dolicocephaly, overbite... and no internal signs, does it inevitably mean they have Marfan's? The doctor said (on an unrelated topic) to the person accompanying me \"can you do that?\" (the wrist test) and then said \"that is a Marfan sign\". Is this then a diagnosis? A diagnosis would be, \"You have Marfan's.\" If you are concerned you should ask your doctor directly. You might have Marfan's or you might have some other skeletal condition.

Sorry for these questions I just worry alot consumes my days\ud83d\ude44 Marfans is genetic so you either have it or you do not. While I am not old enough to experience that pain yet , ppl with marfan are susceptible to pains in the knees n back but so is nearly everyone especially in your line of work. My mother has marfans too. She has near sightedness n that is it. Me however have flat feet , super near sighted , tall af, heart issues , caved in chest, the works. So it is a roll of the dice , I have a cousin who has it also n he plays soccer bc he is not so bad. So same could be applied to you. While marfans is genetic n you have it or you do not , each trait relating to marfans is also not guaranteed. I did not mean to down play your knee pains n such, but what I mean by pain in my sense is my heart will hurt, like I cannot breathe, if you do not experience that you should be okay. I recommend cbd cream for bone pains I have had chest pain but I was told it could be anxiety... I suffer from that for years and I guess my lifestyle habits do not help..

Marfs is not a condition that will kill you while you are asleep, its progression is happens slowly and nowdays we have interventions that take care of it. The main concern that you have to keep an eye is to avoid physical stress (getting exhausted, doing intense exercises) and physical contact (high impact sports, car crash, trowing yourself on the wall idk) - that can be really harmful to you if you have an advanced aortic dilatation. You have been to some stress in your life so it would be nice if you wait until your echo to go back at excercises.\nIf you are having a chill life with no high physical impacts/acelerations, you have nothing to worry :) and listen to your docs.\n\nfeel free to ask about anything\n\nyou can find a lot of usefull information at marfan.org", "am 17 and a female, found out I had Marfan about 5 years ago.

Besides joint pain this is the only thing I have really had to deal with until now. \n I am 6\u2019 tall and had always been super athletic and I have done either cross country or track all year round for the past 5 years. I know it is not super common for people with Marfan to be able to do sports, but I am very thankful and very lucky that have not had any heart problems. However the past 1.5 years I had been dealing with pain in my hips and knees. Whenever I ran you could visibly see my knees going in. I also walk with a slight limp. I went to the doctor and found out my hip is slightly rotated, making one leg longer than the other. and I am being treated with physical therapy right now. Those past 1.5 years I was in pain from the sports but I just told myself  \u201c this is what it is supposed to be like, athletes are supposed to be in a lot of pain\u201d and it took a lot of me to realize that doing cross country is just too much for me.\n\nI am starting to realize that I am going downhill from here. I have seen what Marfan did to my dad, he had to have several eye surgeries for his retina and deals with a lot of pain. It is crazy that a year ago I did it even really think about that fact that I have Marfan and now it is super prevalent. I have also been depressed the past few months. I do not know if it is because I am not doing a sport or because if of other unrelated stresses in my life, but I am scheduled to go see a therapist. Congrats on seeing a therapist. Looking back in my teen years I would have taken better care of my knees and back as being in my thirties it kind of sucks. Things will always be better as long as you do not let that dip into stress and depression take over. I wish you the best and hope physical therapy helps you. That is a great thing, that you are going to see a therapist. My husband has Marfan's, and that is been the most amazing thing, when he finally found a therapist who understood what life was like w/a chronic disease. Best of luck to you. I am 31 years old and I have Marfans. My biggest problem is that I have had a couple of collapsed lung on different occasions. I recently noticed the joints on my toes are always hurting. It sucks that we have to go through this. Sometimes it gets to me. I have not had heart surgery but I am aware that as I get older things will get worse. I am a mother of a 6 year old boy who is marfans free. I am just staying positive and not thinking too hard. We cannot allow marfans to take control. Let us enjoy life.\n\nSorry for any errors, typing from cell. :) Hi, what exactly do you mean with \"auditory processing\"?", "Teens in the UK Hi folks! I live in the north of England, I am a 16 year old and I have had spinal fusion surgery and have problems with my heart and hyper mobility and chronic pain. I have struggled to find other people that I can relate to, anyone else in a similar boat? Ya I got the same I am 15 and am getting surgery to correct my spine curve soon I hope your surgery goes well, my top tip is take some ear plugs to the ward so you can sleep because it is really loud!", "recently diagnosed at 22. doctors? my primary diagnosed me but is referring me to a rheumatologist for another diagnosis bc she wants it to be solid to the government/insurance. i am 22 and have been sick and disabled since i was 12. i feel a lot of anxiety all the time. i would always joke how i had abnormally arms and legs and my parents and even doctors at birth mentioned my long fingers and toes. i am upset i went to doctors for years who could not see signs of this or any of my other more recent diagnoses. a lot of them looked at me and thought i was young and judged how i presented myself and just assumed i was lazy or something. my new doctor i have seen for about 1-2 years and she is helped me uncover a lot through tests. \n\ni am wondering what type of doctor(s) diagnosed you guys? and if there is any known specialists or list of specialists people can see for this? i am in kansas \n\nalso what other illnesses do you guys have, if any? and if you have the time to talk more about it. like how it was found, what doctor, age, etc. starting my research now as i have ignored it a few days.. but would love to hear from you all personally if i can.. i always felt so different\n\ni am currently applying again for disability, needed more medical evidence of functioning the first time and i had a doctor who did not believe me or my past diagnoses at the time (18yo). but since i have has my new doctor things have been documented much better. Primary and Cardiologist diagnosed me. \n\nIf your primary thinks you have marfan she should not be wasting time and money with rheumatology, she should be getting you into cardiology because a marfan patient's heart is the primary risk and usually the primary diagnosis. I was diagnosed at a young age because my dad and grandpa were both already diagnosed, so I cannot remember who diagnosed me! But, as for specialist, I really think two very important specialists to have are a cardiologist (because that is the biggest risk with marfans) and an ophthalmologist (because eye problems are also very common and can generally be treated if caught in time). However, everyone presents in very different ways, so you may need different specialists than I would! I was refereed to a genealogist by my doctor. There they did a blood test and referred me to a cardiologist to check my heart. \n\nBlood test came back negative so I do not have marfans even though I have the physical traits. Heart also came back fine. thank you! she said she would do more research. i have been having heart issues/chest pains. my aunt who we now believe has it as well has had blood clots, heart attacks and now has a pacemaker. i will have another appointment soon and am going to ask for another echo. at the time my doc said since my last one was ok, i do not need to worry. but with my symptoms,and not having an echo for a few years, i believe it is necessary and think she will too. i will get a referral to a a cardiologist. i am also trying to look for doctors who may specialize in marfans too. thank you so much for the info! i see, that is good! believe my aunt has it and maybe my dad too but he never goes to the doctor. and thank you, i had been referred to a cardiologist once by my doctor for tachycardia but i did not go because i just did not have the money. i am going to get another referral and should be able to go this time! also trying to get another echo done asap since it is been a few years. i have to get another eye exam and my doctor told me to make sure to tell them what to check for with marfans. i have been having very blurry vision and have to wear glasses now. i am going to try to do research to see if any of these specialists may work with marfans any too. thank you so much! that is interesting! my doctor did mention testing but she said it was expensive. that is why she is trying to get me to another specialist cause maybe insurance will take their word more over a primary doctor. \n\nis your doctor still tryin to help you figure out if anything\u2019s wrong? not sure if you have symptoms too or just physical traits. i have minor physical traits, mostly i am just tall (but 5\u20198) and have very long arms, legs, toes, fingers. and a thinner face but i am not thin like that No there is nothing inherently wrong with me, my primary doctor just thought I might have the syndrome based on my physical qualities. \n\nWhat country do you live in? I live in canada, the blood testing was free for me. Pediatric cardiologists and opthalmologists helped confirm my Marfan diagnosis at age 4. You definitely want to see a cardiologist asap to rule out any possible heart effects (but please try not to panic in the meantime). You may also want to have a consult with an actual genetic counselor. There are actually a decent number of connective tissue disorders that can share similar clinical features to Marfan's (like Ehlers Danlos and Loey Dietz). Marfan.org has really good info about the disorder so be sure to take a look at that. \n\nIt is also very common to have co-occuring mobidities with Marfans such as dural ectasia, POTS, different auto immune issues, the list goes on. People with Marfan's and the effects they get from it are on a super wide spectrum. Some of them get very severe issues and some pretty mild. I can also recommend for you to check out the different Marfan Syndrome facebook groups as others' experiences can be very helpful (especially when your primary care doctor does not seem to be very knowledgeable on the subject). Feel free to reach out to me if you have any other questions! If you are in KS, would it be possible to visit St. Louis? We have a Marfan clinic here at Barnes Jewish, headed up by Alan Braverman. He is my husband's cardiologist and general Marfan guru. Being able to treat at Barnes has made life SO much easier, because everyone there, even the ER staff, either knows about Marfan's, or knows to call Dr. Braverman's office for guidance when they see him listed in my husband's chart. I mean, it is probably not practical to come to StL for EVERYTHING, but even when we were living in NC, my husband would fly back once a year to see Braverman, and he could then coordinate care w/his providers in NC if something weird popped up. Might be worth looking into! (And oddly enough, it was a podiatrist who first diagnosed him.) ", "Genetic tests?  You can probably get one done privately but it would probably be pretty private. What are your reasons for doing it without your doctors approval? ( might be relevant.", "People who were part of a medical research study, how was the experience, what they were looking for, and what conclusions did the study threw out? ", "Pulse at suprasternal notch Hi everyone, Does anybody have a pulse in suprasternal notch( the visible dip in between neck and the two collarbones)? Mine pulsates clearly and it makes me feel anxious\ud83d\ude30.Is that a common thing in MFS? Does anybody else have it? Yes. I had very little fatty tissue at that part of my body though and it *seems* to me like there is very little muscle, so when I press with my finger on that area of my chest, it feels like I am hitting straight bone.\n\nBeing anxious makes it more noticeable because you are worried about it. When I have anxiety attacks its very noticeable to me. \n\nIt is also noticeable after going up the stairs, jogging, etc.\n\nIf you are concerned I would suggest talking to a doctor about it, or calling the nurse from the marfan foundation :)\n\nGood luck! It is noticeable for me even at rest People can feel their pulse in many parts of their body, this has nothing to do with Marfan Syndrome and is not anything to be anxious about. It is a natural and healthy thing to be able to feel your pulse, as it is your heart beating and blood flowing throughout your body.  \n\n\nWorrying about your heart rate/breathing rate/feeling your pulse could be a sign of anxiety. \n\n  \nTry to find out what you are anxious about, is it Marfan Syndrome heart conditions? Have an echocardiogram every year to know you are absolutely safe. I suggest reading about CBT therapy or speaking with your Doctor/GP if you are having anxiety. Which is fine, as I can too. I just got wordsy and continued on.\n\nI can also see my heart beating in my ankles and in my thumb. It is pretty standard, my dude. There are things that make it more apparent, but again, that is pretty standard.", "Recent diagnosis and problems with my doctor Hi guys. I am a 20f who was tested a couple of years ago for Marfan Syndrome. I had some physical features but not enough to conclusively diagnose me, so I also got an echocardiogram (which came back normal) and a genetic test (which was negative). I have mild myopia but no other eye problems. It was recommended that I follow up in a few years to make sure nothing had changed with my health. Last week, I followed up with a genetic doctor to receive more information about the test and its accuracy, but the doctor decided to redo the physical examination and concluded that I have Marfan or another connective tissue disorder.\n\nWhile I appreciate the second opinion and am open to further testing, I think the doctor went about it in the wrong way. First of all, what was supposed to be an informative session about genetic testing turned into to 2+ hours of him examining my body and continually using words such as \"deformed\" and \"abnormal\" to describe my physical features. He also constantly compared my features to his own describing mine as \"abnormal\" and his own as \"normal\". When explaining certain characteristics to me, he used internet pictures of people with pretty severe skeletal features of Marfan and essentially implied that all people with Marfan look like that. Finally, after concluding that I have Marfan or another connective tissue disorder he recommended an echocardiogram but did not give me any further information about what that means for my health and my future. There is lots of information online, but, left to my own devices, I tend to spiral into worst case scenarios about my health. \n\nDo others think I am overreacting about how the doctor handled this situation? I felt like he was not very kind nor supportive throughout the process, and I left feeling infinitely worse about my body and my health than I had before the appointment. Has anyone else experienced similar insensitivity from doctors? I am going to be honest here but if you do not have enough physical features, a normal echo, no eye problems and a negative genetics test then it is not marfans. Have you looked at other connective tissue disorders? As someone who has gone through these type of conversations with docs since I can remember, I -totally get what you mean.\n\nI (20f) was diagnosed after birth and grew up hearing a bunch of white-coated assholes telling me I am \"abnormal\", \"irregular\" making it sound as if that was a bad thing and comparing my features to pictures of totally unrelated cases. It basically messed me up in many ways (low self-image, lack of social skills, etc) and it took me a while to realize how insensitive, unethical and unprofessional they were. \n\nYou are not overreacting and you deserve to be widely explained what your case is about and how to prevent or treat any conditions in order to live a pleasant life after this. Maybe also explain things from the past that did not make sense before. You need someone who  will not only explain all that to you, but also be supportive and sensitive along the process. \nWish you all the best x I would see if you can get in contact with a cardiologist or a different geneticist who has experience with Marfan patients. In this case, getting a third opinion makes sense. It is unlikely you would be fine a couple years ago but suddenly be incredibly indicative of Marfan this time around (especially if the geneticist did not even have any tests for your eyes and heart to back up his physical assessment). I am really sorry he used those terms, because it is honestly quite dehumanizing to hear (especially if you do end up being chronically ill/disabled). Second this, others to look into would be Beals Syndrome, Ehlers danlos, and  loeys-dietz (in case OP needs something to Google)\n\nI will add though that my uncle initially had a negetive Marfan's genetic test and then a later positive one. \n\nThey initially did a cheaper test where they specifically looked to see if he had an identical Marfan mutated gene as my mother (his sister) and this came back negetive. Years later he had a second test as his doctor had doubts and this time it was positive. Based on family photos we suspect that my grandad carried two marfanoid genes, one from each parent and passed separate mutated genes on to his children. \n\nMy great-grandfather was diagnosed Post-mortem after dying during aoritic surgery which led to the whole family getting diagnosed, but his wife was also very tall, thin, looks very marfanoid in her photos etc and died during aortic valve replacement surgery when she was in her 30s (she was actually one of the first people in the UK to have this surgery) \n\nIt is possible it is marfans, but far far more likely that it is a different connective tissue disorder which may, or may not be genetic (my step siblings have a condition which includes connective tissues issues caused by a medication taken whilst they were inutero)", "Do I Have Marfans? I was just asked by one of the mods to test changes to the automod intended to weed out people asking if they Marfans, or for medical advice. \n\nSo, I am quite tall, and thin, and I do not always feel completely perfect.  Do I Have Marfans?\n\nAlso, I have had genetic testing done, and it demonstrated that I do in fact have Marfans. This corroborates diagnoses by a cardiologist, geneticist, and my own GP. Does that mean I have Marfans?\n\nIf I do have Marfans, will I have to give up my job as a professional skydiver? Should I quit fighting yacks? Would it be beneficial for me to start jousting? Should I buy some blue shoes? How about diabetic socks, will they help me play rugby better?\n\nTL;DR: this is not a real post, please ignore it (unless you are the automod, of course).", "Neonatal Marfans vs Marfans In the hospital right now with my newborn. Doctors suspect she has marfans due to long fingers and toes, low ears, and she has a slightly enlarged aorta root. Anyway, we have been reading up all we can, and I have learned a lot of people with Marfans do not know they have it until later in life. Those on this sub Reddit: were you diagnosed as an infant, or later in life, and if the latter, was that because any physical indications you now have were not present at birth? I am trying to understand how \"regular\" marfans and neonatal marfans differ. Neonatal appears to be a much worse diagnosis, but if it is a congenital syndrome, then I figured everyone would present some signs from birth.... confused and worried.\n\nThank you for any light you can shed. I was \"strongly suspected\" of marfans at birth. I think that was mainly due to extremely well documented family history. I was monitored for signs until the diagnoses was \"confirmed\" at age 10 because of the size of my aorta. I looked like the example always given for the way those with marfans look for the longest time.  Sorry to hear that.\n\nThey suspected I had it when I was about 3 or 4 years old, I had an eye test done in pre-school and they found my eyesight was horrible (dislocated lenses).  I was 'officially' diagnosed when I was 7.\n\nBecause it is a syndrome there are varying degrees of signs and symptoms that show themselves in people who have it. My son was diagnosed using genetic testing when her was about 1 year old or so. He was very tall for his age and my wife and I are average: long story short we were getting genetic testing done for something else (negative), and the geneticist had a hunch regarding Marfan's. His only other symptom so far is that his aorta is very slightly enlarged, which we would not have checked without the initial diagnosis. Hope this helps.  I was diagnosed at 26 when my ascending aorta was on its way to dissection. Growing up I was put through various tests and checks (most of which I do not remember) because my spine was a bit off but not diagnosed as marfans - it was not a thing yet. I do have the height and long fingers/toes but limbs are still proportionate to my entire body. That said, I spent a good 6 years playing competitive sports at school oblivious to the fact that this would eventually creep up on me so it is not a death sentence, it is just something you have to constantly monitor. My best wishes to the little one. That is our exact scenario! But, ours is only 9 days old. How old is your son now, if you do not mind me asking? As I understand it, it is a big gene, and severity can depend on what part of it is 'messed up'.  I am still not diagnosed, but have some of the signs, and I try not to worry since nobody in my family seems to have died of it.  If they see it and catch it early, it *might* be because it is severe, or it *might* be that they are just more alert to these things nowdays.  Good luck with her.   Hi everyone. Thank you for your comments. We are very appreciative of your stories. He is three, taking losartan every day. He is doing great, although getting the pill into him is challenging to put it mildly... Hi There, I am a 27 year old who was diagnosed around 5 or 6 but strongly suspected and therefore monitored since pretty much birth.\n\nI am glad you found this sub.  I do not have any children of my own yet, but as I got older and took on more medical responsibilities I cannot imagine what my parents went through, especially before the information and support that communities like this provide was a click or swipe away.\n\nAs others have noted, there is a LOT of variability on what symptoms your child may experience.  I have been tall, lenky and chronically underweight my whole life, but my aorta diameter is stable (so far), my lens stayed fine, scoliosis is very, very mild.  As accuratley noted elsewhere here, fibrillin is a very redundant protein, which gives the opourtunity for lots of different mutations that will present in lots of different ways.  A genetic councilor would be the best source of information on which phenotypes (outward expression) tend to occur with which mutation (and may be covered by your insurance, for which, having just had a child, I am guessing you reached your deductible).  Just bear in mind that very little disease research is as tidy as \"people with this mutation always have this phenotype), we have come a long way but it is still going to involve words like \"very likely\" or \"unlikely\".\n\nMy parents did not know I would be so boring.  I grew up with severe pectus (after having surgery to correct it at age 3, did not take) and while my aorta stablized and is more \"normal\" than most now, it grew quickly for a while and we thought we were looking at surgery in the next few years for a while there.\n\nMy point is that while research and monitoring has grown in leaps and bounds, no one will be able to tell you with certainty what the 90+ years your child can expect will hold.  It may have some unpleasent parts, but by and large she can probably expect a pretty normal life.  Hell, marfans is what drove led me to take on protein folding, something which I had a fair degree of sucess with doing published research as an undergrad.  Also the long fingers make for great jazz guitarin'.\n\nSo much of marfan management is monitoring.  This is going to be scary at first.  Aortic disection is a terrifying concept!  Which is exactly why we all go for our regular maintinance to take a look.  Heart surgery is no fun (about 4 months on the other side of open chest valve repair), but the procedures for marfan's are generally routine at this point.  I always took comfort in the fact that if they go do heart surgery on a 75+ y/o, I would be a cake walk.\n\nIt will be important to make your peace with that.  The worst parts of marfans are usually time bombs that let us know when they are going to go, and that we know exactly where the \"off switch\" is.  It can be intimidating to live with that, but you get used to it.  Doing exactly what you have done, reaching out and asking questions, really helps to normalize it.  Hell, I just finished planning an off road motorcycle camping trip for this summer.  To be honest, the biggest pains in the ass from my perspective are the routine things.  Making sure you go to your MRI as needed, making sure you keep your lens' monitored for displacement, is your podiatrist appointment for your flat feet this week or next?  If you need new orthodics are you still on this years deductible or did that roll over again?  The pharmacy will not give me the 90 day supply like I asked, have to call my GP about that...  That stuff is a pain in the butt, but it becomes routine and it is not scary.  You expect scary things need to be adressed by big, powerful forces but the truth is it is pretty boring.\n\nThis, in my opinion, is the greatest gift you can give your child.  Help them understand what you are doing and why.  Show them how these big scary things are not all that scary after all.  As you become more comfortable managing the condition, so will they.  As they grow talk to them, and listen to them, about the frutrations of living with a chronic health condition.  A pubescent, pimple faced kid who is already dealing with the awkwardness of growing up is going to have some feelings when the school pulls them out of gym.  That college kid in their first apartment having a hard time remembering to do laundry is going to learn realllllll quick how awesome it is their mom had their care management down to routine.\n\nAll of this will make them an amazing human.  The truth is, at some point, every human gets very, very, sick.  For most of them that is later in life.  At 27, by talking with my parents and through my own initiative, I have learned how to keep up on my condition.  I have learned to navigate the medical system to find the best care, how to navigate insurance to make sure those bastards pay it.  I helped my friends pick a health plan that worked for them at their first job out of school.  I will be able to help my sister when she is looking to start a family one day and has to plan for prenatal care.  I will be able to help my friends process and navigate their first cancer scare as we all get older.\n\nAnd, MOST importantly, I will be equipped to make sure that my parents, who loved me enough to ask total strangers on the internet what the best way to make me healthy and happy before they even left the hospital was, get the best care I can give them as they get older.  Just like they did for me.\n\nCongratulations :)  You and your daughter will do great things. Thank you so much for your perspective and kind words. We are out of the hospital now, and already feeling better. We have got out geneticist, cardiologist and orthopaedic doctor follow ups already scheduled - let the monitoring begin!\n Awesome!  Also The National Marfan Foundation ( is an excellent resource.  They have staff dedicated in answering questions.", "Human growth hormone? My husband has Marfan, and says that I may also have it (he is a health professional). I have lung issues, he has heart problems. Does anyone know if human growth hormone can do anything to reverse some of the heart issues associated with Marfan? I do not want him to die \ud83d\ude2d What kind of heart issue?.human growth hormone is for who is deficient I think Ummm no. If anything that could cause wonky issues with the heart by stressing! Even creatine protein powders are not a good idea. \n\nMarfan syndrome is not caused by anything to do with the human growth hormone. At birth, the way we are genetically formed to make collagen is different. We make it weaker. Because collagen is found virtually everywhere is different amounts within the body, marfan syndrome effects every single patient differently (hence the term variable expression)\n\nNo, you simply cannot take collagen supplements either to replace the weaker collagen because it does not work that way. Simply put, we are just made differently. The best possible chance you have for a happy, healthy and long life is to follow your doctors instructions and guidelines. Do not follow health fads and hash tags. Do not get swept up in weirdo things other people do (hey! If you eat only cucumbers for a month a do the hokey pokey under the full moon you will be cured!!!...no...you will not lol) you have good odds! Get your scans! Follow excercise guidelines! Eat well.

I am sad because I know the feeling!\n\nI saw this quote online and found it a good reminder\n\n\u201cYou Do not Have to Be Pretty. You do not owe prettiness to anyone. Not to your boyfriend/spouse/partner, not to your co-workers, especially not to random men on the street. You do not owe it to your mother, you do not owe it to your children, you do not owe it to civilisation in general. Prettiness is not a rent you pay for occupying a space marked \u2018female.\u2019\n\nThis goes for guys too. We do not owe anyone handsomeness or muscles or being sporty or looking or acting in a \"masculine\" or \"manly\" way.\n\nYou are all beautiful and handsome and fine as you are. The people with the problem are those who would judge us on our body shape and not our contribution to the world, not us.\n\nI would like to also say that things get easier as you get older. Young people are going through a lot of changes and it is a confusing time. This confusion often gets dealt with in mean or unhealthy ways and I promise you that most people grow out of it. I also put on some weight in time, developed my interest and style and made loads of friends who shared my interests. This is absolutely achievable for all of us regardless of how affected physically you are by marfans. \n\nKeep your heads up and know your worth! And do not forget that this group exists for support when you need it, as do counsellors, psychologists etc.  The point is that those people are not worth your time. Just trying to be encouraging but shoot me down if you like  Agreed, when you are younger everyone is self conscious of their body, its not just marfs. It just easier for us to get self conscious because we can actually put a name and identify the reason we look the way we do.\nBut the real truth is, other people dont really see us the way we see ourselves when were self conscious. I get comments on my height, but that is it. Im 31 now and not once has someone commented on the long list of things I used to worry about as a youngin. \nBe yourself, be confident. Because Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, has something in the personal life (health issue or not) that they are self conscious about.

I mean, I always balance on the cusp of being underweight and I still have \"love handle\" looking things because my ilium is weird and huge (there is a medical diagnosis for it but I do not remember what it is because it is not really that big of a deal) and the way my flesh sits is weird, too. And then, maybe your spine curves inward, meaning you get a distended looking stomach even though it is not. Pectus excavatum can also cause kind of an illusion or exaggerate a \"beer-belly\" too.\n\nIs it really safe for you to do intense training? I think your best bet would be to count calories and check your TDEE to make sure you are eating as healthy as you think, and adjust your expectations. \n\n I am definitely getting a belly now that I am pushing 40 and have 2 kids. I am also absolutely terrible at taking care of myself. So, good on you for exercising and eating healthy, but you probably should not be doing so \"intensely\". I hear it is pretty common for marfans patients to develop that kind of body shape. Abs are mostly about weight loss, and weight loss is easiest with low carb, whole food.  Cardio will not help that much.\n\nStrength training is what you need for muscle growth.  With Marfans, you do not want to go all out, so stick to bodyweight exercises until they are too easy.", "Can aneurysm shrink? Last year in August an aorta root aneurysm measuring 7.3 cm had discovered. This year in March i had CT scan they measured it as 7,2 cm. Can an aneurysm shrink? I personally think that it is within the measuring tolerances (scaling on the computer screen). Compared from 5 years ago i decreased my blood pressure from avg 115/75 to avg 110/60. Also supplementing with collagen peptides and bone broth powder. Also a mild aortic valve regurgitation. I have no symptoms and i am in excellent physical condition. Cardiologist recommends OHS aorta root and valve replacement. As for now i opted for monitoring. Whoa. I thought they operate at 5.0 cm. \n\nI am not sure what symptoms or physical condition has to do with this. Aneurysm rupture kills people suddenly without any warning. I would be more inclined to put the change down to small margin of error in measuring, aneurysms do not go away on their own.  I know from personal experience had my aorta root and valve replaced on my 21st birthday som 30 years ago. I think it depends on height. My cousin\u2019s been just under 5 cm for years, but they said it was fine because he is super tall (~205 cm). I have to imagine that 7 cm would still be super risky though, unless OP is like &gt;210 cm tall. I think body size gives you a little leeway to wait (like maybe up to 5.5 cm.). I do not think it gives you an extra 2 cm of leeway, but I am not a doctor. 2 cm is 0.79 inches I do not know what physical condition has to do with it. Low blood pressure would help prevent it from getting larger, but it is not going to shrink it. If your cardiologist is recommending surgery but you are still skeptical, you should at least see a specialist for a second opinion to see if they agree. They are the experts. I am sure they are recommending it because they think it is the best plan of action. \n\nThere is also little to no evidence that collagen supplements work on blood vessels, most of the research we have comes from small studies and only show small skin and joint benefits, so maybe do not stake your life on them. in my original post i forgot to mention my age and stats.\nI am 64 and most probably i had undiagnosed aneurysm for the last 50 years. Under symptoms i meant the symptoms of aortic valve  regurgitation. i added my stats to the original post. i am 185 cm and 90 kg. 64 years old 185 cm is 72.83 inches I am 64 year old, i decided to monitor the size of my aneurysm. It was diagnosed just last year, and i only have two measurements. I used to have very pronounced veins in my arms since i was a teenager. Those veins did \"deflate\" in the last 5 years. I am not expecting the aneurysm to \"go away\". But it is not growing or if it shrinks even slightly - i decided not to have surgery. i had second opinion. All opinions are based purely on the aneurysm size. Very few incorporate the height marginally into recommendations. At my aneurysm size all cardiologists have to recommend surgery - if not for any other reason - then just for the potential liability if they do not recommend it. \nMy vascular health improved dramatically in the last 5 years due to the nutritional changes i implemented. I used to have spontaneous nosebleeds multiple times daily. Now i get minor nosebleed maybe once a month. It is your life, but your height does not make 7 cm sound better. That number would be extreme even for someone 20+ cm taller than you and unless you plan on dying soon, you are still going to need surgery at some point in the near future anyway with that aortic root size. It makes more sense to me to get it done now, before you have an aortic dissection. You should trust your doctors. It is just margin of error, we cannot change our tissue with those supplements, but companies really want us to think so! It is pretty common for discrepancies in measurements depending on what tech performed them since they are all making slightly different choices with where exactly they are taking the measurement and what tiny angle differences they are choosing to take the measurement. My mind was blown with how different everything could be when a doctor went through in real time and demonstrated how understandable all those discrepancies are!  I am taller than you and had my surgery at 48mm. It was stable for years, but my scans were always 1mm bigger/ smaller randomly, does not mean that your aneurysm shrunk, or that it will get down to an acceptable size. they definitely are taking your height into account when recommending surgery. I understand that it must be hard to be confronted with something like this at a later point in your life, but you have to understand what everyone else on here has been saying too: you will feel fine until you fall over and are dead. no amount of monitoring will let you predict when that is going to happen, it is a miracle that it has not. you should trust your doctors. the surgery really is doable, and I was back to going to work and school about 2 months after it. the rest of my ascending aorta outside of the aneurysm is between 40 and 50 mm. I do not intend to have carotid arteries included in the surgery. So for now i will play the hand i got dealt.", "What is a marfanoid face? Hello everybody.\nI\u00b4ve seen that a marfanoid face is one of the traits of the ghent criteria. However, I am not really sure of what a marfanoid face means. I\u00b4ve seen that people affected with the syndrome have some similar features, but how exactly are the facial thraits of someone with marfan syndrome? How much can traits vary from one person to another? Because for example between Austin Carlile, Vincent Schiavelli, Jonathan Larson and Bradford Cox there is not a very strong resemblance even though they all have marfan and if you see in other syndromes as in down syndrome most of those who have it look like each other. And finally,  how can you know if you have a marfanoid face? \n\nThankyou very much. Not sure about those others, but my wife thinks I am pretty handsome. :-) A lot of the appearance related \"criteria\" for marfan syndrome strike me as almost pseudoscience and I think as we learn more about the syndrome we will see a move away from such silliness. \"...move away from such silliness\"\n\nTotally agree, but the crazy part is it is not pseudoscience, it is just dated.  My degrees in biochemistry and the history around how anyone managed to figure out anything always blew my mind.\n\nA LOT of diseases diagnosis started with \"uhhhh, I do not know, these symptoms and features kind of come together, I... I guess\"\n\nDiscovering the mechanism for heredity did not happen until after humans split the atom.  Our understanding of the subatomic came before our understanding of why people look like their parents.\n\nThe crazy thing is the term \"gene\" predated the understanding of DNA by over a century.  Before knowing how, people understood traits moved together, etc.  That is Mendel and his peas, most people know that.  What is truly mind blowing is Mendel actually tracked inheritance of more than one trait, and based on frequency of co-inheritance was able to deduce how many \"units\" certain genes were from one another.  If you do that math now it corresponds almost to the base pair.  He had no idea what they were called, but he was mapping genomes TO THE BASE PAIR with his peas.\n\nIn a day when I can bring up a 3D model of several fibrillin mutations on my phone, it seems so strange that it was not that long ago medical diagnosis was basically a loose observation.  Like I said, it just blows my mind anyone managed to figure anything out without the benefit of the understanding that we get from a highschool education these days. I think it just means faces that are longer and more asymmetrical than typical and sometimes with thinner nose or droopier eyes.

I had mine put in when I was 13, now 38 and I am almost positive this is what has been killing me for 8 years. I went to many doctors who kept saying I just had a tarlov cyst that was messing with my sciatic nerve but noone looked at my entire spine, which recently my new pain management ordered a full picture top to bottom and mentioned structural issues and she wanted to have neuro look at it and he looked and said well you do have intrsacral meningeol but it is not causing any issues so I cannot help you. So I started researching and the structural statement from my doc led me to flat back. I literally have every symptom and have been describing my symptoms for years and this did not come up one time. How? Ugh. Has anyone had this happen (the flat back after harrington rods for scoliosis) and would you mind sharing you story with me? I might have begged for a surgery I did not even need 5 years ago because of what those other doctors said. I am pretty sure I have this. It is difficult to stand up straight without leaning forward.

I asked something here a little while ago about genetic testing, but it turns out I probably will not get tested soon. The doctor who initially noticed signs in my father and me has decided to delay my referral to genetics because my father has made it to his age (51) without aorta or lung problems. I know that I probably should not be worried, but I would feel better either knowing I do not have any problems or knowing I do have problems and how to fix them. Especially because my physical form for marching band requires the examining doctor note any signs of Marfan. Sorry if this is a bother. I do not know why I am so concerned about this. You might try to get a second opinion from another doctor. Or ask your regular doctor to at least allow you to get your heart scanned. Making sure your aorta is ok is probably more important than genetic testing. Yes, second that on the second opinion suggestion.  Not everyone with Marfan's has cardiac involvement - even siblings present with different symptoms despite shared genetics.  So not having aortic or lung involvement does not necessarily rule out Marfan's. Have you checked with the National Marfan's Foundation?

I am having a dilemma between being a doctor and a pilot! I have Marfans I want to be either a pilot or a doctor. Can I be a pilot having mild symptoms of Marfans? I have a mild aortic regurgitation. I am also thinking about medical school. So I am confused now Do not let it slow you down, but still be careful with it. Be who you want to be, unless your looking to be an Olympic athelete. I tried to get into the airline industry; so I am pretty biased towards that. Can you be a pilot though with that syndrome (esp with the heart problem). I know that aviation authorities are strict with their medical standards. To me doctor sounds like a safer option.  Though if your dream is being a pilot check with you doctor to see if that sort of thing is okay.  I have regurgitation in some of my heart valves too, high five bro \ud83d\udd90 I would go for safe in your case. If you can wing it (;-)), try being a doctor, make money and take private small airplane lessons. Thank you for your opinion! I have been thinking the same too. Thanks! \ud83e\udd1a Well you certainly will not be getting into the air force or military with your aorthic condition so you would have to work your way into piloting through the private sector. I believe you should bear that decision in mind if you are considering going into piloting. I do not know how it works in your country but in mine most commercial pilots are former Air Force pilots.\n\nAnother thing to consider within the piloting industry is the relentless schedule they have to work with, coupled with occasional height sickness which posses a big stress on your aortha. I am not sure if going into a job that will push you into these conditions is a very good idea if you are taking your health into consideration. \n\nLastly there is the fact that in such a line of work you could very likely suffer a complication such as aortic aneurysm while being abroad. Of course for any regular person this can happen. And surely your employer company would cover medical emergencies for their pilots abroad. But I would have been terrified to face my aneurysm in another country and away from my family.\n\nStill, if such is your passion and you would not be fulfilled as a doctor you should go for it, but I really think  you should consider it. So, I have been looking into getting PPL for a bit now.\n\nAccording to FAA regs, if you have had a valve replacement you are cannot get your papers.  They do make exceptions, and not everyone is happy with the rule, but it is there.  There is also some wiggle room re: repair vs. replacement (a positive and stable surgical outcome seems to be enough), but theres definitely extra paperwork.\n\nNow this is for a private cert, but I imagine it is more strict, not less, for a commercial pilot.\n\nSo, long and short, get your wings, but I am not sure I would make a career out of it.  You may find yourself grounded with a highly specialized skill you can no longer practice.\n\nOn the other hand, the same thing will likely make you a better doctor. Thank you for your opinion! It really helps! I have been thinking a lot lately about being a doctor, I think I will go with being a doctor. Thank you for your opinion! Hi! I am an Air Force pilot and hold an Air Transport Pilot Certificate (ATP) and readying to transition to the airlines. My daughter has Marfan Syndrome. There are only a handful of things the FAA lists as medically disqualifying. Most likely you would need a \u201cspecial issuance\u201d for the medical. I am doubtful they would approve it, but you could find out by checking with an FAA Doctor, AKA Aviation Medical Examiner (AME). Personally I would recommend against this career path b/c it is extremely expensive to train for, and your ability to fly is tied to physical health, including eyesight and heart function.

I am currently going through the diagnostic process for Marfan's, however in my country if you have a genetic disorder it either takes a lot of money and/or years to get a solid diagnosis. My GP is fairly sure I have it and has confirmed the features in my younger brother too. Having had some past spinal injuries, I am no stranger to chronic pain, however I have been experiencing widespread moderate to severe joint pain during my first year of university. I have had to quit my job due to pain and fatigue, getting through labs and lectures is really hard, and overall I have been slipping into hopelessness and despair. All of my specialist appointments are months away and my psych will not help as it is a physical issue. My joints ache, and my muscles feel like taut knots around painful areas. I cannot sleep and I have lost my appetite. I have had to depend more on my family than I have ever had to before since moving out, seeing friends and making plans takes so much energy, and it seems like all I ever talk about to people is the pain I am experiencing. Having experienced severe depression in the past (with no related physical pain), I know these feelings of hopelessness and guilt are a slippery slope but I cannot seem to help myself. I have had so many side effects from pain medications this year that my doctor is reluctant to find something that helps without a specialist's opinion. Is this kind of pain normal for Marfan's, and do any of you have any advice on how to cope/treat it? I currently go to therapy, practice mindfulness and go to weekly yoga with no real effect. Keep your spirits up!  I have Marfans, but live in the US.  I have had every cardiac surgery possible (expect replacement of my mitral valve).  I made it through and I really should not have.  Keep your mind focused, do not worry about what others are doing with their lives.  Dont compare yourself to them, it is not fair to you.  \n\nAs well, there are some benefits to having Marfans.  Yes, I said that.  You will be a much stronger person in the long run.  For the energy thing, drink lots of water and try vitamins, plus eat healthy foods.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBlu I can definitely understand what you are feeling. I was diagnosed when I tried to get a physical to play sports. It went from wanting to play competitive sports in my teens to basically being told I could never play again. That was a depression in itself. Then as I got older and realized how much more I was limited compared to my other \u2018healthy\u2019 friends it did not get much better. Then in my 20s I was diagnosed with glaucoma and other pain related problems. Sometimes I feel like a ticking bomb waiting for the next dx but mostly I just try to make the best of what I have in life and try to cope with the problems to improve myself. Dealing with this dx will definitely give you thick skin because in a lot of ways it will be problem only you will be dealing with while others do not even realize it. Most people cannot tell there is anything physically different about me and they think I am fine so the struggle is often very internalized because others cannot understand or relate. I am in grad school now and I am often so busy and anytime I get a back ache I think \u2018please do not let it be another pneumo I do not have time or money right now\u2019. Just recently I also had chronic pain in my lower back from early degeneration but it is gotten better with rest and therapy. I would say focus on the positive in your life. Look for something that motivates you and do not dwell on your dx (if in fact it is Marfan\u2019s).

Getting an echo this Friday.  Last echo I had was 3 years ago (no aortic enlargement just MVP) so I am kind of nervous if they might discover something serious.  Going To be relieved afterwards regardless.  I technically do not have Marfans but after the doctor suggested it I am pretty sure I have some variation of it (indent in chest, super skinny, etc.).  Anyways can MVP contribute to aortic dilation in Marfan patients or do they not interact with each other in that way?  Thanks! MVP can be completely isolated or seen in conjunction with enlargement, but it is not a causal relationship. Not a doctor, so please take with a grain of salt.\n\nTry not to stress on your echo! As a Marfanoid with features like you describe, look into whether or not your health insurance will cover genetic testing. It may even be worth paying for if you can. After 20 years of worrying, I recently tested negative for the known connective tissue diseases. It is a huge relief and one I think people should pursue if they can. What kind of symptoms do you have if I may ask? Iam interested in ur case, I havent had a genetic test done.\n", "Effects of LSD on my heart Hey, I have been diagnosed with Marfans every since I was 8 and recently I have been wondering what would happen if I were to try LSD? I have been smoking very potent weed for a while with no side effects other than a very powerful and fast heartbeat and I read that LSD increases heart rate so I wanted to hear your opinions on if it could run any serious health risks Not sure if it helps or not, but I have got Marfan and shrooms have never killed me, so I got that going for me, which is nice. I would recommend not doing drugs at all. I do not know. I might get hate for this, but is not LSD and drugs like that illegal? I never really got why people admitting to doing illegal drugs online. I think just uhhh, not doing drugs will save your life. Again, not sure how this well go, I hope I do not get attacked for being a \"square\", the only safe drug I know is weed, but I advise people should do weed if it is legal and they have a license and blah blah blah. Because they know the feds do not give a damn about some kid that said he tried LSD on reddit. I would be a bit more concerned about the effects of LSD on your brain, honestly--like, on the physical structure of your brain. Also there is some evidence that LSD can induce seizures, which are super dangerous for us even in ways that they are not for genetically \"normal\" people. Reports of Grand Mal seizures associated with LSD are extraordinarily rare and the pathology of people who have them is not really understood. Depending on your situation, most modern research seems to indicate a net benefit on the brain for people who have depression and anxiety.  I would love to see any research you have showing, as you said, that LSD effects the physical structure of a brain. I have done mushrooms and LSD several times and I have had no issues. If you are concerned about this, which I am glad you are, I would say read up more about it, and make up your mind.\n\nIf you decide to do it, try micro-dosing and have a sitter, someone who is sober and around, who can calm you down if you begin to have any symptoms. The feds care about threats, so why would they not care about drugs?\n\nAlso I KNEW I WOULD GET DISLIKES! LOL! Thank you. FUCK DRUGS!", "Negative genetic result. Multiple physical traits? Has anyone here received a negative result for genetic testing but still have been diagnosed with marfans because of heart eye spine and physical traits? Thanks I have been diagnosed despite coming back negative on a genetic test. I was in a grey area for a while but after switching doctors the marfans diagnosis had apparently officially made it onto my chart. May I ask what gave you confidence that you were marfan despite having a negative genetic test? The two big ones were I had scoliosis that got bad enough that I needed spinal fusion surgery and that I am only 110 pounds at 6' 5\". When I was younger I also was showing some mitral valve prolapse so I had been getting EKGs and ultrasounds once a year for that. So what do they do as a far as a treatment plan when you are negative, but all symptoms present? Well the EKGs and ultrasounds were not ever finding anything that could be an issue so I was getting scheduled for them less and less. Went from biannual to yearly to semiannual.\n\nI never showed all symptoms. The last time I talked to a cardiologist they said that the height and weight disparity was so drastic that it probably had the biggest effect on being diagnosed. I have not seen a doctor in a while. Yes, I was diagnosed clinically as a kid years ago. The first DNA test I had in the 2000s was negative. My specific marker was not identified until 2017. My genetics Doctor is checking me for Loey Dietz Syndrome as my Marfans gene test came back negative.\n\nThere is a decent amount of overlap for symptoms related to Marfans and Loey Dietz.", "How did you gain muscles/weight? I have mild form of Marfan\u2019s. I am 16 and 5\u20199. I do have a mild form of AR and mild form of MVP. Doctor said it was fine to do gym exercises and weights, but no contact sports. It is been hard gaining weight (currently at 58kg or 128lb). \n\nFor those who have successfully gained weight/muscles, how did you gain it? How long did it take to you to get to your desired weight. I am dreaming of getting to around 140-150lb/60-68kg. What did you specifically eat to make gaining easier and what home exercises do you recommend? damn you are lucky, I am 20 years old, 5'10 and only weigh 119. i honestly am wondering this myslef. i eat so much during the day and exercise does not do much for gaining weight for me. You have to count your calories.  A rough approximation will do.  Find a TDEE calculator online to work out your base number,  then and 500 calories per day.  It should result in around a pound of gain per week.  \n\nI did the recommended routine from r/bodyweightfitness. Gained 27 pounds,  though I subsequently lost 8 when I stopped. Agree with Canadairy, stick to bodyweight exercises and yoga. Low impact is the safest way for Marfan's. You will never be jacked but you will be lean. It took until I was 23 or 24 before I could gain weight even eating 4k calories now I have to focus on losing weight cause I gained like 60 pounds in 3 or 4 months and not in a good way haha. Focus on eating mostly clean foods figure out your TDEE (there are calculators online) and add like 500 extra calories, you do not want to try to gain too quickly because it can cause issues and you can only make so much muscle per week. Protein shakes and peanut butter are your friend for easy to eat and quality calories and protein. Take magnesium and fish oil for your joints and muscles and some fiber as well because it helps with overall gut health. Maybe throw in a vitamin d/k2 mixed supplement as well if you do not get a lot of sun.   \n\n\nEven though you got cleared for lifting weights i would be super careful with that because you should really only be doing high reps (12-15) with low weight but honestly that is not very fun. Bodyweight exercises are safer and you will get similar results with less risk because you are not straining and breath holding as much, when you are tensing hard and breath holding when lifting that causes undue pressure on your heart.   \n\n\nYoga is super good because you are always breathing and not straining at all but it takes a long time to gain muscle doing it. I am just now starting to get some core strength and leg muscles after like 3 months of consistent yoga, but yoga is super good for your brain health as well as your body health, it does not even feel like exercise it feels like a good body refresh. Just do not be too discouraged, with Marfan's you cannot be a super buff dude but you can still have a nice physique. Oh and do cardio, cardio is HUGE for long term heart health, I ignored it for basically my whole life and I could barely walk a mile without being out of breath.  Hope this helps! I cannot reiterate enough to be SAFE and listen to your body. Do not let your desire to look good get in the way of being safe. Slow and steady is better than injuring yourself. It will change when you are older, I was 180 and 6'9 until I was 23 or 24 and now I am 27 and 250 ( not in a good way lol) Marfan's bodies can be weird. I could literally eat 4-5k calories a day and not gain weight when I was younger but it will catch up to you now I have to stick to like 2500 to 2800 to maintain. Just try to add protein shakes and peanut butter to your daily meals and the extra calories should help 2 tbsp of peanut butter is like 160 calories and a lot of protein and good fats and really easy to eat. Just keep adding like 500 or so extra calories and after reevaluating once every two weeks or a month add another 250 until you start seeing results. ", "So, freaky study about Marfan life expectancy... So I was diagnosed at 18, just under a year ago, but have not actually changed my lifestyle at all. Because I have no aortic dilation (yet), I am actually still on my college's varsity track team! In other words, I have just kind of been ignoring the fact that I have Marfans. My brother decided to be helpful and take it seriously for me, and so looked up the life expectancy of people with this syndrome. He comes up to me and just says \"Hey! You know you have only got a 1 in 3 chance of living to 40, right?\" \nSo, that was a bit freaky. I also pointed out that the study was from 1972, but it is got me thinking...\nDoes anybody have data on life expectancies? I kind of want to look into this now.\n\nHere is the link he found, if you are curious\n\n", "Could I have latent heart problems that do not show up yet in an EKG? Before I start, I have a referral to an orthopedist and I am waiting to schedule an appointment for suspected marfans. Im only 5'8\", not tall, and my arms arent longer than my height. But my GP suspects I have very very mild marfans. I have scoliosis, pectus excavatum, and arachnodactyly. When I was a child I had symptoms associated with MVP. I had an EKG which found no abnormalities. Ive been to the ER for severe back pain, they did an EKG and found no abnormalities. I am 20 years old and Im wondering if heart problems can develop at a later age in people with Marfans. Again im going to ask an ortho, but I wanted to see if that had happened to anybody else personally. I still have the symptoms I had when I was a kid, low blood pressure, fainting spells, lightheadedness. But apparently my heart looks fine and I am pretty confused. One of the biggest risks with marfans is the \"aortic anuerism\". It does not show up in an EKG. You need to do some sort of imaging to find it out. The cheapest option is an echo cardiogram. \n\nThe aneurism can develop as you age, so typically everyone monitors the progress periodically. I had an ultrasound when I was 13 or so and nothing was found. I should probably ask about getting another one. Yeah it is a good idea to check again. If they even suspect Marfans get a referral to a cardiologist and get an echo. They will look for the anuerism but will also look for a dialated aortic root. That is a tell tale sign. Sadly im on medicaid in the U.S., so since I just had an appointment (which I scheduled in February) I wont be able to see my GP again until September or October(even if its urgent). So Ill try to get a referral from the orthopedist if I can, but I dont know if they can do that. I did not have heart problems up until 2017 and in my young adulthood I got diagnosed with marfan syndrome. I heard aortic issues can go unnoticed if the appropriate screening tests are not preformed. My aorta looks normal, but my heart is not normal. (Acute coronary syndrome.) Get a echo. I had plenty of EKG\u2019s that showed nothing. Echo showed aneurism Everything looked perfect until my last check up, then they found leakage in one of the heart valves. Luckily this is not scary at all, at this point at least. My aorta width is still 34 mm so I am very happy about that.", "Maci Currin recently broke the record for world\u2019s longest legs - I suspect she has Marfan \n\nObligatory \u201cnot a doctor\u201d statement here. \n\nI recently read this article about Maci in the news and was immediately suspicious that she may be a fellow member of the Marfan club.

Otherwise it sounds like I am making it up.\n\nI would not be surprised if Maci and her family have already been made aware of it. I actually commented on that post that I favor leaving people be and minding my own business. The comment section seemed pretty 50/50 at the time when I made mine. I was just struck by the mom\u2019s comment in Maci\u2019s case. Thanks for your input. As another commenter mentioned, I am sure many others have also noticed and perhaps already said something. Thanks, and you are probably right. Yeah I get ya.\n\nI have had someone tell me when I was young I might have a medical condition. I already knew since my birth.

Am thinking of having a lens replacement to eliminate my astigmatism,light sensitivity . Has anyone had a lens replacement and if yes has your vision improved? Yeah,  I have had three.  The first one was June of 2003 (right), second was December 2003 (left),  third was April of 2013 (right again). \n\nI believe the procedure was still fairly new in 2003, which is why I had my eyes done separately.  There was a big improvement in technique in the six months between the two.  And the last one was even easier on me and had the best results.  \n\nThe first two surgeries took me from needing glasses or contracts to see more than a couple feet to being able to drive without any corrective lenses.  I do need reading glasses now though. Funny, I had my right eye done in 1997 and my left done in 1999. Both are still doing great. My dad recently had a similar procedure and it amazes me how much more routine it is. His recovery time was also much quicker. No regrets at all about having it done. Yup. Right was done in 2006 left done in 2009. I never realized how blind I was until I had them done. My dad had a lens removed in the mid (or maybe early?) 90s and it was really rough on him.  I remember him being  flat out on the couch for weeks before he could even walk across the room. \n\nMy brother just had an eye redone last year and was back to heavy lifting in a month.  Modern medicine makes marfans a lot easier to handle. You went two years with your vision that wildly different?  How was that?  I did it for a month and it drove me crazy. Right now my eyes i think are really bad compared to other people. One of my biggest problems is light sensitivity. When someone stands in front of a window and the sun is shinning towards them I cannot really see them. Now that am 18 i want to have this surgery because i think it will be life changing l. When the surgery was finished could you see properly or was your eye patched up? Did it hurt? I was in highschool when I had the surgeries. I have lived most of my life now with them fixed so it is hard to remember how bad it was before. The first surgery (right eye)  went fine. I had some head aches after for a few months due to some eye strain. It was like trying to use a muscle you have not used ever in your life. Second surgery (left eye) went about the same. It healed and I had some head aches. About a year later tho I started having problems. Long story short during allergy season my eyes would get so dry and scratchy that it re-opened the surgery wound and my eye \"deflated\". But I went back to the Dr and had a small procedure to repair it and all is well. Eye drops will be your best friend. Definitely worth it tho 100% I hope that am going to be able to have the surgery this summer before i go to university. Am excited tbh Yes I have had a lens replacement and tbh it changed my life. I personally found it took a couple of weeks with some minor pain to see properly but after that... It was just wow (only way I can describe it really). My right eye was essentially a lost cause anyway, which made the risk of surgery worth it. The doc could only bring me to 20/30 vision because 20/20 would have led to too much disagreement between the two eyes. Two years later my left eye degraded enough to again make the risk worth it.  \n\nFor those two years, I was no longer legally blind, so the difference between the eyes did not matter as much. I could see at all and that is what mattered. It was icing on the cake to have TWO good eyes after only two years. I had a lense replacement but not for astigmatism or light sensitivity.  I had both eyes done in summer of last year and my vision dramatically improved.  My glasses went from 3 cm thick to thinner than the actual frames.  My daily migraines lessened as well.  I doubt this is much help because I did not have those conditions though. I had mine done in the span of a summer so you should be able to do it, although mine was a bit of an emergency.  It was patched up and I was on very strong pain meds and it still hurt quite a bit.  If the surgeries end up taking longer and your uni is not too far away from your doctor you can go to the dollar store and pick up a pair of reading glasses so you can read. My mom had hers done a few years back over a few different surgeries.  She has a replaced lens in one eye and no lens in the other.  She wears both glasses and contacts to correct for the surgeries.  Her recovery was not that bad and it seems now to be an improvement to her life.  Having the contacts is kind of hassle, but it does not seem to bother her much.  She did it out of necessity, though.  One of her lenses became completely detached.  I cannot say if it is worth it just for fixing light sensitivity.  (My lenses are dislocated and I never knew it caused light sensitivity.  Makes so much sense now!  My eyes are sensitive as fuck). Yeah it does i also have astigmatism and cant see far away. For me they said my retinas were too weak to replace them, was that not an issue for you? They estimated like a 70-90% chance of retinal detachment. I would be careful with lens replacement, I went to 3 separate doctors when I was younger, first 2 said they would do it and it would not be a problem. 3rd doctor said they were insane for suggesting it because my retinas looked too weak and the chance for retinal detachment (pretty much guaranteed blindness) was like 70% +. Luckily my lenses dislocated and I got like 50-60% improvement in my vision. Definitely envy anybody that can get a full replacement. Being right in the middle sucks sometimes haha Lens dislocation happens randomly?", "how do you guys deal with the anxiety of having marfans? if you even have any. Sorry in advance, this is my first post here and it might be a little long. In school I never really cared too much about my condition, I did not really take very good care of myself, drank loads of caffeine and did not always take my meds, but I never really noticed any symptoms either. \n\nLately it seems I am noticing my condition more, even on beta blockers my heart rate goes up a decent amount when I get anxious (which makes me more anxious lmao), I notice more palpitations as well, I am not sure if I am just getting older or if I am getting worse, doc seems to think I am fine but I cannot seem to beat the anxiety that comes with feeling like my body is failing me. On the flip side I have been eating better and trying to be more active, and I physically feel better, but I still stress myself out.\n\nTo make a long post short, I am curious if any of you deal with anxiety, if its normal and how you cope with not feeling \"normal\". Part of me feels like I should not exist being flawed or whatever, having a shorter lifespan and my heart being a time bomb really freaks me out. Personally, I like \"mindfulness\" meditation (it is super chill and is not as hippie dippy as it sounds). You can find good meditations on YouTube. I toss in some headphones and do a 5min or so meditation before bed. I also like to be as healthy as possible and do what is best for someone with an aortic aneurysm. Keeps my mind at ease knowing that at the very least I am giving it my all. My approach is basically stoicism.  I have it.  I cannot change it.  Therefore no point in stressing over it.  Go on and enjoy life.  \n\nIt is like, yeah my aorta could split open tomorrow.  Or I could be hit by a car.  Or crushed by a falling limb.  Or any number of other things.  To live is to be at risk of death. \n\nDo not know if that is helpful. My son has Marfan (just found out) he is in complete denial. My point is you are dealing with it pretty well. I want to echo the mindfulness and meditation. There is also a lot of research on yoga and anxiety which leans toward being a positive thing. You should pick a gentler yoga like Asna or even \u201cGentle yoga\u201d. \n\nThe other thing you can do is research and read and join a support group. One that meets in person once a week. Meds. Possibly therapy if I can free up the time and funds for it. \n\nGranted, it is not *just* marfan syndrome that I am getting treatment for. I have other issues myself, I used to take meds, did not really work for me though. Therapy sounds nice, just do not really know how to get started with that sorta thing plus im not sure i could afford it. Life's a blast lol. One way to deal with it might be to think in detail about the things that scare you. Imagine a dissection and think about how you will deal with it - the logistics - how you will call emergency and so on. And imagine how your death will come, if that is your luck. I find that thinking about it gives me an illusion that I am somehow prepared to face the eventualities, and makes me less anxious.", "Just curious about other people on this sub Reddit So I am 14 going 15 and have marfans syndrome. I was always kind of worried about but recently I have felt as if I am very low on the spectrum and am just curious as to how Other people with it are. Thankfully, I was diagnosed when I was very young (6) and have been on medication since. I am 6\u20193 with a wingspan of 6\u20196 and still growing. I had to wear an eyepatch and glasses when I was 7-8/9ish but I do not anymore. But everything apart from that seems to be not marfans like at all. I have no irregularities in my spine and my aortic disselation(i do not know if that is correct I am not too informed it) is around 35mm. I also never/rarely get joint pains and have 0 problem with posture. I would like if some older people who know more about marfans could reply and maybe inform me a little and tell me how I compare. Thanks xo Yes, Marian syndrome affects people in very different ways to very different degrees. My own twin brother has it to a significantly lesser degree than I do. Myself, I seem to have it to a significantly lesser degree than some folks I have heard from on this sub. So for all the trouble I have, I feel fortunate knowing it could be far worse! Yea the funny thing about Marfans is it manifest differently in different people. And it is a degenerative disease so the older you get the worst some of your symptoms may get. I had mild symptoms my whole life until recently (now 34). My back hurts, my joints hurt, my aorta is swellingand the doctor told me last week that my pectus has gotten deeper from last time it was measured 4.0 up from 3.5 last visit?! \nI think the thing you have to be most careful about is the aorta and dissection. So check your Z score and monitor that yearly. Because that can swell later in life like mine did so you will still want to avoid lifting and contact sports. \n\nBut do not let that get you down you can still lead an epic purposeful life! Rock on.  Ye man thanks a lot bro What is a Z score? \n\nIt is a more accurate way of determining when you may need an aorta correction. Check out that link and punch in the numbers.  Thank you. I do not have his sinus measurements  It is determined from an echocardiogram or a CT angiogram. Have one of them administered and get the results for your records and keep them forever. But you can kind of play with the numbers now since you know his height and see where he is safe at and where he may need to seek repair. Knowledge is power with this affliction.  I tried that and it was -8.75 lol I did not put a number in for the sinus reading  Try 3.0, 3.1,3.2 etc and see what those numbers are. My z score is 3.4. My sinus reading is 4.3.  So I put 3.4 in and his z score was 1.7\n\nHe is 6\u20196\u201d 170\n\n Good. This gives you an idea of what size you want the result of his echo to be when they measure his aorta. Anything lower than 2.0 I do believe is what you want. My first echo ever when I was 19 was already at 3.9. So let us hope he is low.  Basically all the physical symptoms, but my heart, lungs and eyes are good. They did for the first time find a small leak in one of the heart valves last time, but I am very chill about that.  I actually had my annual check up a few days ago and found out I actually have no leakage for now. and a strong heart beat. I suppose marfans has just given me advantages of being tall and skinny\ud83d\ude02 I am appy everything is fine! As a girl I do not love those traits on me. I would much rather trade tall and skinny with short and curvy :p I guess I can be happy I can eat as much as I want without getting fat (for now)  Lol tbh if I were a girl I would embrace the fact I am taller than I should be and make it me. Everyone wants that curvy body now but I think why not be different  You are very wise for your age! :D thanks Just being curious how tall are you? 6\u20192\u201d. Would you still embrace it? Hahaha.\n\nI try though, it is not like I have another choice  I am now 6\u20194 which is not only tall it is 3  inches taller than anyone in my school. And I am only in second year of secondary school. Including the seniors. doctors have told me I am going to end up 6\u20197-6\u20199. Of course I get called, and will be called lanky and all that but I have realised that the only people who ever insult me are from people who are small, fat, or both. Not that it is bad for anyone to be any of those but it is clear that this edge of difference is actually something people would die for. Sorry to rant but it is something I try to tell myself a lot \ud83d\ude02 I can totally relate to wanting to rant about it. It really crushed me when I was 14 at 5\u201910 checking out my height at the doctor only for them to tell me I would turn out somewhere from 6\u20192\u201d - 6\u20193\u201d. However now that I am here I am starting to be fine with it. Your estimated height is all over r/tall, though.

Surprisingly enough my doctor still gets my parents to be tested even after being tested multiple times because neither of them are marfanoid at all. And they think it is just an unfortunate mutation. (I say unfortunate though I would not change it for the world) my parents are far from small but they are still nothing insane. My dad is 6\u201d0 exactly and my mom is 5\u20197. Which is tall for a girl but still nothing extraordinary.  The exact height of my non Marfan parents! Haha. You must be a male version of me then \ud83e\udd23 Why would not you trade it by the way?  It makes me stand out. It gives me that of difference and since I handle all the health implications and they are manageable they do not affect my life in a life changing way.

Interesting that you got the diagnosis without having any of the three issues I mentioned in my comment. Did they instantly allow you for a dna test? \n\nI still have no official diagnosis because of healthy eyes, heart and lungs, and I have tried to get one since I was 6. However, ever since they found the leakage they think it is marfans. I did a new DNA test in a new country, as in my previous test they found a mutation they had never seen before. Hopefully they have seen it in the Netherlands and I will get some explanation soon.  \n\nI am grateful for Marfan in the way that I have become my empathetic and strong self, although there is still some luggage that I am taking care of. Life is great, just wish I knew that when I was younger :)  I had a problem in my eye and had all the physical symptoms. I was around 5\u2019 when I was 6 years old with a wingspan of 5\u20194 I think. So that is why they took me for diagnoses. I do not remember much else tho but I am sure they were other symptoms  Oh, I did not know about the eyes. I see! :)  Even at that i still swim by myself a lot meaning over the years I have actually got quite lean \nSo (not to sound cocky) I have a good figure sor someone my age. Not that looking good makes me better than anyone. But again, I felt since every man wants that same body with broad shoulders and chest, six pack big arms etc, that all \u201cgood looking\u201d men look the same. Being this tall kind of gives those same features a bit of a different look.

I am sure people with marfans can be lean (although often difficult to get there) and good looking as well :) Much good luck in the future. What an amazing conversation. Damn Reddit is a pretty cool place It sure is!  So we got the results of the echocardiogram. The doctor saw enough to refer my son to a cardiologist.  How is he doing  He seems fine. He is in that I am young and invincible stage. I think the only time he has pain is when he has to lay on his side.  I used to have that a lot and trust me it is actually gotten a lot better just from time passing  ya I walked around with a ruptured appendix so I guess he got it from me. ", "Why is it not good for marfans to practice competitive sports? (20m) Since my childhoode I have played a LOT of sports, almost all days of the week and the marfan gave me a really good body for it, Long arms to reach balls, skinny and athletic body for great speed and a clumsy way of moving that make adversaries always underestimate me. It is one of the most pleasant things in my life and I have been a competitive volleyball and basketball player, now I focus on soccer and tabble tennis. I really highlight on it and I am exploring the options to become a professional player.\n\nThis year I went through the aort surgery (kept the natural valve) and everything went fine but I was expecting that I would be able to get back to my athletic routine after a little rest time.\n\nMy doctor said that I would need avaluation to see if I would be able to do it all again and probably would have to avoid contact sports. Is it beacause of my heart or is it because of my body in general? It is mostly because of your heart, as even with the surgery, other parts of your aorta are still at risk of developing an aneurysm. Some specific activities such as scuba diving are also risky since we are at risk of pneumothorax, and high impact sports tend to fuck with our joints and could cause a lens dislocation. can I have an aneurysm without having the dilatation? My understanding is that contact sports are dangerous because of the risk of getting hit in the chest which could cause a rupture. Along of course with the pressure put on the heart and arteries from the intense exercise you are doing. \n\nIf you have had surgery to replace part of your aorta, you may still have be at risk at other parts. You may also be at risk for pneumothorax (had it, twice, not fun) and joint injuries. \n\nI was an athlete growing up and I learned I had Marfan\u2019s as a teen when I went for a competitive sports physical for school thinking my pediatrician was being over cautious (and annoying!) by sending me to a cardiologist instead. I definitely feel your pain in having to give up sports. I went through an intense grieving period afterwards and also a period where I was angry and rebelled and kept playing recreationally thinking I would rather die than not play. Eventually the years caught up with me and I ultimately had to find other hobbies and other ways to exert my energy. Best of luck to you and take care of yourself first and foremost. what hobbies do you have instead of sports? Generally just going on long walks/light running with my dog now and throwing the ball to have him get it. I also do a lot of roller blading and bike riding both of which I have noticed I can do for a long time without overexerting my heart. My doctor always suggested golf which I suppose would my hit my competitiveness but I find it boring tbh. \n\nOther than that though the aches and pains of age now does not entice me to do much more anyway and I have more indoor hobbies like reading and such. Sudden aneurysms are possible, yes. They happen to normal people all the time, and we are naturally more susceptible.\n\nWhile people here talk about heart/aortic related aneurysms a lot because they are most common, my doctors have made it quite clear that marfs are vulnerable to aneurysms everywhere. You can blow out more than your aorta doing competitive sports. ALL of our connective tissues are fragile. \n\nThat means joints and eyes as well. \n\nI blew my retina doing excercises I should not have in physio. I can no longer see with that eye. It was my \"good eye\" and my vision with my other eye is now around 300/20. Do not be ridiculous risking things for the sake of risk. I miss being able to see. \n\nI have been told it is a matter of time for my other eye. The idea that I will not be able to see my kids and husband one day makes me crazy and really anxious sometimes. \n\nLearn from my stupidity \ud83d\udc96 it is not worth it.", "Anyone else here like me? I am am the 1st person in my family with Marfan. I was tested when I was younger along with my immediate family by a hospital with a dedicated Marfan's department. It was suspected that at least my father had Marfan's as he has a mild pectis excavata.\n\nBut as it turns out, neither of my parents or siblings actively or recessivly carry the Marfan's gene.\n\nSo i was just curious if anyone else happens to have the same situation. Well you seem nice but I do not really know you...\n\n:-)Yes I am also the first in my family. It is got to start somewhere, I suppose. Lucky us, right? Yep. By chance what kind of severity do you have. We used to joke with the doctors that I could have been the ideal model for Marfan posters.. I am essentially a 9.5 out of 10 It is not recessive it is autosomal dominant.\n\nAbout 25% of cases are spontaneous mutations. Sometimes though the parents can be  false negative. E.g, I had DNA testing years ago and it found no markets. Had it again a couple of years ago and it did - as scientist discovered more markers over time. \n\nYour dad having pectis but not Marfan seems like too much of a coincidence. What DNA testing did he have? TAAD panel? Not sure, it was in the late 90's/early 2000's. If I am remembering correctly it was a genome test of sorts, could likelybe wrong in that assessment(if there is a difference, I am no scientist).\n\nHis heart has always been great (no murmurs or arrhythmias), no stretch marks and while tall and skinny,  he is far more proportional in limbs and digits than me. Has been in active military and reserves including war time deployment.\n\nSame goes for his father,same build w/ no pectis disorder, active military in WW2. Died of wasting disease.\n\nWould be interesting to get another for him to check and get a reconfirmation if it was affordable. You can get the TAAD panel from\nInvitae.com for $250USD. If your dad tests positive then the kids are tested for free. Yup! I am the first. After I was diagnosed it was suspected that a cousin may have had it cause they were skinny and tall but everyone got tested and I was the only person with the gene. \n\nEdit: oddly enough Also a textbook case for a marfans patient. I do not think think there is a symptom I do not have. My mom was 1 of 4 and she was the only one with it. Neither of her parents had it either. Spontaneous mutation. Same here! The 25% of the .02% haha. I stick out like a sore thumb in my family (who are all 5\u20197\u201d) My great uncle had pectus excavatum as well, but I do not believe he had Marfans. I am still in the process of being tested. (Tests need to find that I have either an enlarged aorta or eye problems before I can get a DNA test with my current healthcare arrangements, but I have a very large number of the features.) Yep! Im the only one in my family! Just got really lucky i guess! I dont know what test i had, but when i was young (under 10 yrs old and im now 19) i tested negative for marfans. next thing i know im 15 and rushed to the hospital with aortic dissection. ended up testing positive. the technology is constantly changing. I dunno if anyone else calls it this but I tell people who ask that I am a \u201cSpontaneous Combustion\u201d! No one in my family seems to have it, I am the first. And I plan to get my tubes tied (or something of the sort) so I will also be the last. \n\nIf you need to talk, I am here! It is definitely possible to live a relatively normal life, albeit with some hiccups here and there depending on the severity of your condition. Yep, same here.  And like you, I have family members with mild symptoms. (Cousin with mild pectus, grandfather had the marfans build, and dad had some ankle problems) but everyone got tested and I am the only one who has the gene. Thanks I appreciate your offer. I am in my 30's so I have already come to terms regarding my capabilities and life prospects.\n\nLuckily I quite enjoy my life. No hassles or drama that I cannot get out of (except for work) and as a bonus I am debt free. I did not think it was a gene.   I thought it was a gene variant.   A mutation.   Seems like you might be writing they do not have the same mutation. Yep, first and only in my family. \n\nAlso, as it is been mentioned, you cannot recessively carry the mutation. Either you have it or you do not. If you were to have offspring each offspring would have a 50/50 chance of carrying it.\n\nI am also considered a 'textbook case' of marfans, despite being 5'9\" and AFAB. \ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I am also the only one, had genetic testing done about two years ago. also the 1st knowned case in my family but my father suspects my  great-great-grandmother  had it because he was also very tall (210cm or so) I am the first case in my family, too! No one else has any indicators, though my maternal grandma was a bit on the tall side (she was 5\u201910\u201d while I (f30) am 6\u20192\u201d). I read somewhere that the likelihood of the mutation increases with the age of the father, and my pet (unverified) theory is that my dad\u2019s age when I was born had something to with it, but I have a younger sister who does not have Marfan Syndrome.", "Questions about Marfan's?

Hey everyone, first time posting here\ud83d\udc4b. I have seen some people on here talking about how energy drinks are a bad idea for ppl with marfans symptoms. I have never heard that until now; is that a serious thing to avoid?\n\nFor reference, I (24M) have MASS syndrome (sorta like marfans lite), I am on beta blockers for an aortic root dilation, and my cardiologist has never brought caffeine or energy drinks up.\n\nNot asking for medical advice, just wondering what others' experiences have been. Not a doc, generic advice:\n\n\nIf you have a known aortic root dilatation energy drinks should be avoided.\n\nA morning cupa or whatever probably is not the end the world but yes, you should be limiting things to spike your BP. I personally use Swiss water method caffeine free coffee. It is been a life changer. I am super sensitive to caffeine already because of another heart defect so I really really love the taste of these with 99% free of caffeine. I get them from amazon. Mayan stone is a really good choice. I mean in reality energy drinks are not good for anyone. I used to drink them all the time when I was working overnights because I hate coffee. I did not die nor did I have any adverse effects but they are definitely not good. I love coffee and have a fondness for energy drinks. I have been hitting the caffeine hard this last year, and I have also had my heart take a turn for the worse.\n\nNow I also had covid and a ton of stress and depression (which caused fatigue and insomnia, which caused me to drink coffee/energy drinks like water), so shrug. It could just be coincidental. \n\nMy cardio said 2 cups of coffee a day were fine, my GP said no caffeine at all. But that is me yeah? You are best talking to your team. There are many conflicting scientific studies on all the various forms of caffiene.  Not just \"bad or okay\", many show it to be GOOD for preventing diabetes and cognitive decline.  Some nursing homes that used to only serve decaf coffee, now only serve caffeinated ;)\n\nGreen tea has as much Caffiene as coffee, but balances it with a relaxing amino acid, L-Theanine.  Most studies show it to be extremely healthy.\n\nYour real issue is to keep your blood pressure down, so that your aorta does not expand to the breaking point.   That is why energy drinks are bad, they combine Caffiene with lots of things that raise blood pressure.\n\nI hate beta blockers, especially over the long term (depression).  I discovered that many of us have high blood pressure because we have slightly high levels of inflammatory homocysteine:\n\n(\n\nHomocysteine is easy to control with diet and supplements.\n\nI still take Losartan (not a beta blocker) for good measure, but my blood pressure is completely normal now.\n\nBTW, I am not actually a Marf either, I have another type of \"Marfan's Lite\", ( \\-- but they all work similarly. I looked up caffeine in relation to Mitral Valve Prolapse, and they seemed to think it was bad.  \n\nMight be best to ask your cardiologist directly, especially if you have another appointement anyway. After my heart surgery they said no caffeine. \n\nMy brother was drinking a lot of energy drinks and it through his heart out of rhythm. He does not have Marfan. They can also cause issues with your kidney or liver long term I think. May I ask how did you find out you have MASS specifically? Is there a specific test for it as a subtype of Marfan's? Do doctors misdiagnose between the 2 often? I am not a medical professional of any sort.\n\nFor many years I have religiously drank coffee in the morning and if I am to have a really, really long day I will have a bit more caffeine around 12 or 2 pm. That is it.

I read about how most women dislike skinny guys and it makes me very depressed and feel inferior to muscular guys.

I recently had some issues with my heart were it would beat fast (Between around high 80's at rest and around 120's with physical movement). So naturally we looked into this. Allot happened, but i eventually got an Echocardiogram. During this time my doctor informed me about Marfans Syndrome by testing if i could do the hand thing (Where your thumb can pass through your closed hand). Now this got me really worried, I am kind of tall, but still shorter than most of my friends and people my age. I am fairly skinny, i have long-ish fingers and toes and i got diagnosed with (Extremely mild) Scoliosus and Pectus Excevanum. Apart from those features, i do not have anything else. No eye issues, no pains, no joint problems, i do not really get out of breath much or anything. If i never looked up the syndrome i honeslty woudn't even suspect i had anything. Anyway, the Echocardiogram came back 100% normal, as in everything was fine, healthy, normal and working well. I discussed with my GP (as we reviewed the results) about the possibility of me having Marfans. He basically told me that they looked into it since i had some features and said that i could have a very mild case of it (Where i have some features of it but not the full thing, atleast not the heart issues). I personally do not care if i have the \"Looks\" of marfans, i am worried about the Heart Issues, so i asked him about that and he re-asured me that my heart is perfectly normal, that the Echo checks everything and that i will be fine. He said to my mum if i am really worried about it, that it wont hurt to get some check ups every few months or so just to be sure. Now my question for you guys is, Is my Doctor/GP right? Do Echocardiograms show marfans (atleast heart related issues)? Should i stress? because i'ts been giving me really bad anxiety recently and i just kind of want it off my mind. If my heart shows up perfectly normal on an Echo, does that mean i will never have marfans related heart issues? I just want to be safe (and not worry so much). If anyone could answer and ease my anxiety driven mind, i would thank you a thousand times over. If you need any further info or questions please ask! i am not shy at all :)", "How do you keep going? I am ready to give up I am 30 now and have been really going downhill for a decade. My marfans is mostly effecting my musculoskeletal systems and I have chronic pain and fatigue (amongst many other issues). No treatment has helped. I have lost everything I had going for me and my career is over with it barely even starting. I am on permanent disability and none of my doctor's expect improvement, only worsening. I barely can leave my bed and a few hours up and about will mean days of pain. \n\nSo how do you manage to keep going? I have no prospects. No energy to maintain relationships, let alone start new ones. I am in pain and miserable with no expectation for this to ever change. I just do not see the point of continuing with this existence. I am only a burden to those around me, I am unhappy and in pain, so what is the point? Hang in there buddy. You should talk to someone.  Professional I mean. I am going through a some of the same things and I feel you. I have and they are not really much help. They said I have to learn to adjust and accept my situation. I do not seem to have depression (according to the doc) but am just in a shitty situation that makes my very logical personality feel hopeless.  Yeah, I get that. I do not know of you have tried meditation. That is my next logical step I think. \nWhile that did not work for me, I wish you better luck. Everyones unique so it might be what you need.  Thanks. I hope you find something. Here for you buddo Though I cannot personally relate, my mother is going through a bit right now. I care for her deeply. I do not believe you are a burden at all. I am sure everyone around you cares about you as if not more than how I feel about my mother. We share marfans and I expect to someday go through a similar bump. All I can say is that the care is genuine. Stay up. And like I said , I am here. Be safe  I do not have much to tell you even though we have a similar genetic disposition, I do not have your symptoms. However, I work with people who suffer from chronic pain, and I know that a big part of dealing with this is *acceptance*. \n\nIt took me several years to start feeling like myself after the surgery, and not feel like I was a defective person. I shared my story with many, of how I found out about Marfan's and how I had to have an almost emergency procedure, because of my aorta about to burst. I did not feel normal, knowing I had to take warfarin for the rest of my life, and I do not know if my symptoms will ever worsen and I will be disabled or dead. But that is just our shared experience, and accepting it, has made it easier for me to get through life - one day at a time- and see myself as a person, and not a statistic in a medical journal. I think the hardest thing for me is I do not have something to hold on to. Most others when they go downhill already are married, have kids or a career that keeps them going. I do not have that and with the state I am in, it is not likely to happen. Without that strong motivation to accept your situation and go on for some reason in your life, it is tough.  Just because your health is declining does not mean your life has to. And look, none of this is your fault. You seem guilty for having more need than others. You were born with this, as were we all. Not to get all Good Will Hunting on you, but it is not your fault. You are a good person. Keep talking to people. Professional, sure, but just reach out. Keep reaching. Someone will reach back. But you have to reach. Life can be amazing no matter how bad your situation. But you have to reach.\n\nSpeaking of, I am going to pm you. I have some specific questions. I am in the same boat, though right now I am still working. My job is quickly becoming too much for me, though, and I feel somewhat adrift. Between the dural ectasia/chiari malformation/degenerative disc disease triple whammy on my spine/nerves and my knees and elbows starting to come out of joint at times it is really getting hard to do physical labor, but a desk job is out of the question because sitting is almost instantly painful. \n\nI do not even know where to start though, or how to continue. I would had hopes for a neurosurgeon, but the surgery is so risky he does not want to do it until I am essentially immobile, regardless of how suicidal the pain sometimes makes me.\n\nI do not understand it. I totally understand where you are coming from. The medical field will do anything to keep us alive but not quality of life The care is there but so is the frustration with me. They still cannot come to grips with the fact that I will not have a normal life and lie about it to everyone saying I am working and randomly will be annoyed with me for not being able to do everything I should. Its so discouraging and I can see that I make my family and remaining friends lives worse and I am just a drag. They are stuck with me but their lives would definitely be better if they did not need to care for me  This is coming from a personal stand point. But i belueve the human body is absolutely mesmorizing in its ability to adapt. When you consider something like the placebo effect or diet or headspace, it kind of steers towards attitude being one of the key factors. I agree with a seoerate comment that expresses how, just because one thing in your life is declining  your entire existence has to as well. The care for you is genuine and I cannot express that enough. Even just hearing this from you makes me a stranger feel passionately toward you. I can only imagine how your immediate circle must feel. You may think it is a burden or drag to them. But i guarantee that every one of them knows that every inch of it is worth it. I recommend maybe  try a pet, like a dog. They are very therapeutic and I view them as essentially human in presence. Just a thought. Please take care and feel free to write me Honestly, I think what you said was right in the early years of my illness. I was still a student and relied on friends so much to get me through it and help me get to class. But as the years dragged on and my health declined, my friends and family started avoiding spending time with me. As I could do less, they did not know what to do and just stopped coming to see me or making plans with me. I had a really positive attitude and pushed through a lot. I even got a master's degree while being very ill, but by the time I finished, I could not really work anymore. What I am saying is, as the years dragged on, as my health fell apart, the positive attitude and care from those around me disappeared. The most I get is a 'hows the health?' every few months with clearly no interest in hearing the answer. Its sad to think about where I was, to where I am now. My research partner who I did my Masters research with makes 200k+ a year now and is married with a kid, that would have been me if it was not for this condition. \n\nA pet could help me, I have been thinking that too. But I have to live with family since I cannot afford not to. And my family will not allow a pet.  I am sure they would understand a pet though. Especially if you spoke to them about it. I appreciate your dialogue immensely, and I would imagine your close ones do also. If you do not mind me asking what did you master in ? I believe that is incredibly interesting. Your mind is right intelligently and it is clear you know that.  You are still very capable my guy,  seriously. I am curious as I am sure you have atleast thought about possibilities. What are they? You would think so but I have been given a hard no for the last year. \n\nI did my Masters in computer science...data science. We worked on algorithms that she is now using for high frequency stock trading. Its a great field and you can get incredible bonuses which offer you a lot of freedom in life. Unfortunately, sitting upright causes a lot of pain due to DE and vision and memory issues make it difficult to work. Concentrating is exausting and painful, so while I actually spent 5 years during my decline working part-time to avoid going on disability, I eventually reached the point I had to.  I see a lot of drive in you. I am sure there is still opprotunity there for you  Anxiety and depression can make physical symptoms worse. I have gone through several periods of severe mental illness where I could barely function, and my physical pain was insufferable. I convinced myself I had cancer and wanted to end it all. Fortunately I was put on SSRI meds (after ruling out physical health issues) and some counselling and bounced back. Life is still not ideal, but at least I can mostly function. I would suggest keeping a journal to track your thoughts and feelings, as well as challenging yourself to accomplish things, no matter how small. Isolating yourself is also a recipe for disaster. I wish we had better ways to connect with others like us, and provide support, but at least here in Ontario, Canada that is not really the case. I agree with this, and find it interesting that even doctors often choose not to pursue life-extending interventions when their quality of life is severely impaired. I have always chose quality of life instead of quantity and still follow my interests of cycling, sometime unhealthy food choices, etc. to push back against this health situation as best as I can. I have also had to deal with \"questionable\" parental support which can be frustrating. While they say they are supportive, they do not seem receptive to bad news and seem to want to pretend that everything's \"okay\". Earlier they also suggested my anxiety was just in my head and that I should just get out more and meet new people.  Hey man hang in there!\n(Idk if this is important but I am 15)\nJust had aortic root surgery and it was exhausting, and I thought of giving up, but never for long. My parents supported me a lot and seeing my friends helped a ton.\nI would suggest talking to a psychiatrist and just doing fun stuff. Live life to the fullest! Go to the cinema and stuff!", "Careers To my fellow Marfs- Just out of curiosity, what types of careers did you end up pursuing? I got diagnosed at 5 and i am in my 20s now and preparing to apply to medical school. Life has been a journey (as i am sure it has been for all of you &lt;3), but my experiences and interests have confirmed my desire to become a physician...Problem is everybody around is frowning upon it :( My doctors are saying its too hard and my parents have pushed me to pick another career path for the past 10 years..(like actually though)..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny thoughts would be appreciated. I am also just curious to see what you all ended up pursuing? I (23M) was diagnosed at birth. I entered university interested in urban planning. Recently finished school and now work for a non-profit doing affordable housing development. I like it because while I am at my desk 90% of the time, I also get to have an excuse to get out and visit job sites etc. I went into IT and was forcibly retired at 29.  My body was already worn out from all the lifting, climbing and crawling (server technician.)  If your doctors suggest it is going to be too hard on you, they may just know what they are talking about.  Then again, you might be the exception.\n\nIf it were me I would still go for it.  I truly enjoyed working and my life is poorer without it.  Just be prepared for what could occur.  Your mileage may vary.  Dad and I are dairy farmers.  One brother works in a feed mill, the other is a delivery driver.  Uncle is a barber.  \n\nThat is all the current Marfans in my family.   I became an EMT. My experiences sparked an interest in medicine as well.   I do not personally think med school would be to hard physically speaking. It a ton of schooling but if you are passionate about it, it would be worth it. I was into financial services for about 5years. I quite loved the profile, my body despised the the long hours though. I had a lot of marfan problems relating to posture and general body aches throughout \n\nBut the most concerning one was I developed a CSF leak due to dural ectasia and had to take off for a few weeks to have a surgical fix. People at work did not believe that such a thing was even possible, thought I was making things up to \u201cescape a busy season\u201d. Marfans are not common here, I was quite upset with their thinking.\n\nI called it quits and took up a masters. I realised that my passion is to teach. I am not fully sure how much I can complete a PhD, but I am considering it. I am quite a bright kid, but I have a lot of monetary commitments to the family. I have not made a decision. It is still work in progress, I have made peace with my limited abilities. \n\nWe marfans have varying levels of abilities. Assess your own and decide. There are a lot of marfans with mild symptoms who live a near normal life. A few people do not even get diagnosed. A few have deliberating conditions that limits them forever. Try getting your accurate picture and internalise it. Then get to a career decision that you best like among the choices you can make  I am a surgeon. PM me if you like.  Started in the film industry but it was too hard on my body. Doing computer science now, and love it. It is perfect. Work from anywhere (couch with laptop). Perfect.  My family doctor works three days a week as she chose to spend more time with her family than work as she has young kids.\n\nWhen I was younger I had a desire to go into the  medical field. My uncle was a doctor and went to school with someone who had Marfan who became a surgeon. My health made me feel like that was not a good idea.\n\nIn the end, my passion has always been computers since I was a kid so I chose that route. I have had a great career in software engineer for 20+ years. It is low physical stress, great pay/benefits, and in high demand. I highly recommend it. I finished my PhD, got an aorta/valve replacement, and now work as an associate professor in CS. Librarian in an Elementary School. If you want to go into medicine maybe try pursuing radiology? I used to work with radiologists, it is just sitting in front of a screen and taking calls all day. Wound up going to school for biochemistry, protein folding specifically, partly because of the marf.  Wound up starting a company making systems where we make bugs breathe through a wire.  Been a crazy ride.\n\nIf I can get funding while I am staring down a valve repair, you can be a doc.  Get after it. Thank you for sharing- that is one hell of a ride- you rock! You bet!  Being a doctor is going to be hard for reasons that have nothing to due with the marf.  Message that surgeon above!  That is a great resource! I am in health care--got a master's degree in public health and work in pharmaceutical marketing. I think all the collisions I have had with the health care system from the marfans made me really interested in it. Marines I wanted to go to medschool as well... Turns out I cannot see blood lol\nAbout to finish lawschool now and work as a state attorney", "The actor who played \"Mama\", Javier Botet, has Marfan's Syndrome \n (may need google translator. Page is in Spanish)", "Stretch marks I am currently waiting for a referral to a rheumatologist to determine if I have marfan's and I am wondering about these crazy stretch marks I am getting...\nI am skinnyish and in the last six months I have been getting angry-looking stretchmarks all over my thighs, back of legs, groin area, stomach, etc., and it seems to be accelerating. It is frustrating because I never took my shirt off at the beach due to some bad body acne, and that finally clears up then this happens... I prefer the body acne to be honest. I probably will not be able to wear shorts soon - it is getting really low down my legs.\n\nI have been using some cocoa butter/collagen/vitamin-e type shit for a few weeks but it has no effect.\n\nIf I **do** have marfan's, is there any way of stopping this stretch mark progression? ", "Is having POTS with marfans extra dangerous? I almost certainly have it and I have never had an echocardiogram or anything. I have a weird pulsating feeling down close to my bellybutton as well. Anyway my concern is I read you are not supposed to do vigorous exercise because of the possibility of a rupture if the aorta is weak but I have POTS. Is it possible that the POTS can simulate a heavy workout and increase the chances of rupture? well if u havent had an echo theres no way to tell if your heart is even at risk for dissection I agree with the other commentor that you should get an echo done to really know how your aorta is doing. \n\nIt depends how your POTS is for you. For me, my heart jumps from 60s to 90s, maybe 100s upon standing up. \"Vigorous\" exercise usually means your heart rate is above 140 (or about 70% of your maximum heart rate, calculated using 220-). So if your heart is jumping above that during each POTS episode, you might want to see a cardiologist about it and see if it puts you at risk of a rupture. Though in general aortic aneurysms can usually be aggravated by high blood pressure, not necessarily a fast heart rate.  POTS is usually an issue with fast heart rate but low blood pressure, though it can be different for everyone. \n\nEither way, if you have Marfan's or suspect you have Marfan's you should be seeing a cardiologist anyways because there is automatically a risk of mitral valve complications or aortic aneurysm. It is better to be aware than to keep guessing about your heart health.", "What is the name of a similar syndrome? The DNA test results finally came yesterday to my mom, and it turned out I do not have the marfan but a very similar syndrome. What is it is name? I cannot remember.. Ehlers-Danlos", "Has anybody been able to actually put muscle/size? I have been struggling a lot with the physique that comes with marfans. I was planning on starting some weight lifting (following the 20lb max limit) but I do not know if I will ever add size, I do not know if marfans also compromises muscle growth. \nHas anyone been able to add muscle by working out and doing a diet? \n\nThanks. Not a significant amount. But working out makes me feel better and helps reduce back pain. I had a cardiac ablation for tachycardia and put on 20 lbs. Sure slowed down my metabolism.still have twig wrists but am now 160 lbs/6' yep, I have never had any issue putting on muscle and weight. But definitely most people with Marfan Syndrome seem to have a lot of difficulty. I would suggest trying protein powder and check with your cardiologist if light weight lifting for you is fine. Fully second this. I used to be in nearly constant pain; regular exercise leaves me feeling like a million bucks - as much as a Marf can, anyway! Yes. It took years, but it was very satisfying to hear my specialist tell me that I was unusually muscular for a Marf. Still, I am not muscular by the standards of ordinary men training. I will add to this, I have paradoxical breathing as they could not re attach two ribs after a surgery.  The right excersize help a TON to reduce it and consequently improve my breathing, even when I am not doing aerobically intense things. So you may not add size, but you will add strength and general \"fit\".\n\nDepending on your age, do not discount the \"fit\" end of it.  Being in your mid 30s and lacking a gut/generally being capable is what being a hulk at 19 was. Doctor says I am not allowed to do any form of exercise. My weight limit is also 10lb. Although keeping a good diet keeps me FEELING strong and energetic. So that is very important. I have had trouble with weight in the past, but never with putting on muscle. I do not have any definition of course, but my family had been able to be fairly strong. Not the greatest thing for us, because the temptation is always to push limits. Dad was a farmer before his diagnosis/open heart, brother was a carpenter before his open heart I didnt start to \"fill out\" until I was almost 30. I have not gained but 2 lbs but on someone as slim as me that two pounds makes me look a lot more defined. Yes actually. I dint know if you should listen to what I have to say coz I seem to be very low on the spectrum of marfans symptoms but I am diagnosed with it. When I was younger I had such insecuruty over it but as I grow j realise I as just a skinny child like most children are. As I grew I went to the gym as though I did not have it. I have managed to actually build a pretty impressive physique going from 60kg at 6\u20193 to 90kg at 6\u20196. Now everyone is different. And I am lucky in the fact I do not many physical symptoms of Marfans. But I found going to the gym and preforming exercises properly!(important) and getting stronger gradually has actually ridden me of most joint pain and back pAin. I can now walk around for prolonged distance without needing to sit down. Now again I am not a doctor this is not medical advice. Me and you are very different and might not react to everything the same. But if done properly, monitored and consistently yws i it is possible Spent 6 - 9 months clearing about 3500 calories a day (mostly from bulking protein powder) and working out with resistance bands. I spent an absolute FORTUNE and was almost sick daily because I was forcing myself to consume so much.\n\nWhat happened? I got a fat stomach and that was it. Seriously. All that time, money and effort for such shitty results. It really pissed me off. My arms and legs were as skeleton like as they were at the start and that was before I gained so much weight. That is what I was told when I was first diagnosed. A few years ago they told me that they would done more studies and decided some exercise was good for people with Marfan\u2019s? It was really jarring after sitting out of gym class for my entire childhood. It probably depends on how enlarged your aorta is.", "Hey brits with marfans Have any of you had a vulnerable to coronavirus letter yet? Nope\n\nI also have a mechanical valve and pacemaker but apparently I am still not vulnerable. Or they want to kill me off, mot sure which to go for! \ud83e\udd14 Theres a possibility I may have gotten a letter but I flew out March 20th - I study there so all my med deets are registered with NHS so coulda but I am not surprised they sent them out. Stay safe!! I was sent a load of generic British Heart Foundation printouts at the start of April but I think this could be because I had the PEARS procedure at the start of March.

I was diagnosed with Marfans syndrome when i was really young. I got the right treatment and i had some eye problems and problems with my aorta I had a scoliosis surgery(it went very well) . Everything is controlled and i am checked every 6 months. i am 6\u20192-6\u20193 and i wont get taller. \nI started vaping about 2 weeks ago and my question is will vaping affect my aorta (btw I have not had any lung problems in my life)  Btw i use no nicotine  i would not worry, definitely stay away from nicotine though.  \nGenerally people say vaping is 95% safer than smoking: ( My personal story I smoked for like 7-8 years but I stopped 2yrs ago and started vaping have seen any issue really? I currently use nicotine in mine though.  Not really but you would be better off not doing it marfans or not  I choose to live my life and not spend too much time worrying about the consequences. I vape. Eat junk food. Drink soda. Use cannabis. Ride my bike hard.  Still here at 49. I have Marian, I smoke &amp; ingest, I have a medical card. I have not had any issues. Although I have issues with my lungs and vaping really hurts my lungs, oddly the light smoking does not. They are saying now there is a possible lung reaction with the chemical of the coils, etc., heating up. You should follow some MM pages. I would definitely steer clear of any nicotine, it makes your heart race which will enlarge your aorta quicker. Best of luck!!  Thanks for the replys guys!!! how old are you? 18 I am guessing you are juuling? I do not think vaping affects your lungs that much as nicotine is the only chemical that is bad for you in terms of addiction and dependence. I highly doubt nicotine alone is the cause of cardiovascular disease. there are so many others poisions in cigarettes that are so much worse that nicotine is nothing compared to that. If it had any cardiovascular risks similar to real smoking, they would never prescribe nicotine replacement therapy. The vaping hurts because unlike cigarettes the liquid used for vaping does not contain ingredients that suppress coughing.", "Anyone have veiny arms like this?  It is like I am looking at my own arms. Didnt think this was a Marfanian thing. Also,my son is just getting tested (those are his arms). He doesnt have many symptoms tho\u2019 I am not sure that it is. Yes I really think it may be. Both my brother and I have arms like this, too. It may not necessarily be the veins themselves, but the fact that many of us have that same underlying shape. Most thin people. Yeet Looks just like mine You have real good veins and circulation, but not indicative of Marian\u2019s or a health problem. He is being tested for marfans but mainly because he is tall, slim (not skinny) , has big hands and plays elite sports.  I find he has more muscle mass than a 15 year old with Marfans would have and more than some of his friends...... Looks pretty normal! Anna, you seem pretty stressed your son's test,  but you need to relax.  I understand your worry; I am both a father and a life long marf. Stressing before you get the results does not help though.  \n\nLook at it like this: test comes back negative,  great,  no worries.  Test comes back positive,  well now you know and can take compensatory action.  Either way your son will be better off than if he did not have the test.  \n\nA little stoicism is a great help for dealing with Marfans. Lucky for me HE is very stoic! I mean to a fault! I guess I make up for it lol.  Dad and I are dairy farmers,  one brother works in a warehouse setting,  and the other is a delivery driver.  Marfans exists on a spectrum,  so even if he has it he may still be able to lead an active life.", "Need some hope tonight Last year I lived in blissful ignore of connective tissue disorders and had never heard the word Loeys Dietz. Fast forward one year and eight members of my family have been diagnosed with this disorder, including my mom, my sister, and myself. \n\nIn August of this year, my mom underwent surgery to repair an aortic aneurism and a valve replacement. During the surgery, she suffered a dissection. We know that she is lucky to be alive right now. However, as a result of the dissection, she suffered several complications including kidney failure requiring dialysis. \n\nShe was in the ICU for a week after the surgery and the hospital for a week after that. Honestly.. her recovery has been hard. She is been going to dialysis 3 times a week, has had several instances of fluid build up on her lungs, and even at one point had what we think to be a seizure. This is horrible for anybody but especially for my mom, the sweetest, funniest women who has always had good health before this Loeys Dietz bombshell was dropped on our lives\n\nToday, on the same day we learned that her kidneys were finally healing and she will probably be able to come off dialysis, we learned that the dissection has caused an additional overgrown aneurysm in her descending aorta which is also inlarged and they think she will have to do another open-heart surgery. The first one was the most traumatic event of our lives and I cant imagine doing this all over again in a few days. They also are not hopeful that her kidneys will recover in the event of a second surgery. She also has an iliac aneurysm that needs to be repaired.\n\nI hope that I am not scaring anybody writing this. To be honest I am not really sure why I am. Connective tissue disorders do not discriminate and I am so scared for my mom. It would be helpful to hear if anyone has ever experienced any complications such as this or any advice. Trying to pull myself together and take deep breaths at the moment, I just want her to be okay. I am on a phone and holding my daughter in the other hand, so I will write a proper response later, but I at least wanted to send some love and well-wishes your way. You and your family have been through a lot, and I wish your mom a speedy recovery. Thank you, that means a lot I appreciate the kind words It is scary, yes. A dissection was my worst nightmare until I met folks who had them and lived to tell the tale. \n\nIt is tough right now - keep close to your family, love each other, and hope it turns out well. \n\nIf you ever want to talk, we have a discord server as well.", "Where to go from here? ", "Marfan and ADHD I posted recently that my son is probably going to receive a diagnosis. He has ADHD and has been on Concerta (a stimulant) for about two years. Does anyone here have ADHD? How do you manage it when a stimulant medication is off the table? \n\nMy son is bright and has big ideas for college--I am worried for his quality of life if I pull him off a med that helps control his ADHD. Cognitive behavioral therapy for adhd can be really helpful. As well as other drugs that help focus but are not stimulants like bupropion I have a web-test ( informal ) diagnosis for ADHD ( maybe crosspost to r/ADHD ).   Similarly, I have 'marfanoid' characteristics, but no confirmation from a recognized medical authority. Regarding college: While not ADHD, I am on the spectrum with Aspergers, but my case was relatively mild compared to other people I have known since I mostly learned to manage it on my own as I got older. However there is now a growing number of programs at various colleges that assist students on the spectrum with tutoring, counseling, accessibility resources, resume and interview training/assistance, etc.\n\nUnfortunately there is not a single, nationwide organization behind these programs, so it is largely on a per-college basis, and they are usually quite small and easily overshadowed by the coverage accolades programs get. But I would encourage seeing if prospective schools have such a program as they can be a huge benefit to their students. Does your son have an IEP at school (I am assuming there is an equivalent in other countries)?\n\n1) You may need one for physical education moving forward.\n\n2) There may be marf related things affecting his academics.  My grades jumped two letters in every subject when I got a laptop for classes (back when that was uncommon).  My hands would just get to tired for essay responses.  It literally changed the whole trajectory of my life.\n\n3) I *think* they make special provisions for people with ADHD.  Different testing environments, breaks, extended time etc, and it will be honored for state tests, SAT/ACT, and apply to whatever college they go to.\n\nAs far as your direct question re: meds.  I do not have any insight for you, but I would bring it up with the cardio.  They may not be very worried about concerta, and I would find it hard to believe they do not have other patients (marf or not) whom they have had to recommend alternatives to.\n\nedit:  just wanted to 2nd cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).  I have learned it for depression, and had a friend with *severe* adult ADHD whom it helped a ton. having been on and off the medication you have talked about (and having ADHD). for me (and perhaps just me). i find it difficult to get off it. slowly lowering the dosage helped and i have now found ways to cope a bit more, stuff as listening to music in class.", "Custom DIY 3D-printed Orthotics Instructable I thought I would share this.

I am a man and everytime I have had an erection i get pain and acing inside the body, in level between belly button and penis. It really turns me off and ruins my time with most girls I have hooked up with, and I hate it... Have been counseling with doctors about this but have not yet had any reply.\n\nDo anyone here recognize this issue? Anyone who have had same problem? never heard of anything like that, seems serious. How long have you been feeling that way? I recommend talking to an urologist and ask for exams. Yes, see a urologist!\n\nIf you have problems/pain/etc go see a doctor! You should not be suffering needlessly. While people talk a lot about the aorta (an the associated issues) in the chest, there is another in your abdomen.  It could be any number of things (sorry), but it is worth the precaution for that as well the same way a pain in the chest can be different for us.\n\nAlso, we are more prone to hernias.  I had one for years before it was pointed out to me standing for more than 5mins should not be painful.\n\nFinally, if a specific diagnosis fails to come up, I would push for a physical therapy referral.  I have recently started and it is been WONDERFUL.  There is a lot of muscle groups that because of previous surgery, scoliosis, etc we tend to compensate for rather than rebuild, and it can cause problems over time.  Docs will overlook this often (IME) because they are focusing on the \"show stoppers\".  PT has helped me with a lot of things that I assumed were just \"how it is\".

Hey community-\n\nI have a darling kiddo who has \"the posture\" like many with Marfan as well as some other soft signs.  Her dad has the posture as well, and long fingers etc.\n\nBiggest thing right now is that she is delayed with walking and crawling and bad vision.  Is this typical of Marfans? Marfan syndrome affects people in different ways to different degrees, so it is hard to say what is typical. My son's eyesight was severely impacted such that he needed surgery by age four, however he did not actually display any signs of impaired vision; it was the ophthalmologist who informed us. My daughter, in contrast, has not had her vision impacted nearly as much.\n\nShe did, however, have issues with walking, but this was actually due to hip dysplasia and was not related to her Marfan syndrome.\n\nFurthermore, I am not actually sure what you mean by \"the posture\". Do you have an example image you can share? Does not have to be of them, of course, is there one on the internet somewhere as an example? I was diagnosed really early, a few months after I turned 1. No one else in my family has it,  but my doctor suspected it and I got tested. I was not officially diagnosed until high school when they noticed my dislocated lenses, but since my mom has Marfans we pretty much knew beforehand.  Like other people have said, Marfans presents itself differently in different people.  I would have your husband get tested if you are suspicious, but appearance is not everything. Thank you so very much for your reply.  Baby's posture is curled \"in\" when comfortable, sort of hunched in upper back.  Husband has the forward thrust neck thing going on, with head slightly in front of shoulders.  Both are gorgeous and delightful people lol.  Baby has already had vision surgery at age 15mos.\n\nIll try to get a pic. I do not have Marfans, but I have a very similar disorder (Loeys-Dietz Syndrome). I was diagnosed at 27, because a cardiologist noticed I had an enlarged aorta. I exhibit the body type of a Marfan/LDS patient (tall, skinny) but other than that, nothing else ever stood out. I just hit the 2-year anniversary of my aortic root surgery and I feel lucky every day that it was discovered and safely taken care of. I do not know when the diagnose was told to my parents because my mom had it and I was monitored since I was born but I found out myself at 13 when I tried to play competitive sports and was referred to a cardiologist. I suppose I am lucky in that even though I have many of the signs, they are mostly mild for now - except for getting two spontaneous pneumothorax at 15. That was not fun. Sept 17th with LDS I had a lot of signs in childhood but I was not diagnosed until I was 27. Hip dysplasia sounds like something that would happen to babies with MFS, why was it determined to not be part of her diagnosis? 14", "How to tell my 6 year old Hi everyone,\n\nMy son (7) has been recently diagnosed, and it has been a fight with the health country where we live that has taken over 3 years - so all in all, it is good news because we were positive he had it, and now he can get the attention he needs.\n\nWe will travel soon to another city to visit a hospital where he will undergo several tests. That is all good. However, up till now we have just told him that whenever we go to visit a doctor is a regular check and that everything is fine. I am thinking that it is time to explain to him that this is something that will continue to happen, and that he is special in a way.\n\nAnyone has experience with this or any suggestions on the best way to communicate this to him? I am positive this will trigger a lot of thoughts and questions in him and I want to be as ready as possible.\n\nThanks in advance Hi there! Thanks for reaching out. I know this is a tough time, both my children inherited from me, so let me express my solidarity and sympathy. I think it is great that you want to make him aware of it, that is a good thing. Having something like this is something that should be approached openly, with candor, and he should feel free to ask questions and understand, so bravo.\n\nI would suggest not necessarily approaching this from the perspective that he is special in some way. I feel as though sometimes this could lead to a child feeling like they are somehow separate or apart from everyone else. Rather, it may be best to be rather matter-of-fact or mundane about it. The fact is, many people live their lives with some kind of issue they carry. And even if you are not born with something, the odds of developing something are so high, normal vs. special no longer seems meaningful.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, I have told my son many times he has it, but I still do not know that he \"gets\" it, and your son may not either. It could very well be years before he realizes this is a thing he was born with. So I would not be too worried about him taking it too hard.\n\nVery best of luck to you both. If you ever want to talk, please do not hesitate to pm me directly, and the community is here if you ever need to reach out. And do not be afraid to reach out to the Marfan foundation. They are very kind people who want to help. I was diagnosed at the same age. Just tell him, tell him why you worry and what your concerns are. I had a pretty good understanding back then, and I know my parents had it worse than me. Just be frank, cry if you need to. Personally, I was not traumatized at all.

Temperament,  sense of humour, thoughtfulness, creativity,  passion, and more all play a role. \n\nMy advice to your brother is the same that I would give to any boy his age (and that I wish someone ihad given me. ) **Do not worry about relationships yet. Focus on finding out who you are.**  Try things - cooking, music, art, theatre - whatever strikes his fancy. Join clubs, strike up conversations, meet people. It can be hard and terrifying.  Sometimes he will be rejected, or there will not be any connection. That sucks, but it is life. \n\nBut the more things we do, the more people we meet, the greater the opportunity to find a person who is as in to us as we are them. It is totally possible to do both. I have had several long term girlfriends and more than a few casual flings. I am actually currently overweight, so my brand of Marfans seems a bit different from yours (or most people) but I am actively working on that. Positivity and being friendly and outgoing seems to be what worked for me the most. I have decent musculature, but that comes from my line of work and the allowable activities that I participate in. Definitely check in with your doctor about some good activities for you to pursue. Hile there are some definite no's and some definite yes' for all of us, Marfan Syndrome can vary drastically from person to person, so it is important to follow what your doctor recommends for you specifically.

I am sure your brother will be fine  :) My advice will be, do not fixate too much on your body, it is what it is. Work with what you have! If you are super insecure about your body - learning how to dress in certain ways may help with your confidence! I am 6'3feet,19 years old and have had 3 surgeries in my eye but despite that i have so much fat in my stomach and legs that none can tell i have marfan and this is because i ate a lot when i was like 9 or 11 but my arms and legs are skinny yet it does not matter because you can do moderate to little exercise with less weights and high reps with that you can build a decent body.\n\nAs for girlfriend do not worry about that. The right person will never care about all this stuff. I used to b a loner all my life but ever since i stopped thinking bad about myself i kid you not i have had 3 girlfriends from the period of 2020 to present day alone so yeah stop worrying about stupid things\n\nJust keep him well fed and a good diet/exercise and regular check ups and i wish both of us a good life ahead:)", "imagine this, if you will\u2026 \u2026being born a human, yes, of all animals in existence you were born a human, never mind the odds of that happening but then imagine being the 1 in around 5,000 to be born with a tissue disorder which severely impacts your physical and emotional quality of life, yikes!

Merry christmas. \n\nI have several physical symptoms but the ones that are life threatening, like a large aortic diameter, are controlled by now (I am 21, maybe they have not shown yet idk, hopefully they wont). Because of this, the genetist that I went to did not want to order me the genetic exam for Marfan Syndrome. I wanted to ask the people that had the genetic test done and it turned out to be positive for Marfan's, how was the process? What convinced your genetist? What symptoms you had that contributed to the decision of you being given a green light for genetic testing?. Also, if anyone has experience with genetic testing through Invitae, I would really appreciate your testimony on your experience. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks and happy holidays. I have aortic enlargement and dislocated lenses as well as 10+ on the Beighton scale and was diagnosed by a geneticist at 9 years old based on those factors. They did not order my genetic testing because my parents were opposed to it. I followed up as an adult and got the testing done, and tested positive. \n\nThe geneticist is really where you need to start. They will get your Beighton score and look at the reports from cardiology/ophthalmology/whatever else you have and determine if they think you should have testing done. If they do not want to order it it will be because you are not showing enough diagnostic symptoms and especially without family history that could lead them to believe that you do not have it. I am not sure what your symptoms are but there are also other syndromes like Marfan that can cause some similar problems. I received an echocardiogram when I was four after my father randomly died of aortic dissection. Everyone in my family was cleared except me. Now I have my aorta monitored every 6 months via echocardiogram and ekg once a year. An echo is like a 30 minute process that is not the least bit invasive (it is what pregnant women get) so I do not know why your doctor would not allow you to get one? If yours is considered enlarged like mine afterward they might have you get an mri to confirm the measurements. But like I said an echo is not a particularly difficult thing to get done so I would try to arrange one if possible to just know for sure. Just order it via Invitae.com and pick the TAAD panel.", "Should we be optimistic about this? ", "Heart problems? So, I recently found out about Marfan's and I match everything except for flat feet, stretch marks, and heart issues. I have not gotten an EKG or a scan yet, but is it possible that the symptoms will creep up on me? Like an aortal dissection without any warning at all. ", "Let us talk about dating I have noticed a common theme crop up in several posts over the last few months. Many of you feel discouraged about finding a partner, typically because of how Marfan Syndrome makes you look. So let us talk about that.\n\nFor my part, I am older. I have a beautiful wife, and two equally beautiful children. But like many of you, I was also frustrated by how difficult it was to date people. Most were not attracted to me. I looked different. I get it. But what I also discovered is that this phase only happened when I was young. Young people are superficial. It is nothing against young people, I was one myself once, but it is just a typical (but not always true) fact. It is the hormones, it is the incredibly competitive culture that school can be, it is lots of things. Once you move beyond all that, people start maturing. People start looking at you for who you are, and not how you look compared to all the others. This is the stage where you will see an uptick in people who are interested in you. But here is the thing: you need to love yourself first. If you do not, they will not either. People love other people who are confident, kind, and respect themselves and others. That can be harder for us because we just went through this entire stage where no one was interested in us, so if they are not interested, maybe we are not worth the love? Codwallup. Fiddlefaddle. Enough of that chicanery. Other old-timey phrases.\n\nSo my salient points are these:\n\n1. Be patient. As you get older, so too you will find that people will be more interested in you.\n2. Love yourself. If you are not happy with you, no one else will be. \n\nAlso, be funny. That also really helps. My wife will tell you. I need to print this and frame it so I can look on it when I have my bad days. I have good days and bad days. Some days I feel like John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever., strutting around town. Other days, I feel like a sad clown.\n\nWhat drives me to my sad clown days is when I think to myself, \"I am so awesome, why do not the lady folk see that?\"\n\nYou are so right in being patient. I have some beautiful women that were into me and while they ended, 2/3 had nothing to do with me and I have to be patient in knowing that the 4th time could be the charm and it will be great! You are sexy and you know it.\n\nSo clap your hands? idk. I appreciate it! I did not realize you were the same Redditor who asked me the question on the other post. Thanks again for the feedback. i am glad you brought this up.  This was a big reason about why I signed up for mentoring through the NMF.\n\nAs I tell people \"You are different, but not *that* different.  The good news is you will find someone.  The bad news you will screw it up just like every other person on the planet has, and it will hurt more than anythings every hurt before.  And you will get better and move on just like everyone else.  And none of it will have anything to do with your FBN1 gene\".\n\nThe \"love yourself\" part is one of those things that people go nuts over when you are older, but it is true for all stages.  There is something to it people pick up on.  Own it, digest it, do not let it stop you.  Carry yourself with confidence, be honest with your partner about the insecurities you have worked through (as the relationship progresses).  Pair that with some well fitting clothes and you will do just fine.\n\nAnd I will say, around my mid-twenties, the fact that I was managing a chronic illness was weirdly attractive.  Did not see that one coming.  But keeping up appointments, knowing the features of insurance, etc, it is a weird thing that people see and go \"that is good partner material right there\".  Doubly so for surgery.  Triple so for having managed your insecurities and being able to talk about them.\n\nThe double edged sword there is that if you do not, if you cling to a relationship because you feel like you are unattractive and who could want you... you will poison it dead.  Your baggage is your greatest asset and sign of strength... as long as you have it sorted, stowed, and managed. \n\nIf you have not had/needed chest reconstruction: trust me, no one cares about your chest.  Most intimate moment I had involved a suction cup noise made by her chest and my chest during activities.  I do not think either of us ever laughed so hard.  If you have to sleep in a weird way or something because of back issues or whatever, again, people do not care (just share the covers).\n\nIf you have had surgery, the scars are not a problem.  Most people I have been with actually like them in a \"badass\" kind of way.\n\nOh, also, just because it is literally listed as a symptom, in-case it is gotten to anyone's head:  When they say \"marfanoid facial structure\", yes there are some thing's you would notice if you are looking for them, but none of them are a-typical or unattractive.  It is kind of like saying someone \"looks Irish\" or the like. \n\nFinally, few things on the kids front, some of which was new info since I have been seeing a lovely maternal fetal medicine doc:\n\n1) Yes, marf is autosomal dominant (meaning 50/50 shot), but it is absolutely something you can screen out if you go the IVF route.  Any hereditary condition which has a single gene identified responsible can be screened for.  You have the option to have children you know will not have marfan's if you choose so.  I was surprised to find this kind of screening is actually quite boring now.\n\n2) Pregnancy for women with marf carries some risks (most associated with delivery).  It is important to see a specialist if you become pregnant, and a good idea to talk before you \"try\". Thank you for posting a positive note like this. I think we have all struggled with this regardless of our gender or orientation. \n\nThis is great. Yes to more posts like these. My 14 year old son was recently diagnosed, and shows more physical symptoms now as he is maturing. Thank you for writing this. He does not talk about it, but a geneticist was pretty brutal going over his body at 13. Not that the Dr meant harm, but it is such a difficult age. I noticed his shoulders drop and his eyes lowered as the doc went over every single thing wrong with him physically. Thank you for writing this, and sharing. I hope my beautiful inside-out son will have this kind of confidence. I am doing all I can to try to instill it in him. Not going to lie, jr high and high school were hard as far as dating went. Kids are mean. Once I was out of high school though, I was able to surround myself with the kind of people I wanted to be around. Then things started looking up. Now I am happily married to my beautiful wife for nearly ten years. Lucky for me, she likes guys that are tall, skinny and slightly disheveled. Yep, right on the money!", "I have the symptoms , but never diagnosed ", "I feel stigmatized Hi am 19 and i go to college. The thing is that i feel stigmatized due to me having marfan syndrome which lead to depression and social anxiety over the years, am scared and afraid of what people might think even though its mot that noticeable .

I have talked to therapists over the years but whatever they say i still feel stigmatized.

I have been told to keep it at 15 pounds or lighter, but I do not think that is based on any scientific study. Just go slow and listen to your body. But check with your doctor before starting any exercise plan.  No as far as I know I do not have Marfans. I was just curious Many weightlift to help with the appearance of their pectus excavatum. (Sp?) Does not lifting increase the probability of a lense slip in the eye? I have been told to not lift anything heavy at all anymore or even run because the risk is so high.  Friends on the pain and their severity. Some, (perhaps most) people are a hard no. Others are advised to go slowly and carefully. My family has always done heavy lifting as part of our day to day work without suffering any ill effects. Post aortic root replacement surgery  Marfan patient here. My cardiologist advised to avoid heavy lifting. Cardio  and calisthenics: ok \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc  Also post surgery. I was told not to lift anything heavier than a milk jug.  Can I ask you age? Just curious.  19 :) I was 21 at my surgery... makes me wonder if my doc is careless or if yours is careful.  When I was diagnosed at 14, doc always told me the minute my aorta dilated above 4 cm, it was go time. In a span of ~16 months it jumped from 3.6 to 4.1, when it had not moved from 3.6 in years. Thus, immediate scheduling for this summer. \n\nThink it is all on circumstance and what is best for the individual.  Can you gain muscle mass or just strength?\n Are you asking if it is physically possible for me? Or if I am allowed from my cardiologist? Can you answer both? I did gain muscle mass. But not much due to not doing heavy weight lifting, just cardio and calisthenics.  It really does depend on the individual, I would seek medical advice. Some cannot run some can...some can push 30kg some only 15kg. Me personally I have lifted intermittently for past 6 years and only discovered marfan last year. I am waiting for my heart check up and I will hopefully get straight back at it. \n\nDefinitely not advisery though definitely depends on severity. I have Pectus Caritanum so I kind of have to.

Now, guys with MFS face a more challenging road because it generally is more \u201cOK\u201d for women to be too thin than it is for guys, so that means our only real physical option is to bulk up, which is risky because of our aorta but also difficult because our gains are a LOT slower and smaller than it is for able-bodied people, so, is it worth the risk to bulk and escape the physique that is so harshly judged by others? or is it better to evade risk, but face a harsher life? \n\nWell, that is up to you, but personally i am going with the former because i am sick of missing out on a normal life from something out of my control,and whatever risks come with it i will deal with it oh well. it is unfair and is irritating once you connect all of the hate you have received to your core problem but it is just our reality I guess .

Unless you have been diagnosed with a potential for aortic dissection then you can engage in pretty decent amounts of exercise without fear. If you have the coverage you should request a check up regularly, every few years should do, more as you hit middle age. It is not something that can always be spotted before it happens but it is also a delusion to think you should not be able to engage in pretty strenuous cardio etc. \n\nHowever you are likely an ectomorph (google it) &amp; gaining mass will be difficult for you in the way you want (musculature). We are closer to lemurs than lions &amp; genetically predisposed to that as you mention. You can succeed at the kind of shaping you want but it is going to be harder than most people have it by far. \n\nGet your diet right to help promote growth, get a LOT of cardio (swimming probably best since it is more full bodied), then supplement with upper body / lower body workouts. Do not skip the lower body even if your goal is upper body growth. Your body is a system &amp; it thinks your lower body is more important so it is not going to help your upper body grow if your lower body is too weak. Obviously core strength training is helpful too. \n\nGood luck. Kind Of in a same situation, I got tired of the comments and stereotypes so I decided to bulk up. I gained 10 pounds but when I went for bloodwork, all my numbers went up. Cholesterol, good and bad, went up, blood pressure, everything. I looked better, but I was in better health, before the ten pounds. I get it, everyone wants to fit in and be desired, but if it comes to a point where you are making yourself unhealthy, or risk death, it is not worth it. Absolutely it irritates me. I was classified as obese because I gained so much weight to try to \u201cbalance\u201d myself out as a kid. I am 21 now and have since lost about 80 pounds and am sitting around a 23 BMI. Still tho I would like to be more muscular. As for the body features there is only so much you can do even with invasive/non-invasive surgeries. I have learned over the years to just accept myself for who I am and accept that there will be a lot of girls who do not find me attractive enough to give me a chance and that is fine, confidence and how you carry yourself can overpower a room and make you realize not every person cares how you look anyway. ", "Fianc\u00e9 was diagnosed with Marfans today. What should we expect for our future? Got back from John Hopkins earlier today, and the provider there essentially confirmed it.  She needs to have surgery on a small aneurysm they found by chance a few weeks ago.\n\nWhat we did not really get a chance to talk about was what should we expect for living with Marfans to look like moving forward.  We were mostly focused on her upcoming surgery. Wow that is amazing that they were able to catch it! That is so good they caught it now rather than when it became a life or death emergency. A lot of women with Marfan Syndrome who become pregnant also experience a rapid growth of the aneurysm. (Just in case this is relevant). If you have children there is generally a 50% chance to pass it on. ( has a lot of great resources.  \n\n\nIt is important to be diagnosed by a geneticist who will order a DNA/connective tissue panel blood test, because there are hundreds of different mutations which cause Marfan Syndrome.  \n\n\nFor me, life with Marfan Syndrome is fairly normal, but my symptoms and signs have always been on the mild side. I go for a yearly echocardiogram every year and that is about it. I avoid extreme heavy lifting and I take my -sartan medication. I will probably need surgery at some point in the next 10 years but it is just a matter of monitoring for me because my aneurysm is very mild.  \n\n\nThere are quite a few options for surgery now, if the aneurysm is caught early enough, PEARS surgery is an option. ( That is what I hope to get. Although it is not available in Canada or USA yet.  \n\n\nI have not needed surgery, but I understand that the 2-3 options available are fairly routinely done now and are very successful. Depending on the option, I believe a lot of Marfan patients will have to go on blood thinning medication if they have an artificial valve implanted.  \n\n\nI suspect there may be some major stress and what will seem like major changes, but I think your lives will go back to normal with some minor modifications, for example no extremely heavy lifting, taking your prescriptions, more routine monitoring, etc. The main danger with aneurysms is that they induce no symptoms and many people never know about them until it is too late.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9e was diagnosed early and will probably have a yearly ultrasound follow-up from now on. Compared to people who have no clue about their health issue, she is now among the lucky ones! It depends. Marfan affects people very differently. Some have a lot of pain, some do not. Some need surgery in their eyes, some do not I think we learned in this whole process there are some family members on her mother's side who have Marfans.  Fortunately we do not have any children, nor do either of us desire them.  Just her and I.  I think the big thing for me is the potential life expectancy simple google searches seem to indicate people with Marfans can generally live a long life.  But this is all so new so I am not sure what to really expect at this point. The life expectancy used to be lower because there were not as many ways to successfully detect and treat aneurysms.\n\nGenerally Marfan patients are put on -Sartan medications (Like Valsartan or Losartan), or Beta-Blockers, (like Atenolol), which slow the growth of aortic aneurysms. It is important to note while these are blood pressure lowering medications - lowering blood pressure directly is not what helps the aortic aneurysms (as other blood pressure lowering medications do not help)\n\nThere are supplements some people take like trans-resveratrol but that is not proven to help in humans with Marfans, only mice. I would check with your doctor if they advise anything.\n\nTogether with the medication, surgery, and yearly echocardiograms (sometimes they will do a CT scan instead to get a better image), the life expectancy should be normal.\n\n  \nI used to be very concerned with average life expectancy when I was a child, but now I know more about Marfan syndrome, I am not worried.  \n\n\nBecause so many people have so many different signs/symptoms/problems with their condition, she will generally be able to figure out what problems she has from Marfan syndrome and come up with ways to manage the symptoms.  \n\n\nFor example,  \nMaybe she has scoliosis, or she does not.  \nDislocated lenses in eyes, or not.  \nHyperflexibility, or not.  \nFlat Feet, or not.  \nLoose Joints/Joint Pain, or not  \nAbove average height, or not  \nAbove average armspan, or not  \nChest deformity, or not.  \nVery Skinny/difficulty gaining muscle, or not...  \n\n\nThe only real issues that can come over time are the cardiovascular (predominantly aortic aneurysm) and eye issues (sometimes retinal detachment) - but these can be treated if caught early.  \n\n\nI believe with your regular checkups to the cardiologist and regular echocardiograms, you will learn more about the condition and what state the aneurysm is in. For example you can find online what risk the aneurysm is depending on it is size, however your cardiologist will be able to tell you this as well. In my case, my aneurysm is mild risk. If it grows some more (which it probably will) I will then have to consider surgery. For me , marfans has not changed much besides give me an excuse to not go on roller coaster I do not want to do. \u201cOh I have a heart issue other wise I would\u201d works every time Marfans is very highly individual. My experiences with Marfan syndrome are different than the ones of most people in this sub. There is really not a lot of general advice except she should get echocardiograms every 6 months or so (I do, and I do not even have the classical heart problems of Marfans -- she does) and you should seriously consider whether it is medically prudent for her to ever get pregnant. With her heart issues, my personal vote would be no. Pregnancy can (but does not always) really wreak havoc on people with Marfans syndrome -- to the extent where my local support group back in the day was basically nothing but friends' death stories. This is also unfortunately when a lot of people find out they have Marfans (post aortic tear, which may or may not be too late depending on severity. Classic symptom is severe shoulder pain.)  \n\n\nOther advice is follow the advice of her doctors religiously. Johns Hopkins is the best -- keep going either there or Stanford. Most hospitals and providers are not equipped to handle Marfans patients in my personal experience (and again, I have a very mild case compared to the folks on here.) I would not be risking any kind of major surgery with any doctor who does not immediately know what Marfans is and can recite all its implications forwards, backwards, and sideways.   \n\n\nWith her heart issues, she will be told not to do any isometric exercises. Any weight lifting/rock climbing/scuba diving/etc days are over. Defer to the dr on whether any cardio is possible. This is probably the hardest part of having Marfans \\*for me\\*, because there are so many things I just cannot safely participate in and experience.   \n\n\nHave her get her skin checked (good idea for anyone), eyes checked regularly, heart checked all the time. My personal version of Marfans has been mostly orthopedic problems; she may or may not have these. But it is likely a good idea to refrain from most intensive physical activities for the heart issues alone. Still, you might look into physical therapy/orthopedics specialist/etc for management of chronic pain + joint/etc issues if she has any. I get injured very frequently by such benign things as walking around or sleeping (any position.) She may or may not experience the same. It appears to get worse with age (and I am 23.) I would not worry too much about life expectancy since now she knows she has Marfans. The biggest Marfans danger is not knowing you have it, because then you do not know that you should not be lifting weights, should not be scuba diving, etc. That is a big reason why people drop dead -- not knowing they have it and therefore what to do or not do. If you know and follow the Drs advice, and do not have a super severe case, life expectancy is likely to be relatively normal tbh.", "Grandpa (passed 2014 age 88) (look at them digits) and EDS grandmother (passed 2019 age 93) \u2026.

Maybe I am just getting paranoid and I just have long fingers. I do not really have any of the other symptoms, I cannot tell if I had crowded teeth since I already had braces on and off. Wingspan is about equal with height Can you fill me in on why people care so much about this one sign? It is beginning to look like munchausen \"marfan's\" should be it is own disorder. Observe the OP asking about their heart, when clearly nothing is there to be Marfan\u2019s. But, why is the Strindberg sign gaining so much traction lately? You are pretty much right. I think people are trying to ask about this specific thing to get around the mods' asking for diagnosis post ban.\n\nAnd hypochondria is already a thing, tho I think it has to be pretty extreme to get a diagnosis. Plenty of people have hypermobile fingers without having a complex and rare genetic disorder like mfs. Unless a lot of marfy ducks are in a row I really would not worry if I were you. It is normal to sometimes have a metallic taste in your mouth after doing exercise. A positive hand sign does not necessarily mean you have a heart issue. To determine if you have a heart issue or not, your doctor will check your blood pressure and do other tests such as an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart). Mild aneurysms generally do not show symptoms unless there are also other heart issues.  \n\n\nIf you are concerned that you have heart issues because you are showing signs and symptoms or you have a family history of connective tissue or heart disorders, I would suggest making an appointment with your doctor. I think people get medical signs confused and believe it means you have something. when really it is just like symptoms and you can have them without having a disorder or illness. and to clarify, i was just linking the picture as a sign of hypermobility that can be related to marfan. but ofc hypermobility is not solely a marfan trait. and i have been diagnosed as hypermobile no doubt. i find these diagnoses interesting as i have issues with my shoulders, hips, and knees, but i do not know what any of it means. But i am not going to post these because it is so dominated by the thumb sign being the correct marker, that it seems people without it have taken to imitating it.", "Doctor does not recommend beta blockers Hey, Im 19 from brazil and I have done a valve reparation/aorta root surgery last year and I have the Marfans diagnostic. I am currently being checked in every 6 months by two cardiologists and none of then recommend me beta blockers and I do not understand this. \n\nI have done some researches and it seems to be a consensus that they are really helpful, but I dont want to say that to my docs and somehow subjulgate their knowledge lol. Does anyone has an explanation for this decision? I really dont want to do more surgeries like that one lol do you have high blood pressure? mine gets pretty high along with palpitations so i have been on beta blockers for some years now. maybe they never saw anything concerning bp wise? i do not know much about it or if that is the main thing they look for but that is my guess Mine is normal or maybe naturaly low, could be it. When I measure its always 12/8 or 11/7 Blood pressure is usually measured like 120/80. In general beta blockers can have side effects but usually marfan patients are on either Losartan or beta blockers unless there is a contradiction or some other issue. I recommend that you would ask your cardiologist directly as to why you are not on beta blockers or Losartan.", "Vaccine eligibility Hi everyone.

May I ask delicately, but why does the pneumothorax scare you more so then the other conditions? i have a great fear of breathing issues and having to stay in the hospital. i have been told i most likely have marfans and even if i did not pneumothoraxes are still common in people with my build. i just want to know if their really as common as they seem to be portrayed I see. Well first you are very brave to come and ask others for help or information. First I would not worry any about it because you do not know if you are Marfan or not. If not, then the likelihood of having one is very very rare. Less than 200,000 a year and only 5-10% more likely with Marfans. In the off chance it happens, then you go to the hospital and have it inflated. It is one of te easier things to correct with Marfans. You are bigger than both of those issues. Worrying will do nothing but bad for you until you have a clear battle ahead of you. Lot of scary things in Marfans and the world. You got to acknowledge them, fight them, and keep moving forward. If not then the anxiety and worry will thwart your life and growth as a human. I wasted so many years worrying. I know how you feel, and if you take nothing else from this conversation, please please please, do not let that worry plant seeds in your mind. I wish you all the best. I had one a year ago.

Unfortunately, is not offered in the states. I live in the US but my insurance will not cover an operation abroad.

Yes, I had the op in April, patient number 208. It went really smoothly, I am now off all my meds. Let me know if you have any questions \ud83d\ude42 I have some because I just had the David procedure in August. What is the difference?! I found this on David vs PEARS from Tal Goelsworthy, the inventor if PEARS. \u201cHugh Bentall pioneered the Total Root Replacement(TRR) operation in 1968, BUT it involved a mechanical replacement aortic valve that mandates anti-coagulation therapy for life. Magdi Yacoub and then Tirone David pioneered 2 variants of Valve Sparing Root Replacement(VSRR) that preserves the natural aortic valve leaflets and allows the patient to avoid anti-coagulation therapy BUT it is a technically demanding operation that does fail requiring not infrequent re-operation. I was offered TRR in 1993 and developed PEARS surgery (with Tom Treasure and John Pepper) to avoid anti-coagulation therapy and to retain all my own aortic structures.\u201d Are you in the US? If so, did you get insurance to pay? Thanks No, I had it done in the UK under the NHS Thanks for responding. Much appreciated! Should you be off your meds? You need to protect the rest of your aorta and have it scanned yearly. The David procedure has been done for 20+ years and it works well. It came out a few years after my mechanical valve. \n\nDo not be worried about having it done vs. the new procedure with a much shorter track record! You do not have to be on the \"bleeding edge\"! \ud83d\ude02 My concerns with the David procedure are the use of the cardiopulmonary bypass, the higher mortality rate, and the need for reoperation. \n\nPEARS has been around for 15 years with zero deaths, zero reoperations, and is a quicker and less invasive surgery. You get to keep all your own parts. \n\nI will go with the David procedure if left with no other options but I would prefer the PEARS. This all depends on money and my insurance. \n\nThanks for your feedback, much appreciated. I had the pears procedure and, from what I have been told it is the way to go.  It delays the need for a much more invasive root replacement that sometimes does not last and needs reoperation (and is more risky).  For me, if you can do it it is a no-brainer.  There is no downside as, if it does not work, you can have the root replacement at a later date.   \n\nIn the medical industry there is a tendency to go for tried and tested operations because doctors do not like change.  However this actually stifles progress.  Remember doctors are not scientists, they are medics, and, unless they can give you a bonafide reason not to have the pears procedure, trust the research and go with your head.  \n\nIn my situation, the opposing doctors could not give a reason other than \u201cit is not tried and tested\u201d but as you say, the 15 years of results have looked as they should and I cannot see any obvious downside, only an upside.

Start with a primary care physician and express your concerns just like you did here. They should refer you to a cardiologist and geneticist so that you can be tested for the FBN1 or other Marfan related gene mutation, and monitored by a cardiologist with an echo/EKG. There is no harm in seeking clarification and it could save your life. Cardiac echo is inexpensive and can be a good first step, if cost is an issue when working with your primary care doc.  My daughters doc never connected the dots at first until the echo. Always worth going to the doctor because ,imo, this condition is still relatively new and I am a bit curious on how you have been these past few years without medication n such. Unfortunately even if the echo does not pin point it bc that is possible as every case varies, but that would be a more comforting note than having marfans for sure. My mother back in the 70s was diagnosed with a heart murmur and it was not until I was 5 back in 03 that they rediagnosed her bc they had just labeled that condition, figured out I had it and boom, now they know she does too. So I believe it is possible you do have it. And if you need a for sure , it is a geneic issue and by testing that , it is a 100 percent of finding out, next bet would be echo n then last but not least self diagnosis  if you are having any health issues talk to a doctor. from what you have said you dont really seem to have too many signs of marfans. one thing that I read that is good is you said u have flexible elbows, most people with marfans including myself have reduced elbow extension. definetly talk to a doctor about tour possible heart issue though, better safe than sorry. My son is facing the same questions. He has different symptoms but many of the classic symptoms. He has heart problems and no 20 year old should have heart problems. Getting tested is not going to give you the disorder. It is not going to do anything except educate you on your health. \n\nI was told I could have Marfan when I was a teenager. I ignored it and consequently I may have passed this disorder onto my son. That is a huge responsibility. \n\nGet the peace of mind.

It does not seem to be related to Marfan Syndrome. In fact, up to 35% of people may not have ever have had wisdom teeth. It is definitely genetic though:  ( I do not know that it is related to marfans as I am the only person in my family with it, but my dad does not have any wisdom teeth, but my mom does. And I have bottom wisdom teeth but was born without a top pair. I have mine. I was told that I did not have any, then I got my lowers. Only one of them was even able to cut the surface (wonky tho), the other grew perpendicular so they were garbage.\n\nMy dad figured the reason the dentist could not see them may have been marfan.

I have not connected this with the Marfan syndrome.", "Question: How do you decide if what you feel under physical duress is normal discomfort or something that requires medical attention? Hello all, new here, and had a question about your general experiences with Marfans. Having read the guidlines and such, I feel like clarifying this is a question on personal experience and not about diagnosis. I am currently in college and have quite the pedestrian commute compared to what I used to and came across this subreddit. Since I do not know anyone else who has Marfan Syndrome, I figured I would ask about something I have had a problem with in the past.\n\nFor context, my university is built on a large hill, and as such there is a lot of steep uphill/downhill commuting. My first semester here, my gen-ed credit classes were spread all over the campus, so I would start at the bottom of the hill in the morning and make my way uphill throughout the day. This led to me having a collapsed lung, but it was treated fairly quickly and I got back into my routine just fine. Currently, now that I am onto my major courses, my commute is not nearly as severe, but I still struggle with it sometimes.\n\nSo, as for my question, how do you all decide if you are just feeling the discomforts that can be fairly normal (in my case, being out of breath, pain in my lower legs and back, elevated pulse), and serious signs of danger (my primary concern being heart issues, even though I have never shown abnormal aortic growth, but my anxiety makes me dwell on the possibility)? So far, my rule of thumb has been \"discomfort means stop and rest, pain means something is wrong,\" and it has worked well so far, i.e, the collapsed lung. But since I have never meet anyone, aside from my family and cardiologist, who are aware of Marfans, much less have it, I figured I would ask here what people who have it look for when they think something might be an emergency. I am only 22, but Marfans has make me think long-term most of my life, so if anyone who has more experience living woth Marfans could share what they look out for, I would appreciate it.\n\nApologies for wall of text. Sorry, I am not really sure if I have marfans yet so I cannot really help but I am curious what a collapsed lung feels like, as im tall and lanky and assume the possibility exists for me. Does it feel like one side does not fill up? Does it hurt every breath? It is a little surreal looking back on it, actually. We did not even know I had a collapsed lung until the 3 week mark, from what we could tell. So it is a more gradual process than you would expect, at least in my case.\n\nThe thing that tipped us off was a burning sensation in my chest and being out of breath longer and more frequently than I usually am after my commute. So it is not always as dramatic as I thought it would have been before I experienced it. But it is usually a very gradual process that has plenty of time to be treated with no lasting post-op repurcusions.\n\nAlso the doctors really put my mind at ease. I would had some other surguries before, so this was minor by comparison. And with how common it is, and the treatment having been the same for like a century now, my surgeon could count on 1 hand how many times the treatment went wrong in any way out of the _thousands_ he would treated throughout his medical career. So once I was in the hospital, within half an hour I was not really that worried. Wow that is interesting. Were you active in sports or anything your whole life as well? Not really. My family was very proactive in keeping an eye on my health, so sports were mostly off the table. But I am not much into sports anyway, so I never felt like I was missing out. Was more into reading and video games.\n\nIt is actually funny, my best basketball moments were backwards shots since my eyes were unreliable. I have the same concern and follow the same general rule.. hiking would be the only activity that I sometimes experience borderline discomfort/ pain and if that is the case I always take a break. I have asked my cardiologist for a stress test so I know where the line is. But she said there is no pushing it.. I should always be at a pace that I can easily have a conversation Good to know that the rule works for other people. That alone honestly helps ease my mind on the topic, having anxiety and all. I do not hike myself, though on busy days, walking around WKU's campus can feel like a hike. So it is good to know that the general rule can apply to activities far more strenuous than my day to day. This is a great question. It is been the crux of many Marfanoids I do believe and the biggest concern for me also. I fear there is no way to truly tell which is what makes these connective tissues disorders so scary and debilitating. Especially if you suffer from anxiety because then you have to contend with that as well. And the biggest concern is the aorta dissection and you can be asymptomatic your whole life until you have a major trauma which is why it is so important to have your regular echoes and CTs. If you really need peace of mind when you are having a discomfort or pain you can always go to the doctor or ER if you think it is dire. Everyone feels pain differently so I would not hesitate either. I have been dealing with this problem for 15 years usually spurred by a heart arrhythmia or a chest pain because I knew my aorta was enlarged since I was 20ish, am now 35 and just recently had the surgery for repair. The surgery helped a lot with my anxiety and not just the physical problems that it corrected. \nBut as for determining if a stimuli is serious or not, it is good to know which Marfan problems are serious and which ones are not. Most of the Marfan problems we get are not serious just rather difficult to live with until they are corrected day to day. Example being your collapsed lung; you walked around with one for a long time like a hero. The eye problems, the joint pain, the subluxation and a lot of other issues that arise are all manageable and can be corrected or treated to some degree through normal pcp visits and then seeing the specialist in that system that is effected. It is ultimately the aneurysms that should scare us the most. And if you are doing everything on your end to prevent a dissection ie not lifting heavyweight, overexerting yourself, coupled with the proper testing then you are doing mostly everything in your power to stay safe and in control of your life. Marfan syndrome sucks and I hate it but I will fight it everyday. Well said. This is honestly the first time I have heard this kind of stuff from fellow \"Marfanoids\" (never heard that term until you used it), so having this context really helps. College is stressful enough, so these responses have made me much less anxious about the physical side of it knowing even if Marfans can be varied in severity, others can manage the symptoms just fine if they are as careful as my family has been so far. Always good to have a sample size outside of just myself for these kind of things. Ah one of the best parts of Marfan\u2019s has been the ability to play the \u201cPain Bingo\u201d... \n\nBreaking Back? \nLegless Legs? \n\u2018Un\u2019Lucky Lungs? \nHorrible Heart? \nJust more Joints?\n\nOh the fun, it is like each day brings a whole new day of pain! \ud83d\ude1e\n\nI gave up working out what pain it is now, if it lasts more than \u2018normal\u2019 I would get it checked out. Although \u2018normal\u2019 seems to take longer and longer to ease up as you get older. At least I am single and do not have the nagging to get checked every time there is another twinge, lol Fair enough.\n\nSide note: It is actually funny, my shorthand breakdown of Marfans to people who are unfamiliar with it is \"picture a slot machine, but one with like 10 wheels on it, and every single one can land on a either physical effect with a seperate random chance deciding severity, or no effect at all, and it is just luck of the draw.\" But I might switch to \"pain bingo\" cuz that is too on point to pass up. I have it and I have a similar issue. The city where I live has a lot of hills and if I do not get to school early enough to get the close parking lot I have to walk up a hill from the one further away and it can be exhausting, not to mention how easily I get hit from the beta blockers. I try to find ways to make it easier for myself such as getting to school early to try to get close parking or taking an elevator instead of stairs if I have to go up 3+ floors. My general rule is how much out of the normal I feel and how much it takes me to recover. I have had two pneumothorax though I do not think they were from pushing myself too much so on that point I cannot relate but I would say if you feel like you cannot recover quickly enough then definitely take a break. If you feel your heart is racing too much or if you feel like if making it all the way without stopping may lead you to take a break then I would suggest taking a break. I will say though, as with anything else, keeping a good light exercise routine and healthy eating will always improve how much you can do even when you are limited. I would suggest if you think your hike is too much maybe look into a bicycle or scooter that will help with the commute? The commute is not nearly as bad now that I have started on my major courses, since they are all in the nearest building to my dorm. So the commute has gone from nearly the entire campus to 2 blocks at most making things overall better on that front.\n\nI will have to look into the diet advice, since I have been meaning to work on that anyway.

I know they say life expectancy for those with Marfan\u2019s is similar to the general population so long as you seek proper medical care, take your medicine, etc. \n\nI am curious how much truth there is to this though because I often hear about marfs passing away at younger ages. \n\nIf you know anyone who passed with marfans, would you mind sharing at what age they passed and the cause? Or any other info you have on this topic. Thanks so much! My father has a good friend with Marfans who I would assume is in his early 50s now, I have not heard any mention of him passing away though he needed work done on his heart a few years back. Most stories I know of are people who passed away young are because they did not know they had marfans. I know of a family  who is father passed, who was in his 40s I think, because he just did not know and then had an aortic dissection and did not survive. There is also an NFL player I believe who lost a new born to neo natal marfans.  Unfortunately there was not a lot to be done in that situation even if they had known about it before hand. \n\nI know of these stories cause the national marfan foundation started an awareness campaign in my community and they chose to highlight these stories for their charity walk.  \n\nI was just telling someone else that about 20 years ago it was very common for me to go to a new Dr and have them know nothing about marfans. Back then I think the average life expectancy was in the 60s. In the past decade or so I have seen a big turn around in doctors knowledge of marfans syndrome. I would say that is partly due to the NMF but also just the internet being accessible side l source of information.  Now the life expectancy has risen to the national average. This is something I struggle with as someone who has recently found out about my enlarged (44mm) aorta. A lot of posts are like hey life expectancy is fine as long as your heart and aorta hold up. My grandfather passed at 43. After a valve replacement he got endocarditis (infection of the heart) Twice. The 2nd time did not respond to antibiotics and he ended up in a medical trial for new antibiotics. these turned out to be carcinogenic which lead to his death. \n\nhe had also damaged his liver and kidneys taking pain killers due to the pain associated with Marfans\n\nHowever his identical twin brother is still alive and in reasonable good health at 64. he had a heart valve replacement about 6 years ago. \n\nby great grandfather died in his later 40s (confirmed Marfans) and his wife (My great grandmother) died in her early 40s (suspected Marfans). both died during heart valve replacement surgery (my great grandmother was one of the first in the UK to have this surgery so her dying made sense...) . neither of them were suspected of having marfans until they died and this was the official start of my family medical history. \n\nFrom my family's point of view the heart valve replacement surgery has been the main cause of death, and its worth noting that survival rates and post-op recovery keeps improving. \n\nwhen we talk about knowing someone (especially older family members) who has died its really important to remember that heart surgeries keep improving, survival rates are better in the last 10 years, 20 years, 30 years etc... My father has Marfan's, and so do I. He is in his mid-70s, and I am nearly 40. \n\nThe real secret is to live 'till you die - most folks with normal hearts do not figure this one out quickly enough. aw i love this! me reading this and needing health valve replacement surgery in a few months \ud83d\udc40 this is interesting though! i would be curious to know what his twin brother does to help him have gotten to 64 (exercise, diet, etc) \n\nAlso, how cute that your great grandfather and great grandmother both had marfans! The survival rates are very good now. This is the difficulty with looking into life expectancies as the treatments have changed so much. I really do not want to add to your worry! \n\nMy great grandparents died having valve replacent over 40 years ago. At that point dying was almost expected. We use different techniques and different valves now, neither of them knew they had marfans so it had not been monitored in advance. It was very late by the time surgery was attempted. \n\nMy grandfather died about 20 years ago. For him surgery went fine, but its worth bearing in mind that valve replacement (and indeed prolapsed valves) put you at a higher risk of endocarditis. This means that you should not get tattoos done and should avoid bleeding gums (its usually reccomended that you take antibiotics after oral surgery as the gum is a high infection risk) \n\nMy grandad probably would have been fine were it not for 2 factors\n1) he compulsively flossed his teeth untill they bled every night leading to endocarditis. \n\n2) the other strains put on the body by marfans (joint pain etc) were not well understood or managed and his kver use of painkillers which were not designed for long term use damaged his organs. Had he taken early retirement and had good medical care (like his brother) he may ha e been fine) I was only 4 when my grandad died and we live on the otherwise of the cou try to his side of the family so I do not know his brother personally. From what I have been told I think it was largely a difference in profession\n\nMy grandad was a nurse. On his feet, long hours etc. He continued working even when he got ill and we know he helped himself to medical supplies to ease his pain and symptoms (both painkillers and things like catheters). He was a very confident man and did not seek much medical support.\n\nHis brother was a bus driver. Less strain on the body, he was a single father though which I imagine was very tough. He retired at around 40 due to vision issues.\n\nI do not think either have ever been fit or into exercise and I think they had similar diets. Just Northern English food. Lots of stews, offal meats, etc. Marfans is so variable though even with identical genes. My father died at 37 of aneurysm dissection.  That was 1979. He knew he had it, but never got monitored or kept tabs on it. I had surgery to replace 2 valves and repair an aneurysm 24 years ago. I just (sadly) learned last week I have another aneurysm and need to schedule the surgery. best of luck with your surgery! what type of valves did you have put in? from my understanding, having them last 24 years is pretty good no? I have the mechanical valves. 24 years is good and they tell me they are still doing fine. Fine enough that they are not planning on replacing them during the aorta repair, which honestly pisses me off because if they are this old I would rather them just redo them while they are in there to reduce the possibility of yet another surgery for them further down the road.  Thanks for the luck-I need all the luck I can get. I am 64 and in process of being diagnosed with marfan. Last august just accidentally it was found that i have 7.3 cm aorta aneurysm. They wanted to schedule surgery right away, but i want to make an informed decision. Had the aneurysm checked again last month and it did not increase. Otherwise i am in perfect health. woah! 7.4 is quite large to my knowledge. I had mine repaired around 5.3cm i believe and even that was kind of pushing it I was told. I think it depends on where along your aorta your aneurism is though. \n\nHere is an interesting study on the chance of dissection depending on the aorta size:\n\n I was diagnosed with Marfan syndrome when I was 9.  I had a AAA when I was 48.  I have asthma and type 2 diabetes. I currently have 2 small aneurysms that are being monitored by my cardiologist and heart surgeon.    Listen to your body, take your meds and find doctors who knows what the hell they are doing.  I am 69.", "Wondering if I have marfans Hello, I am a 17 yo male and recently i started having a lot of back pain. I have had back problems for quite some time now(since I was 12) and I was diagnosed with mild scoliosis and postural kyphosis. Treatment options included wearing a brace or exercising so I chose to exercise because it seemed much more convenient at the time, but no matter how much I trained my muscles( I have been going to the gym, exercising home or with a specialist) my kyphosis has not improved, It actually got worse. My kyphosis seems to be structural, no matter how straight I stand it is not fixed. \n\nThis is how I found out about Marfans Syndrome. An abnormal curvature of the spine seems to be one of the symptoms and I also have stretch marks on my back, shoulders and triceps(the ones on the back are caused because I grew too quickly according to my doctor), I have long arms and legs and I am much taller (6'.1\")than my parents(around 5'.6\"). I weight around 175 lbs yet still somehow look skinny. I cannot do the wrist test, overall my sight is alright but slightly worse in my left eye, I am not flexible and I do not have heart pain or anything, but I cannot help but feel scared. I cannot convince my parents to take me to a doctor because they think I am delusional.\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\n(P.S) English is not my first language so please excuse my mistakes. You would need more signs than just being 6'1\", having stretch marks, and having scoliosis.  \nSee here:  (   \n\n\nGenerally people with Marfan Syndrome are much taller and have dislocated lenses in their eyes.  \n\n\nIf you are concerned, you could see a geneticist to evaluate you, or an eye doctor to look at the lenses in your eyes, or a cardiologist to have an echo cardiogram on your heart to see the size of your aortic root. Thank you, I will see if I can convince my parents. I hope I am just delusional though. An important thing to remember is every case is different since one of the core issues of Marfans is it is effect on connective tissue throughout the body. So symptoms lining up can only help an educated guess, but 100% confirmation requires testing. But if you have regular checkups with doctors, such as general practitioners, opthomologists, cardiologists, etc., even if they are not specifically experts in Marfans, they would spot any problems as they start to develop.\n\nCases like Chris Patton, a basketball player who died from his Marfans during a pickup game, are EXTREMELY rare, and happened over 30 years ago when the general population had no idea that something like Marfans existed. And while stories like that can still be scary, every story like that has helped doctors better know what to look for, even if they are not specifically \"experts\" in Marfans.\n\nWhen I was younger I agonized over having Marfans, but as I got older, my cardiologist telling me my heart is fine, and my opthomologist telling me my vision is not going let me stop worrying about everything that *could* happen, and focus on what I need to worry about right now. Marfans is not a universal checklist, it is a dynamic and varied condition. So I would say focus on the problems you are facing right now, and whenever you see doctors for checkups, tell them your concerns and they will gladly help keep an eye out with you if they are a doctor worth their salt.\n\nHope that helps. Thank you!", "Scared I might have Marfans I am 29, about average height, always been just a little underweight. My mom just told me one of our relatives had an aneurysm related to Marfans. She talked to her doctor about it and he said she very well might have a mild form of it based on some joint hypermobility but she has not had a genetic test or any heart testing. She is also about average height, maybe a bit taller than the average woman, and her weight fluctuates but she stays thin mostly.\n\nWe both look pretty normal and do not really have any known major health issues. The only signs I see obviously on myself are being thin, and I can do most of the hand \"tricks\" Marfan people can do, my fingers are longish and thin but do not look unusual. No scoliosis or teeth crowding or chest oddities or flat feet or anything. I have moderate nearsightedness. Sometimes if I lie down the wrong way it feels like my shoulder might pop out of place. And I can turn my feet and arms almost backwards. But I look nothing like pictures or Marfan people. \n\nI have major medical anxiety plus I live in the USA with no health insurance or money. Now I am worried my heart is a ticking time bomb and I do not know what to do. I do not know what the point of posting really is but I am just trying to start somewhere. Hi, first of all do not worry as you will be able to find a clear answer.|  \nSecond of all, nobody here can diagnose you but I will mention that things like Ectopia Lentis (Dislocated lenses in the eyes) and being very tall are two hallmark features of Marfan Syndrome. See here: (  \n\n\nAny optometrist/eye doctor will be able to immediately tell if you have dislocated lenses in your eyes, but since you are 29 you would have likely found out about this already.  \n\n\nIf your family doctor thinks you may have a connective tissue disorder/Marfan Syndrome, they should refer you to a geneticist and to a cardiologist. A geneticist will do some things like get a family history etc and may also recommend genetic testing.  \n\n\nA cardiologist will do an echocardiogram (an ultrasound of your heart) - to see if there is any aneurysm or any valve issues  etc.  \n\n\n  \nIf you cannot afford going to a geneticist and are worried about your heart, the most important thing to do is to see a cardiologist as this is the most serious issue with regards to Marfan Syndrome.   \n\n\nI usually have an echocardiogram every year to monitor the growth, so far it is stable so as long as it does not have any sudden jump then I know It is not yet a ticking time bomb.  \n\n\nThe only point really where your heart can be a 'ticking time bomb' in regards to Marfan Syndrome is when there is a large Aneurysm or tear that needs immediate treatment. First of all, relax. \n\nSecond, Marfan syndrome is not a death sentence, far from it, but you do need to see doctors regularly. \n\nThird, you might have some characteristics of it, but just because you have characteristics does not mean you have it. There are a lot of people who think they have Marfans, especially people with \"medical anxiety.\" I do not think you have even close to seven points with the Ghent nosology. Check for yourself. You might have 3. \n\nUse the systemic calculator: \n\nDiagnosis is complicated and involves a multitude of different factors. \n\nLastly, get insurance! Obamacare sign up starts in a few weeks (assuming you are in the US). You will be able to see a doctor in January, get an ECG and know more then. If your aorta is not dilated, I doubt you would qualify based on what you described. Thanks. I know Marfan Syndrome is pretty treatable but I have a medical phobia so it is really scary for me to even go in to get checked out, let alone need to see doctors regularly. Also I do not have a doctor at all. I have never gone as an adult. (Besides the eye doctor, so I guess I would probably know if I was having major eye problems.)\n\nAnd I would never suspect I have this if not for the fact that it seems to run in my family, it is not so much that my medical anxiety makes me think I have everything. I more like to ignore medical issues.\n\nI agree I do not have a lot of the characteristics, at least not that I can see myself. \n\nI can probably at least muster up some strength to get an EKG or whatever at urgent care in the next month or so which my research says costs about $200. \n\nThanks again for the assurance. Hopefully everything checks out...\n\nEdit: I think some of the things I mention may be more related to the things the other commenter said, so if it seems like some things do not make sense that is why lol\n\nAlso should mention I have been to urgent care and the ER and the dentist a couple times as an adult and I have had blood tests. But never like a checkup. Gotcha. I understand. Medical anxiety sounds crappy. It seems unlikely to me that you have marfans, but it would be a good idea to get diagnosed from a professional.\n\nFYI, you would not need an EKG, you would need an ECG-- an echocardiogram. Perhaps that also costs $200, but you might want to be sure.\n\nAlso, you might not simply be able to have any old GP read your ECG to diagnose a dilated aorta. You should really see a cardiologist.\n\nThe best thing for you to do is to get insurance, and then start the process on January first. (Do you need help signing up for Obamacare or Medicaid? I can walk you through it)\n\nBaby steps. Use your insurer's website to find a Primary Care Provider within network who is near your. You will likely have several doctors you can pick from. Find one you think you might feel most comfortable with.\n\nThen schedule a physical with your doctor. While there, tell your doctor about your concerns about Marfans, tell them about your family history, and your bendy joints, and anything else you think is relevant.\n\nI would also tell them about your medical anxiety. I assure you, they will be sympathetic.\n\nThen your doctor will write you a referral to get an ECG and to see a cardiologist. Make sure to schedule the ECG before you see the cardiologist, so that they will have all your data for your cardiology visit.\n\nYou are still really young, so likely, you have not really needed major medical treatment, and ultimately, and you are probably totally fine. But as you get older, you really need to get over your medical anxiety. Early treatment and prevention is the very best thing you can do for your body. You should make the effort to get over your anxieties and learn about your body.\n\nBest of luck to you! Thank you for your comment. I, like OP, also have medical anxiety specific to marfans syndrome. I was diagnosed with ehlers danlos and see a cardiologist often but the overlap in symptoms always makes me have panic attacks close to my appointments. Currently awake at nearly 4AM browsing reddit threads on this, so yeah. \n\nAnyways, I wanted to thank you for this comment / your thoughts bc you have helped me chill out a bit and feel less hopeless.", "Is anyone else as unlucky? Me and my 3 siblings all have Marfans and only one of my parents has Marfans syndrome.\n\nIs anyone more unlucky?  Neither of my parents have it, or my grandparents, or anyone else in my family for that matter. I got it from a spontaneous genetic mutation. So there is that. Same! I guess we are just suuuuper lucky ;) Both my parents carry the gene One of my 3 children got it, no other signs in the family tree. Even his FBN1 mutation is previously unknown, so no guess on what to expect. me too :)) Me three! Mom has it, my self and two siblings have it and my first child. My husband and 2 of my 3 kids have it. My husband was a spontaneous mutation. I am the only one in the family that was unlucky.... No one but me and my identical twin in my family is diagnosed or suspected to have Marfan's Syndrome You could have type 1 diabetes and ADD like me. I am pretty lucky when it comes to Marfan's (depending on how you look at it) tho, like no life-altering/odd deformities besides weak ligaments.", "Anyone a heavy drinker? i have always drank spirits even thought its probably not a great idea, anyone else?", "Looking for more information\u2026 My health has rapidly been declining over the last five years. I am trying to figure out what is going on with this precious body, and I just discovered marfans. I hit all the markers and it is starting to make sense to me. So my question is, what is the typical age of diagnosis? Also, definitely going to check out the resource given here to find a doctor. But how in the world do I find a proper doctor? I live in the boonies with practically no medical support. I do not know where to begin this journey. Thank you for your help! I was diagnosed right after I was born. may I ask how old you are? Many Marfan cases are missed but many are caught at birth or in the younger years with the signs of dislocated lenses and/or aortic abnormality/aneurysms.\n\nYour first step should be to speak with your family doctor, and tell them about your concerns and if they suspect Marfan syndrome as a possibility they will likely refer you to a geneticist and a cardiologist.\n\nThe geneticist will look at your families history, especially if anyone had dislocated lenses, was very tall, or died of heart complications. They may also order genetic testing for Marfan/Connective tissue disorders.\n\nThe cardiologist will likely do an echocardiogram which is just an ultrasound of your heart. They can detect aneurysms from this. Thank you! 35. Many people are diagnosed in their 30s Most importantly avoid strenuous activities like lifting weights. Avoid contact sports.\nSee a doc immediately if you ever feel chest pain.", "Does a negative test for Marfan mean I do not have it ? Does a negative test for Marfan mean I do not have it ?", "Question Is thoracic aneurysm at 83 still part of genetics and mild Marfan or just age?? Could be genetics, (Marfans is genetics), could be age. but also there is no such thing as mild Marfans. Either you have the gene or you do not. Age is more likely unless you have been genetically diagnosed. That. I have always been so keen to understand what they mean by \"mild\" cases of Marfan. Really scares some and puts their health anxiety through a roof. Get checked, you either have the gene or not. This is true however certainly the signs and symptoms can appear to be milder in some cases of Marfan Syndrome.As people age (regardless of Marfan Syndrome or not) the size of the Aorta does increase over time. So Aortic Aneurysms are definitely seen in older people without Marfan Syndrome.  The expression can vary. I am far worse then my dad.  But it is dangerous to think that \u201cmild Marfan\u201d means your heart is just fine. Exactly. This is why I strongly resist the idea of \u201cmild\u201d Marfans. You and your father share the same genetic mutation but it has expressed itself differently in each of you. Anybody genetically diagnosed its Marfans should continue to monitor their health even if they have previously not had issues.", "Surgery Day So I am new to this sub but today I wanted to...vent? Talk to people who understand more accurately. \nTo start our I will say that according to the blood test(one that did not compare my DNA to my father\u2019s) I(24) do not have Marfans but my dad(55) and brother(33) do.  So does two of my aunts. \nOver the last month and a half my brother has been told that his aortic arch has had a tear, since about May probably, and the only reason he was alive was because of his aortic root replacement 13 years ago.  Since finding it they did a subclavian bypass in preparation to help with the arch replacement  and this past Monday they were going to replace the arch. \n\nThey hit a snag though. Way back during his first surgery they asked if he wanted his pectum excavatum repaired. They told him that overall his was not too bad and it would primarily just be for cosmetic reasons. He declined and it had not affected him until now. \n\nBetween the inward bowing and a LOT of scar tissue they were unable to do the replacement that day. They took three hours just to remove the tissue. Now it is Thursday and he is in surgery as we speak. \nI was there on Monday and Tuesday but I knew I could stay past then. I wish I could have been there. I wish he could know I am there for him but my job got in the way.  He is in a good hospital and he knows I love him but I just feel bad because I cannot be there. \nSorry if this does not belong here I just needed to tell somebody who would understand.  That does suck, but I am positive your brother understands.  The fact that you can share so much about his situation shows that you have really been there for him.  I am sure he knows.\n\nRemember recovery is more than a day.  Playing video or board games with him a few weeks from now when he is feeling better enough to be stir crazy and not really out and about will mean the world to him.  Right now he needs basic care, but that is handled.  A phone call, a visit later on is what is going to help him feel like a person again. Thanks it is just hard I guess  It absolutely is. The best you can do is try and be kind to yourself as well and remember to breath.  I was not kidding, you articulated his condition better than some folks can say about themselves.  My sister was not able to be at my surgery and that was 100% fine, we watched the Gilmore Girls Revival together when I got back on Netflix and that meant way more.\n\nThat feeling of support does not come from 1 day, and it is not lost in 1 either.  Your bother knows you love him.  It is hard not being there, and it is great you vented, just know that he knows and you will have more opportunities.", "I have all but two qualifications for marfans. Should I worry about the future? Like 3-5 years ago have been to all the doctors two see if I had Marfans. I was two symptoms shy of being labeled with it. Recently the stretch marks on my back have become much worse, I am getting more. Should I be worried of developing the serious symptoms? Should I be tested? What symptoms ? Stretch marks, abnormally long fingers, flat feet, scoliosis, double jointed, and tall in slender.\nNothing fatal or anything wrong with my eyes, but again that was several years ago, is their a chance that those symptoms could appear? I have an awful sunken chest (pectus excavatum). I am having more stretch marks on my back. \nI am predominantly just worried about my eyes and heart. They said my heart was fine other than angled funny. \nShould I be concerned 20 years from now my retinas will be detached or I will develop severe heart problems due to marfans?  I do not know how old you are but I have had marfans since I was born obviously , 20 now. Eyes have deteriorated a bit but not much. Hearts has grown w me but not since I dropped growing. I am no doctor but I will tell you this. If you are around 20 plus/ stopped growing you are fine. Take it easy obviously but if something were wrong you would know trust me. This is your heart were talking about, it would not slip under the radar by any means. Keep updated w the doctor. I will say when I turned 16 17 i started getting little pains in my chest but doctor said it is nothing crazy. But as far as development goea. Took 16 years to feel a pain and if is almost non existent now in my 20s. Not much has changed, so for you to go from May e has marfans to deaths door is highly unlikely l. Just pay attention to yourself and if you needed an excuse to eat healtby/ stay in shape. There you go I do not mean to be rude but we cannot diagnose you as we are not doctors.

Sorry for the late notice, but I have a first appointment with a thoracic surgeon tomorrow afternoon. I would love to get suggestions, especially from people who are post-op, for questions I should be asking. Any help would be appreciated. \n\nFor background, I have know I have marfans for... over 20 years now. This past summer, a CT came up with an aortic measurement of 4.5cm :( My cardiologist said if it would been any larger, he would have pulled the trigger already. \n\nThis visit was facilitated by my cardiologist, so that I am a face and a person to the surgeon, not just some random name with a chest to crack when it comes time. The surgeon had me go for an echo and CT last week, to get an update before the appointment. \n\nSo, yeah... wish me luck on the recent tests - not sure I am ready yet for this surgery :/ And I could really use advice on anything important I should ask.\n\nThanks in advance, everyone!!\n\n**UPDATE:** Well, done with the appointment. The surgeon has lots of experience with Marfans patients, thank goodness (even though his cute nurse had never heard of it), and he was actually very positive about things. I learned (referencing one of the comments) that it is indeed considered an aneurysm at this point, not a dilation. I learned that he is not putting a lot of restrictions on me, as long as there is not an abrupt rise in blood pressure (which probably means I should not look at his cute nurse too long XD). I learned the procedure he is looking at is an aneurysmectomy. \n\nAnd I learned that he has a very positive outlook on things, so I am good until I need to do another CT and follow-up next year (no cute nurse for a year?? maybe better that way XD)\n\nVery relieved! First of all, :( it is always rough to get news of an aortic aneurysm, but at least you have plenty of time to prepare yourself. When mine was found, it was at 9.5cm so to say I had no time whatsoever to think is an understatement.  \n\nYour surgeon will basically cover all the necessary grounds when you speak to him. Some of the things he will likely tell you is what this surgery involves depending on where your aneurysm is, where he will make the cut, and most importantly all the risks, complications and numbers (stats). Every procedure has a name, so you can ask and read up on it yourself. The complications and numbers can be very hard to hear cos there is a reason why they wait until the aneurysm is at least 4-5cm before they decide they must make the cut - the risks of aortic replacement, especially if it also involves the heart valve, are exceptionally high. It would help if you write all these down, cos chances are you will forget.  \n\n(As an aside: my brother (has marfan too) is currently in the ICU from an abdominal aortic repair and while his surgeon ran all the numbers with me, I forgot a lot of it shortly after the meetings cos all this is a lot for the brain to process, especially in shock - so, write everything down if you can.)  \n\nAscending aorta repair does not require prep apart from shaving your bits (I am a woman), some abdominal aorta repair requires prep ahead of surgery - you will know when the surgeon tells you the sort of repair you need. If not, ask. Also, depending on whether it involves the valve, you might need post-op blood thinners. All of which I believe a competent surgeon will cover in his first speech to you. If not, ask. Ask about pre-op prep and post-op care. Many surgeons (with good bedside manners) will very likely take your lead as well, some patients do not like to hear all the grim news so they just tell them what they need to know and leave it be. If you want to be as involved as possible, tell your surgeon to tell you/show you everything but ELI5. My own surgeon went as far as telling me the name and brand of the heart valve he gave me, and even the material of the aortic replacement cos he knows I have this morbid curiosity.  \n\nLastly, but super important, cos everyone will fail to tell you this, is you must be prepared for how much this will fuck with your head. It will be a while before you learn to trust your body again. The surgeon's most important job is to repair the bad bits in your chest, so even though you might be fixed up and in recovery, your mind can take a beating cos once you have been cut, everything changes, until you regain your confidence with your body again. The thing is though, you will never know how your body/mind will handle this until you are in recovery. If it becomes too much to bear, you can ask for a counsellor, or someone professional you can speak to while in the hospital. I am naturally a very resilient person, but recovery took a shit load out of me - going for short walks would have me in tears eventually cos I was just so terrified my heart will stop while slow walking. So, be prepared for this to fuck with your head for a while.  \n\nSorry for the wall of text, but BEST OF LUCK with all of it! I am at 4.7 and while I have met with a surgeon, we talked it out and both of us agreed that surgery is not something we are ready to do yet because I do not have much if any growth. \n\nI suppose this is not to be expected, I met one of his colleagues while in the hospital for a different surgery (that ended up being vastly complicated, thanks marfan!) that doctor absolutely flipped about how fragile I am and how I needed to go to Cleveland or Johns to see a specialist. No thanks. The problem ended up not even being cardiology there.\n\nAbove all, do not panic. Listen to the doctor, but do not be bullied. If you have concerns, state them. If they want to get you into surgery but you are not ready, you can ask for a second opinion, but make sure you have a good reason. Just not wanting to is a poor reason to risk your life.  &gt;First of all, :( it is always rough to get news of an aortic aneurysm, but at least you have plenty of time to prepare yourself. \n\nI am not sure mine's an aneurysm so much as just dilation. My understanding is that they are two distinct conditions. Or I wrong about that. Or I do not know what I am talking about.\n\nLooks like I have found a question to ask lol\n\n\n&gt;When mine was found, it was at 9.5cm so to say I had no time whatsoever to think is an understatement.  \n\nJeebus, ~~dude~~ not dude. I did not even know that was possible! Glad you are still here!\n\n&gt; where he will make the cut, and most importantly all the risks, complications and numbers (stats). \n\nYeah. I am not looking forward to hearing this. My biggest problem is going to be not psyching myself out before anything even happens :/\n\n&gt;Every procedure has a name, so you can ask and read up on it yourself. \n\nThis is a good idea right here. I have looked around online, but I lack enough information to know which of the many possible procedures I should be reading about. Having seen so many doctors for so long, I tend to understand medical-ese better than the average person, but I will still need to make sure it is at a level I understand. \n\n&gt;the risks of aortic replacement, especially if it also involves the heart valve, are exceptionally high.\n\nAbsolutely. Terrified. \n\nOn the other hand, I have got enough life insurance that my wife could pay off the house and credit cards if, good forbid, something happened  :/ I am sure she would rather have me around though. \n\n&gt;It would help if you write all these down, cos chances are you will forget.  \n\nEverything will be written down in the moment, and then straightened out later. That is the only way I will be able to deal with this.\n\n\n&gt;Many surgeons (with good bedside manners) will very likely take your lead as well, some patients do not like to hear all the grim news so they just tell them what they need to know and leave it be. If you want to be as involved as possible, tell your surgeon to tell you/show you everything but ELI5. My own surgeon went as far as telling me the name and brand of the heart valve he gave me, and even the material of the aortic replacement cos he knows I have this morbid curiosity.  \n\nThis is great advice, thank you. I am like you, ELI5 me every damn thing. When I was younger, I would have doctors not really say everything, or sugar-coat it. I generally do not allow them to do that anymore, but this is a good reminder - I may be too overwhelmed to think about it today.\n&gt;\n\n&gt;Lastly, but super important, cos everyone will fail to tell you this, is you must be prepared for how much this will fuck with your head. It will be a while before you learn to trust your body again. \n\nOmg, yes. I have had three lung collapses, and a recurring hernia. I totally get that feeling, like, right after you get this thing fixed, but you are sure this little ache or pain or whatever is a sign that it is doing it again! :/\n\n&gt; So, be prepared for this to fuck with your head for a while.  \n\nThanks for this. I keep hearing that the recovery is not as bad as I might think. But that is not saying much, as I think it will be pretty damn awful :( I need to know going in that it will suck just as bad or worse than some of the surgeries I have had in the past. None of the major ones were easy. \n\n &gt;My aorta is large, I do have an aneurysm,  but it is not changing.\n\nThis is my thing. Based on past measurements over the last 10 or so years, this thing is not fast moving. I get the getting in there before it is emergent, but I also do not want this major of a surgery earlier than I really need it. \n\n\n&gt; needed to go to Cleveland or Johns to see a connective tissue disorder specialist. \n\nThat is one thing that worries me. I have had some surgeries in recent years that ended up being somewhat complicated, because my body did not heal quite normally or quickly as it should have. I think I nearly gave this poor hernia doctor a stroke. I really worry about my healing from something so major, and already plan on telling him to touch base with the hernia doc - that guy's had me open more than any other one person.\n\n&gt;Above all, do not panic. Listen to the doctor, but do not be bullied. \n\nGood advice, and I will keep it in mind. I have known too many surgeons that are too eager to cut. No thank you, if it can be avoided.\n\nThanks for the advice, much appreciated! &gt; for a different surgery (that ended up being vastly complicated, thanks marfan!) \n\nCould you elaborate, if you do not mind? I have had some surgical difficulties that I wondered if it was marfans-related  I went in for a laparotomy to remove ovarian cysts because I had a history of pain and *finally* I found a doctor who was awesome and concerned about my quality of life as well as my health.\n\nWell... he dove in and it was nothing like the ultrasounds had shown. Now they *had* looked a little strange, which was why he did a laparotomy and not a laparoscopy, but he was expecting them to be off the tubes and not... whatever it was. He basically freaked. I was being treated like a time bomb because they thought he just found two rather large iliac aneurysms (7cm on one side, 4 on the other). That is when I met Dr. You Need To Go Somewhere Else, You are Too Fragile. \n\nWell. An MRI and a CT later, and it turns out my lumbar spine is pretty much just disintegrating (official diagnosis is \"anterior sacral meningocele\" and ( is actually sort of similar). Yay. Coupling that with my chiari malformation and CSF flow blockage, I have got fun times ahead. But do not we all? I was pretty scared when I went, because I was afraid the surgeons would just be ready to cut, but he was very risk averse. The surgery has its own dangers, so we agreed it would be best to wait until the rewards outweigh the risks. For me, it was not at that point yet. Just by what you have said, it sounds like you would be in the same boat.\n\nI had a new doctor at the time, and I think I was probably the first Marfan patient he would ever seen. He is chilled out quite a bit since then.  I have always thought dilation/aneurysm refers to the same thing in our cases, with aortic aneurysm being the technically correct term! What do I know??? There is a reason why I never pursued biology in school lol.  \n\n\nThis is good news though (well, good is relative in any marfan case, but still!), that your aneurysm is not growing fast enough to be of grave concern yet. Did he say where along the aorta you need the repair - ascending, descending or abdomen? The other good thing is this is not your first rodeo, so at least you already know recovery can be a bitch. I ask cos while some descending/abdominal aorta repair are fairly straightforward in terms of pain/recovery, an ascending aorta repair requires your sternum to be sawed open, so that part of recovery absolutely sucks.  &gt;I have always thought dilation/aneurysm refers to the same thing in our cases, with aortic aneurysm being the technically correct term! \n\nYou know, I am usually a pretty smart person, especially when it comes to medical terms, but... yeah, I have no idea. I assumed \"dilation\" was different from \"aneurysm\" because the latter word was never said to me. I thought dilation was just a wide area, while an aneurysm was this ballooning out of a weak area. \n\nBut I have been given no indication that the appearance has changed in such a way, so... maybe you are right then?? Maybe the a word was not mentioned so as not to freak me out? Who knows?\n\n\n&gt;This is good news though (well, good is relative in any marfan case, but still!), that your aneurysm is not growing fast enough to be of grave concern yet. \n\nI have medical records going back like 15 years, and it had not grown as much as I would thought. When the cardiologist called it at 4.5 last year, I was devastated, because I thought it had grown a bunch in the last couple years. \n\nBut I went and dug out my records, and it apparently grew something like .4 over the span of *10 years* or so. I became a little less worried after that. And both doctors sing the praises of the Losartan the cardiologist put me on, so maybe it will be a long time yet before it gets worse.\n\n&gt;Did he say where along the aorta you need the repair - ascending, descending or abdomen?\n\nYou know... I did not even think to ask. I think I was too overwhelmed with relief that he was not considering surgery in the foreseeable future, and I put all my questions away - does not do me any good to ask all these detailed questions now, if my surgery ends up like 5+ years out. I would just have to ask them again. \n\nWell, it looks like I have got a reason to call back and talk to the cute nurse, now does not it? \ud83d\ude02 I am super curious now. About the aneurysm I mean.\n\n&gt;an ascending aorta repair requires your sternum to be sawed open, so that part of recovery absolutely sucks.  \n\nWith my luck.... :/\n\n Well shit balls. I just got a call back from the ~~cute nurse~~ doctor's office. It is ascending. :'( I guessed as much, cos if it was descending/abdominal, you would be sent to see a vascular surgeon instead. Welp. You still have time before you actually have to face it! Since this is not your first rodeo, you would be well acquainted with the incentive spirometer anyways. All I can say is find a big pillow, make it your best friend - cos every time you cough everything will hurt, and you will have to cough quite a bit. Hug the pillow like it is your most precious possession (tell the missus she has nothing to worry about tho, it is only temporary arrangement) so it does not feel like your chest might just explode.  \n\n\nInteresting stuff about Losartan tho. I am always curious about what other people are prescribed. I was/am prescribed with bisoprolol to manage the BP, but I reckon it is also because my heart was in a very bad shape coming out of surgery, what with the 9.5cm balloon that thoroughly ruined my valve and thus making the heart enlarged. Oh fuck me, I hate the spirometer. Hate. Them. Three lung collapses, and I am far more acquainted with those accursed things than I would like to be. \n\nI have had a similar type of pain before, from both a bowel resection, and abdominal hernia surgery in the aftermath. It is just startling how much we use our core without realizing it. I fucking hated life for a bit, and became best friends with my pain pills. I am sure I will feel the same way whenever this thing goes down.\n\nThanks for being so encouraging! I am going to need all if that as I can get whenever this thing actually does go down! But not this year, thank goodness.", "Should I see a doctor? Hi folks,\n\nWhen I was a kid I lost my father to an unexplained heart episode and it is been on my mind ever since. Mostly because I am worried the same will happen to me.\n\nI want advice from this community. So please bear with me. \n\nI recently learned about Marfan syndrome and began thinking what if that is what my dad had. And so I know people here are not doctors but I thought of asking if it is worth seeing a doctor anyway.\n\nSome facts about my father: he was tall, hypertensive, had heart palpitations. But he was also obese, a smoker, and not very active. And so I wonder if it was undiagnosed Marfan or an unhealthy lifestyle. Otherwise I do not know that he had any other signs of Marfan.\n\nMe: I am a tall somewhat thin dude, 27 years old. I am 6'4\", 230 lb, but most of my fat deposits in my lower half. My arms are skinny. But I have a belly, big butt, and thicker thighs. \n\nI am pretty sure I do not have either the wrist or thumb sign. \n\nI am nearsighted, but only slightly, with astigmatism in one eye. \n\nAnd most recently I learned that my overbite is due to a small lower jaw. That is what ticked me off and that is why I am here to see if yall have any advice.\n\nI am not aware of other issues so far.\n\nDay to day I feel fine. I run a couple times a week. I have some back pain from bad posture but nothing that cannot be mitigated with some core workouts.\n\nSo... is it worth going to the doctor for a check?", "did anyone get diagnosed with Marfan and later find out there was no fbn1 gene? did anyone get diagnosed with Marfan and later find out there was no fbn1 gene?", "I cant sit?? Hi guys! I was diagnosed with marfan at the age of 2-3, because my grandmother realized that i didnt see anything. Doctors realized that both of my lenses were dislocated. My both eyes had two surgeries when I was about 4-5 and my left eye had third surgery last month. I am now 17. I have mild scoliosis but its so mild that it doesnt need any treatment(i also fell of a horse three years ago and hurt my lower back and it sometimes aches but doctors didnt find anything.) My knees and ankles go a little inwards and i have had the insoles that correct the postures of my legs. I am about 182cm/6ft tall. I was just wondering if any of you have trouble sitting if you have to sit still for long time like in school. Like it doesnt hurt or anything i just get really uncomfortable and because of it i need to move constantly and change my posture and move my legs. I dont know if this is even a marfan thing. I am going to physiotherapy soon but was just wondering if any of you have experienced this?\ud83e\udd14 Sorry for my english i am from Finland\ud83d\ude01 The protrusion in my back bars the rest of it from touching the chair, so seating arrangements are extremely uncomfortable.", "Hello Again Hey everyone.\n\nI posted here awhile back about being concerned I have marfan syndrome.\n\nThought I would check back and give you guys an update. I really appreciate how supportive and reassuring you were before. I know you all get a bunch of these posts and they must drive you up the wall by now but it is a good source of comfort.\n\nI went to my general care doctor the other day and explained my worries. I said I wanted to get screened for Marfan and we did a quick examination. My fingers are hyper mobile and I easily pass the wrist test. I have long fingers and thin wrists. I am also pretty skinny. I have always had trouble gaining weight.\n\nOr well at least until last year. I am 5'10 and bulked up to about 140 after having weighed 115ish most of my life but I am back down to 121. Which is probably because I have not been eating as much as usual in quarantine and not exercising like I should.\n\nAnother thing we took note of was my severe myopia and astigmatism. Although I have never had a dislocated lens and bad eyes run in the family. As do crowded teeth coincidentally, which I also have.\n\nSee what gets me is I fit the bill for the stereotypical marfan diagnosis. Bad eyes, long fingers, super skinny; but I scored pretty low on the Ghent criteria.\n\nLast time I posted I mentioned I have flat feet, which is not true come to find out. My feet are normal. My fingers are long but I cannot pass the thumb test (but I heard most marfans cannot pass the test while reading something online?) My arms are longer than my height but the ratio comes out to only 1.02- 1.03ish if I remember correctly. My lower segment is longer but not enough to meet criteria. No scoliosis.\n\nI do not have any rib cage deformities aside from a lone protruding rib on my right side. It is fairly subtle and does not effect my breastbone aside from a slight bump where it connects. We were not 100% sure if that would count as a point towards chest asymmetry or not since the criteria states \"extends beyond normal variation\"\n\nWe could not do any of the criteria that required X-rays but I have never had any pain suggestive of Dural Ectasia or Protucio Acetabulae. I used to be an avid golfer and never had any problems with my hips and occasionally I will get a really dull pain in the bottom of my back but only after sitting for quite a long time or something similar. Not a common occurence.\n\nI do not have skin striae. She listened for a murmur but did not hear one.\n\nWhen it came down to it, my Ghent score was a 2 or 3 depending on whether you counted chest asymmetry.\n\nBut she scheduled me for an echocardiogram and an EKG this week. She said she did not think the insurance would cover it on just the basis of a test for marfan but because I would had palpitations in the past, they would cover it for that.\n\nI believe my palpitations have just been from stress though. They always coincide with stressful events in my life and I rarely have them when I am stress free. Never been diagnosed with a murmur.\n\nI have had an EKG a few years ago that came back normal. I have had a chest xray in 2018 that is come back normal too. I am not sure if Aortic dilation would show on a chest xray but it is my understanding that a lot of marfan cases are picked up with routine chest xrays?\n\nAnd I know this sounds like another diagnosis post but I promise its not that. I am just looking to vent I guess? I have probably read 1000 posts like this one on your sub this past week because I cannot stop stressing about it. Waiting for the echocardiogram has me so scared. I cannot shake the feeling I am only a few days away before being faced with the fact I will need heart surgery. A few days away from my life changing forever.\n\nAnd I just do not know what to think? One minute I am thinking \"Bad eyes and teeth run in the family, you score pretty low on the Ghent score, you cannot do the thumb test, your chest xray came back fine; you are just overreacting\" and then the next \"How can I not have it? I have severe myopia, I have always been skinny, my ankles used to hurt when I ran track, I fit the bill for the stereotypical Marfan case, I definitely have it.\"\n\nAnd I know I cannot find that out until my echocardiogram on Wednesday but man this sucks. I feel like I cannot talk to anyone about it. Even if I try, no one understands.\n\nMy family keeps trying to be encouraging and reassuring me I do not have it but I do not know what to think. It is so overwhelming and it makes a person feel so alone. That is great that your doctor referred you for an echocardiogram, that is definitely the main area of concern as it will let them measure the size of your Aorta. The signs and symptoms of Marfan Syndrome are definitely varied across patients, for example I do not have loose skin or overly flexible joints or any have pain when running but I do have Marfan Syndrome with a mildly dilated Aortic Root (43 or 44mm).\n\nI have also had Chest X-rays done, but they are not useful in examining the Aorta at all. The echocardiogram is usually the most important piece to check out the heart.\n\nIt is possible to have a very mild case of Marfan Syndrome, myself I would personally describe my case as mild as I did not have any Aortic dilatation until I was around 26 years old. (43mm). I am now 30 and my last echocardiogram said my Aortic root was between 43 or 44mm and I am now taking Losartan.\n\nI would not worry, I suspect you will be very relieved after you have your echocardiogram. My brother, I hear you and completely understand where you are at, have been there myself many tomes.  Hear me out, you are paying anxiety-interest on a debt you do not even know if you owe.  \n\nGo for a nice long walk, listen to your favorite music, focus on enjoying your life!  When you get your results of the echo you will likely be pleased.  Marfan's is rare even if you have all the signs it is no where near a guarantee you have it.  I have a good friend from college who was a very slim, flexible, and lanky 6'0 dude with pectus excavaitum.  He is a fantastic athlete and awesome dude and he does not have marfan's, despite fitting the physical bill.\n\nIf you do have it, yeah that sucks, but do not make it suck more by worrying about it before you even know if you have.\n\nSending you good juju for your echo \ud83e\udd1e\ud83d\udd49\ufe0f I am so glad you are getting an echo. Aortic aneurysm is the most important thing to identify in all this, and an echo will do that. If you do have a minor aneurysm, ask your GP or cardiologist about Loeys-Dietz and Ehlers Danlos Syndromes. If he or she is not familiar with those, get a referral to a genetics specialist. They are similar to Marfans in presentation, but management is different. Critically, surgery is recommended at a lower aneurysm threshold for LDS than Marfans. \n\n\n\nLet us know how the echo turns out! Thank you for the support and the heads up! I will definitely being that up. Unfortunately my echo got pushed back 3 weeks but as soon as I know, I will update you guys! You guys are the best Thank you for your very reassuring comment. I pray that you are right. I am glad to hear that your case has been mild and your aorta has not dilated much.\n\nThanks for taking the time to make a stranger feel a little less scared, hope you are having a good one! \"Anxiety-interest on a debt you do not even know if you owe\"\n\nThat was very well said and quite thought provoking. Thank you stranger. Thank you for your reassuring comment and the good juju. It is much appreciating and very comforting I was also going to recommend looking at EDS or LDS. I have LDS type II and no one caught it until I had a dna test done.", "Does anyone else get really cold?

Also I have marfan syndrome.\nI am planning to search our problem during my master degree. \nActually, we have very promising news. I really hope that our disease will be cured within next 10 years. Especially with the new DNA editing technology. \nAs we know, the volume of fibrillin can be managed by the level of gene expression (% or way as the gene works)\nThe new gene DNA editing does not edit DNA in general but can change the way of genes' expression (the way how it works).\nI am very excited because the works in a lot of laboratories are being conducted. \nAlso, there is a way to change our DNA by the crispr-base editor mechanism. And it is very precise ( some researches have been done in China and USA in vitro)\nDo you have any thoughts about it? I would be glad to know your opinion. Seems a slippery slope, and probably depends on individual families and how it is expressed.\n If I had a choice to keep my kids from getting it? Absolutely. Do I want to undergo gene editing to change the way I currently am? I already take medication and manage my lifestyle well enough that the reality is that it is probably not something that is necessary for me.\n\nSo probably not It is very interesting position. Thanks. \nYou actually need not to change the way who you are. ( Maybe  some cm of your heart must, or eyes). Hah. \nAlso, you can turn off or turn on parts of FBN-1 gene to change its expression and regulate the volume of fibrillin. It is not changing of your DNA at all,.

(Folic acid deficiency or inability to process folic acid)\n\nOther papers have shown that there is not a link to folic acid and expression of fibrin genes. \n\nI think this is one of those areas where it is tempting to say \"here is a magic bullet that we can use to change everything\" but you need to look at multiple studies and realize that there are so many systems in the body that there is a reason there is a rule in this sub against giving medical advice No, it is not. \nMy doctor manages my diet.\n\nNo, I am talking about other vitamins.

Even the idea of it gets me excited", "Chest pain and marfans i have known about having marfans for basically my whole life, also well aware that i should probably seek a doctors advice. just curious as to what to expect to hear and if anyone else with marfans has had chest pain before and what came after. for the past few days the left side of my chest has been giving me on and off again pains, nothing that last too long but if its enough to make me have to stop what im doing and even sometimes makes me light headed.  You really, _really_ need to see a doctor and get your heart/aorta scanned.  It is common for people with marfan's to experience heart problems because of abnormal connection of heart wall tissues and enlarged aorta. It can also cause inadequate circulations. You need to see a doctor to get it checked out.  If you are having chest pains and light headedness at the same time you should go see a cardiologist ASAP, maybe even the ER if the symptoms do not go away or increase in intensity. \n\nIsolated chest pain could be any number of non-threatening things but the combination of symptoms is definitely cause for concern.  Thing is even if i were told that i need to undergo surgery or anything i cant see myself going through with it. been in a bad spot for a while and living with depression for as long as i can remember, looking at these pains as kind of a \"gift\". stopped taking my beta blockers and been heavily smoking cigs and drinking energy drinks to i guess speed up the process. was just curious if any fellow subscribers with marfans has had chest pains lead to more serious heart issues. and again, i know i should seek a doctor, but that is not going to happen. just looking to hear from people who have had chest pains and if anything came from it. The beta blockers explain why you are getting chest pains. It is supposed to prevent chest pains, hypertension, and other symptoms of heart attack. You need to start taking them again. Also, you need to cut back on the cigs and energy drinks. Those 2 can definitely cause chest pains. With your condition, it is just hurting your heart more. are they just pains or signs that i might actually have a heart attack? if you really want to know, then you need to get checked out. but I would start taking them again and wait. if the pain continues, then please consult a cardiologist. I am not a doctor, but I am a cardiac tech student and a heart patient myself. I take ACE inhibitor, baby aspirin, and digoxin. During my training, I realized how important it is to make sure you do not skip any of these medications. They are VERY IMPORTANT. These things are life savers. i appreciate the concern but im not looking to get better, have no intentions of taking the medication again or seeking out a dr. but since i have you here do you think that having taken the whole bottle of atenolol could have caused some damage? i took about 1450 mg of atenolol a few days ago, when i woke up i obviously was not dead but felt sick to my stomach and as if i was coming down from a bad trip, even my eyes were dilated as if i was tripping. i dont know if that was due to the atenolol or the sleeping pills tho, have been blaming the sleeping pills since i had a similar reaction to the them last time i tried to od on them.  uh well you definitely could have died taking too many of atenolol. i do not think it caused you any damage yet. would they just slow down my heart rate to the point of death? that was my thought behind taking as many as i did.  You really, really need to see a doctor asap, and I would also suggest a counselor or therapist. My husband has Marfan's as well as severe depression, and it is not anything he can handle on his own.

I have been referred to the marfan unit of the Vall de Hebron hospital in Barcelona. I do not understand anything, if I have been negative in the genetic tests. Has anyone had anything like this happen to them? Thank you.\n\nTranslated with  (free version) While they have found a lot of FBN1 mutations that can cause Marfan, the science is still evolving and every year they find new ones. Thus, some people get diagnosed *without* a FBN1 mutation, because they clinically fit enough of the symptoms and signs. They often end up testing positive a couple years later, once research has found more mutation variants. Thank you for your quick reply, the centre where I have an appointment has a multidisciplinary unit dedicated only to marfan. The geneticist before the tests was convinced that he was going to find a mutation, he was very surprised when it did not show up, but we have all the other symptoms except the aortic dilatation. My family also does not have a known FBN1 mutation, and the majority of us absolutely have Marfan. Kind of a pain, frankly. What were the clinical manifestations that led to the diagnosis? I am curious as I had pigeons chest and kyphosis along with longer than normal arms. However, I have normal hands, wrists. A perfect heart thus do not believe I am even able to get the genetic test. You should see a geneticist who specializes in connective tissue disorders. They will likely give you a genetic test that specifically looks for all possible connective tissue mutations.  \n\n\nThey will also be able to diagnose you (with or without finding a Mutation) fbn2 maybe? The geneticist who saw me was not an expert in Marfan, tomorrow I will post a photo of the genetic analysis.\nThey have seen them in the new hospital and still they have referred me to the marfan unit.\nI think that is what you say, he has to be a specialist in connective tissue pathologies.\nI am nervous about the few days left to go, I have been like this since 2012. Longer arm span, arachnodictaly, pectus excavatum, scoliosis, flat feet, acetabular protrusion, myopia, diplopia, some parts of my body are lax but for example I cannot stretch my elbows, mitral prolapse, and I think I forgot something else.

Exactly \ud83e\udd23 I have crowded toes as well That is hilarious I always think about how people always compliment my \"elfish, sophisticated, elegant\" fingers and hands and how they are freaked out by my feet and ??? They have the same qualities of being long skinny and pale!! What a huge double standard lol I guess I have had the opposite happen personally, but my feet are relatively normal (8.5 US mens 10 US womens) and my toes are not crowded, just long and curled from 3rd toe on. \n\nAlso, nice to see someone else in the lifestyle/industry 'round here. I figured I was not the only one. I always call my feet swim fin feet. \n\nOne of my friends still insists that I could sell foot pics for good money but I do not believe it.

Genetics ruled it out but still I am checking my hearth and aorta every year in a Marfan clinic due to my habitus (flat feet, tall, hand sign etc) and familiarity.\n\nProblem is that I basically stopped \"living\" since I know this possibility. Now, after medical check ups, I will start to exercise again.\n\nAnd since I am an artist also, I drew this drawing to give me emotional strenght and resilience.\n\nTell me what you think! Thank you for reading this! It is a cool drawing. Do not worry too much though, it is not that big of a deal. Just go to the doctor and take your meds \ud83d\ude0b. Hey Thanks! Luckily my aorta size is still normal. So I do not have meds but in a month I will have my doctor visit and it will be checked again. Thanks for your kind words! They help!  Since genetics ruled it out and your aorta is in normal size, why do you still think you have it? Genetic test is probably the most sure way to prove you have it since many of the symptoms are very common even in those who are not affected by it.  \nDo not be a hypochondriac. You are okay, live life to the fullest and still check your heart from times to times. It is not bad to know you are healthy Thanks. It is true, I should stop to live in  fear and start enjoying life still checking myself!  if you have a normal aorta you do not need meds, stop worrying and do something for yourself. \n\nEven if you do have it, most likely your life wont change much unless you are playing sports.", "I have to get my echo redone and my anxiety is through the roof, how did you deal with it? Hey all,\n\nI am in the process of getting diagnosed with marfans. Unfortunately, my first echo was inconclusive and I have to get it redone (it will be done by a top of the line specialist, thankfully) but I do not know how I am going to deal with the wait. It is in over a month (!!!) so I am seriously clueless as to how I will be able to deal with this wait. I would greatly appreciate any kind words. Well an echo is just an ultrasound of the heart, they are extremely common. They do not need to be done by a top of the line specialist, but the images and measurements they take will likely be sent to a specialist.\n\n  \nSo do not be concerned about that. That is the first step, they will just use this to take measurements of your heart, namely the aortic root.  \n\n\nThese are very common for people with Marfan Syndrome, I have them done at least once a year, I think I fell asleep during my last one.\n\nIf they find that your aortic root is bigger than it should be, it is not a huge concern anymore really because of the treatment options and that it is relatively easy to keep checking up on.\n\nIf they suspect Marfan Syndrome, they will likely send you to a geneticist for genetic testing/counselling. Basically it will be a DNA test to determine what Marfan/Connective Tissue Disorder Mutation you have and  the geneticist will also ask a lot of questions about family members to see if it might run in the family.\n\nAnyways, it sounds like you have good Doctors so just keep following their advice and you will be absolutely fine, no need to worry. Worrying is useless, and will only add stress to your mind and body. Think positive thoughts and keep yourself occupied by things you find uplifting. Echos are notoriously fussy as diagnostic tools so it is not at all uncommon to have them redone. Thanks, I am aware of all this but (I think understandably) it is still a little nerve wracking. My Cardiologist that I will be seeing is class, so I am definitely not nervous about care if something is wrong. I try to remind myself of everything you kindly wrote out but man, it gets hard imagining the \"worst\" possible scenario. I do appreciate your comment, however. I also all most fall asleep during my echos i find them kind of relaxing at this point having had a couple dozen done by now in my life.\n\n  \nBeing diagnosed really wont change your life in any negative way any problems marfans has caused you have already been dealing with your whole life and now you just get the piece of mind of knowing why and if you did not notice any problems before now they should not get worse now just because you know.\n\nAlso you might also find out you dont have marfans which is also good.  \n\n\nHope that helped.

I was wondering if anyone had a abnormal pulmonary function test and if it was abnormal. Doctor said I had weak respiratory muscles attributed it to Marfan syndrome as other testing was normal I was diagnosed with asthma suddenly, at 31, last year. They were talking about sending me to pulmonary but it never quite got that far. I expect it to eventually, I feel like I am getting worse. \n\nI feel it is connected to the ventilator/anesthesia caused partial collapse I had, but they insist it is not. I just feel it is weird that I go from no asthma to asthma less than 6 months after that, you know? \n\nAll I had was some weird, annoying breathing test done by a nurse where they determined I had the lung function of a 47 year old.  Lung issues are common with Marfan. Pneumothorax,  asthma, reactive airway disease and COPD (without smoking history) are all common. A pulmonologist can help you manage the issues you may have. Yeah I have a pulmonologist  he basically just said I had weak respiratory muscles and sent me to a neurologist who ran a million dollar work up which showed nothing. He just said its caused by Marfans but I cannot find anything on Marfan and weak respiratory muscles  \n yeah apparently I have the same thing. Lungs way past my age but never smoked.  I am newly diagnosed but I have always had respiratory issues. I had reactive airway disease as a child. I got pneumonia many times. I do not have good lung output. I never do well with the incentive spirometer when my allergist tests it. They have tried to say I have asthma but I have not used an inhaler since I was a kid.

I had valve sparing aortic root replacement when I was 17, but guess the \"valve sparing\" portion of that did not work so well :/ Having already been through the surgery part before, I am not /too/ scared for the surgery/recovery other than the nagging idea of something going wrong. What I am a little apprehensive about is adjusting to life with a mechanical valve. I am specifically worried about the clicking bothering me. I am very sensitive to noise especially while trying to sleep, so hoping that I eventually get used to it. I will be getting an on-x valve so I guess i am just curious if any of you have specific experience with the noise with that one? Also how has your experience been adjusting to Warfarin? My late father also had a mechanical valve so I am not totally unfamiliar with it, but his was put in in the 80's so much different tech I suppose, so just looking for someone who can speak to the newer valves I had mine done almost 25 years ago when I was 20. It is a St. Jude valve. \n\nI do not notice the clicking any longer. That passed very quickly. Sometimes other people do if things are quiet. \n\nI have had no adverse issues with warfarin either. Once my blood got super thin after changing my diet but I did not have a bleed or anything. \n\nGood luck! Thanks for the advice! Do you drink alcohol? I know what the doctors say about it, just looking for people's actual experience Nope. My old boss had his aorta replaced and still drank while on Coumadin. One day at the office he had a massive bleed because if it. I was not there but it was a scary experience for sure.  Yesssss. I am so bothered by the idea of the clicking bothering me because I am already has misophonia (bothered by certain sounds).  I have you in my thoughts and prayers. I have not had any aortic surgeries yet but I am going to the Cleveland clinic soon to set a date to get one done. I would love to hear how everything else goes with your journey? I have a ton of questions for you if you would like to connect. \n\n34 year old male,\nOn the fence with marfans since 19 until aorta started swelling two years ago.  Sure I will keep you updated! Not sure how helpful I will be regarding the questions but more than happy to give my insight You get used to the clicking. My husband has a St. Jude's, and I never notice it anymore.  Thank you, message me anytime.  I know I am late to the thread and I hope you had a good outcome.  I had the On-X put in last April (Age 32) at Mayo (MN).  I will say when I first woke up from surgery I was thinking \"oh man they are going to have to go in and replace this!, I will not be able to stand this ticking.\" But after a few weeks things started to get better and I would say by 3 mo it did not bother me any more (although I can still hear it).  Now at 1 year post op, the tick is almost comforting to me. Hopefully its not bothering you but if it is give it some time.  The Warfarin therapy has been way easier/less traumatic than everyone seems to makes it out to be, my INR is usually between 2.2-2.5 (I know On-x could go lower but Dr. wants me to stay between 2-3) and I do not give much thought to Vit K. either.  I guess everyone is different, you will get comfortable with the way your body handles it. I test INR at home now and that is a huge plus as well. I go about my life pretty much normal, did a ton of snowboarding this last winter (just cruising..too old for jumps/rails now days) and actually just started playing pickup hockey again.  I am a little concerned with playing hockey but I play with the same group of guys each week and its pretty easy going, no checking etc. I am not going to let the valve/warfarin scare me away from doing the things I enjoy.  YOLO. I got an OnX in Winter of 2017, and the clickings bothered me ever since.\n\nIt is gotten to the point that my family Dr. Has tried prescribing sleep aids for me, but nothing works.\n\nUnfortunately, it is effecting my ability to function day to day--i get very little sleep, and most that I do get is not restful, it is from sheer exhaustion.\n\nI have started seeing some psych Drs to help with post surgery issues, and they think the sleep issues are some of the cause.\n\nMy Cardiologist said I am in a very small minority of patients with this sort of reaction to the valve. Thanks for the advice! Things have gone incredibly well. This surgery was way easier than my first. I was out of the hospital in 4 days and basically back to normal by 2 weeks. Just returned to this gym last week and can tell that my heart is so much stronger than before. INR has been a tad annoying trying to get the dosing right but I am supposed to start home testing this month so hopefully that will make things a little bit easier. However I still have not had a drop of alcohol so hopefully when I do it does not change things to much.\n\nI also remember having the same thought about the clicking when I woke up in the hospital. First few days of it were brutal but now I hardly notice it. It is been a fun party trick lol. \n\nWho was your surgeon at Mayo?  Glad to hear things are going well! My INR bounced around a bit in the beginning as well, you will get it figured out. Alcohol does not seem to have too be of an effect on me but I know everyone is different. My numbers will definitely rise a bit  if I have 1-2 the night before I get tested so I would ease into it and test it out bit so you can figure out how your body responds.  Yeah the tick is fun to mess with people, I like to ask if they can hear the ticking and then watch them look around to try to figure out where its coming from....good times.\n\nMy surgeon was Dr. Cicek, who did you go with? Had my first couple of drinks this past weekend and checked my INR the next day and it did not seem to make a difference from what I can tell. I started home testing and it is soooo much easier. My surgeon was Dr. Dearani. He operated on my dad 4 times, my brother once, and this was his second on me. A legitimate life saver. Dang sorry to hear that. I can definitely see how it could be bothersome if your brain does not tune it out. In the beginning I used to count clicks, like counting sheep,  to fall asleep and eventually my brain started to ignore it. I can still hear it all the time, I just try to embrace it now. I always wondered if a ear surgeon or someone could fix the problem somehow, I hope you can figure it out. It is amazing to me that in 2019 they have not made a metal valve that does not click. Good news! I agree home testing is so much better than going in to get tested. Dr Dearani is the head surgeon there isnt he? I think I have seen a few of his videos, seems like a really good surgeon. One 'blessing' is that it made disability pretty easy to get.  I am on an indefinite lifting/physical exertion limit, and that combined with the sleeping issues and PTSD from the recovery process went quick.

Primarily size and over all heart function my heart was in the congestive heart failure stage at like 45% functionality therefore at 23 I got the surgery I am a novice but what I gather is that they also look at family history what size was your aorta. how was the surgery and recovery? 48.82 mm 4.8 cm I think I declined all hydrocodone and Xanax and left the hospital in 3 days to go home and smoke weed, after one week I was getting my own fast food and driving, after two weeks it was back to work. I went from 190 lbs to 110 lbs or so currently but I am going to start lifting again to regain weight, I lost a substantial amount of blood and died as soon as they cut me open but that is about it. I am 6\u20192 or 6\u20194 depending on who measures me chest does not hurt anymore obviously and I should have began lifting to regain weight much sooner than this week but my surgery was august 15th I believe of 2020 Ha you died \u201cthat is it\u201d? That scares me man. You have staff there to immediately assist you do not over think it, idk how bad I am compared to others but I assume my case is fairly good I work full time and have physical hobbies along with lots of reading and studying for college.

I cannot speak for everyone but marfans has made me a normal person with just slightly strange features never had an issue with it and I rarely see a doc. Only thing I can recommend is do not do what I do and actually take your medicine I was on losartan and atenolol for 22 years now I am on metoprolol? I think. But I do not use it. primarily size but also rate of growth. If they notice a sudden rapid increase of growth that might urge them to proceed with surgery. \n\nThere are studies out there on Google that show percent risk of rupture depending on the size. \n\nI had my surgery around 5.1cm i believe maybe a little bit bigger than that. \n\nTypically, surgery for marfs is considered around 4.5-5cm i believe but there are also cases where someone can get up to like 7cm before it ruptures. I stopped drinking because I no longer could hold any liquor as I got older. Is there a specific reason marfan folks should avoid alcohol? That is a crazy amount of weight loss. Seems like they did not give you very good nutrition and exercise plans. I am one month post-op, 1 full week in the hospital, have not lost much weight at all. I have only heard to limit/avoid it if you are on blood thinners, which is typical with a mechanical valve. The weight loss was because I was in congestive heart failure for almost a year before they did my procedure and I honestly just did not feel like eating I still do not eat much today I had a CABG-Ben Tall because my aorta was enlarged at the sinus of valsalva I think it was called. So they replaced my whole aorta and mitral valve. But yeah I have had no appetite for almost two years trying to start gaining weight again this year Geez. Ok yeah that makes sense. That does not sound fun, sorry dude. I just had an aneurysm, no heart failure so other than some complications in the hospital there was not a big improvement after the surgery. Heart function going in was normal. My aneurysm was really noticeable but it is fine now, I need scoliosis surgery so bad but I work at fucking Walmart in Tennessee for $11 an hr lol cannot afford insurance but my mom can hopefully add me to hers this open enrollment i get a checkup every year and they will only perform the surgery on me if I hit 45mm", "Has anybody used the vacuum-bell-therapy to help with pectus excavatum??

They are often contraindicated in people with Marfan-related aorta concerns, ostensibly because of the pulling force it may put on the aorta. It is possible that it could be safe and effective for your child, but definitely talk to a cardiologist first.\n\n(\n\n&gt;In patients with any underlying concern regarding aortic root dimensions, the vacuum bell technique is not advised as a safe treatment option\n\n(\n\n&gt;Contraindications of the method comprise skeletal disorders such as osteogenesis imperfecta and Glisson's disease, vasculopathies (e.g. Marfan's syndrome, abdominal aneurysm), coagulopathies and cardiac disorders.

At the end of last year I received the results of these tests back, confirming that I have a mutation on the gene which causes marfan syndrome but it is a totally new mutation they have never seen before. Because of this, I do not entirely know which symptoms I will experience throughout my life, leaving me in an infinite loop of tests and stuff. I want to build muscle but I am a bit hesitant to currently. The last echo cardiogram I had revealed that at the age of 18 my aorta still has not enlarged. I am wondering if I can begin exercise as a normal person would, or if I should be cautious with exercise. Sorry for my poor English, I am very tired at the moment so I cannot articulate correctly. Any help would be appreciated. When they say it is a new mutation, do they mean:\n\n- it is a spontaneous, non-inherited mutation, but it is still the normal Marfan mutation (i.e. you have Marfan but you are the first person in your family to develop it), OR\n- it is a mutation on the same gene, but it is something different\n\nIf the former then I would follow the Marfan activity guidelines. If the latter I would probably follow the guidelines where not following them means you might die\u2014do not do high intensity exercise or scuba dive. Its the latter, its an entirely new mutation they have never seen before, after testing my mother and grandfather they have discovered that they also have the same mutation I do. Gotcha.\n\nI would take a better safe than sorry approach and avoid high-intensity exercise like CrossFit or rapid changes in pressure like SCUBA diving. Many of the guidelines are tailored to people who are phenotypically Marfan rather than genotypically so. I would assess your self and say \u201cwill doing this thing injure me due to my abnormal phenotype?\u201d If so, I would avoid it. Well, if it comforts you at all, none of us know exactly what we will get from marfan syndrome. It is a syndrome so we can all get a mixed bag of common whatever have you ailments. I, for example, have an entirely different presentation than my own baby brother who is also diagnosed. \n\nIt is going to be so hard to say what you may face. You may not face anything at all and your mutation could be entirely harmless, who knows? If you are entirely asymptomatic in both your heart and your joints, cautious exercise would not hurt but always always always stay in close contact with your doctor.  Have they had any sort of heart, arthritis, or eye problems that could possibly be reclassified to this new genetic issue?", "Invitae Testing (Saliva) Anyone here do testing through Invitae? They claim saliva is just as accurate. Doctor would not order the test but I think it is worth checking. Yes I have had a couple. I think it is pretty accurate. Cleveland clinic said it is just as accurate as blood. I do not see the reason why they would lie about it being one of the best hospitals in the country. I say get your doctor or another doctor to get you the test. It is your health. I was diagnosed by invitae saliva test. Did you order one of their kits or did a doctor order it for you? My cardiologist ordered it and they would only release the results to her I wanted to see a geneticist for the test but the earliest appointment I could find was in August.. \n\nHow old were you when you found out you had it? And what was your aortic root measurement that prompted the cardiologist to order genetic testing? Marfans has been discussed my whole life but I was just diagnosed 9 months ago, I am 42.  My root was 47mm but she ordered the test before that because she wanted to know if I had marfans.  I am very lucky, I have good insurance and a VERY proactive cardiologist.

I can do it if i force it. also, I read that the entire distal phalanx needs to pass the palm for it to count, is that true? I had no idea that being able to do that with my hands was an actual test lol. \nPutting my thumbs that way is not really natural so I guess in a way it is being forced but not like I am purposely trying to stretch it out beyond where it can go, if that makes sense? On my left hand my thumb is visible up to the first knuckle, on my right it stops at the cuticle of my nail. It used to be the same on both but due to nerve damage and mild arthritis in my right hand/wrist things on that side are a bit harder to manipulate. I think you are not supposed to force your thumb outwards with your fingers folded over the thumb. Just fold your thumb across your palm as far as it can go by itself. The medical geneticist made me force my fingers as hard as I could until it showed. So yes. If you can do it at all, forced or not, it is a positive.

Had surgery last year to repair my mitral valve. Aorta is looking good, I am monitored closely. I had scoliosis surgery when I was 14. \n\nAbout two years ago my body went insane. What started as neck pain morphed into me barely being able to walk, because my hips were in excruciating pain. I was diagnosed with Seronegative rheumatoid arthritis, meaning they think I have this but none of the actual markers to confirm it show up in my blood tests. Prior to that they tested me for West Nile, Lyme disease, etc., all negative.\n\nI am currently having my second \u201cflare\u201d in the past three months. Yesterday my shoulder muscle hurt, and a few hours later I was screaming in agony like I was being stabbed (I have been through a lot, I can handle pain, but this pain was almost making me pass out). It hurt to breathe. I went back on the prednisone I took last time, at my doctors instructions, so the pain is manageable right now. \n\nThis is all say, I am not convinced this is arthritis, and neither are my doctor and rheumatologist, but they are at a loss. I am wondering if this is tied to Marfans in any way. This is my long way of asking if anyone has been in a similar situation, or had similar pain? RA affects the joints, and while I have as some joint pain, it feels mostly muscular. Has anyone been diagnosed with RA? Or been misdiagnosed? Just looking for any info I can find. Thanks for reading all this! 33/F here, I do not have RA, but I do know there are people in the many Facebook MFS groups who have both.\n\nI have had the pain you are talking about, or something equivalent in it is suddenness and its debilitating-ness. Mine is tied to Dural Ectasia, in my case they pain starts right about the kidneys, makes it impossible to breathe, stand, sit, and lay in any comfortable manner. The only thing that eventually helps is an NSAID, (In very heavy moderation, since it can be bad for us) and a heating pad to lie on, burning warnings be damned.\n\nEssentially the pain in my case is my nerves/spinal chord/column being pinched like mad. Its much worse in humid weather, and is even worse in cold, humid weather. There is not a lot that can be done to prevent it, other than as soon as I feel that specific type of pain to grab an NSAID and the heating pad. I do not know if there is anything that can be done to help DE. It can be found on an MRI and is usually hanging out in your sacral (?) spine.\n\nBeyond that, it might be a question worth asking over at r/askdocs. They cannot diagnose you, but there are a bunch of verified doctors/nurses/med students/etc of all specialties, they may have better suggestions and information which you can then bring back to your doctor's to see what can be done.\n\nBest of luck! Such pain is a Thank you so much for response! I am sorry you deal with this pain too, it truly is horrible. I have been wondering if it will DE, and mentioned it to my doctor. She is truly amazing, but she was not even familiar with it. I will check out that askdocs page, thank you! Have you seen a chiropractor? I once felt like that and my wife convinced me to visit hers. They did some test that I cannot remember the name of that measures muscle tension and did a few X-rays, then made a small adjustment.

Like just cannot at all.\n\nBasically, is this enough to warrant asking my doctor about Marfan\u2019s and if so, how do I go about doing that? I suppose really anyone can have marfan syndrome.  As for going about asking your doctor, just say you heard of it and you are concerned.  I am sure you doctor would not care if you just asked about it You can have the body shape without having the syndrome. If it is the only symptom you have, I would not worry. Yes, totally. The problem is that having Marfan and extra weight does more harm that the average person - your joints, heart, etc. are already weak. Some of the more serious issues can be silent. My great uncle died of sudden heart complications when he was 22, just dropped dead out of nowhere in the middle of college. I just want to know if it is worth getting checked out, even if it is just to quell my paranoia. Depending on the nature of the heart complications, a family history could be a much more important criteria than the hand sign. I think normally it involves your direct family though.\n\nIf cost is not a concern or your costs are covered, I do not see why you should not check for peace of mind. Yes. I have genetic testing confirmed Marfan syndrome and am obese. Well when you mention your uncle's early heart failure I think there is more concern, see if you can find out his exact cause of death (in the case of Marfan it will most definitely be an aorthic dissection) and see if you can get a couple of exams like an Ecocardiogram or even better a CT scan to check the size of your aortha.\n\nDepending on the results of your exams a Cardiologist should be able to make a proper diagnosis. I too am overweight and 5\u20196. My mum went through a load of shitty doctors before being diagnosed, and despite my mother being confirmed marfan I still had trouble getting diagnosed because I was not \u201cthin enough\u201d.\n\nYou mentioned your uncle, does your parent from that side of the family have any health/physical traits? Marfans is certainly possible for shorter and fatter people too, given they have a number of other symptoms. My mother\u2019s brother is much much MUCH taller than their parents or either of his siblings and has had some heart issues in the past. As far as my own mother, I do not know a lot about her health problems as she does not often share with me but I know she is had a lot of trouble with tendon and joint injuries. She is obese but active and although running brings her joy it puts quite a toll on her joints. Idk, it could just be her extra weight messing with her knees and ankles. I do not really know anything about her heart health and I do not believe she knows much about it either. Yes, of course. People put too much stake on the \"tall and thin\" stereotype- it is just as much a symptom that can be missed as anything else under the umbrella as anything else. There is a reason why Marfan is a *syndrome*. \n\nAll it takes to be overweight is to eat more than you burn. Marfs are not supernatural beings last I checked, so we can be overweight, too.", "My Echo was normal but my Cardiologist will be reviewing the CD of the exam, and I am anxious. Hey all,\n\nI had an echo done and fortunately it all seemed normal. The report said my aorta and mitral valve were normal, however the cardiologist will be reviewing the CD as opposed to the report. Is it possible for them to see something else? I am not officially diagnosed with marfans but my GP and I have concerns. I have breathed a sigh of relief but am wondering if it is too early to do so. No worries, standard practice for a good cardiologist. And if your aorta was enlarged enough to be an immediate concern, they would see it. It is a pretty obvious difference. I would not fret about it. That is the radiologist read.  A good doctor will look at the images too.", "sick of the diagnostic process, is one more round worth it? **Tl;dr**  It seems fairly likely that I could have Marfans but I am tired of spending the time and money on diagnosis. I have chronic joint pain due to hypermobilty (diagnosed). Will following up a marfans possibility benefit me in any way? \n\n\nMy life seems an awful lot like a series of doctors visits at the moment.  I have been trying to get chronic migraines under control for the last 5 years. I have also *finally* been diagnosed as asthmatic after more than a decade of people assuming I was just faking/exaggerating chest pains and shortness of breath. :/ \n\nI also finally caved and started seeking treatment for joint pain.  I have had some issues for as long as I can remember. As a kid my ankles were always very weak and they and my jaw popped a lot.  As a pre teen I had occasional problems with my ankles and wrists. I had braces. As a teenager (19), I have pain in every joint you can name. Because of a family history of autoimmune disorders on my mom's side, we saw my GP who noticed hypermobility and did some bloodwork. It came back clean and we were then sent to a rheumatologist whose reaction was basically \"you *look* healthy what the fuck are you doing here\". She ordered more bloodwork (clean!) and diagnosed joint hypermobility.\nI have had a bit of PT for the hypermobility and I have just started trying out KT tape in the hopes it might actually help. \n\nSo why do I think Marfans might be in the picture? I have the hand signs - thumb folds past the pinkie, I can reach around my wrist with my pinkie finger and thumb.  I have a slight but noticeable outward curve to the manubrium of the sternum. I have been told I have long fingers but they seem fairly normal to me.  I have always been more or less thin but I grew up with 3 neighborhood kids who were chronically underweight (not starving!) so I have never seen myself as particularly lanky. I am not exceptionally tall now, although I was the tallest kid through grade school, but not the oldest. I definitely dont look like a textbook example of Marfans. My dad, on the other hand, does.  He was tested and his heart is fine, so that is reassuring.  Unfortunately healthy heart = no marfans, according to that doctor.  so it is now \"impossible\" that I could have inherited it, according to my family.  I am honestly a bit concerned about going forward without seeing if my heart is also not going to kill me any time soon.\n\nI guess the question is, is fighting my family and spending time and money on more doctors really worth it?", "Worth pursuing a reassesment? M24 Hey guys! 24 year old caucaisian male here. 5th year med student. 6'6 and 200 pounds, mild GERD and anxiety. I saw a doctor with the idea of EDS or Marfans, but he dismissed it. I thought I would give you guys my ideas and see what you think, not taking this for medical advice though\n\nAlways been tall and thin, but fairly muscular from gym training these days. Father is 6'3 and mother is 5'10, they do not have Marfans. No aortic dissections in family. I also have small hands and joints in general when in relation to my height, so not a classical marfanoid habitus. Wingspan under my height. Hypermobility issues especially with my upper back. Good eyesight, no flat feet. Allergies and bruise quite easily. Hyperhidrosis, easily tachycardic from very little exertion. Pectus excavatum and mild scoliois. Elastic skin especially on face and neck. Echo from the beginning of this year showed 3.5cm at sinus of valsalva, so no dilatation. \n\nIt does not scream marfans, but being this tall and thin with pectus and scoliois worries me slightly. Ideas? Not a doctor - also a medical student \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHmm based on your information, this would give you a positive Z-score of approximately 0.33. To be officially diagnosed, you would need:  \na) A z-score of 2 or greater WITH ectopia lentis\n\nb) A z-score of 2 or greater with FBN1 mutation\n\nc) A z-score of 2 or greater with a systematic score on the ghent nosology of 7 or greater.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, it is important to know that, I am not a doctor, and this is by no means a diagnosis. You should go forward with the second opinion just to be sure and try to get a genetical test.   \n\n\nAlso, another helpful detail would be if you had a previous echo done. It is fundamental to compare. This is probably the most important thing when it comes to evaluating Marfan's - comparing echos, looking for any sudden increase in aortic size in the absence of BSA increase. Oh also, I missed something, elastic skin and hypermobility issues is characteristic of Ehler-Danlos syndrome. Very high specificity, you should get evaluated for that as well.", "Suspect I have Marfan Syndrome. Now what? I have many of the physical characteristics of the syndrome, as do many family members. I have frequent heart palpitations, fatigue, migraines, and joint pain. My mom has a heart murmur and has recently discovered severe aortic stenosis. This leads me to question whether it may be related to undiagnosed Marfan.\n\nI checked the list of specialists on marfan.org and there is no one within several hours of my location. Do I start with my primary care doctor and ask for a referral to someone locally? My insurance does not require a referral for specialist visits, so I could possibly skip that step and see someone directly, but I am not sure what type of doctor I am looking for. Do I start with a cardiologist? A rheumatologist?\n\nI hope to get pregnant again soon and am now feeling worried about potential heart issues. Thanks in advance!", "Is it possible to have Marfans without any Aortic Enlargement at 17? So I posted a week ago about getting a TEE and I just had that done and they did not find anything abnormal so the next step is genetic testing and i am not sure if it is even worth doing if I do not have any valve problems or aortic enlargement. I have almost every other symptom of Marfans but if it is not possible for me to have not developed any heart issues then I do not really see the point in pursing this further.\n\nI have never played sports or worked out seriously  and have generally been taking it easy my entire life so i am not sure if that could contribute to having no aortic enlargement this late into my life.\n\n\nJust for the sake of it i will post the symptoms i have been dealing with since birth so you know why I suspect Marfans.

Sorry for the long post. \n\n**Edit:**Thanks everyone, i will definitely get further testing! The people at the hospital were kind of dicks about the whole thing and seemed to think it was not possible to not have aortic enlargement and still have Marfans so it makes me feel much better to know my suspicions are still valid. I guess most people probably would not feel better knowing they possibly still have a life threatening disease but I just want to know what is wrong with me and it is good to know i am still possibly on the right track. ", "Do you have any Pectus deformity? Hi. I am interested to ask if any one of you diagnosed or mafanoids have Pectus excavatum or Pectus carinatum? How is your, mild or severe? \n\nThank you. I have it a bit. \u2018Sup? Carinatum gang we out here.  \n  \nIt was more severe through puberty but only mildly noticeable now that I am older. Carinatum my brother has the opposite like I can stick my fist in his chest I have carinatum* Excavatum here. Had it bad enough that coupled with the scoliosis had a collapsed lung for quite awhile, had a bar inserted to fix it up though so up to no dent Same, and I can only really notice now when i lay on my back or if I lean forward where my chest leans up on things. Mine is relatively severe. wamp wamp.\n\nedit: clarification Excavatum. I used to lay in front of the TV as a kid and eat dry cereal out of it. I do! I call it my uni-boob. It is a hit with the ladies lmao. I imagine if I got mine scanned at the correct angle it would be shaped like a Nike swoosh, but I think it is technically excavatum. It is not neat like typical though. It is kind of... sharp on one side?\n\nMakes it annoying to wear bras.\n\nBrother has severe excavatum, mom had moderate carinatum, grandfather also had carinatum according to my grandma. Lol my brother did that too how long did it take to recover and stop feeling pain? I am considering inserting  a bar myself but I am scared It actually was not that long by any stretch of the imagination, but you have got to take into account I was a child (5) so I was way more able to bounce back from pain, and was a much faster healer so times may vary, but compared to similar surgeries we have (Open heart, spine correction, etc.) it was incredibly easy Question is the collapsed lung due to the pectus?\n\n I notice that when I do deep breathing exercises I do not get the same results as others do, and I wonder if it is my chest inhibiting my lung or lung capacity. It was a combination of the pectus as well as severe scoliosis so yes, but with additions hm fair enough, thanks! Nope, only some mild rib-cage asymmetry. How a bit and what form for it? Excavatum or? I was diagnosed with excavatum last year but found out this year that it is actually Carinatum. Do you have scoliosis? Or any symptoms? How is that? So only some of your ribs sticks in, otherwise a normal chest? My sternum is normal, but on one side I have got 1-2 ribs that are longer and poke out a bit. And on the other one my ribcage  got a little dent. It is not really noticeable, so yeah, otherwise, a normal chest. Alright that is cool tho. How did you get diagnosed then? Family members? Pectus deformity is only one of the many ways the syndrome can manifest itself. Got diagnosed because they found out I had an aortic aneurysm, and then did genetic testing. I have got some other symptoms too, like the height, spider fingers, myopia, extreme hypermobility, etc. Alright. But the genetic test was the main reason for the diagnose? I mean. Without it you cannot be diagnosed right? I am getting tested in 6 days, but my doctor just said to me that she would check my arm-span. And if it was shorter then I 100% do not have it. But just a Marfanoid body You can have Marfan and have a normal arm-span, your doctor is wrong on that front. You can also get diagnosed despite a negative genetic test, but that is more rare (about 10% of cases). \n\nUsually, a geneticist will examine you and take not of how many points you score on the ( In the absence of a family history of Marfan syndrome or a positive genetic test, you would need to either score 7 or higher *and* have an aortic dilatation that is big enough, or have both an aortic dilatation and ectopia lentis (lens dislocation, in the eye).\n\nThe thing is, it is a syndrome. There is some common traits to the syndrome, but every person with Marfan is different, and some will have close to no symptoms while others will get the full blown thing. Genetic tests can help diagnose people, but we still have not found all of the possible mutations that can cause Marfan, so there is some cases where the genetic test will be negative and people will still have enough symptoms to lead to a diagnosis. \n\nIf you take a look at the systemic score I posted earlier, you will see that it is entirely possible to score 7 or higher despite not having some of the features such as a long arm-span or pectus deformity. In my case, for example, I have got both the wrist and thumb sign (3 points), hindfoot deformity (2 points), chest asymmetry (1 point) dural ecstasia (2 points), severe myopia (1 point), and the arm-spa thingie (1 point). That, plus my aneurysm = diagnosis. The genetic test only confirmed things further. \n\nAlso, note that a lot of the symptoms of Marfan are, by themselves, really common in the general population. Lots of people have myopia, or a pectus deformity, without having Marfan. It is the combination of all theses things, with aortic and/or eye issues that hints at someone having the syndrome. Alright so it is pretty hard to diagnose I guess. So I saw on the systematic score that there is 3-4 things where you can get 2 points like the dual ecstasia. I have not been tested, so how should I know if I have it or not?  Also I do not understand the finger sign. If I put my thumb down it is not long enough to go out of my palm if you know what I am saying. But if I take my other hand and help the thumb getting as far as possible, then It can go out of the palm. But without the help of my fingers and other hand my thumb cannot get out of my palm. So I am kind of confused what is a positive finger sign. I do have a positive wrist sign because my wrist is really thin Ideally, a geneticist will have you do those tests and judge by himself. You are not really supposed to diagnose yourself, sadly. For the dural ecstasia, the only way to know is to get scanned. As for the wrist and thumb sign, you need to be able to flex your thumb as far as possible, then close your fingers around it to make a fist. It is positive if it looks like (  Your other hand is not supposed to help out. \n\nFor the wrist sign, the end of your thumb should overlap with the end of your little finger (**not** the index) while curling your hand around your other wrist. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay. So it this considered positive? My hand Not a doctor, but yeah that looks positive to me ;) Alright. But as I said my finger length without help cannot go further my palm. But with help from other fingers/ other hand it can. I am not sure \ud83e\udd14 I am being tested in some day. What do you recommend? The skeletal and the blood test? I have carinatum but didint get surgery cause it didint interfere with much, kind of wish I did anyway just to fix the aesthetic I guess, but for females with it, it makes it a lot less noticeable once u pass puberty and no one can really notice unless u wear a sports bra where the bones might protrude more, but hey once it dosnt cause detriment to ur health like lungs ect it is only just a feature Just try to be seen by a geneticist. They will know what to do. I had mad awful scoliosis, had it corrected a few years ago, but ultimately didint change much for my carinatum. I did notice tho after some research that after some people corrected their carinatum it seemed like their spine really benefited?\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f 31F and I have carinatum. It is not majorly noticeable as my boobs hide the majority of it except when laying down flat. How did you get diagnosed? At birth, both my grandmother and father were diagnosed with marfans throughout their lives so they knew to test me and my brother when we were born. Excavatum. Did you get the diagnose because of family history? I forget the diagnosis, but one half of my ribcage is all sunken in the other side protrudes out \ud83e\udd74  really emphasizes the typical asymmetry girls already deal with of their chest", "what exercise do you do? i am a girl, i am not trying to bulk up like a lot of the threads on here, just stay healthy. so far my heart is 24mm so it is actually the scoliosis that is more of a concern - my back doctor has said nothing will make it worse but hes treating it from an idiopathic angle and i worry that actually because it stems from marfan and loose ligaments and things, that exercises like running or whatever will make it worse. at the moment all i do is strengthening exercises like planks because i worry that even things like pushups will worsen my back - so if you have scoliosis, what exercise do you do? hello, you want to strengthening your back. I would ask a physical therapist for more info on what ro avoid and what could help target your unique  curvature. my doctors really like pilates  due to it being low impact and helping form lean muscles Hi, i have marfans but i dont have heart problems and my scoliosis is normal (just from bad posture). However my doctor suggested taking up pilates. It is great because it makes you stronger: your abs, you back, your arms, etc. but i think you should talk to your doctor and a therapist. If they allow you to, maybe look for private lessons as they focus only on you. They said me that swimming is the best option. Also, I have a personal table of exercise with machines of the gym and isometric exercises (I have Marfan too) Maybe look into yoga? I used to do it all the time and loved it. I also like Pilates and swimming and walking. My doc said no running and that I should not do boxing or anything with resistance. Sometimes I find with yoga and scoliosis I sometimes make my back hurt more or stretch myself without building strength. So I try not to do more than 20-30 mins of yoga (I need it for mental health!!!!) I also love cycling.", "A marfan guy got covid-19 Hello, I am new to this community, I am a male and im 17 years old, I work as a nursing assistant and im studying nursing.\n\nAnd by virtue of my work in the hospital, the rate of infection with covid-19 virus has become greater, and almost 2 weeks ago I mixed with my friend at work and he had most of the symptoms of covid-19, two days later I woke up in the morning to find that my whole body was hurting me so that I was not able to lift my shoulder from the bed, I immediately measured the temperature and found it 38.5, and after that I made a quarantine in my room.\nThe next day I woke up and the symptoms had decreased, and in the third day the symptoms disappeared completely, but only the sense of smell weakened.\nAnd now my friend who i mixed with he got tested for covid,19 and its positive.\nI do not have any heart diseases, but I have a family history of injuries.

Marfan's has barely affected my life outside of some teasing when I was a kid and it is hard to buy shoes or clothing that fits my long thin body. I have had a full life and so can you. This", "Eyes questions How severe is your myopia? Anyone got ectopia lentis and when did it start developing? How common is lazy eye with Marfan? \n\nThanks for your answers Mine is not extremely severe. No ectopia lentis or retina issues so far, but my neurologist is making me go to an ophthalmologist due to a problem with aura and flashing that we cannot seem to get rid of with her treatments. My optometrists have seen nothing wrong other than the mild myopia, but my neurologist wants a more detailed work through.  \n\nI have a lot of neuro issues, though, so I would not be surprised if they found out this was somehow caused by my spine, too.  Can you legally drive? Yep, no problems on that front. My state has a super lenient eye test, too, and I am really good at guessing the fuzzier letters so I think my back/legs will give out before my eyes do for driving. At 3feet I could not make out faces. I had to b hold books within a couple inches of my eyes. \n\nIntraocular lens implants have been fantastic. I had pretty severe myopia, around -8.5 on both eyes, and some astigmatism. \n\nI got LASIK, against the advice of some providers, but I have had 20/20 vision for over a year and I have no regrets. \n\nMy eyesight started deteriorating around 4th grade.  I thought it would be somehow dangerous to do a LASIK surgery. Did doctors know you had a Marfan syndrome? Yes, I told all doctors involved in the procedure. I still chose to take the risk. I have severe eye issues. I was never able to drive because of them. I get that some people might be willing to risk lasik and that is their choice. \n\nI have lost and eye to a retinal detachment. The surgeries I had in an attempt to save my vision were agony beyond what I can describe with words (I have had multiple heart surgeries/bone dislocations...it does not compare) . In the end not only did I lose my eye, I also ended up with a very badly damaged cornea that blistered with the slightest irritation putting me in bed at least half the days of any given week. Corneal blisters are hell (especially post operative ones) and really maximum doses of dilauded barely took the edge off. You just lay there and writhe until it heals over (approx 48 hours). In the end I needed a corneal transplant because my cornea would not heal. \n\nThis is what lasik can do to fragile connective tissues. It is your choice. But sincerely,  I would not wish the pain I experienced on anyone. \n\nNo, my retina did not detach because of lasik, but it detached because I was being stupid and doing isometric exercises I should not have been. We are \"cautioned\" for a reason. It is not that things will go wrong, its that there is a much higher likelihood they will with us and when they do, its catastrophic. \n\nIf you are considering lasik please think about it. I have an eye doctor in the family. He was one of the first doctors to do lasik in our area. He had ALWAYS refused to perform the surgery on anyone with a connective tissue disorder.  Yes, everyone knew. My surgeon was aware of it, but thought my eye was healthy enough for the procedure. \n\nHe, of course, cautioned me that the surgery could  be unsuccessful, or that i could lose my gains overtime. ", "digestive issues? ", "Marfan's? So I have pectus excavatum, eye astigmatism, am near sighted, have long legs compared to torso, am underweight, have flat feed, long ass fingers, and shoulder instability. I assume this is enough reason to pursue diagnosis? Not sure if I am being paranoid haha", "exercises in marfan I(20m) had my aortic root surgery this year and this was the only expression of the syndrome(witch was confirmed) that disturbed my sports (basketball, soccer, tabble tennis and typical workout), the other ones were actually pretty helpful (long arms/legs and skinny body).\n\n\nmy cardiologist said that I would have a completely normal life after the surgery and would never need another one. But I see a lot of relats of people who got their aort growing in another location, is it possible that as a marfan I wont have this trait? I am not entirely sure what you are asking but that sounds like a question only your doctor can answer", "Just got told I have a partial aortic dissection? Has anyone ever had one? My aorta is not that dilated on an echo but on the CT scan I guess they could see a dissection....they want to put me on a beta blocker and do another CT scan in a month but is this generally something they just monitor? Or do you usually need surgery? They did not really give me any answers over the phone. TIA! First off, sorry that this happened to you. I am surprised that they didnt give you more information. You should absolutely call your doc asap and ask every question you have, while this community is filled with ppl with a wide range of experience, were are not doctors. \nI have had several dissections and they all required surgery. But again, that is my personal experience and may not be what your doctor recommends. \nIt is important to always remember that marfans effects everyone a little differently, it is a big spectrum, and only a professional can tell you what course of action to take. I have a Type B dissection a decade ago and they found evidence later that I had another dissection previously that had healed. Mine sealed themselves so I did not need surgery. Thanks! Thanks that makes me feel better! No problem. Good luck!", "It is often to get muscular crump for being Marfan? Am I the only one who very often gets muscle cramps in the legs when lying in bed, driving, etc...? And I eat a lot of bananas (they say they prevent cramps) and stay hydrated. I am asking here in case it is something related to Marfan's. I dont think its related with marfan but i cant be sure. Might want to get a  check up if its disturbing your daily life Is it something recent or an ongoing thing?\n\nIf it is recent you may just need to stretch it. Try stretching the area and your legs in general followed by a light massage in the area. Yep, back of my calves, tops of feet, and my hands! They come and go, I was put on a magnesium supplement and it helped a toon. Not medical advice by any means, but my doctor had me take 500mg one time per day. I tend to stop the supplement after a while and see if they come back, then start taking them again if the cramps come I have Marfan Syndrome and I do take a magnesium supplement. I would say that I sometimes get a lot of muscle cramps in my legs, feet and toes. I have noticed that if I drink a lot of fake sugar (diet coke etc) I get a ton of muscle cramps, so I try avoid these. Also I get cramps if I am sitting uncomfortably, like in a very small car or on a plane etc, or if I am sleeping in a very small bed. Yeah. This was what it felt like in the beginning when dural ectasia started acting up. Eventually it turned to full on leg twitches/goblins with a blow torch on my leg. I use 50 mg of topomax daily which takes care of 70% of the cramps. Low dose kaidian dulls a lot of the rest. \n\nI hope you find a combo that works for you. Yes!! I get them super often in my feet and calves. Two triggers I have noticed are alcohol and socks. The socks must be a physical thing, like my feet do not like being constrained. But the alcohol must some how be related to dehydration or maybe sugar. Not sure, but typically hydration does help decrease the occurrence of my cramps. For me it turned out atenelol was wrecking havoc on my system. Not just only horrific cramps for some reason, but joint pain unbelievable, and the list of what it caused goes on and on. I talked about it in detail ( To say it made a major life changing impact on my life, is still an understatement. One other person found this to be the case for them as well and were immensely thankful when I talked about my story. But by and large I could have just been an outlier. I wish you well \ud83d\udc4d", "pins and needles sensation  \nThe past few days I have noticed this sensation of pins and needles in both of my arms whenever I stand and rest both of them at my side. I would also say that its predominantly more \u201csensational\u201d on my left arm than it is on my right. It will go away when I am i am in motion. I have had scoliosis surgery when i was a teenager. \n\nI do not know what this could be. I did some stretching to see if it could alleviate the sensation however, it is still present. Should I contact my cardiologist about my situation ?", "Has anyone had the COVID vaccine? I have an appointment tomorrow for my first dose of the COVID vaccine. I am so nervous. Has anyone received it and if so what was your experience like? Thanks I have not but both my grandmas and my grandpa did. They did not felt anything beside a bit of muscular pain on the location of the vaccine.\n\nI am a researcher at the health field and I have read through the papers of some the vaccine studies and despite it was all published and reaserched in a small amount of time compared to other vaccines, they were all immaculate on methood and precision of data. All the safety measures and tests were followed and taking it is no different from taking a flu vaccine. \n\nSome other possible collateral effects from the shot are:\n- Mild weakness\n- Mild fever\nthey are all brief simptoms that tend to go away shortly and are not caused by anything related directly to the covid virus, but it is an response from your immune system learning to fight the virus throught the proteins contained in the vaccine.\n\nIf you have more questions feel free to ask or pm :) I got my first dose. It was really simple. My arm hurt the first night like any other shot. But I otherwise felt fine. No side effects. I had my first dose last week of the Australian Zenica (Oxford one)\n\nIt was a quick and efficient process (uk). I queued outside the church it was being administered in for about 10 minutes. Then got waved inside to fill out a form so they could check for allergies. \n\nThey went over to a volunteer who again verbally checked for allergies and confirmed my name and DOB etc and then he jabbed me and it was over I  seconds. \n\nMy arm hurt for about 3-4 days and I had a mild headache for 1 day.\n\nSide effects do vary, I know a couple of people who felt really poorly, with fevers, headaches etc but after 2 days they were fine again! \n\nDefinitely have some paracetamol on hand for side effects but overall its Sister is positive to Loyes Dietz she got vaccinated back in December since she is a doctor. Had dose #1 of Moderna, dose #2 next week. Tbh my healthy non-Marfan mother reacted more than I did. Going for round 2 of moderna today actually.\n\nFelt a little off with my first one (like when the dose on my heart meds was off or something) but pretty smooth sailing.\n\nIf you are worried about the broader stuff, /u/FreshThumbs seems like a great resource!  I am a biochemist but my real area are enzymes themselves.  One of the things I found really interesting though is how they were able to quickly get through trials.\n\nFor ethical reasons, you cannot really do a \"challenge\" study, where you expose someone intentionally to the virus.  This means you have to let the control (placebo) group go about their business until they naturally develop infection to a statistical threshold.  Tricky to do for a lot of diseases, pretty easy when there is an active global pandemic. I got my second dose of the pfizer vaccine a few days ago and am doing great!! I was just SURE that with all the things wrong with my health that the vaccine would kick my butt for a day or 2, but each dose was fine for me. Just felt like I would worked out the muscle the shot went into for around 24 hrs and maybe felt a little tired... but I am always tired, so maybe it was just me haha I have had the first dose of Pfizer, I was very ill the next day with a migraine and a fever but that passed quickly. I was fine after that. I have had my 2nd dose of the Phifzer vaccine for over a month now and I honestly felt pretty darn good during the process. \n\nI was expecting to get some side effects like many people have said in the media, but I got to be honest.. I did not feel anything of sort (at least not from my usual aches and pains that come from being a Marfanoid.) The only thing I tell people is that your arm feels sore for like a day and a half, but that is normal from every shot. I get poked with needles and IV\u2019s often it just comes with the territory at this point. Thanks everyone this definitely helped. It is been 24 hours and I feel good, no symptoms \ud83d\ude0a I got the phizer vaccine back in February. The first shot was painless, mild muscle ache at the injection site, similar to the flu vaccine. Second shot I felt mildly sick for a couple days, just aches and feeling blah. That is normal though, second shot is supposed to produce more of an immune response. hell no Just received my first shot today, other than a little soreness wher I received the shot I am feeling fine I received the Moderna vacine", "A shock, a minor revelatory moment, and now, a \"hello\"! Well, happy Tuesday. \n\nBrief back story- this summer, my SO (a med student) recommended that I inquire about a connective tissue disorder with my PCP. I heeded his advice, and doc guessed EDS type 4. A second GP echoed that. Just before the new year I finally met with my Rheum- and he hit me with a big one- Marfans- which of course I had come across in my \"research\", and to be frank, terrified me. Due to the presence of both Marfan and EDS characteristics, I am now waiting for April to roll around for my first meeting with my very own genetic counsellor for definitive testing. \n\nA minor revelatory moment occurred when, in the midst of my panic, I came to the conclusion that regardless what name you give it, I am still exactly who I am the way that I always have been. Nothing is new, nothing is different, nothing will be changing because of the name that it is given. A breath of fresh air. \n\nAt any rate, here I am! 23 year old female. I am certainly marfanoid in appearance, at 5'10\" weighing in at 115lbs, incredibly long fingers, what my rheum called \"fairly severe pectus excavatum\", scoliosis, and the list goes on. What I do NOT have, however, is corrective lenses (though I could probably use some, but have not had my vision checked since elementary school) or any immediate concerns regarding heart health that I am aware of, though I do frequently experience tachycardia and a miscellany of other oddities of my vital signs. \n\nSo, my question for you all is this: those of you diagnosed without family history, what was your journey like? How has the dx (having a name for it, I mean) changed your lifelong journey? Are there things about it that you continue to struggle with?\nThose of you who, like myself, have the presence of some of the signs and features while others are absent, do you have family members who also vary in degrees/severity or in the manifestation of the typical \"signs\"? What has your journey been like? \n\nI am interested to learn a little bit more about a world that seems so foreign, but to which I may have been a member of all along! Thank you, and CHEERS!", "Any Indian Marfan Here? Idk it kind of feels lonely at the top(pun intended). You. I like you. I am Bengali if that counts Have to ask, India or NA?  (I ask because I am the only NA Marf I have ever met and any of my doctors have seen.)  I understand I am not from India, but I sure do get called Indian by a lot of people. I am from NA but not totally sure I have Marfans. I am a pretty lanky guy but I am only about 6\u20190. Concaved chest (3cm) and some unstraightened teeth are the only other symptoms leading me to believe this. Yes I have the all the physical features but did not get tested..

Im supposed to get tested for marfans soon bc my dr suspects it. Well a specialist for something else suspected it and then she told my family dr. But my echo was normal, so yeah. Just wondering! They did. That is how I found out I also have Ehlers Danlos. They will test your genes for any mutations and give you a detailed report of the findings. I see, thank you! That is a good question. I had genetic testing but to be honest I am not sure if they tested for other things, although in my case it was pretty clear I had Marfans.

I had surgery to correct my scoliosis when I was 11. Rods from just about the top to bottom. I am currently 37 and also have Marfans syndrome and take Atenolol daily. I am not a pain pill person and would like to try something a little more natural. Would love to hear if anyone has tried and how it felt. Thanks so much! #MyFirstRedditPostBeGentle In my experience CBD works best for emotional or cognitive difficulties over physical... when it comes to physical pain it works a biiiit but more so relaxes you.. if it is legal where you live for medical or for rec I definitely recommend weed for physical pain. It works a lot better, but YMMV. :) I am 20 and got some crazy scoliosis, but it doesnt actually hurts and I can manage to keep it controlled with pilates and stretches, but I have got 2 recomendations from docs for surgery and only one doc said I could wait to see if it progresses.\nThe truth is that I am terrified about this surgery because they say the recuperarion is the worst and I am afraid It will hurt more than if I had not done.\nAnd I have got some questions about mobillity. are you sill able to dance/do some soft sports (running/friendly basketball/ tabble tennis)? yeah, the component that will work on pain relieving is THC. You should check with a doc if it is safe for you, he may ask for family history of schyzo and some other things, but if you are not on the risk group it is pretty safe if used with responsability. I smoke weed and take kratom for my pain and scoliosis/kyphosis and arthritic pain. Kratom is a plant PM if you want more info and a safe reputable vendor. They run lab tests for contamination and heavy metals, I have took kratom on and off for 6 years now Yes cbd works I not entirely sure weed is the best option for a person with mafans since it does not just effect the heart, but also blood pressure and what not Well, I cannot dance, but I do not think that is related to the scoliosis or Marfans, I just have no rhythm Lol. But yes, I can do all of those things :) 2 years ago I took a nasty fall and jacked up my hip on top of everything else lol #clumsy so I have a bit of limited mobility but for the most part, I can do just about anything. I mean all of my doctors are aware, my heart is monitored regularly and nothing is out of normal and I have smoked weed for 9 years and was an iv drug user for 4. \n\nIt is definitely case by case but I have never had any issues Wait even your aorta has been stable?? I mean it is dilated but not in the range that raises red flags. Even after shooting heroin, crack, fentanyl, ketamine and cocaine plus an assortment of pills. It never changed drastically from even my hardest of stimulant binges. Well dam Mine is still at the same range even when I vaped at one point. I think that is dependent on a number of variables.  My 14 year old daughter has had leg pains since birth.  We tried multiple CBD variations and doses and none worked on her at all.  We were bummed.

Having mine replaced in a few months and kind of nervous. I had this surgery a few years ago! I was young and when I woke up I noticed the clicking noise and asked about it, thought it was some clock somewhere! Now I barely notice it, only if I think about it. I use it to count seconds sometimes.\n\nIt took me just one week to come back home from hospital after the surgery and I started to go to school immediately, so the recovery was pretty fast.\n\nMy experience with Coumadin has been positive, I get the inr checked once per month and that is enough for me, it is pretty stable. Some people have to check it more often. You have to be more careful with cuts, but it is no big deal. I had a fair share of injuries such as cuts, burns etc and it was never a problem to recover.\n\nUnfortunately, the outcome of the surgery is where I had a bad experience. The surgeon did not initially plan on replacing my valve with a mechanical one, but he had to, for some reason that was not clear. He basically tried 2 or 3 times to \"save\" my valve, and that is probably what led to a dissection of the descending thoracic aorta and a second (successful) surgery one year later. You are going to get the valve replaced from the start so that should not be a problem I actually had the reverse experience of you! About 8 months ago I had my aortic aneurysm fixed. They put a graft in place of my aortic arch and hemi arch. I had a ton of complications/rough recovery and all the extra trauma on my body has led to my valve to now leak. \n\nBut i am glad to hear the clicking has not been bothersome! Do you have a partner? If so, have they been bothered by the clicking? My godfather had the same surgery and I remember asking his wife about this, she said she does not hear it anymore and it was never an issue. Do not think my ex gf ever said something about it either I had it done 25+ years ago. No additional surgery so far. No weird bleeding due to Coumadin either. I get my blood tested once a month. I have an On-X heart valve.  I might recommend looking into it.  It is I believe the only valve that has a lower INR requirement due to the material it is made of and design.  In the EU I believe they just take baby aspirin but in the US the FDA has approved a lower INR (less blood thinners).\n\nI also have a Dacron sheath over my ascending aorta.  The clicking was a little bit to get used to but it gets quieter over time.  I believe tissues grows over the valve or something like that. You also get used to it. I hardly ever notice it anymore.  Children (with their better hearing) are more keen to hear it.  My partner noticed it but it was not enough to keep her from sleeping or anything.  I remember after surgery a nurse trying to figure out where the \"watch\" was.\n\nRecovery was slow but steady.  I was also put on beta blockers and it took a few to find one that did not knock me on my ass.  I would be happy to answer any more questions about your upcoming surgery.  Mine was totally unexpected and pretty much an emergency surgery so it might be a bit different of an experience for you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are the people that made my valve.  They happen to be made locally and I got to tour the factory and even got a ring made of the same material.  I also have a tattoo of it!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n( My surgeon actually suggested the On-x valve! I guess i am uneducated on the topic because I thought it was the same thing as the mechanical valve. I did not know they only take baby aspirin for it in the EU. I think they must be pushing for this in the US as well because my surgeon mentioned a new promising study in the US that should hopefully stop the need to take coumadin with the onyx valve. He thinks in 5-10 years it should be approved so fingers crossed. \n\nThat is so cool you got a tour. What state is the factory in? Did you just reach out to the company? I would love a ring of the same material that is so cool! The On-X is the most advanced valve. It is a mechanical valve but it is also the brand.  Yes, the FDA is just slower to adopt things than the EU.  The design causes less \"eddies\" that can cause clots and also the material is super slick and hard for anything to hold onto it.\n\nThe factory is in Austin, TX.  Yeah I reached out to them to let them know I got a tattoo and they wanted to see it. I think they took info down in case they wanted to use it as a \"story\".    \n\n\nHere is a picture of the valve, the ring, and my tattoo!  \n\n\n( Cannot even remember how long it is been for me. I had problems with the local surgery not keeping my INR under control so made a crappy website to track it myself, bought my own meter and monitor it myself.\n\nI now check once a fortnight and keep it far more stable. \n\nThe clicking is not that annoying after a while either. You notice it if it is really quiet but otherwise general noise tends to drown it out. There was the odd time in hospital you would see someone check there watch because my tick is irregular! \ud83d\ude0f\ud83d\ude1b I am having valve sparing surgery on my root/arch soon. Hoping this does not happen to me, especially since all of my valves leak a bit. mention it to your doctor and see if there is anything you can do preventatively to help. mine was apparently caused from excess inflammation and i know there is some evidence to support supplements like turmeric, ginger, fish oil etc can help with inflammation. Not that a simple vitamin will cure all problems but it may be worth trying. \n\nAnother thing I think would have improved my chances was if i weighed more. I am 6\u20192 and 100lbs. I am trying to gain as much as I can before this next surgery but it is super hard because of my marfans. I just had this procedure on April 12, 2021. In the few weeks living with this valve the clicking is noticeable for me because I am always in a relatively quiet environment. So far I can not drown it out with my headphones, but I hope that I will get used to it soon. So far I am healing very well and I have my follow up appointment this Thursday. In regards to the Coumadin, my INR has been 1.6 for the last two weeks. My Coumadin clinic is not trying to have a big spike in my meds because they do not want to make my INR too high but they are still getting me to therapeutic range. My cardiologist and my surgeon plan do the Eliquis trial sometime in the near future.  Other than having a lot of INR appointments it is not bad so far. I am noticeably colder all the time, so having a blanket and good fleece jacket post op is ideal. \n\nI did have one issue where they were over treating my blood pressure post op and I passed out and fell on the floor at home. That gave my parents and I quite a scare. \n\nThe scar is not as bad as I thought it would be either and it is healing really nicely. \n\nFor me at least, I started walking the day after surgery, but eating was not fun as 1. the food is horrible  and 2. I just did not have a good appetite because everything smelled and tasted weird IMO. When I got home a week after surgery, I started doing 30 min walks on flat ground, it did help me to get a feel for the sound of the valve and to just get outside and away from people (with my family still watching from a distance OFC). \n\nPlease be sure that you have a good support system that can help with mental stuff too, I cannot stress that enough. I still do not feel myself mentally. \n\nI am 21 M (aortic valve/root replacement with on-x aortic valve conduit). Feel free to Direct message me if you have any questions. this is really fresh in my head. Glad to hear your surgery went smoothly! You seem to be making amazing progress in your recovery! \n\nDo you have apple airpods? I know they have a technology that helps drone out your heartbeat, swallowing, breathing etc. I bet some other headphones so this too. \n\nI definitely agree that it is a hard thing to go through mentally. Partially I think because during recovery you are mostly sitting around watching netflix. This would make anyone down. I spoke with a therapist frequently following my past open heart. She actually had a ton of great tips and advice! you are definitely right. I do not think watching John Wick movies after surgery is helpful either. Funny enough, one the nurses watched it while he was giving me my meds. 42, M, Had my replacement with on-x and root reconstruction on 4/28.  Not going to lie, recovery is tough.  Getting out of the hospital was a big improvement, better sleep, better food, better bowl movements (nurses are obsessed with constipation).  I am always uncomfortable but getting better every day.  The clicking is already almost unnoticed unless I listen for it.  The complete lack of energy is almost scary.  I am not a nap all day or watch tv all day guy and right now that is all I have energy for.  INR clinic has been fine, twice a week right now but only takes 2 minutes for the test. I had AVR in 2008 and have a mechanical St Jude's valve that requires me to take warfarin. This was actually a second bout of heart surgery as the first time round  in  2005 they tried to repair the valve but that was not successful. I was younger the first time round and was keen not to be dependent on warfarin forever but that choice was taken off the table in 2008. It was strange hearing the valve tick at first and over time it became hardly noticeable and at least when I hear it now it reminds me I am alive:-) Taking warfarin for me has been a strange experience as my INR fluctuates more than I would want it to but to be honest the testing and regemin is now firmly baked into my life.  Foods (vegetables)  containing vitamin K I steer clear of because they interact with warfarin along with excessive alcohol that does the opposite in thinning the blood. I typically get INR checked once a month or sometime twice a month if the INR is out of range and my dose is adjusted. I have pondered getting a Coagucheck home testing machine and may do so to avoid trips to my GP. The only issue with that is whilst the machine is relatively cheap to buy, the testing strips and a recurring cost and quite expensive. Furthermore not every GP offers to take your reading over the phone/email to adjust your does although mine does. Another important thing to bear in mind is that if you ever require  some kind of surgery in the future you will need to spend  more time on hospital either side of your procedure in order to lower your INR pre theater and then raise your INR post Op. This can be frustrating especially if like me you want to get the hell out of hospital ASAP! Other things to be aware of is that being on warfarin means you can bleed like a pig even from the smallest cut and I have spend many minutes of my life pressing down on wounds to stem blood flow so patience is definitely a virtue. Also, makes sense to be extra careful with sharp objects! The final insight from me is to make sure that taking warfarin daily becomes a permanent part of the daily routine as missing a dose can have a significant impact on your INR. This can become more of an issue if your next blood test is weeks away. Hope my post has been useful and more than happy to share my experiences with anyone else that lives with this unique condition that has a whole spectrum of health impacts that effect some people more than others. thank you for this! It is interesting to hear these details that i would not think of. Some things I wonder is what about cuts in the mouth? Like from flossing too hard. How does one stop that from bleeding. \n\nAlso, I am not sure your sex but if female, how does it affect your periods if any? My gums on occasion have bled when brushing however it does not persist and I have found that a couple of extra rinses sorts it out. One time I bit my tongue and that was very hard to stop bleeding and it took me almost 24 hours of having some gauze on it! I cannot comment on the period being a man but pretty sure your  physician can inform you but suspect there may be some increased blood flow. My wife is now so accustomed to the clicking that she cannot fall asleep without it.", "Marfan's Research Project, any answers are very much appreciated! :) Hey you all, so I am a highschool student currently studying genetic disorders in Biology, and have been assigned a project on Marfans! I have been researching for about a week or two now but I have been struggling on a specific section asking about emotional impacts on those affected by Marfan's and their family. Its a bit hard as most of the internet is focused mostly on the physical impacts, and mental impacts are a bit scarce. So I came here as there are people here that have it and I can possibly find answers directly from the beautiful people here! \n\nQuestions I need answered are, from the parents perspective (mostly);\n\n1. What changes to your daily routine have been made to support you or your child?\n\n2. What has been the emotional impact on you, your spouse, your child, and the rest of the family.\n\n3. How will your child be tre eated diffrently, and how will this affect them?\n\nThank you so much for reading and any replies are very much appreciated, and if you are not able to that is alright! Thank you so much and have an amazing day/night all of you beautiful and strong people!! :) Both my husband and son have Marfans syndrome, but are overall healthy individuals. I think the things they have struggled most with emotionally have been due to being made to feel different. My son had been very verbal from a young age and obviously tall as well. He is often received comments about being too big to act certain ways, even when he was just a two year old. Everyone has always expected him to be more grown up simply because he looks more grown up, and I do not want him to miss out on the chance to be a kid.\n\nI struggled as a mom as he often wanted to be carried (having loose joints is exhausting), but he was physically too big for me to carry and over my husband's weight limit to safely carry. (My husband's cardiologist sideways he not lost more than 40 pounds at a time as lifting more would put too much stress on his aorta. \n\nMy son wears glasses and ankle orthotics (like plastic support braces), which help him live his best life, and he gets embarrassed when people mention them. We refer to them as this summer armor, and that helps him I think.\n\nLet us see, my husband had to carry his birth certificate around for school events for years, because people always questioned how old he was, and if he was too old to be participating in events. He hated this I have it and so do both of my children. As the one who passed it on to them, that is its own emotional burden, but that would be a whole lot to unpack, so I will let that be. To answer your questions, though: \n\nThey cannot participate in the same physical activities as most children. This is to protect their heart. As you can imagine that can have an emotional impact on them, and makes them feel different. This is over and above already feeling different because they look different. \n\nMy son has already gone through a number of surgeries, and his eyesight is a major challenge, as he wears both contacts and glasses. My daughter is not as effected as she is only 4. However they will continue to have health struggles their whole life. Up to and including chronic pain issues which is what I am currently dealing with. It will be very hard on the whole family, emotionally, financially, physically.\n\nIt is hard to say how others WILL treat them and how they WILL be affected by this. I know what my own experience was growing up, but society has matured a little bit when it comes to bullying, so I would like to hope that they will not have it quite as bad, but that could very well be wishful thinking as their dad. The plus side is that once they make it to adulthood, society tends to favor tall people, so they will have that going for them.\n\nI could go on and on, but dinner is on the stove. Good luck! Thank you so much for your reply, I really do appreciate it more than I can express with text and words! I wish you and your family the best and thank you for taking the time to reply! :) Wow, thank you for sharing! I appreciate it so much and wish you and your family the best present and future!! :D 1. My spouse and children have Marfans. For daily life - we spend about 1/5th of our income on health care so we try to live a pretty frugal life. I do not let my children participate in most athletic activities - mostly for health reason. But my oldest was very self conscious in P.E., so I will get them out of things for confidence issues as well.\n2. I feel discouraged and worried often. One child has already passed away and I have sat through many surgeries. I feel like it causes a lot of anxiety in all of us. What bad thing is going to happen next? Who is going to need the next surgery?\n3. The health care my kids get is mainly a \"wait and see\" approach. So they are probably going to be dealing with anxiety about it the rest of their lives. They will know they are probably going to need a major surgery but when? For their appearance, they may feel self conscious at times but since they have family that looks like them, that might help some. I agree with the previous comments that people assume they are older so we have had some rude comments before. On a lighter note, my kids have had huge disappointments about never fitting in a Power Wheel car. \n\nGood luck with your project! I am impressed on how much research you are doing. Please, consider a career in health care ;) Thank you so much, this is very useful in my quest for a well thought out and thorough project! And thank you for that last bit, I have thought about a career in healthcare when I was younger but my passions are more with Illustration and Design, Animation, and Music (Percussion, specifically)! :) 1: As Marfans Syndrome is kind of a spectrum, it varies from person to person. For me and my brother specifically, we need to wear really thick glasses and in PE classes we are not allowed to participate in a lot of units due to fear of aortic dissection. Never been a problem as we do not have it that bad, of course.\n2: Having Marfans naturally came with way more doctors visits than one might usually have. I have had two eye surgeries to get my lenses taken out, because (as you may or may not know already) Marfans affects connective tissue and my lens was floating to the front of my eye and it could have damaged parts of my eye and I could have gone blind. The doctors visits, possible surgeries, surgery recoveries, and echocardiograms can have a big impact on school performance and have caused some problems for me.  This depends on the person, but having Marfans has given me a lot of self esteem problems as I look different and feel ugly most of the time. That is a more specific emotional side effect though.\n3: A lot of schools did not accept me because they were afraid that I would have a heart attach or something while under they are care. If you educate teachers and staff about this condition that will always try to cater to your needs and that is great. When dealing with peers your age, especially on the younger or less \"courteous\" side, you will almost always hear \"your eyes are big\" it \"why do you look anorexic\" or various comments about your height. That last one does not sound so bad until you hear it every day. This CAN be considered a compliment, but in my case it is unattractive to be tall. So probably be ready for that.\n\nI hope this helped Oh boy. So you will get a lot of variation in these answers as it depends on how badly each person  is effected.\n\n1. My husband was very lucky in that his work was super accommodating and  allowed him to work from home.  This allows  him to help more with things around the house. Our son is mildly effected right now. I am visually  impaired  and have a lot of joint issues/heart issues so I tire\n easily. \n2. Emotionally. Well. That is  hard to. I worked very hard at school. I had a very hard time giving  up my career. Basically  we try to find the fun as much as possible  and deal with health issues  as they come as honestly  as we can. My spouse  burns out. So do I. This disease is hard.\n3. I hate seeing  my son get teased for  some  of  the same nonsense  that I did. People  are calleous  and  cruel.   We claim to be an anti bullying  society  but that is  nonsense.  No teacher ever stops the kids that come at my son. He loves that he can talk to me. He tells me that a lot. I think having  someone  get it helps. 1. I am living post dissection.  I have had to stop working which is boring as hell but I feel better not having to put my body through the physical stress. After my surgery I had to take more Blood pressure medication which made me very tired so I stopped going out unless it is necessary.\n2. I am not going to lie, it is depressing.  It is not easy having an advanced case of Marfans knowing the odds to live a full long life are not really in your favor. I cannot have kids, I cannot do most things other people do and it wears me down a lot if I get to hung up on it. In my teens I was very depressed and even suicidal.  I spent most of my adulthood in therapy to manage my depression.  Now I am trying to manage my anxiety.  Ever since I had a dissection every little chest pain I have strikes a fear in me.  As far as my family goes we do not really talk about it cause we are just not those kind of people.\n3. I have been treated differently my whole life.  Either people stare at me cause I look different, or they flat out say something like \"what is wrong with your legs/wrists?\" It affected me more when I was younger.  It definitely did not help my self esteem.  Then I grew up, gained some maturity, realized life is complicated and full of nuance.  Not every one in the world will like me or think I am attracive.  That is a true statement for literally every human on earth. I am really not that different from everyone else. There is many great comments here that do good in breaking our various reasons for mental problems related too having Marfans.\n\nFor myself it is definitely related to mental health and social anxiety DUE TO the physical characteristics associated with having I have always been self conscious about the way I look and it has greatly impacted my confidence.\n\nThis leads to a lot of problems like social anxiety, depression, and overall will to do anything. \n\nFor myself the greatest impact has been in the relationship side of things. I am a 24M and have yet to come close to having a relationship with someone never mind pursuing one due to all things mentioned above. I have it and my son likely has it as well. He is only 6yo, and I was officially diagnosed after he was born. I also have a 3yo daughter who is not exhibiting any of the telltale physical traits of Marfan's that my son is displaying.\n\n1. So far there have been no changes made for my son. He is pretty normal aside from being a four foot tall six year old. This may or may not change as he gets older. My daily routine is impacted mostly by the fact that I am starting to get arthritis (I am only 40) and my physical activity is somewhat limited. It takes me a while to get mobile in the morning without too much discomfort. I am also usually pretty sore at night when I go to bed. I also take heart medication that increases my fatigue. The part of this that causes me the most distress is not the pain or discomfort, but the fact that I cannot be as active with my children as I like.\n\n2. I definitely harbored a lot of guilt after being diagnosed. However I have moved past that. The alternative is obviously not having my son in the first place, but he is such an amazing person that I cannot imagine a world without him. I am also optimistic about future medical advancements. My own prognosis, aside from the arthritis, is pretty good. I should live a normal life as long as I stay on top of it. There is no reason he cannot do the same.\n\n3. His height is going to be the most obvious stand-out characteristic that he will struggle with. Some people view being tall as a good thing, but for me if that height is coupled with a potentially life-threatening disease, then it is not associated with any benefit. It is also like living with a giant beacon on your head. Everywhere you go, you are too small for your surroundings, and you stand out to everybody. It is easy to feel claustrophobic when you are hyper-aware of your size like that. Along with being tall, I was also skinny. My son is on that same trajectory. I was subject to a lot of ridicule for my height and weight by my peers as a child. I am a bit more optimistic in this regard, because just what I have seen of his classmates and friends so far is that they are much nicer than kids were 35 years ago. So I hope for his sake that he avoids that.\n\nSomething I would like to add is that I am concerned that my son is also displaying ADHD traits, which is yet another disorder that I also have. I was not diagnosed with ADHD until I was an adult, but it seriously clarified a lot of the issues I had when I was a child and struggled in school. Stimulant based medication actually greatly improved my coping skills, however I had to discontinue them after I was diagnosed with some abnormal heart rhythms and atrial fibrillation. I am worried that if my son does end up having ADHD (we are waiting another year or two to have him evaluated) that he will not be able to use medication that could benefit him and his school work could suffer like mine did. I am on the lighter side of the spectrum, but so much of what you said here resonates with me. Five years ago I went into atrial fibrillation. I have known since I was 16 that I probably had Marfan's. Because of insurance and pre-existing conditions, we never got the official diagnosis. We just kept an eye on my slightly enlarged aorta, which thankfully remained stable. But when I went into afib, I immediately got thrown into a panic attack, which made it way worse. Now, I have got the diagnosis, and I still keep an eye on things. But every little pain I feel in or around my chest threatens to fire off another panic attack... it is crazy. I was super depressed and had suicidal ideations as a teenager too. Now it is the opposite. I am still depressed but I am scared shitless of my own mortality and the prospect of an early death. Thank you so much for your response, it has helped very much! I hope you are able to start feeling a bit better on the self esteem side in the near future, I hope you have a good day! :) Sadly kids can be cruel, but hopefully things can be done and they will have a change of heart in the future! Thank you so much for sharing your experiences with me!! :) I am not a Marfans patient, but I have a very closely related disorder called Loeys-Dietz Syndrome. I would like to think my experience(s) and answers to your questions are applicable, but you can choose to use them or not! :)\n\nI was diagnosed 2 years ago in Summer of 2017 (at 27 years old) and had aortic root replacement surgery in November of 2017. \n\n1. I can no longer exercise the way I was accustomed to. Not being able to physically push myself to my limits is frustrating and at times disheartening, but I do my best to try and stay active.\n\n2. Initially after diagnosis, I went through a roller-coaster of emotions. I remember constantly thinking \"So this is why I am so tall...\" or \"Wow there is something wrong with me....\" Having lived 27 years thinking I was 100% normal/healthy, it was difficult to come to terms I have a genetic disorder that is potentially life-threatening if I do not have open heart surgery. Since surgery, I feel very lucky. My LDS went unnoticed for so long, it probably would not have been discovered until it was \"too late.\" Life is funny!\n\n3. I am not a father yet. Me and my longtime girlfriend plan to get married and have children. We already plan on going with in vitro fertilization. As lucky as I have been, I do not plan on potentially passing this down to my children.\n\nHope this provides some insight. Good luck on your project!", "Tal Golesworthy: How I repaired my own heart\n      - YouTube ", "A little reassurance Hey everyone, I am not quite sure what to type here so I guess I will just start from the beginning.\n\nI have always been tall and skinny. Compared to the rest of my family at least. Throughout highschool I was 5'10 and about 118lbs. I have bulked up a bit since then. I have never had a large appetite and never seem able to put on fat but these last few years I have been trying to eat more and get more exercise. I am still skinny but I have bulked up to 135 lbs or so.\n\nMy limbs have always been long and I have always had long fingers. I used to play basketball and that is what I was known for.\n\nWhich coincidentally is how I learned about marfans. During a routine physical, my doctor took notice of my long limbs and digits and did a cursory exploration for marfans. My hands were flexible enough to pass the criteria, I have pretty bad myopia and flat feet. However, eye problems and a skinny childhood is not unusual in my family and due to the fact I didnt have any dislocated lenses, my spine was straight and my skin was not stretchy, she decided I did not need further testing.\n\nHowever lately, I have become quite concerned about it. In many ways I match the profile and on top of that, I have fairly severe health anxiety. I am waiting for my primary care doctor to get back to me so I can make an appointment to get checked out. I am going to ask her to refer me for an echocardiogram so I can get some answers.\n\nBut the waiting is killing me. The idea of it is killing me. I have always tried to do everything right. I usually hike or walk 3 miles a day for thr exercise, I try to eat healthy, I stay away from excessively unhealthy food and drugs; its killing me to think I have tried to do everything right to take care of my body and I still might have a heart condition out of my control.\n\nI have taken some solace in the fact the majority of enlarged aortas occur before the age of 19 in marfan patients because (due to a period of health anxiety, I thought I was having a heart attack and got evaluated at the hospital)  I got a chest x ray when I was 19 it came back normal, aside from having \"long lungs.\" I do not even know if I should take comfort in that but it is all I got.\n\nI once had low blood pressure during a routine checkup but every measurement since has been fine.\n\nIt is just so overwhelming to think that a week ago, I was completely content with where my health was and now I could be a week away from learning I have a heart condition that will change my life forever. I might be a week from learning I need to wait for this pandemic to subside so I can have open heart surgery.\n\nI am a landscape photographer and travel writer, I might be a week away from learning my heart will not allow me to be in my current field of work anymore. I might be a week away from learning I should not pursue grad school for anthropology due to health reasons.\n\nI am not sure what I am hoping to accomplish with all of this rambling. Its just so overwhelming and I think I am just hoping the world isnt going to end hey man I just wanted to say I am at the same point.. in my thirties and puzzle starting get anxiety about it .. I think I am going to ask the doctor too... \n\nexactly same situation as you .\n\nand had stomach problems lately that after CT scan of abdomen was nutcracker. my lower aorta is fine size is good etc..\n\nbut I wonder about my upper one and as I type this k feel anxiety getting to my chest \n\nrambling is good sometimes . puzzle coming together I me t to day and I get anxiety too . \n\n\ntake care Hi there, from someone who has had marfans for most of my life I am unsure as to why you think you will need open heart surgery? Usually people only need it if their aorta has become quite enlarged ( between 5-7cm) so it will need to be replaced but before you get your echo scan I would not worry too much. If it shows that your blood pressure needs to be controlled you will most likely be prescribed atenolol which helps this. I understand that waiting is worrying, I am also waiting for my yearly echo scan, since mine was cancelled due to covid. I am sure it will be okay, and you cannot do too much about it until your scan results come back. My life with Marfans has not changed too much, I cannot have too much strain on my heart so no rugby or heavy lifting. Let me know what happens! Stay safe :) I am 38 and have known since I was a kid, I was always the tallest (6'0\" female) and had obvious Mitral Valve Prolapse that my doctors noticed as a kid. I have been followed by great cardiologists my whole life. I get an echo and ECG each year, and every 3 years an MRI to get an even better picture of my aorta. I live a great life, I am a teacher (which is not an easy job), I have an awesome partner, we travel, when there is not a pandemic happening. All of this is to say, you can continue leading your awesome life. Yes, you may need surgery one day (I actually just had surgery to repair my mitral valve), but as long as you are followed closely by good doctors, you should be able to keep doing what you are doing. I totally understand the anxiety, I have it too, but Marfan's has not stopped me from living the life I want to. I just have a good excuse not to do pushups or shovel snow. ; ) You should be able to continue in your career. Both of those are pretty fine, just so long as you are not doing scuba diving or parachuting.\nMarfan is not the death sentence that it used to be. Most of us now have a comparable life expectancy to the rest of the population, and can expect to have just as high of a quality of life. Based on your description of your life, it is doubtful that you will need to make many changes. \nThere are also several medications that are showing promise for shrinking aortic size. Its comforting to know there are a lot of us enduring the same thing. Thanks for the response, hope you are well Thanks for the response :) I am awaiting my echo scan and am quite nervous but its comforting knowing there are others in the same boat I will be happy to never shovel snow again haha thank up for the response :) its comforting to know that marfan isnt a sentence that will limit the life you can live. Thank you again Thank you for the response, that is quite reassuring. I am quite scared for my aorta but I am also scared of giving up everything that I have spent years caring about. Thank you for the reassurance No problem. My brother and my dad both ended up having to make really hard decisions after their open heart surgery in that regard, so I have thought about those restrictions quite a bit. \nI have always thought that part of having Marfan is making sure that you follow boundaries, learn to listen to your body, and take your medication and follow medical advice and hopefully that keeps you out from under the knife. I am sure that is not always the case for everyone but I have been lucky so far so I will keep doing it. That is reassuring to hear. I would have no problem taking my medicine daily and listening to the doctors orders. The idea of just a sudden realization I need heart surgery is one of the scariest things about all of this. I am glad to hear you have kept away from the knife so far and I hope your dad and brother are well", "Got a date for my scoliosis surgery Read this for some backstory:\n\n ( \n\nI will get the surgery on the third of March. \n\nI talked to a girl from my school who had had the surgery, which was quite nice. I had some minor questions so it was nice to be able to talk to someone about the surgery in my native language.\n\nI do not really feel nervous, the last couple of surgeries I only got the nerves a couple of hours before it actually occured. That said, I do not look forward to it.\n\nIt is really nice to know that besides my friends and family there is an entire community to back me up and help me through this stuff mentally. My parents and, of course, myself, It is natural to feel nervous and even scared so let yourself feel those things, it is all good. You got this. We are rooting for you! Keep us posted on how it goes! Had this surgery when i was 12 years old 6 years ago. My scoliosis was bad and it was going to get worse so i had to do it when i was 12. I was nervous at first but as the day of the surgery was coming closer i was getting less nervous . It hurt for the first 3 weeks but later the pain settled down . For the first month i was taking oxycodones and aspirin to deal with the pain and when i took them i felt no pain. But when the drug run off i had to take another one immediately but for me this was only for 3 weeks\nStay strong. Hey good luck! I had my surgery over 30 years ago when I was 12. I have had no major problems as an adult. The science has advanced so much since then and what I had done is pretty archaic in comparison!\n\nGive yourself time to heal and take it easy! Had mine in 2015, it is a lot to take in and nervousness is okay. Just kno after u will surely be soo relieved!! Hoping recovery goes smooth, best thing I did for mine was get a thin foam sheet pillow (kind of hard to explain but foamy pillows/cushions will deffo help). I am sure u have been told to get a body pillow as well, for me that made resting a million times better and im sure others may say the same. You got this lovely! Xx This is my experience at the same age. I took Oxy and percocet to quell the pain for a month. OP: DO NOT BE AFRAID TO ASK FOR MORE PAIN MEDICINE.I felt extremely anxious asking for more, but my doctor said it was totally fine. You will not want to be off them for the first month. Yeah I tend to not ask for pain relief medicine but I will be sure to get it this time.", "Do you have kyphosis? And if you do does your spine stick out? No just 2 different scoliosis curves. Lumbar curve also has a bit of hyperlordosis due to how absolutely trashed everything is down there. I am actually going to the chiropractor in 2 days to ask him if I have it because I think I might have it. I will edit this comment in 2 days to tell you if I have it. One thing to keep in mind is that most people have it, and it is not necessarily related to Marfan's, but it is more due to our bad posture when working on computers. I am making mine worse by typing this sitting in a chair with my neck stretched out. Yep, I do. My spine does not stick out but the right side of my ribcage (under my shoulderblade) sticks out - so I have a humpback. Its one thing I personally struggle with as far as my appearance since before I can remember - but I cannot do anything about it, so... /shrug A chiropractor cannot diagnosis it. You would also need an x-ray. This is not true, it is usually self-diagnosable but I just want confirmation from my chiropractor. A quick google of \u201ckyphosis diagnosis\u201d will say otherwise but ok lol Actually... we are both right. If you just type \u201ckyphosis\u201d into google it says it the overview that it is usually self diagnosable. But on ( says that you need an x-ray. What site is the overview coming from? When I search \u201ckyphosis\u201d I get an overview from the site I will link at the bottom (because I do not know how to do what you did). The overview I get does not say self diagnosable.\n\n Every chiropractor I have gone to has run a number of films to see what is wrong with my spine. I have learned more about my spine from going to the chiropractor than an orthopedic doctor ever told me honestly. Anyone can give an opinion. A chiropractor can probably give a fairly well educated opinion, but that does not mean a chiropractor can give a diagnosis.", "Possible I have Marfans but do not have the funds Hello, sorry that this is going to be another one of those posts. I have really bad anxiety and am sort of a hypochondriac. \nI am 25 years old (female) and have been very tall my entire life. I am 5\u201910, around 136 pounds. I am thin but not extremely thin, in my opinion. I was always chubby as a child and teen till I changed my crazy eating habits and thinned out around 17/18 years old. I just am a tall and lanky girl. \nThere is not anyone in my family that is really tall, mom 5\u20196 and my dad 5\u201911. Nor is there a history of Marfans. \nI can do the wrist sign, but my the fist/thumbsign do not overlap unless I really force it, which hurts. I have long, thin fingers and a small wrist. \n\nI am very nearsighted and have been my whole life. I go to the eye doctor yearly and recently saw an ophthalmologist. Both have  never said anything was wrong with my eyes other than my poor eyesight and astigmatism. They just said I have an increased chance for retinal detachment because of high myopia. Do I have to mention to them to look for the lens problem? or would they just tell by doing eye exams? \n\nI have no heart problems I know of and have always had normal blood pressure, slightly on the lower side. I dont believe I have ever experienced heart palpitations. I mean, my heart beats really fast when I do cardio...but I feel like that is normal! \nNormal lungs, as far as I know. \nI think I had a slight scoliosis as a child, but nothing ever came up with it. I have been pretty healthy my entire life, aside from being a little overweight as a child and teen. \n\nMy bottom teeth are a little crowded, but I never got my wisdom teeth out which I remember my dentist saying I should have done years ago they prevent this. It does not bother me. I do not know if i have a high palate or not. My top teeth have always been straight. \n\nHowever, because of my long fingers/limbs, small wrists, and nearsightedness this is always in the back of my mind. \nI think my body looks proportional, but I never measured my wingspan or anything.  \nI cannot afford to get a echo right now. I have shitty health insurance. Do you think I am just overthinking? I suffer from bad anxiety so I do not know if I am making a big deal out of nothing.  Where do you live? The echo is a relatively cheap test. Unfortunately you cannot detect an aneurysm by anything else other than some form of imaging, of which echo is the cheapest. Illinois. I thought they were at least a grand?  I live in Singapore. Over here it is around 200 - 300$. While the MRI is 1000+. You could probably call the clinics and check, not sure how it varies in the US I am in Ohio/WV. I just had an echo done and it was $900 with my insurance but, the hospital I went to allowed me to set up a payment plan. I only have to give them $5 a month. You can always call you insurance company to find out the cost. I hope this helps. I would reduce the matter to family history.\n\nHow are your parents?\n\nDo they have cardiac problems?\n\nIf they are ok then it is hycondrism.\n\nIf they show minimum symptoms like in my family then it is also  a no problem.\n No they have no problems so far and they are 49 and 52. However, my grandfather died of a stroke. That is about all i know of. He lived a really unhealthy lifestyle, though.  Thank you. I just do not know if I should get it done because I need to pay for my education and I think I am just overreacting. It would be a big struggle to have a high medical bill on my shoulders. My insurance has a 2,500 deductible.  You would likely be better off treating the hypochondria than going for marfan based off of nearsightedness and crowded teeth.  Crowded teeth, myopia and long fingers alone are not enough to diagnose you with Marfans. Yes, you could have it. Odds are you do not. But I am just a random person on the internet and am in no position to advise you one way or the other.  \n\nHowever, if you are truly that worried then you need to find the money for an echo.  It is the cheapest test to check for an aneurysm.\n\n That said, I really think that counseling would help to alleviate some of your anxiety.  \n\n\n\n no medical background here either. \n\nyou claim to have been little overweight, you are not extremely tall your crowded teeth come apparently from the wisdom tooth. you say you are hypochondriac  I see the chances small especially since it would come down to mutation like I am (not from family lines) that is quite rare, you are 25 and never had any complications that mean it would be quite the mild form of marfans anyway.\n\nDo go see a doctor to get reassurance and do not self diagnose/google because it doesnt help. get tested to see if anything is up, i recommend the gen FBN1 (fibrillin-1 ) as that is where the mutation manifests, it is most likely cheaper than a echo (im Dutch I do not pay for healthcare) but please do not stress out.. it doesnt help. yes doing cardio increases the heart rate, its normal \n Then i wouldnt worry and treat the hipocondrism. There is no family history of heart problems and yet my son has Marfans. We are pretty sure he is a spontaneous mutation as neither my husband nor I show any signs. Get a heart echo to ease your mind. If it shows a problem you can pursue it further. His cardiologist visits cost around $1500 twice a year but it is at the local children's hospital that writes off a lot of people's bills for their inability to pay so their prices are a bit higher but they have a Marfan clinic so we pay the price gladly.  Depends on who is doing the test. Son's cardiologist visits run around $1500 but the genetic testing cost around $3000. I know there are different labs that do the test but those are the prices we had to pay in America.  Oh damn.. sorry to hear. \n\nLike i said I am clueless on prices because of the healthcare system:/ sorry", "What is your experience with myopia? (Not being able to see things that are far away) Hello again everyone. The thing is that I (M22) have been noticing that my myopia is getting worse and worse. I was told by the optometrist that it should become stable when I turn 25 but I do not know if that is a standard rule that includes marfan patients. What is your story with myopia? Did it ever stabilize? And if it did, when was that. Thanks I had to get a new pair of prescription glasses every year from age 9 to 24-ish.  \nThe last time I got a new pair was at 27 and my vision only got marginally worse from the last pair, so the expectation for it to stabilize around 25 does not sound too far-fetched. How old are u now? I have just turned 25, mine so far have worsened ever  year\n\nHow've the degree to which they are worsening had slowed the last 2 years, and my mums vision stabilised at 25 (and the same prescription as me) untill she was about 40 Your mom got worse when she turned 45? Or she just became also farsighted? Thanks for the reply btw My mums eyesight in general started getting worse around age 40\n\nI think she is very slightly more myopic than before (tiny amount) but her main issues have been with vitreous detatatchnent, partial retinal detachment, floaters etc. Oh I see. I hope u do not suffer from any detatchments. Good luck. Thank you,\n\nPosterior vitreous detachments are very common, even in the general population, though there it usually happens after the age of 60, after 80 its almost a certainty. \n\nThey \"only\" majorly impact your eyesight for about 6 months. With marfans most people will have a PVD at some point.  After that you have an increase in floaters etc but you can learn to ignore/tune them out As a fellow myopic may I ask how much myopia you and your mum have? I am not 100% sure how its measured, but i have -5 in both eyes, i think my mum is at about -5.5 at this point, but i do not really know her exact prescription. \n\ni also had strabismus surgery a couple of years ago to correct some double vision which honestly caused me more visual issues than the short sightedness I am 24f and have had multiple vitreous detachments. I did not know they were a thing until my first one. Quite scary for a while bc you will have a spot in your vision but the slowly disappear over a few months. i (F19) have been using glasses because of myopia and a astigmatism since I was 9 and it started stabilising about a year or two ago; it still changes a tiny bit every year but it is not as drastic as it used to be, maybe because you are a guy it will take a little longer(?)", "What led to your diagnosis? Currently waiting on my genetic testing.... This is my first Reddit post ever! So, here goes.  I am curious about what led everyone here to be diagnosed with Marfan\u2019s.  My father died at 51 of a suspected thoracic aortic aneurysm (it was not confirmed because stepmother #3 refused to have an autopsy done). He also had a lot of the physical characteristics. I know we are not supposed to ask for medical advice or if other posters think we should be tested.  I am already waiting for my test results, I am just curious about what led you to be diagnosed. When I was a toddler I had a cold so my mother took me to the pediatrician. We did not have an appointment so we just saw who was available. The pediatrician who saw me noticed it right away. So I got really lucky. Wow, that is lucky! My optometrist! They noticed my poor vision and lanky features. Sent my GP a letter and the rest is history! Very thankful for that pick up by him. Must have been a good optometrist.\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb Waiting on my test too! Anyone know how long they usually take? \n\nUm, year of back and neck pain, went around the world going to doctors and specialists. Went back to my GP with some back to back pneumonia, complained about my back and all the doctors for a year, muscle spasms in my chest started happening while I was there, and she was like murmers not spasms. Put it all together and screamed marfans. My grandfather died at 39 due to un diagnosed heart problems, was complaining about back, neck and chest pain the week prior. Dad had a disection around age 50 and was diagnosed. They immediately jumped to checking me. Did not do genetic testing until many years later, there were enough characteristics and family history to have a clinical diagnosis. I am hoping it will not take too long.  It has to go all the way across the country(USA),  so it will probably be awhile.  My father, his father and grandfather all seem to have had some sort of aortic/valve involvement.   I had an ECG/EKG today which was normal, Dr said no murmurs. About ten years ago I had an echocardiogram  and a CAT scan which were both normal (do not know if that is even relevant since it is been so long) I have been having chest and back pain off and on for a year.  I go back and forth between wanting to find the reason and being terrified of finding out.  One of my joys in life is riding horses and I know that would be out with Marfan\u2019s. I know it is nothing compared to being alive, but still makes me sad. I hope your test comes back soon! Same, I am on the east coast so hopefully I am on the side of the country it is going too. For the last 6 years my daily routine was 8hrs in the steel mill, 4hrs clear cutting trees, 2hrs in the gym. The last year hit me like a freight train at 30yrs old and it is all I can do to get my two jobs done. I could not image riding a horse rn, I cannot step off a curb with out my neck feeling like a slinky. Dad had a dissection at 27, his pediatrician had diagnosed him but not told his parents. My brother and I were raised as if we had Marfan's, and had the classic body type from the start. Me and my brother diagnosed formally at 11 with echo, genetic testing done for me and my two sons which confirmed. \n\nThe cool thing about the genetic testing was that by locking down the specific mutation it helped with medication choices. I am so sorry about your Dad, it is terrible that the Dr never told his parents! Genetics have come a long way, in both fascinating and terrifying ways. I hope your test comes back with some conclusive information so you can get some help feeling better soon! Well he got better and is in his mid sixties now. He is had a couple issues since, but was able to get the valve repaired. He is actually finishing a really successful career that he probably would not have gone into if he had not had to sell his dairy so suddenly from the dissection. \nIt is one of those things that is really traumatic, but things ended up working for the better. Same. Right now I am on Prednisone, Duesx, Lyrica and NAC as a supplement to help with the pain and mobility issues. \n\n\nAfter a year of having doctors do nothing but throw pills at it, I have come to one conclusion. If it is not a narcotic, theres a 90% chance it is useless, bunk, bs, that is just going to hit you with more side effects on top of it. I kept fucking up my shoulder playing baseball as a teenager. One orthopedist was like \u201cI want you to get your heart checked out. You ever hear of Marfan\u2019s?\u201d Got diagnosed at 16 or so, 32 now. I have all the physical traits, lattice petting in my left eye, kyphosis, lordosis, arachnoid cyst and tested negative on genetic testing (it took 2 months for the results to come back). Will still get tested every year for heart and eye problems so even with a negative genetic result, you will not be 100% sure you do not have it. Just be careful, good luck when i was seven, my eyesight was awful. Like, i could not even write, and everytime I went outside I bumped into things that were right in front of my face. My mom took me to the doc, and my lenses were apparently super messed up. I was basically looking sideways everytime I tried to look straight... and since that is not exactly a Common problem, that lead to my diagnosis.", "Vaping I dont have marfans but i do have an elarged aorta growing .5 cm a year. Just wondering if anybody knows if vaping and smoking weed are a bad idea for me.  Appreciate all answers Oh sorry i didnt make it clear. I have a mutation in a gene that affects connective tissue but docs dont know what it causes yet. Its a \u201cvariant of unknown significance\u201d but recently found out ive dilated a centimeter in the last 2 years. From about 2 cm to a little over 3 now. I am  kt sure about vaping but weed is definately harmful to the aorta. It softens the muscles in it.  That Is interesting. Ive seen a few articles on people with marfans using medical marijuana but yaknow for better reasons then i do. Is it just the smoking that you are saying is harmful or the actual thc itself I did not know that!  Not relevant for me personally but I would like to learn more, do you have a source I could read?  I do not mind an academic paper. Source? I have not gotten checked if I have it but I am 100% sure I do I am 31 years old.\n\nI have been vaping, smoking, dabbing medical marijuana for about 8-9 years now.\n\nI have been good so-far but I really should check in with a doctor or a cardiologist eventually. :/ ( ( You should have annual checks on your aorta to measure the size. An echo, CT, or MRI. You can go from normal-ish aorta to a near dissection in less than a year. That is what happened to me! Smoking anything is a bad idea given the lung problems associated with Marfan. On the Marfan Facebook page people talk about taking CBD for pain and for many it really helps vs. heavy pain medications. The consensus on there is that vaping or eating is probably safer. Again i dont have marfans, just the same heart problem and am tall and lanky. The question is mostly is smoking or vaping bad for an enlarged aorta Yeah that is what I hear. \n\nI will definitely go do that when hopefully I will have money saved up for it. :/ Super interesting, thanks! No insurance? Are there any programs that can help? Maybe, if I was proactive enough to search for it. But I am not lol :/ Been vaping weed for a year to help with the pain and all my doctors know about it, including the cardiologists. They never said anything about it being an issue. Got Marfan and an aortic root aneurysm. They did say that smoking would be bad, just as smoking pretty much anything can be bad for you. That study does not mention much about the aorta and most of the cited studies in the paper do not mention method of consumption (which I suppose is by smoking). \n\nUsing weed *all-day-everyday* is not going to be good for you, just as taking multiple cups of coffees or drinking too much, but in moderation I seriously doubt it would have much of a negative impact on aortic dilatation. Even the increase in HR that often happens with cannabis use is mostly limited to first time users, as when you get a bit more tolerance it tends to lead to a decrease in HR, a finding you can read about in that paper.\n\nI have got an academic access to read most scientific papers and there is close to no data regarding cannabis use and aortic dilatation. Studies relating to more generic cardiovascular health are mostly done with smokers instead of vaporizing, and the negative stuff that can be found on vaporizing seems to mostly be related to oils instead of dry-herbs. What gene? I have a VUS of TGFBR1 and have been diagnosed with EDS for 12 years...it came up during testing for something else lol. Do you have a cannabis-positive cardiologist/vascular surgeon? FBR2 Unfortunately sometimes there is not really.\n\nI had not been to a doctor in many years until recently because I made more than the few hundred a month you can still qualify for Medicaid here but not enough to afford insurance. (Been to a couple of nurse practitioners or discount/free clinics when available and I could afford it, but nothing useful ever came out of it).\n\nNot capable of working a regular job to make a more stable income but not feeling like stopping paying bills and feeding my family is responsible either so been stuck in-between with unresolved chronic health problems.\n\nBusiness I was trying to start finally collapsed so far I qualify for Medicaid (silver lining, right?)... First echo ever tomorrow. I have enough of the stuff I am pretty sure I would have been diagnosed by the pre-2010 criteria without further testing if I had had a competent doctor back then... Here is hoping I can get some answers finally at age 31...", "Body image Unlike most marfans Im not supper skinny and tall. Im 1,70cm (5\u20197) (im a girl) but i have thick tights.

Also, my knees kind of \u201cgo inside\u201d (i dont know how to explain it) my legs are not straight, my tights look like a V because of my knees. That is something fhat makes me really insecure. But i dont really know how to deal with this. I came to reddit because no one knows about my condition other then my parents and i need to talk about this with someone.\nThank you for reading. The term you are looking for is knock knees. If it is caused by marfans than you might need surgery to correct it. \n\nHowever  most cases of knock knees come from muscle imbalances and tightness. So I would try some leg exercises and stretching to see if it helps.\n\nYou can also get your sternum fixed with surgery. My dad and cousin had it done and said it hurt like a bitch.\n\nI (26 female) also have a wonky sternum, but my boobs hide it. If you are still growing you might have a chance for them to grow in some more and kind of distract from your sternum.

I also have a thin upper body and this month I will start doing some upper back, shoulder and chest exercise (all of them with low intensity and high reps so it does not stress my aorta) to see if it helps, if I get a result in some months from now I will tell you lol.\n\nDo not worry about your pectus, people do not tend to notice it or if they do, it does not affect your appearence as you think. As we have some different traces than most people we tend to overreact it, I am sure you are prettier than you see. If it is a big deal to you, you can always search for an surgery correction and that is ok too. 15 nah, dont worry about it . When ia was 15 i was EXTREMELY self aware of my looks , you are probably worrying too much, and you are at highscholl wich is a horrible environment for anyone that is different , there is nothing wrong with your body ,(having big thighs in a slim body can be very attractive lol ) , having your legs not perfectly straight is pretty normal , as long you dont have knee problems you are absolutely fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nyou are just in a very insecure  age , and in a very judgemental environment, but when you get older you will get more confident and people around you will be too busy to care about your looks .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nif you really dont like your body you can always go to the gym , i only got benefits from it and i highly recommend , but i went to the gym because i was very thin and very tall   , but you do you, im sure you look fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nyou should talk to a therapist or a friend at least, its going to make you feel better , sometimes we freak out about meaningless things and we need some one to tell us to chill .

Happens to me if I am stressed or eat a lot of salt.\n\n\nEat a banana and meditate.  If it does not go away in another few days you might consider going to your cardiologist.", "Confused about the wrist sign example from a medical article I always thought the wrist sign means the fingers are overlapping and that it should not happen in the majority of healthy individuals. The original article from Walker and Murdoch describes the overlap of typically 1-2 cm.\n\nNow I have found a medial article with the following figure:\n\n(\n\nThe picture on the right is a \"normal\" person. To me it seems quite indicate of the wrist sign.\n\nWhy I care: I do have the wrist sign, scoliosis, hypermobile fingers (Beighton 4/9) and skin striae. My systemic score would be 3/7, my echocardiogram was normal (I am 34) and I have no problem with my eyes. So I am trying to figure out how is the wrist sign actually reliable, as my wife can also demonstrate a slight overlap. Theres another way of going about it, the one illustrated in the photo u provided is one \"approach\" but it is better to do the finger one where u lay your thumb horizontally and with marfans the thumb usually goes past the pinky by quite a bit (Dr told me this ages ago and for reassurance I tested it on all my family lool -none of which have marfans) I will provide a photo if that confusing in anyway just lmk:) Could you pls provide the photo? or just a \"diagram\"? I do not get it from your description, my English sucks :(\n\nI have it positive anyway, but from what I know, wrist or thumb signs alone are not important, their combination is. man this test is just bullshit, i have exactly your symptom and do not have marfan Yes, I think it is positive in much greater portion of population than the authors assumed. I can overlap by almost 1-1.5 cm. However, I might have JHS which includes mild variant of marfanoid habitus. JHS is quite common and harmless. Yes I probably have JHS too, I have flat feet, mild scoliosis, high arch palate, positive wrist sign\nI did an echocardiography and it was totally normal\n\nI do not have marfan habitus since my arm  span is equal to my height Sounds like me! Mild scoliosis, flat feet (a bit, not severe), positive wrist sign and a completely normal echocardiograph. And of course hypermobile fingers.\n\nBeware, Marfanoid habitus does not mean you need all the signs (i.e. if you have the other signs, you do not need arm-span / height &gt; 1.03). A word of caution here, there is a lot of incorrect information on non-professional website. Adult men has typically armspan greater than their height by 2-4 cm, and that is completely normal. I posted the medical papers in another thread here. It is only a problem if the ratio is greater than 1.03, or 1.05 for MFS specifically.\n\nHowever, for marfanoid habitus, these signs are looked for (citing):\n-Arachnodactyly (wrist and thumb signs)\n-Foot length (heel to 1st toe) : Height ratio &gt; 0.15\n-Hand length (wrist crease to 3rd finger) : Height ratio &gt; 0.11.\n-Arm span : Height ratio &gt; 1.03 (1.05 in Ghent Nosology for MFS\n-Tall stature with lower limb length (floor to pubis) : upper body (pubis to crown) ratio &gt; 0.89 (0.85 in Ghent Nosology for MFS)\n-Scoliosis &gt;20 degrees\n-High arched palate\n-Chest deformities\n\nMost JHS/EDS patients have an incomplete form of the marfanoid habitus.

Very hypermobile like my 3 sibling and they are perfectly healthy (they are all older than 30 years old)\nBut in general I am not very hypermobile, I cannot even touch the floor with my fingers \nHearth and eye are fine, I saw a cardiologist and get an echo, saw an ophthalmologist and do not have major eye problem like subluxation or cataract \n\nWe probably just have JHS like you said or some sort of connective tissue tisorder With JHS, your Beighton score should be 4 or more. You can simply try the tests yourself, you will find them everywhere ;) I can do thumb-to-forearm and pinky-backwards. My Brighton score is 2-3 but I did not do it with a medical professional\nIm a man also\nMy 2 sisters probably have a greater score than me, they are hypermobile all stature with lower limb length (floor to pubis) : upper body (pubis to crown) ratio &gt; 0.89.

I hate the way I look and I hate my personality. I do not think I will do well with any therapist. Plus, with pectus, I choose to wear many layers when going outside which still does not take away the anxiety or social awkwardness. \n\nMy family is caring, my future has the potential to succeed, I just do not have it in me anymore to try. So, I have turned to reddit to try and find some kind of reassurance. Get off social media, reddit and internet as a whole. Find some good books to read. I would recommend Man's Search for Meaning as a start followed by something lighter. \n\nLearn to meditate. Then do a lot of it. \n\nMost people experience depression without having any health issues. Realise that it is part of the human experience and it is not just you.\n\nAnd most importantly stop obsessing about your own happiness and focus on better understanding what drives the people around you. Man my teen years were rough. I was taller than all the other girls and maybe 90% of the guys. That is when I started getting stretch marks really bad and all of a sudden my feet grew and I was legally blind and went around refusing to wear my glasses because they were so thick..\n\nI had my aorta surgery when I was 19- not that much older than you now. I am not going to lie to you- Marfans is shitty. I am 38 now, I have had 3 major surgeries and 4 eye surgeries. It is scary because we all know it is only going to get worse with age. But you know what else ages? Your ability to cope and handle it. You get more life experiences and you realize that of all the hardships you have undergone- your heart surgery was in the least of them.  \n\nI am definitely not minimizing your current recovery- it for sure is miserable. It is ok to be miserable right now. It is ok to be depressed. What is not ok is giving up on yourself. \n\nAlso- Marfan\u2019s has been linked to clinical depression in many people- myself included. I have gone to therapy on and off- sometimes it helps, sometimes not. What 100% does help is medication. I get mine from my regular doctor. Something you might want to consider talking to your doctor about. \n\nTake it day by day for now. You got this. Just know you are not alone. I am 17 and a Marfan, I have not had the surgery done but I feel to some extent what you are going through. The layers of clothes, the self hate, the depression, the loneliness. It is 96 degrees out and people wonder why I am wearing a hoodie and pants. Hi. First and foremost, you need to get some help. Immediately. I would equate suicidal thoughts to the mental equivalent of having a heart attack or stroke. You are currently experiencing a life-threatening emergency, and you need medical care ASAP. Inform your family. Get to a doctor. The reason is, these thoughts you are having, are something that can be addressed and corrected. As surely as a heart attack or stroke can be addressed. If you catch it in time, you can get to a place where you are not having suicidal thoughts, and fix the root issue that is giving rise to them.\n\n (\n\nCall 1-800-273-8255 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRight now. Get off social media and call them. Your life depends on it. Future you will be eternally grateful that you did. Committing suicide at 17 is like leaving the party before you even get inside.

It is beyond unfair to yourself to throw that chance away without even trying.\n\nFeelings of self-hatred, anxiety, and depression, are all awful things to deal with, but they are all temporary things. They This is great advice. Things are not always easy and being a little different than everyone can make things tough. Your response gives hope for someone in their 20s too! I am depressed for no identifiable reason whatsoever and therapy has not worked for me. The medical system here does not really know about marfans much and it is a pain to find professionals who know about the syndrome. Never in a dream I could connect my marfans to it. It makes a lot of sense now Surgery recovery is HARD.  Depression comes with it often.  Being a teenager is also hard.  Give yourself time. It will get better. I am so sorry that you are feeling this way. Please make sure you tell your family that you are feeling this way, it will only help you. Remember that after undergoing surgery + general anaesthesia, the bodies response is to feel depressed every now and then. I am not saying that to try and magically make you feel better, but it is sometimes good to know why we feel the way we do. \n\nThe fact that you know you have potential in your future is a great thing! Keep that in your mind and every time you are feeling down, use that to help you change your state of mind! One thing that helps me is I try to be very concious of when I begin to feel depressed. I do not judge myself for feeling this way, I simply notice the feeling - then try to clear my head. Do not think about anything (it is OK if your mind wanders, just bring it back to thinking about nothing) and just concentrate on breathing. I got this meditation practice from the book \"the power of now\" :) \n\nEveryone will go through some sort of adversity in their lives, and this just happens to be yours. Do not quit - prove to yourself and everyone around you that you have the fortitude to overcome this depression! \n\nI am counting on you! \u2764\ufe0f", "Marfan diagnosis/other connective tissue disorders Hey there. I will try make this brief and not tire eyes, but will very happily clarify any points or answer any questions to help anyone kind enough to reply.\n\nI am a 27/M in the UK.\n\nWhen I was around 18, while on an unrelated health checkup, my creepy GP became distracted by my hand resting on the corner of the desk, and began talking about its proportions and stroking my fingers. Creepy as hell, very unpleasant guy, but I will spare you that story. After a while of quelling my gag reflex he had me stand up, suddenly excited and browsing through his little black book (that kind of GP - did not like computers, in 2006), measured my arm span, gave me a general checkup, quizzed my mother about family history and excitedly expelled that he thought I had Marfan Syndrome.\n\nThis was very interesting not just due to the health risks it might prepare me for with relatively early detection if it were true, but because I would had severe difficulties with school as I would grown older due to debilitating pains in my hands when gripping a pen - something I would long wondered about given my joint hypermobility (hand and fingers bend backward to create two right-angles, thumbs bend equally far in both directions).\n\nLong story short, I was assessed more professionally over a period of about a year, noting my extremely slim build compared to my arm span exceeding my height by three inches, my lack of weight gain, my very visible stretch marks on the sides of my hips and knees, my low spinal flexibility versus unusual digital/manual flexibility, my large and unusually flat feet, my high cheekbones and pronounced jaw, and the extreme (and mildly painful, at the time) clicking and crunching of most of my joints. Additionally, I experienced occasional but agonising and debilitating multi-hour cramps in my intercostal muscles and hips.\n\nThis added to the fact my maternal grandfather died of a massive heart-attack in his seventies - but his brothers and father all died before 50, suddenly, of same - however we lack medical data, as we are estranged from that family, and he was the youngest and last remaining male member of that unit when he died in the 90s. Additionally, he was extremely pigeon-chested, I am told - seen without a shirt he was reportedly quite scary looking, with a projecting breastbone. A very proper man, I never saw him without a shirt myself as a child.\n\nNeither of my parents exhibit hypermobility, though my mother exhibits extreme back-pain, shoulder pain, and nerve issues around her spine ever since her teens. My sister is also clear of any signs.\n\nI was told \"you have Marfans\" for a long time, until eventually being told \"You have the signs but you do not have Marfans\", then the final test with the geneticist led her to flatly state I did not, and would provide no further information or suggestions.\n\nSo it has been around ten years without any NHS provider being willing to look into this any further, and my extreme mobility in some areas and very low flexibility in others remains, while severe pain in my neck, back and shoulders has radically worsened, leading to reliance upon a private chiropractor and an NHS physiotherapist to try to reduce pain and regain or at least retain mobility. I have also had it confirmed that my poor vision is due to an uncorrectable tremor in my eyes - not something anyone but my mother noticed when I was a young child, and denied at the time by opticians, but randomly mentioned to me in my early twenties.\n\nProblem is, I can see triple, particularly in low light - distant points of contrast resolve into an at-times rotating triangle of blurred circles, and this is true even with one or the other eye closed, leading me to wonder what the hell has worked itself loose in there.\n\nI have studied MASS Phenotype, Ehlers Danloss and the rest of the spectrum of connective tissue disorders to the best of my ability (I have recently, finally been diagnosied ADHD as an adult, if you will forgive that this ability can be limited) and remain fairly convincingly 'marfanoid', but not actually subject to that condition. In the absence of any further support, I am at a loss for where to go next - I do not 'need' to know this, and am keeping an eye on my cardiac health as best I can regardless (as I also take medication for ADHD that stresses the heart, by necessity), but I would love to know two things from those who suffer this specific condition, if anyone is able to offer answers;\n\n1) What other conditions should I look into in your opinion, if I am able to get into a dialogue on the subject with the health system again?\n\n2) How does genetic determination of Marfans syndrome work, and did the genetic testing merely tick one scoring criteria, or did it individually and certainly disprove the notion that I have Marfans?\n\nMuch appreciated, thank you =) ", "Will i ever be able to put on muscle?

But it requires a fuck ton of work, dedication, safety precautions, and lifestyle changes to transform as a marf. First of all - you need to go get an echo to see the condition of your aorta before you begin any routine. Second, you need to ask your cardiologist what they recommend you do and how much you can lift. Beyond that it is up to you and how much thought you put into your safety precautions.  Bodyweight fitness, contrary to what some people say in the communities, is not safe and is not worth the little juice that the squeeze will require because BWF takes longer to produce results, goes way past the max amount of weight that even the most conservative cardiologists recommend, and the results are subpar to lifting anyways and with the challenges that we face down to our tissue that impact our gains just does not justify the worth of BWF for us - so do not start with that. The best thing for us mass wise, yes, the best, is to lift. I might get a bunch of shit on here for this but it is true. Other methods than lifting or BWF just do not cut it. After the initial health precautions are taken you need to find and start an upper body / lower body routine with LIGHT weights but HIGH reps to failure / near it on your last set of each exercise. Now, when it comes to safety during lifting, we need to breathe out when pulling / pushing / lifting the weight, and breathe in while releasing the weight. You also need to breathe in and out heavy during rest times. Also, lift SLOWLY. It is not a rush if you wake up early. These precautions, alongside light weights, will ensure minimal if any aortic growth from the blood pressure spikes. When one lifts high reps but light weights they are accumulating volume which equates to reps with a heavier weight. But this will be time consuming. You should wake up early on your training days to begin and finish the routine so that it does not take up too much of your time. So, prioritize health during lifting and outside of it (regular echo checkups) and you should be fine. Yes you can gain muscles, I have gotten fitter in my one week of all of what I just said than I have ever been. People complimented me. But again, lift smart and be dedicated. Also: you need to eat, a LOT as someone with MFS. Google your TDEE and add 500 cals and then 1G protein per body pound to eat enough each day to gain. You also need to sleep for 7-8 hours a day or you will not gain. Do not fret! It is all worth it considering how we look by default. The most liberal cardiologists and the NMF recommend light weights as well. The liberal cardiologists say up to 30lbs but the most conservative cardiologists says up until half of your body weight which may or not be something you are capable of or comfy with because MFS is a spectrum disorder. So for 100% safety, go light and high.", "Harvard researchers need your help. (And we need theirs!). Take this survey.

Thank you.", "Preventing aortic dissection (3 months before aortic root surgery) I am 17 and have been diagnosed with Marfan Syndrome at a very young age. I have been on 25 mg Atenolol and 50 mg Losartan for most of my life, and plan to have an aortic root surgery this June. My aortic root is about to reach or has already reached 5 cm in diameter. I have not had an aortic dissection yet and would really like to not have one before the surgery. I understand that keeping blood pressure low keeps stress off the aorta. As such, would it be a good idea to play horror video games (Outlast 2, etc.) or masturbate (I am a male) between now and the surgery? If so, is there a healthy frequency threshold I should stay under? I am around 6'9\" and 190 lbs. You provided your experience without clarifying the type of dissection you had. An aneurysm of 5cm is severe. Yes, OP can still live his life, but it is not fair to suggest that if his aneurysm dissects that he will be fine.\n You are really grasping at straws here.  I did not suggest that if it dissects he would be fine.   That really depends on family history and the rate of growth. I have seen plenty of people have surgery between 4-5cm.  Hence the \"generally\", obviously there is going to be outliers. I was told that it was good to stay moderately active (swimming, walking, moderate bicycling), but to avoid heavy lifting and sudden exertion. It is also a good idea to stay away from sodium where you can, as well as caffeine/energy drinks as well as nicotine. Masturbation can be okay, as long as you do not go too wild with it. (I was a teenager once myself). Doing it after a period of laying down can be more of a strain as it forces your heart to race to get \"up to speed\" from a resting state. ", "Does my hand look normal?  I kind of have health anxiety and I just wanted to make sure this is not bad.", "Diagnosed with Marfans is my life over ? So I had tests a few years ago looking into why I had so many pneumothorax\u2019s they thought I had Marfans but after a month of testing and me moving home I never heard anything back. \n\nFast forward to this year and I have been hospitalised due to a suspected bleed on the brain which they said was \u201clinked to my marfans\u201d turns out they actually diagnosed me but never followed me up. \n\nWhen they originally spoke to me about Marfans they said to me the life expectancy is 34 I am now 30 .. \n\nI am not expecting anyone to read or even reply to this post but I needed somewhere to share my thoughts,  My dad is 57, my uncle is 72, my grandma lived into her 80s. They all had Marfan's. I am 31 and have no expectation of dying in the next decade. \n\nMarfan's is something you have to accept and adapt to. It is not a death sentence. Ok, Firstly thank you for your response. Secondly you speak of adaptions? What are these? I do not mean to seem rude or come across negative it is just me going on what I have learnt so far.  With CRISPR and gene-based therapies, and stem cells, I think those number are probably a bit old.  I am thinking you *should* learn how to best 'manage your condition', and maybe try to keep up on the latest research, therapies, etc.    I do not know how long ago they told you that you would only live to your 30's, but the current average life expectancy for people with Marfan is the same as the general population, with monitoring and treatment. It is not a death sentence!\n\n\nIt does worry me that they diagnosed you but never followed up with you - when is the last time you had an Echocardiagram done (a sonogram of your heart)? That is what can be the sneaky danger, if you have an Aortic enlargement. I have had an enlarged Aortic Root my whole life, and get it scanned at least once, if not twice a year. This year, I just found out, it has started to grow more and is getting to a dangerous size. In response, we have time to talk about surgical intervention - BEFORE I have a deadly Dissection. I meet with a surgeon in a couple weeks, but if the scans are accurate, I am probably  having surgery in the winter this year to fix/replace the Aortic Root and Valve. I have also been on maintenance medication for my blood pressure and other symptoms for years.\n\n\nI do not know anything about brain bleeds being associated with Marfan Syndrome, but it does not mean that it is not somehow connected to it,  or that it should not be dealt with. \n\n\nIn closing - with all the treatment and surgery options available now, there is no reason to think you are doomed to less than four years left of life at age 30. Try not to fear that! I know it can be an overwhelming thought to think about your own mortality, especially when you have been told you are not likely to make it very long. Truthfully, none of us know when we are going to go - I could just as easily get killed by a falling brick tomorrow - so I try not to dwell on it, and just take care of my body the best I can with the help of doctors and medications.\n The first is that you will need to monitor your condition. You will want an echo cardiogram at least annually. Beyond that you should find a doctor familiar with Marfan's to discuss your case with. Cardiologists tend to know more than a GP. There is a high probability that you will have to limit your physical activity (based on what you have said above), so if you were big into athletics that will need to stop. \n\nUltimately every individual's case is different. I have the eye problems, but (so fast) my heart is great shape. Find a knowledgeable doctor to discuss your future with. Ok, so I feel a little better now. I have been referred for those scans mentioned and I have also been referred to the genetics team at the hospital. I guess panicking does not help. \n\nI thank you all for your responses. \n\nI appreciate them all  I am 36 and in the best health I have ever been in. My Father has Marfans, too; he is 70 and lives aboard his sailboat. \n\nMarfans will not stop you from living a full, wonderful life. Just take care of yourself.  That is the difficult part, taking care of myself. But these replies have provided a different outlook  Get on heart meds, and get a scan of your aorta on an annual basis. The reason people died young with Marfan 20-40 years ago was due to their aorta. We now have better drugs and surgery to fix things. \n\nI am 44. \ud83d\udc4d Yes!!! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Anxiety because of marfans Hi all.\n\nAfter I got diagnosed with marfans last week, I have had anxiety and even suicide thoughts. My body is so tired of being afraid of what will happen in the future, and it makes me so depressed. I know training helps a lot for me in these cases, but with this syndrome I cannot even workout as I used to.. I dont know what to do with life anymore, when I have to give up so much just to be careful with my body. Has any1 else been in this situation? And how did you get out of it? Why do you say you cannot work out like you used to? I am used to train hard 4-5 days a week with heavy lifting and bicycling on the gym. Now, after I have read about this syndrome, I cannot do it because it can affect my heart in a bad way.. same here but if you have been training for a while i say youre good, i have done the same shit with football and i was fine. Yeah I mean.. i got diagnosed now that im 23 years old.\nIn my teens, I played a lot of football, ran a lot with high intensitivity and so on. I have trained heavy lifting since I was 19 years old. \n\nMaybe not everyone with this syndrome will get trouble with their heart? And maybe someonw has very mild form of marfan? If you are feeling anxious about this why not speak to your cardiologist about it, and perhaps consult with a physical therapist who is aware of Marfan's. \n\nKeep in mind that this syndrome affects us all different, some people have milder forms of it, and you may be one of them.\nI have played football (soccer), rock climbed, done capoeira, and have had plenty of impact in my life\u2014all this before I was diagnosed with Marfan's in my early 30s.\n\nNow, I take it a bit easier, but I still climb and I still train with weights and cardio. Sure, I will never have the muscles or the stamina that non-marfanoids have, but I am still working out. I will speak to my cardiologist when im meeting her/him.\nI see, I am hoping I just have a mild form of it. \n\nBut I have normal life expentancy as ppl wihout marfan, correct? No one can tell you what your life expectancy is. But, if you really want to know ( will help you figure it out.\n\nJokes aside, it looks like you have not even had surgery yet, if so, you will end up figuring out what kind of treatment or surgeries you will need as the symptoms develop. Hehe.\n\nThat is correct, I have not had any surgery yet.. I am just hoping my heart will not be affected. \n\nBut how did you get past the syndrome with you first got diagnosed? Hmm, I felt the same death sentence as you are feeling now. My life crumbled, and I honestly, did not care if I died during surgery. I also had a lot of depression issues from the past so that was all conspiring against me. \n\nI survived, and that meant I had to rebuild my life from scratch, and I have been doing that ever since. I am more conscious about my health habits and my life now because of this.\n\nHonestly, at this point I am more scared of meeting a guy and being judged by my scars than about an aneurysm I see, glad im not the only one that has felt it that way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will see an eye doctor and cardiologist twice a year, to keep my health secured. But how is your daily life now, compared to when you had not been diagnosed? Is there much change, or are you living fairly normal? Ah, yes. I was legally blind and I got LASIK two years ago, and so far, it is been great.\n\nMy life is pretty good right now. It is been a journey of mental and physical health recovery. The only obstacle I currently face is the US health care system, which ensures I get coverage when I can afford it. Ah that did not sound too good, since u were blind for a period. But I hear people with nearsightness is much more exposed for getting those eye problems.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat Is great to hear! I can understand that. I live in Norway, so I have good health care system at least. Legally bling in the US means that your myopia is so bad, mine was -6.50, that without glasses you cannot do much. Oh I see.. but both your eyes are good now? Yep, 20/20 or close to it. That is nice to hear! It gets better with time! Easier said I know...\n\nKintsugi is the Japanese art of putting broken pottery pieces back together with gold, built on the idea that in embracing flaws and imperfections, you create an even stronger, more unique, more beautiful piece of art.\n\nI spent 2 years post op thinking I was doomed to be forever alone cos who could ever love these scars. Women are supposed to have flawless skin and all that nonsense. Did not help my self esteem when my ex left me 3 months post op too. If they ever judge your scars, you have lost nothing cos these are weak men you do not need in your life. One day you will meet someone who sees past your scars and even kisses them and cos he sees that what did not kill you really did make you stronger. Just takes time to find him is all :) You are sweet. Thank you. Yeah, working on yourself is always the best thing. And I am not really worried about what potential partners may feel about my scars, I always see it as a barometer of how worthy they are. My best advice is to just not think about it, like yes be careful and cautious but think about who u were b4 u knew - ur still the same amazing person so do not get too down about this. I have known about mine since I was young (diagnosed at around a year old) and everyone is just treated me the same, I am sure things will remain the same for you too. Just maybe *(and this is my personal view)* do not share it with people beyond your immediate family. Cause human nature is prone to judgment and having any said condition known by others who are not very close to you (outside of spouses or bestfriend(s) and what not) may, depending on who, cause them to treat u different (which I think most would hate). \n\nAgain share what your comfortable with, we all have different views and boundaries but by letting your marfans become apart of the background noise ur anxiety will hopefully ease. I had terrible anxiety going into my 1st yr of uni surrounding my marfans but I overcame it once making friends, continuing my many hobbies and education - distracting myself with such a busy life deff helped in easing my anxiety. Just know things could always be worse so just smile and again remember the amazing person u are - having marfans could never change that! I have Marfans and I have no heart problems and neither does my mother who is in her 60s.  I played sports all my life until college and there I started doing Krav Maga and boxing before I realized I should not be.  You can absolutely work out, but just find things that put minimal strain on your heart and minimal stress on your joints. I have found the bike riding and light lifting are good options. You just have to be careful not to overexert yourself. That sounds good!\nYes, I need take som ligther weights when I am lifting, that is for sure.\n\nMay I ask how old you are? I am 22. I have known I had Marfans for maybe 7 years now and in all honesty it has not affected my life that much.  I have only noticed recently that I am more achey at the end of the day and more fatigued.  My brother is 25 and likely has Marfans also, but he also has no heart problems and works out regularly. Marfans looks different in different people, so you just have to figure out what your own limitations are.\n\nI agree with what other people are saying that it is best not to think about having Marfans too much. It does not change who you are as a person, it just means you have to be more deliberate with what you do with your body and be diligent about getting echocardiograms. This community has also been a huge help to me! I have never met anybody outside of my family with Marfans, so knowing other people are experiencing similar problems is really helpful. Switch from training to yoga, help your mind and your body. My anxiety about my future with Marfans started when I was 3, I got diagnosed super early and it affected all aspects of my life. \n\nI have a major fear of death because when I got diagnosed they told my mom my expected life expectancy was 40. Nowadays people with Marfan's live into their 70s pretty regularly. I am slowly getting used to the fact that I am not going to die young. Meditation and therapy have been absolutely life changing. My anxiety levels have decreased by 40-60 percent in the past 6 months.  \n\n\nComing from someone that has lived in fear of this condition for 20+ years, that fear is so unnecessary, it is something you cannot control and it will not go away unless you accept that. Start meditating and learn to accept the fear as what it is, it is an emotion. The more you feed it the bigger it gets. Do not feet it and it gets smaller. Your life will not change much you just have to be safer when it comes to physical activity and get check ups on your heart. You will be okay trust me. You can still live a completely normal (albeit modified) life with Marfan's. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI highly suggest going to therapy for at least a few months to ease you into this as it is almost like an introduced trauma to find out news like this, suicidal thoughts are highly concerning please seek some help and if you ever need to talk I am an expert in dealing with anxiety and depression and I have been dealing with Marfan's for 24 years feel free to DM me with questions! I will for sure try yoga and meditiation.. that seems fun AND relaxing for the mind. I appreciate your advice, and I will DM you! It all depends on the severity of your particular case. You will see that some of the people in here have very severe issues like aortic dissection and retinal detachments. While some of us just found out we have Marfan's because a doctor noticed our arms are kind of long, but nothing else is wrong with us. It is a spectrum. I think that no matter how severe, you should always make monitoring the condition a priority. As long as you know where you are at, you will know what you are capable of.\n\nAnd remember this: even the most severe cases have a normal prognosis these days *as long as you continue to monitor it* and stop any trouble before it starts. There was a lot of buzz in 2008 around Michael Phelps and Marfan's. It is claimed that he does not have it, but if you read the excerpt from his book talking about it, he never explicitly denies it either:\n\n&gt;My heart rate was accelerating and Bob suggested I see the doctor. Because I was very flexible and had long hands and feet, I had some early symptoms of Marfan syndrome, a disease that affects connective tissues and can be fatal if there is leakage to the vessels that lead to the heart. If you reach out your arms and form a T and your wingspan is longer than your height, you can be at risk. In my case, those measurements have always been very close. I did not know at the time why the doctor decided to look into this. My mom and Bob did not want me to freak out, so they told me it was simply a good idea for young athletes to have an EKG test in order to look at the heart.\n\n&gt;**Fortunately everything was, and still is, okay.** I have been tested once a year ever since at John's Hopkins under the direction of Dr. Peter Roe, and the tissues are strong, the aortic route is clear and my heart is in good shape - as long as my Baltimore Ravens are winning.\"\n\nEmphasis mine. That is the only thing he says that suggests he does not have it. But you know what? I did not get officially diagnosed until I was 38, however I was doing all of these same tests that he does from the age of 13 onward, getting the same good results. I was \"clinically\" diagnosed which means I meet enough of the diagnostic criteria to officially have it. However, like 25% of Marfan's patients out there, I did not get a positive result on my genetic test. What I am saying is that if I have it, he probably does too. Especially if he gets his aorta checked annually. I only do it bi-annually.\n\nMy long-winded point? You are going to be fine, because not knowing about it is the most dangerous part. You may even be able to continue some of your sports activities (with the advice of your doctor.) Even if you cannot, you will still live a mostly normal life. On that Micheal Phelps debate, my guess is that he is an FBN2 mutant, which is not technically Marfan\u2019s.\n\nI was evaluated for Marfan\u2019s and did not meet the clinical criteria.  I finally got a \u201cWhole Genome Sequencing\u201d last year and it shows that my mutation is on FBN2.  It explains my height and wingspan and other things.  Also explains my lack of heart and eye problems.\n\nMy ratio of wingspan to height is 1.05 \u2014 same as Phelps.", "I may have marfan's I am not fully diagnosed yet however my doctor suspects I do as I have been over 6 feet tall since I was 15 I also show alot of the other symptoms. What do I need to know about the syndrome and what lifestyle changes should I make if I have it?", "would a GP see me for an appointment to evaluate if i have Marfans in today's climate? I do not know how seriously they take the disease, given the COVID-19 outbreak, I hear it is increasingly hard to see your GP in person and something seriously has to be wrong with you for them to see you in person. I am not sure what to say over the phone to the reception desk to actually get an appointment in person. I have been aware of Marfans for about a year and a half, having many of the symptoms and want to finally get tested for it. I have been seen already, I live in America so I am not sure where you live but I got in and sent to a specialist plus evaluated pretty quickly. Well it is more like sort of unsure what to say, because of the virus it is quite hard to see a doctor in the UK unless it is serious, so i do not know if just calling up and saying something like ''I want to get checked for Marfans syndrome'' is actually going to get me an appointment. Since you have already been seen, do you know if you have the disease or not? Yeah sadly I got checked off for it and have dna testing soon. I have been monitored for about 3 years because they noticed heart aorta growth Unless your having serious symptoms like cardiovascular (shortness of breath, palpitations, chest pain) I would say wait it out. NHS is so swamped and honestly u dont want to risk catching covid. It is hard to be patient with suspicions that u might have marfans but in the long run better safe than sorry with this covid situation. My bestfriends brother is an NHS Dr in London and he says unless someone is in grave condition just chill for a few more months when it comes to non urgent concerns.  \n\nIf your gp can book u in for idk October (for example)  then call them with all your evidence that u suspect marfans and they will surely set u up with a specialist in a few months. I am in the UK too. Pre-Covid, the process I went through to confirm my Marfan diagnosis was to share details of a family member\u2019s diagnosis so that they could then refer me to a genetic clinic.\n\nYou do not need to see the GP for the diagnosis - but you do need the referral to the genetics team to make the diagnosis. This can likely be done over the phone. \n\nI would make clear the symptoms you have that point to a diagnosis and specifically ask for a referral to a genetics doctor who can do the necessary investigations (my GP had no idea what the process was initially).\n\nBe prepared for the GP not to know a lot about the criteria for diagnosis. The NHS website is a fantastic resource for these criteria, so you can reference/point them there.\n\nEdited to say: there really is not any need to wait. The NHS is encouraging people to still engage with their GPs where they need assistance. If you do have Marfan\u2019s, the first priority will be ensuring your aorta is okay, and that is not something worth putting off. I appreciate there may have been the perception that the NHS is swamped given the situation over the last few months - and people have been avoiding GPs for this very assumption, which may lead to them needing critical care for things which could have been avoided.\n\nHere is a press release from the NHS urging people to seek care when they need it: \n\nWithout us knowing OP\u2019s medical situation, it would be best to err on the side of caution when ultimately cardiac matters could be involved, and let the NHS triage OP as they see they need to. I did phone the doctors and I got a phone call with my GP on the 10th of August, I do not have a family history of the disease(I would be the first). I am almost 23 and have many of the physical signs like being slender, skinny, long limbs, long fingers and hands, poor posture which i think is lordosis but not quite scoliosis, crowded teeth, high palate, slight dent in chest, can pass the wrist test but fail the thumb test, although I am not flexible, my eyesight is fine apart from being very slightly longsighted which I have known for 5+ years, do not have flat feet, I am just curious in case you know, I had a recent eye test and they did all the stuff like looking into my eye etc and scanning it, they said my eyes were healthy and all okay but I am wondering if those kind of tests can see things like lens dislocation or any problems with the eyes that Marfans causes?\n\nI just want to get it myself checked out, I will be sure to mention seeing a genetics doctor during the phone call and see where it takes me. Thanks a lot for your helpful advice. No problem at all. Do not know where you are based, but I ended up being referred to the North West Thames Regional Genetics service based at St Mark\u2019s Hospital. It took a few months for me to get the appointment, but the doctor I saw was fantastic - cannot recommend enough! Based in South East England, I just hope that they take my concerns seriously because I feel like I match so many of the physical symptoms that it is hard to deny, thanks again. Do not worry -  just have a plan for your conversation and be clear with them on the outcome you want. They will most likely take you seriously, and if they do not - the worst thing that will happen is you can arrange an appointment with another GP.\n\nBeing (politely) persistent is a big part of having non-conventional medical problems! Yeah you are right, got to be persistent! I just hope that I do not have it.", "Mouth infections worry? Can someone please explain. Hello. I am planning to begin the process of applying for a jaw surgery to correct my sleep apnea. The thing is that I recall reading multiple times how marfan patients need to let know their orthodontist about their condition because something could lead to heart problems. I know the explanation is pretty vague but I do not recall exactly how dental procedures were correlated with the heart. \nCan someone please explain? Thank you. Maybe because of the type and dose of anesthetics that are used during the procedures. Usually, there is a possibility of there being complications in cardiovascular compromised patients when applied wrong doses, even with local anesthetics. That is what they have explained to me before any kind of surgery, although, according to what I have read about it, there is controversy about anesthetics being the main cause of those complications. Mouth bacteria can be a risk when you have a mitral valve prolapse because it can gather and cause an infection. Sometimes they recommend antibiotics before a procedure. It is to prevent bacterial endocarditis - basically, your mouth is an easy conduit to your bloodstream. The bacteria goes to your heart and eats up your valves. \n\nI take 1.5g of amoxicillin 1h before a dentist visit. Any dentist or orthodontist will ask you if you have heart problems, particularly a prolapsed heart valve or have had a heart valve replaced\n\nAs the gum is an easy way for infection to get to the heart and cause endocarditis\n\nSummer dentists will have you take antibiotics for any appointment to prevent this. This is no longer fine in the UK as the risk from a general appt is very low and antibiotic overuse is a big problem\n\nHowever typically if you do have issues with heart valves they probably would give antibiotics for at least some surgeries\n\nIt is also worth mentioning to an orthodontist in general. Marfans often causes tooth overcrowding and a high roof of the mouth etc which come under their speciality. Correct.  The risk is that:\n\n1) your mouth is dirty\n\n2) bleeding from your mouth introduces an opening for those bugs to get in your blood stream\n\n3) once in your blood stream they will hang out in your heart\n\nThe stats around how good oral hygiene (not just antibiotics during procedures, but just like... regular teeth brushing) affects heart health are pretty wild.  It is crazy that (in the US anyway) dental is seen as totally separate from body health.  edit: just wanted to add this is true for the general population, not just marf folks.\n\nAnyway, the care guidelines have been going back and forth as to whether or not antibiotics are strictly necessary for things like cleaning, but I still put my foot down for things like fillings or the like. This is generally not considered good medical procedure anymore. \n\nOf course, if the jaw surgery is extremely invasive you might end up being given antibiotics anyway. My doctors and dentist both have said this is no longer considered good practice and contributes to antibiotic resistance. It is not considered good practice in the US either, but medical professionals are given a lot of leeway here. If you have never had surgery before and do not know how you will react to anesthesia, you should be more worried about the potential effects on your lungs. Anesthesia always has a potential to be dangerous for all of your body's systems, but we are more prone to collapsed lungs than the general population.\n\nBut, if your sleep apnea is really being caused by some jaw deformity, getting that fixed will likely be *way* better for your heart and lungs than being intimidated by possible side effects of anesthesia. Sleep apnea is *awful* for your heart. If you have never had surgery before and do not know how you will react to anesthesia, you should be more worried about the potential effects on your lungs. Anesthesia always has a potential to be dangerous for all of your body's systems, but we are more prone to collapsed lungs than the general population. The only major surgery I had so far, the vent collapsed ol lefty.\n\nBut, if your sleep apnea is really being caused by some jaw deformity, getting that fixed will likely be *way* better for your heart and lungs than being intimidated by possible side effects of anesthesia. Sleep apnea is *awful* for your heart. The Marfan foundation still recommends antibiotics in some cases, like if you have a mechanical valve like me:  Ah, yeah, I can see that. My brother has one too and I know there are a lot of situations that they get concerned about infection when they would not normally be. \n\nI think that is true for someone with any fake parts, like joint replacements.", "anyone else  Hovering around a +10 in each eye I have to explain to people that I am scrunching my face really hard because I am squinting to see i feel man lol my vision is 20/100 and getting worse. i like to post these memes on this sub because there is not enough and i see a lot of negativity here so i want to lighten the mood, you should be happy with what you have and not take over your life ya know? this sub should be a place of positivity, though everyone on this sub are very understanding and helpful. LOL! This could be me. Only found this subreddit today, and boy does this cut deep. Too relatable.\n\nExcept I would be the passenger having the driver read the sign to me, since I cannot drive.\n\nGood meme. Will use this to explain my vision from now on.

Loneliness is a depressing combination with Marfans.\n\nBeen suffering from Marfans since I was young and never really let it get in the way. It started to get in the way during high school, but I focused mostly on relationships of which I had two, one with a really nice girl 'S' and spent 2 1/2 years or 3, not really sure anymore, together and I loved her to death. We got along so gosh darn well, it is ridiculous. I always went over to her house, even though it was not exactly \"clean\" but that would be her parents fault, not so much hers. I spent every day of my life talking to her, and discussing so much together. I will never have that back and it really hurts. Around the end of the relationship a LOT was going on. Her father ended up breaking us up because we were messing around in a public park because her father was being overbearing even though we would been dating for over 2 years, and apparently her fathers friend saw us, and told him, and told her to come home. Kicked me out, and forced her to break up with me and move on. She ended up dating the one guy that I had always been cautious about her being friends with cause he clearly had feelings for her. Few of those kind of guys.. Annoying. Anyways she ended up \"moving on\" but hoping we would get back together, so did I, but she was not really.. trying to fix it?\n\nSkipping a bunch of teen drama..\n\nI started dating a new girl who I got along with and joked around with a lot in my math class, I will call her \"K\". We would sit on the floor in class, and the teacher was really cool about it, honestly he helped push our relationship into an actual relationship.. Love ya forever even though I cannot remember his name.. We started spending a lot of time together at my place, walking around the city together, and just being a solid couple. I was not exactly the best boyfriend especially with my emotional situation, I really missed S, she was a good person, and just wanted the best for herself and me. Me and K seemed to get along much better than S as K was more.. Mature and responsible, though she herself was not exactly the best at cleaning her room, which kept me away from her house - so we spent most of our time at my house.\n\nCouple situations that really negatively effected S opinion of me, like \"flaunting\" the relationship in front of her, because she hurt me and I guess my teenbrain decided that was a good idea.\n\nAnyways, I started being a bit of an asshole near the end of the relationship because of depression and emotional issues, Not treating K right, putting sex above the relationship even though I would tell myself how much she means to me, and she really did, Sex just really helped get my mind out of the gutter.\n\nEnded up breaking up with me over my behavior and the way I was treating her, totally understand and respect her decision. Now she is moved on and happy, and I am glad for her.\n\nAt the end of the day though, I miss them both, and the loneliness is killing me for years, I have been alone for at least 4-5 years, probably longer, and never really known what to do. Dating in our modern society is so hard, especially when dealing with physical pain on a daily basis.\n\nI have tried to kill myself a lot in the past, but I want to live, and I want to be happy, and I have always tried to be as happy as I can with what I have, because it could always be worse.\n\nI ended up getting back to talking to S like a year ago, she broke up with a guy, and I had been talking to her for quite some time, being there for her and talking to her about life issues, I really wanted to get back together and work it out.\n\nI ended up paying her around 4,200 total for supporting her in various ways, in return, we spent a lot of time together and always talked when she could and I loved spending time with her so gosh damn much just being around her made me so happy, we had sex a few times, I have not been happy in years, until I was around her. Nothing made me happier than giving her a big fucking hug.\n\nBut she had changed. She is a drug user now, she makes bad decisions, and in the end did not truly want to be with me or care about me, and yet again my heart was broken for a third time. A lot of lies and backstabbing towards me when I never deserved it. I was there for her always.\n\nAll I can think is how much her father ruined her own daughters life simply because we chose to do sexual things and how lonely I am because of him. I have contemplated so much negative things and obviously never acted on them because at the end of the day I do not know what to do when it comes to anything, raised by a single mother with issues of her own, never taught how to treat a woman until I learned myself how to be responsible and mature.\n\nI live on my own now with a roommate, but daily I want to hang myself from the neck until dead. Though I know I will never do it. I am just lonely to the point where it causes me panic attacks. Please do not recommend a therapist or anything, I have talked to everyone in my life about this, and there is not much anyone can do, or say, to change these feelings, they are just how I feel and our society is so hard to live in.\n\nI have always wanted to be in a relationship, and always wanted to start a family, and have that life. I see so many people with that ruining their opportunity and it hurts so much.\n\nNowadays I am just happy with what I have, but I have no clue how to further myself in life, how to meet someone like myself. I have gotten a call center job which is not that great and finding a job itself has been the worse and most depressing experience ever.\n\nOur society is not built for people like me.\n\nI have not been taking my medication properly for my mechanical aorta valve stuff until recently simply because I have not cared and been heartbroken.\n\nI have even tried to commit death by cop and lost an airsoft pistol that I highly valued due to confiscation, and from someone who only makes $1169/mo it is frustrating.\n\nI have 12 reptiles, and a collection of airsoft guns, I love animals and gun-building, but I cannot even afford it.\n\nI spend most of my time programming a bunch of Paradox Interactive Games modifications, basically just historical games. Europa Universalis IV, Hearts of Iron IV. They are somewhat popular. It is kind of sad because for a 20 year old, they are all I have to show for my life. They are not something to be proud of as I gain nothing from them.\n\nI have some kind of learning disability, I TRIED to upgrade my math to go to collage or something, but I could not do the math properly. I have never been good at math, numbers, and any major thing like that. I got by our poor education system by playing games and getting C's and doing non-education courses like cooking.\n\nBeen trying to find a relationship lately, but it is not going well, and I do not know HOW to meet people aside from Facebook dating, and I have not even met anyone yet.\n\nSpent 5 years of my life in relationships, and 5 years single. I hate not having someone in my life who cares like during the relationships.\n\nI do not know what to do anymore.\n\nA LOT of this story is missing, but I have smoked so much weed in the past to numb the physical and emotional pain, that I just cannot even recall anymore. I quit smoking recently and the emotions are really coming out.\n\nThanks for reading. \nIf you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please reach out.

Please go see a therapist and get some help. I did the same and it was life changing. \n\nKeep taking your meds - a blot clot from your valve may not only kill you but it could cause a stroke and leave you partially paralyzed, unable to speak, etc. \n\nIf you are into coding then they could be an angle for a good career for you. That is what I have done and it is been a great career. \n\nWe have a discord server if you want to chat with other young people with Marfan. Def see a professional. Reach out to a close friend or family member and ask them if they could help you schedule it if you do not think you will follow through and actually do it.\n\nSounds like you are depressed. Someone might say you have \"depression\" but tbh you have plenty of reasons to be sad, so although you may be diagnosable, you are probably mentally relatively normal, just at one of the further ends of human experience. That being said, I can tell you that if you do not take your meds, you will regret it later. Or, said another way, I can guarantee you there is another end of this tunnel, one where you will be looking back and wishing you would taken better care of yourself in preparation for the better part of your life.\n\nIt does not sound like you are ugly or unnapealing, as you have had a dating life. In all likelihood, you have become sad due to loneliness, and lonely due to the way sadness has pervaded your personality. You will need help to break out of this cycle, so seek it irl. From professionals, from family. Your goal is to be happier with who you are, from here forward. So what if you cannot do math, or do not have any direction: accept yourself like that and try to move on.\n\nAs for dating past school, it is tough. Friendship even tougher. I would recommend seeking out social events online through things such as 'meetup\". Try boardgaming, LARPing, concerts, chess clubs, or other group activities you have not tried before, even if they sound stupid to you. You may find something you did not expect to like, and you may find a friend.\n\nThe best advice I can tell you is that, when things are at their worst, you cannot think your way out of it. However, you can act your way out of a bad headspace. Your thoughts do not entirely determine your actions: given time your actions can change your thoughts. So go out and DO some things differently. Keep at it, and I can guarantee your life will improve. Perhaps not the way you expect it to, but it will. Firstly - good on you for quitting smoking and getting back on your meds! Those are great things to be proud of!\n\nI remember all throughout highschool and for a big part of uni, I never had a girlfriend and I swear - it was the only thing in the world I wanted! I was super self conscious about how I looked and just unconfident. I was in such a deep depression and only saw my whole life through a lense where everything was unenjoyable simply because I was not sharing it with a partner. I would look at others and feel so hurt and jealous. Ofcourse now I look back and laugh... \n\nOnly after around 21, did I actually start to get more socially active and REALLY try making connections with girls (beyond friendship level). A big part of being successful with girls (and this goes for any sort of relationship really) is being comfortable with yourself - being happy with your own life. Now, I do not know your exact situation, but its sounding like you are not happy/content with your life as it is. This is what you need to work on imo - because if you are not liking your life, why would others want to be apart of it? This may also mean not being in a relationship for a while, and improving your own life. \n\nSounds like you have got a few hobbies and that is great! Although if they are getting expensive you may need to compromise and find cheaper alternatives. Try also incorporating more social hobbies - I play badminton socially, but there are so many groups on meetup (the website) that you are bound to find something for you. Worst case - just go to a meet up that your half interested in and just focus on making friends - not just trying to find another relationship. This way you are out there meeting new people and growing as a person - eventually when you are in a setting where there is someone you are interested in, you will not be caught off guard.\n\nSelf help books are a great way to find motivation /give you a boost when feeling down. I find they keep me going whenever I start to go flat :)\n\nAlso, make sure you deal with your chronic pain - not the easiest thing, I know, but there are things you can do to manage the pain! Being in pain all the time certainly can contribute to your depression. Simple things like walking, aerobics, stretches, yoga, and other light weight activities are proven ways to reduce your chronic pain! Adopting good postures at work/ using a standing desk goes a long way. I was also recommended a book called \"The Power of Now\" which totally changed my life, but I found that the lessons I learnt in it helped me deal with pain!\n\nAnywho, I hope this all helped, it is abit all over the place - please feel free to reply, happy to talk :) A lot of us have bad depression; who can say whether it is living with a long term disease, or if it is part of the disease? Just be aware that if you are smoking weed part of the effect is to need with your serotonin levels, so when you go off of it it gets real. Good luck with everything- I think a lot of us take some time to get to a place where we are ok. I do not think it was until a couple of years ago that I really started to come to terms with Marfan, and I am in my thirties with an early diagnosis and no serious health complications. Same here, I always feel bad because I can seem to find anyone that wants to have a relationship, in high school always got depressed because I did not have many friends or because people looked at me at a different way I am getting pretty tired of being poor, lonely, and useless. Probably going to die soon. No thanks my life is shit and a call wont change that I need a job and I cant even get that. I dont have the strength to even leave my house. Sick of pain. Sick of loneliness. Sick of being poor.\n\nFuck it. U should not think that way, maybe you just need to change perspectives, life is not a sea of roses sometimes it gets pretty hard Apply for disability. Why should you work in your present condition?\n\nIdk what to tell you other than it gets better, but you have to do the bare minimum of asking for help from others irl. People here can only advise, but it sounds like your depression is too deep for you to be able to act on such advice. You need someone to actually come to your house and sign you up for the services you need.\n\nI spent some time in prison, followed by 7 years of probation with a 25 year suspended sentence for burglary (I was homeless at that time). I know how shitty things can get. \nNow I have a wife, daughter, and almost a decade sober. It always gets better.\n\nCall someone and tell them you need them to bail you out.", "Safe exercises for losing weight on marfans? I see this question from the other direction(gaining muscle) constantly, but not a lot going back down again. I was a skinny kid forever, which led me to terrible eating habits, as I could eat whatever I wanted and never gained excess weight.\n\nThen I hit my mid 20s, put on a lot of muscle mass, and then extra mass. Now I am 33, and 270 6'6\". A lot of that is muscle, but a lot is belly fat. \n\nI am looking into just biking a lot more, but I am worried about safe exercise as I get older. To lose fat but not muscle you need to go on a cut. It does not matter as much as what the exercises are but instead eating at a small caloric deficit each day but also eating enough proper nutrients (proteins, mainly) to maintain the muscle and to maintain that is to do a full body workout at least 3x a week. It is generally safest for us to do light weight and high reps so find a routine that hits the whole body and do that 3+ times a week. If you lose weight but do not hit your whole body and get enough nutrients you will lose the muscle mass as well as fat and return to that skinny physique. This is really a question for your doctor I would think. There is a lot of varied answers I have seen from the Marfan foundation to other medical experts on the topic. I think the biggest factor when losing weight safely for us is probably diet. You can pretty much do that safely and get the results you seek with the right amount of personal restraint. Eating healthy is so difficult but so beneficial. Why cannot cookies make me well?! Best of luck. Weight loss really is not about exercise - it is about what you eat and when. I would really look into that first and think about exercise in terms of fitness. There is a great book called The Obesity Code which could help. As they say, a flat belly is made in the kitchen. I think more than anything you should be looking at your diet. Beyond that, your doctor should be able to get you in touch with a PT who is familiar with safe exercise. I (31F) have Marfan and have lost 40lbs this year purely from diet. Unfortunately, the diet I started was so severely calorie restricted I also lost some muscle in the process. I have now changed to a more realistic diet and try to focus on getting enough protein, and my weight has basically stayed the same. I am still trying to figure out how to lose a little more fat and build more muscle but I can at least say that through quarantine and sitting on my ass all the time, I lost weight through diet alone. \n\nI also used to be super skinny and could eat anything without gaining a pound, but when I was 23 I started gaining. I went from 115lbs to my highest weight being around 185. It was all because I ate tons of crap. Just naturally restricting my calories I could drop 10lbs without any lifestyle change. Do some research, figure out what weight would be healthy for you at your age, and find a diet that takes nutrition and macros into consideration. \n\nIf you figure out how to build muscle though, let me and the entire Marfan community know because none of us seem to be able to figure that shit out. \ud83d\ude02 I mean, I do not really care about muscle too much. My job involves a certain amount of lifting, and I have always had an adequate amount of muscle for that. That is good. My muscle mass is so low I have a lot of chronic pain from it... Why dont you try eating a little less you fat piece of shit? Just because Costco sells in bulk doesnt mean eat in bulk. Learn some self control Well it is good that you are fat and floppy then.

Are we at extra risk for severe symptoms? I have already had a punctured lung because of my marfans and it is spreading slowly in my country. I take 2 hours of public transport every day to my uni and I am worried it is going to be extra dangerous because of my marfan. I am also 3 weeks post op on a rhinoolasty/sinoscopy so I am not even allowed to work out lightly yet due to the exertion. I have an artificial valave and 2 stents.  Also marfan patients are high risk for spontaneous pneumothorax (collapsed lung). I think it is safe to say that marfan patients would be in a higher risk pool for complications if they catch covid19.\n\nBe cautious. Wash your hands if you have to go out. Use hand sanitizer. Do not shake hands. Try to avoid going out to crowded places if you can help it. And of course if you think you are sick go to a Dr/hospital right away. Do not wait and try to tough it out. I know people look at me like I am crazy but as someone who is dad died in his early 30\u2019s (I was 2) I always took the view that I would not live any longer than he did.\n\nSo since I am now 10 years overdue, had collapsed lung, mitral valve replacement, pacemaker and various weird heart wobbles, if some super virus finally achieves what life failed at then fair game... but given what I have dealt with so far, it will have its work cut out for it!\n\nHmm... that might also explain why I am single... no-one wants to date a dead man walking! \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude1b\ud83d\ude08 If you take care of yourself and get the medical help you need, the life expectancy of Marfan is now similar to the average person. Anyone with heart/lung issues or chronic illness are more at risk. So wash your hands, do not touch your eyes/face, stay out of crowds, and take care of yourself. I would be worried about collapsing a lung, personally. I am vaxxed for pneumonia since I collapsed one the first time, so I hope I am good there, but since then, I have personally been extra vulnerable to bronchitis (get it every time I get a cold- which fortunately is not often). Yes, we are at extra risk. Do not touch your face without washing your hands before and after, wash your hands regularly, do not go licking the bus window, and you should be okay. Do what you can to keep your immune system up--keep up on that Vitamin C, sleep enough, drink enough water, you know the drill. Which is why I am amazed I have made it this far. It is like the other universe does not want me either! \ud83d\ude1b\n\nI am guessing you are not from the UK though. Trying to get answers from doctors is ridiculous. They seem to get the huff if you dare question them. (Although I doubt that is limited to the UK) god help you if you expect them to look into something your concerned about... but these days your lucky if you get to see a doctor to begin with so hmm... maybe I should have just become a doctor so I can take care of myself. \ud83e\udd14 Will hand sanitizer really help if it is a virus though? Still a good thing to do though. I just had to comment and say I identify with this way too much lol I have had three collapsed lungs and a pleurodesis... the latter of which makes me particularly vulnerable to pneumonia and bronchitis. I have had the same questions in my mind. Well sometimes people spend a bit too much time worrying about things, but when you cannot control something, no point worrying about it.\n\nSame when people see me on a motorbike and they start telling you how they know someone who crashed on a bike and will not ride again and I just think how boring they must be. We can either live to enjoy things or die trying not to stay alive! \n\nI have told people if I die riding my bike, then I will have died happy! The alternative could be dying in a lot of pain like my dad when they thought he had heartburn and found out too late that no, that was aortic dissection! \ud83e\udd2c*doh* Agreed. I survived my dissection. That was the most painful thing ever. If I can live thru that I am not that worried about much else. So I spoke with my doctor yesterday specifically about this and my history with lung conditions. He said that what they are seeing is the people with lung problems that are at the highest risk are smokers, people with chronic infections or asthma. A history of pneumothorices and even pluerodesis does not appear to predispose anybody to an increased risk. The pneumonia risk that I have thanks to the pleurodesis is primarily bacterial. Viral pneumonia does not infect in the same way. Additionally, because Marfan is not an immune disorder, there should not be any other unforeseen risk in our population. However, there is no specific data on people who have been confirmed infected with covid and have a marfan comorbidity.\n\nTL;DR If your immune system is fine, your risk is no greater than other healthy people your age.", "High Myopia &amp; Ectopia Lentis - Lens Replacement Surgery I am not looking for medical advice but I would be so grateful if you could share your experiences of lens replacement surgery. I have been referred to a retinal surgeon to get appropriate advice re scleral fixated IOL surgery. \n\nI am 24(f) and have ectopia lentis and severe myopia/ astigmatism (recent refraction - 26 prescription both eyes). I am no longer able to tolerate contact lenses which allowed me decent vision (around 20/40) and this is having a huge impact on my quality of life. \n\nGlasses are not a practical option to correct vision at my prescription. On top there are the cosmetic issues especially as a young (f) with extremely heavy and thick glasses - that also cut into my face and cause me a lot of discomfort. \n\nHas anyone here had the surgery and what was the result? Did you have any long and short term  complications? I know this risks are higher for very myopic eyes like mine which is a big concern. There is not much long term data available. I do not want to end up losing my vision all together and am already at high risk of problems like retinal detachment  I am very distressed about the situation so any help would be appreciated.. \n\nAlso im curious to know what are your prescriptions if you are happy to share! \n\nWhat problems have you faced with your eyes? \nMost of my family have experienced retinal detachments due to marfans with much lower myopia than me but I have yet to have this happen. \n\nI would love to hear from you. Thank you so much for even taking the time to read this. I wish you all the absolute best with your health (and eyes)! While I (19f) do not have severe myopia as you do, I do in general have an astigmatism and have had the lens replacement surgery 3 and \u201ca half\u201d times (I will explain). \nIn terms of getting the surgery itself it is very easy and I got it done at 6, 7, and 18 (right eye, left eye, right eye again). Since I was so young the first two times I cannot really say the most about vision correction but the latest time my vision improved significantly. My right eye went from a -8.5 to a -4! It now sees even better than my previous \u201cgood eye\u201d which is a -4.5. \n\nCircling back to that half surgery though, as for complications I did have one after my latest surgery. I originally went in bc right eye retina had detached (it is unknown if this was completely due to my marfans or injury bc I had hurt my eye very recently) and during it my doctor had chosen to replace my lens in that eye bc it had shifted significantly. However, a month after healing from that surgery I got very blurry vision in that eye one day and it turned out the lens did not fit my eye quite right due to the astigmatism and was causing my pressures to skyrocket. This snowballed into me needing a glaucoma stent implanted, the lense re-replaced, and now I am on pressure drops. This is why I say I got a half surgery, bc the lens replacement meant nothing in comparison to the implant surgery. \nHowever, my left eye has been totally fine through these 13 years since it was worked on. I will be honest, my doctor has said it is shifted slightly so surgery *may* be in my future but it is being closely monitored and has not brought any actual problems with it. \n\nAs a whole, try not to let the glaucoma part scare you. I mean, at the end of the day it is possible that was already in my future even though the surgery did make it come sooner. Even with that though I am happy with the results of the surgeries. Nearly one year later my eyes are fine, I can see in what feels like the best vision of my life, and i get to wear thin glasses for the first time!!! Eyeglass places always claimed my prescription was too thick no matter the lenses adjustments so I was stuck with thick frames too but now I have wire ones and wowow it is different. Firstly, I wish you all the luck and a speedy recovery! My situation was different but I will tell my story. \n\nMy surgery was a really long time ago, 1999. Also back then they could not do replacements on people with Marfan's so I just had my lenses removed. In my case the membrane that holds the lens completely disintegrated. \n\nI was 15 in late 1998 when my vision started going funky. It was confirmed by my eye doctor that my left lens was starting to shows signs of dislocation. Since I would just begun high school we decided to operate over the summer break. \nIn March of 1999 I began having really painful events. It felt like my eye was exploding. My vision would gray out in my left eye along with the intense pain, and I once fainted from it. It happened every day in school and despite running to my doctor each time we could not figure out what was up. After a few hours I would be fine. Finally one day I managed to get to my doctor as it was starting to happen. \n\nMy pupil would spontaneously dilate and my lens had partially detached so much it was just kind of flopping around my eye then it would slip through my open pupil. Then my pupil would suddenly change its mind, shrinking back down and trap my lens. This caused the pressure in my eye to skyrocket and I was essentially experiencing spontaneous glaucoma. Once my lens was able to retract, my pressure dropped and I was fine.  Because I would lay down from not feeling well, this is what was allowing my lens to retract. I later had an ultrasound done that measured just how much, or rather how UNattached my lens had become. It was barely hanging on. \nFun note: During the ultrasound my father asked the tech, \"Hey, what is that little butterfly looking thing in her eye?\" And there is this pause before the man responds with, \"Uh, well, that is her lens. It seems it uh, is starting to detach on its own.\" \nI laugh about it now but my dad was legitimately stunned by this whole situation. \n\nI had my left lens removed in April of 1999 and then my right was removed in June of that year. It was kind of confusing during that in between time because my post surgery vision became 20/200 but I was still able to see (poorly lol) out of my unoperated eye, so I wore an eye patch under my glasses until they finally removed the right lens. My corrected vision I believe is 20/30 to 20/40 range. \n\nRecovery was not horrible, as far as I can recall. I have had 3 more operations unrelated to my eyes, and it falls near the bottom on my pain/recovery scale. The only real issue I had was a really nasty throat infection I got after my right lens removal. I was sick for a long time with that. \nBut as for my eyes, I do recall the stitches annoyed the hell out of me. They dissolved after like two weeks. I had some pain but nothing really awful, it was more uncomfortable than painful. \n\nAdjusting to the near blindness was a little challenging. I would always been extremely near sighted with mild astigmatism but could get away without my glasses if I wanted to. I think having one eye without a lens and one with did help in that aspect, but it was still rough. I can make out some details if I squint super hard however all I really see is blobs of colors in the vague shape of things. \nI absolutely HATED my glasses when I first got them. They were easily 2 inches thick, bifocals. I spent my first week of 10th grade relying 100% in my friends to get me around because I refused to wear them in public, and my first pair of contact lenses were not ready lol. \n\nI am 37 years old now and I have still not worn my glasses in public because they are still obscenely thick. I have heard they can be thinned down now, I just have not gotten around to getting a new pair. \nOne really neat thing is that despite all this time, the laser sealing my surgeon did to my retinas has held up spectacularly. My eye doctor always comments on how well my retinas are holding up and I am very grateful for it. \nI am also grateful for contacts but I really wish it was not so difficult or expensive to get. Again, I am sure if I looked I could find better options but past experiences did not go well. 2 inches is 5.08 cm Thanks for sharing and going into so much detail. Sorry to hear you have had complications but glad you are happy with the results! I hope you wont have to have any more and if you do everything goes well.\n\nCan i ask why you had the surgeries at a young age? What type of lens surgery did you have was it a standard in the bag surgery or did it get sewn in and was it a lensectomy? And have you ever had myopia higher than your - 8 (corrected by the surgery) or was it never that bad?\n I am definitely worried about complications like glaucoma, detachment etc all things that worry me so much anyway. Very scared of ending up blind. \n\nIts great you have glasses choices! Mine will always look bad at this prescription unfortunately the glass has to be so thick or needs a very odd looking lens type. Very embarrassed of them and just want my eyes to stop rejecting contacts. \n\nThanks again hope your eyes continue to do well!! my advise to anyone seeking a lens implant is, ask whether a Multifocal XR contact lens will work better.  \n\n\nI have no lenses in my eyes and no implants - I wear ProClear Multifocal XR (+15.5), I can see nearly 20/20 Unfortunately I am no longer able to tolerate contact lenses for more than a couple of hours that is why im in this situation :(\n\nThanks for sharing So happy your eyes are doing well now!\nI hate my glasses they are so thick even with 1. 9 high index glass there is not anything I can do and my eyesight is rubbish in them. My boyfriend has been leading me around because I am so embarrassed to wear in public - I havent even seen friends in 3 months. Was always so grateful for contact lenses this just sucks :(\n\nAll the best! Thanks for the reply. I had both of my lenses replaced, I opted for the option to be able to see distance without glasses and I just need reading glasses when it comes to using my phone, I can still use it without my glasses like I currently am but a +2 prescription that I get from any drugstore makes reading easier.\n\nI still have a stitch that needs to be removed, I just moved states and I had 7 out of the 8 removed already so it is not a bother to me, definitely changed my life for the better, recovery took a few weeks but that was normal. \n\nI also enjoyed being awake for the surgeries, I thought it was just a cool experience being cognitive while they sew your eye up, I kept talking and being told I needed to be quiet but the fentanly and midozolam they gave me had me really high.\n\nMy left eye which was the worst of the two took around and hour and a half total while my right eye from the time the nerve block was administered to the time I was being rolled out of the OR was 45/50 minutes.\n\nSorry if this was kind of ramble, I am at work, I was a 21 male at the time of the surgery and now I am 23 and have had 0 issues since Ive done iris fixated IOL on my right eye with artisan lens by Ophtec. And scleral fixated iol on my left eye with a 3 piece iol by Alcon. Very good outcome. Before surgery, I can barely see or drive at night, even with my thick glasses on. Now i can see very clearly even without wearing glasses. I recommend you to go for surgery, and make sure to find a very experienced and good doctor.  Glad your eyes are doing well thank you for the reply!\n\nDid you have high myopia/ lens dislocation too before the surgery? My surgery would have to be performed by an experienced surgeon at my specialist eye hospital, they have always been great and have saved my family's vision over the years. \n\nAll the best! Thanks again. Have you tried other brands of contact lenses? Or other contact lens solution?  \n\n\nI understand they are not for everyone but I was able to get used to them and my optometrist says my eyes (Corneas) are in perfect condition even though I wear my contact lenses 16+ hours a day  \n\n\nAnyways, the issue is, even with implants, you will have to be on medication/drops for the rest of your life for them and have yearly checkups and you will likely need glasses or contact lenses ontop of them anyways We have tried everything to get me back into contacts for months and ive seen many opthamologists. I wore contacts for 10 years and theres only 2 types of contacts available for my prescription. Currently on 10 x drops daily to be able to wear them for three hours which will still lead to a reaction. I already get checkups yearly or more often due to my high risk eyes. I agree contacts are the best option but i wouldnt be in this situation if they were still an option for me. Sorry for getting back kind of late but I am glad to answer the rest of your questions :))\n\nI had my surgeries at a young age just due to the fact that the lenses in my eyes naturally shifted due to marfans. Both eyes happened at about the same rate but due to the fact that I was young and they were not terribly out of place we did the surgeries a year apart. As for the type, yes to my knowledge they have all been sewn in, lensectomy surgeries. I could be wrong in regards to my childhood surgeries but I am sure about my latest. Also no I do not believe my myopia has been higher than that.\n\nThank for your well wishes about my eye health though, I hope yours stay healthy as well and that this info helps you in your journey \u2764\ufe0f Did you have a subplanted lense or standard replacement?", "Extremely scared about having marfans.

Personally, I have not found any info on this at all. I would think extra precaution is a good idea as many of us have a higher than usual chance for spontaneous pneumothorax. \n\nOther than the pneumothorax part mentioned by another user, this is the only article that I managed to find that was smwhat related Yes I agree, our cardiovascular deficiencies could trigger very strong sickness regardless of age, so I have done my best to keep to myself. I am treating this covid stuff as though it is game over if I get it. With the amount of lung surgeries I have had, if I need a ventilator then it is too late.  It also messes with blood thinners so be careful everyone. I was in the hospital for a week in early March due to an aortic dissection. I didnt need surgery but I had 3 doctors give me the \"if you get covid, you will die\" talk. I am very happy being a hermit I thought dissection meant surgery or death, how did this happen??? so did I. I had a type B dissection and was under surgical ICU for a week waiting to be cut open. They got me stabilized and on a medication schedule then sent me home to see if I would get worse over the next 2 months. I didnt so now I stay on the meds and get a CTSCAN every 6 months My mother who had a replacement was in a forum with Marfan specialists and her cardiologiest.  Both told her that she is at no great risk than other people who are 64yr old.  But, that is her.  I would talk with your own doctor.  \n\nAlso my sister has Marfan, and also tested positive for have Covid Antibodies meaning she probably had it at some point.   No issues and didnt know she was sick The Covid lottery is messed up. Marfan.org put up their thoughts in March and you might be at no greater risk if you do not have significant respiratory issues or other heart issues other than aortic dilatation. Of course, at that point the clotting issues were probably not documented too well. I had the PEARS op in March and otherwise would fall in this bracket: \"People with genetic aortic conditions with none of the above whose only cardiovascular feature is an isolated aortic root dilation or aneurysm are not considered at higher risk than the general population.\"\n[March 12 2020 Statement Regarding COVID-19 and Genetic Aortic Conditions\n\n]( I am curious about this too, especially now with news coming out that covid may be a blood vessel disease.", "/r/marfans now has over 1k subs!

I am really trying my best to accept my face and body, but it is special that even I cannot seem to get used to my flaws/mutations (hate that word). Usually I go months before feeling down because of Marfan\u2019s, so it is not a big issue anymore. But sometimes I daydream and think about how different my life would be if I did not have Marfan\u2019s. Beautiful like the rest of my family. Yeah, I know, pathetic. How can the first thing I think about be how attractive I would look and not how healthy I would be? But looks are not everything, and I know for a fact that the challenges I have faced because of Marfan\u2019s have turned me into a very strong and good hearted person. That is always what I tell myself. But yeah.. Just one of those days. I have had plenty of those days. Hopefully this will help \n\n1. They are not mutations they are unique features. \n2.

It is really hard sometimes, sorry you are having one of those days.\n\nOne thing you can do to make yourself feel a little better is improve the things you can control.  Dress well, keep your teeth clean, maintain good hygiene, exercise as much as is safe for you, etc.\n\nAlso if you do not already, talk to a therapist or counselor.  It is tremendously helpful to talk through things and get constructive feedback on your situation.\n\nKeep strong! You are an amazing person, thank you. I really appreciate your advice, thank you.

Having a great partner by your side helps so much. I used to worry about how I looked. And then I realized a number of things that helped me get over all that. The first one being what you already pointed out: I would rather be a beautiful person on the inside than to be gorgeous on the outside but ugly inside. Because that inner beauty radiates outward, and outshines every inch of you.\n\nThe second is when I realized that, well, I am simply not my own type. I do not particularly care for how I look, but that does not mean no one else does. My wife thinks I am quite handsome. I am simply not my type.

I was diagnosed with Marfan's at age 12, the first person in my family. Had open heart to repair my mitral valve at 19. \n\nAt 35 I was diagnosed with LADA  Diabetes (sometimes called Type 1.5), and just recently my pancreas finally packed it in for good. I am now insulin dependent. \n\nAnyone else out there have both Marfan's and Type 1? I do not but my family was hit with the genetic defects lottery as my oldest brother got type 1 diabetes at 5yrs of age, and I, the youngest, was diagnosed with marfans at about 12yrs of age. The chance of both of them hitting in the same family with no prior history, is, I think, statistically crazy high. I have wondered if somehow these genetic markers for diagnosis/defects were at all related or if my family was just... an outlier \ud83d\udc4d", "Jealousy for able bodied people. Hello everybody. I am 26 and recently moved in with my brother to an apartment complex in NYC. The thing is that I have marfans and he does not. I would not want him to have marfans ofc. I tend to get very envious and jealous because he is able to work out, is more attractive than I am, has much better luck with women, does not have social anxiety as I do (or at least not as severe) etc. And I believe I would not feel this way if I did not have marfans. Anyone else secretly jealous of a family member/friend/partner etc? How do u deal with it? Do you talk to the person about it? \nThanks Yes I feel the same. Very jealous of able bodied people. My sister does not have Marfans. But ultimately these are the cards that we were dealt and we cannot change our genes. I used to be envious of others. Yeah, marfans sucks. Im pretty lucky to not have intensely severe symptoms, but I still had to quit sports in 7th grade. Could not lift weights. Nerdy glasses. 6 foot 4 inches and 150 lbs is not exactly \"buff\" lol.\n\nThe guys on my crew are all fairly sturdy, my sales rep looks like Arnold fkn Schwarzenegger, and I will never look like that. I would die trying. To me its not worth wasting the energy worrying about it. It gets me down sometimes, of course. I would love to have actual pectoral muscles and biceps that dont look like a 15 year old. It is what it is bro. Its ok to feel some type of way about it.. But staying in that negative frame of mind is going to destroy you. First mentally then physically. \n\nYou just have to be thankful for what you do have. As much as i sometimes despise having this body, I know some people are far worse off with their marfans than i am.  My half sister wore a back brace for 23 hours a day. My other sister is a paraplegic due to complications during an abdominal aneurysm repair. It makes me grateful for what little affliction I do have. \n\nThe other things you are upset about can all be improved on. You can work on confidence and social interactions. \n\nThe right woman will not give a damn about your long ass arms or skinny frame. She will love how your arms envelop her and how she feels so small laying next to your giant self. I say this from experience bro. \n\nI hope my ramblings help. 4 inches is the length of 0.46 Zulay Premium Quality Metal Lemon Squeezers. 4 inches is 10.16 cm I am so sorry that you have this struggle. We all have struggles some are apparent and others not so apparent. It only hurts you to go down the envy road. Rather than spending 5 minutes thinking about what you wish was, think for 5 minutes about what you are thankful about. You will be surprised how quickly you start noticing more positive things to be thankful for. You should also volunteer. There is so many ways to do so. Senior citizens in nursing homes would love to have you visit once a week. There is children you can mentor, read too, coach, lead in a 4H group etc. You will also find the attention of those who also give their time will fill that empty void you have and the quality of women much higher than your brother runs into. I would talk to your brother about your feelings. Make sure you are not making it sound like these feelings are his fault, but see if he would be willing to let you vent some of your thoughts on your situation. It might feel awkward but growing jealous could mean you could be resentful later and that is no relationship to have with your brother. I am very jealous and bitter towards other people. Simple things like buying and wearing clothes and them looking GOOD is something I have always wanted. I hate how everything is so huge and baggy on me and looks ridiculous. I do not think I have ever worn a T-Shirt in front of another person in years - always stupidly big hoodies.", "Is a specialist needed for EKG too? Hi there,\n\nWe have a second cousin who was diagnosed with Marfan's a couple of years ago.  \n\nAt my daughter's recent well-child visit (age 12), I made mention of this diagnosis (it was explicitly asked on her sports physical form).  The doc took a look at her spine &amp; thought she did see some curve.  She also has hunched shoulders, slender fingers, a history of knee dislocation, a slender build (height 5' 5'' - slightly tall for a barely 12 yr old) and a wide arm span.  The doctor felt it was enough to refer for evaluation by specialists.  \n\nShe suggested we get genetic testing (appointment wait time may be up to 1 year away).  She also suggested we see an orthopedic doctor (scheduled possibly later this month... depending on insurance carrier).  \n\n\\*\\*In the meantime \\: it sounds like an EKG might be the most important test to get done?  Does that take another separate visit to some specialist?  I am kind of surprised this could not get ordered sooner, or does this get done by a specialist too?  \n\nThis whole diagnosis is just rather anxiety provoking, especially with all of these health care appointment/insurance hurdles.\n\nThanks! An EKG would be done by a Cardiologist. An Echocardiogram is a more important test, though, I have always been told. That is how you check for an aneurysm or dilation in the aorta. A cardiologist would do that as well and its one of the first steps in evaluating for Marfan syndrome. So are you saying then that her pediatrician can order this visit with a cardiologist based upon her observations?  I had been guessing that either the ortho or geneticist would be the first consult and then they would order the cardio work?  \n\nIf this is the case, I presume I could call our clinic &amp; ask the pediatrician to refer us there first?\n\nTHANK YOU for your input sleepy\\_kat!  This is very helpful. The pediatrician can refer to cardiology based on their observations, yes. I do not know how much criteria she meets, and scoliosis is not that uncommon in the general population, especially in girls her age. It might be worth talking to the Ortho first, if that appointment is not too far away. \n\nGeneticist is where you want to end up, of course, but if you cannot bring yourself to wait that long, a cardiologist visit to check that the aorta is healthy can help give you peace of mind while you wait for that appointment. If they are serious about testing for Marfan, they will need to know if she has an Aortic enlargement, anyway. An EKG will not show much, like the other comment mentioned, she should get an echocardiogram instead. My PCP is the one who ordered my echo after I was diagnosed. No matter what doctor orders it, a cardiologist will interpret it. \n\nYour pediatrician can probably order the testing so you do not have to wait so long and pay the copays for a specialist if she does not need one. Needs an ECG. Got one done when I suspected myself of having Marfan's. They check for any signs of aortic root dilation. That is going to depend on what country you are in and what medical system you are dealing with. \n\nGenerally the regular doctor would refer her to a cardiologist who would order it (probably a much shorter wait than the geneticist). But, the pediatrician may be able to order the test directly also.\n\n(And like others said, echocardiogram is the more important test.)", "change in dimensions of aorta and left atrium how quickly can aorta and left atrium increase in size...i had two echo within a space of six months....in first echo left atrium and aorta were both 2.7cm..in the next echo  after six months, left atrium was 3.5 cm and aorta was 3.6 cm..both were done by different doctors..i did ask my second doctor this .He said first one was an error...what do you all think?   btw..i do not have diagnosis of marfans..i am only marfanoid habitus.. Mine went from \u201cfine\u201d to having surgery in about six months. I have had two scans by the same doctor, a year apart, where my aorta measured smaller the second time. This sort of thing apparently is not the most precise measurement.\n\nThat much dilation over 6 months would be atypical, but I do not see why it would be impossible. If you are worried about the results I would get another scan elsewhere. Definitely get another scan after 6 months, at least. Very important question, \n\nHave you been exerting yourself during the past six months? If I might ask, at what age did this happen? Sometimes it can be difficult to measure exactly the dilatation for various reasons (ribs in the way for instance). But the difference should not be that big between two physicians/machines. Did you change something in your life style during these six months? Like lifting weights at the gym? \n\nIn my opinion, you should monitor your heart very closely, meaning getting a scan regularly throughout the year. And if possible, doing an MRI or scan with contrast would allow for a better measurement (this is what I did when my doctor had a doubt about the accuracy of the exam).\n\nTake care OP ! I had just turned 20. Am in my forties now - no heart surgeries since! Oh wow so young! Extremely important question ^  There is always a percent error +/- that can be different from literally a million variables. Machine, tech, calibration etc to name a few. But it is usually a couple millimeters... and if the first one was a screw up that means basically it is useless. No..rather i was lifting before my first scan..i have not lifted since as i have palpitations.. I am 31..and the thing is why has my left atrium grown so much suddenly..i do not have mitral or aortic regurgitation and my left ventricle is just 45 mm Honestly, it sounds like a reading error maybe? Sometimes these things happen as no technology is perfect. Some papers heavily emphasis the importance of doing the test in the same location for these reasons haha.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHonestly, it sounds very odd that your heart grew in such size in so little time, although it could be possible, but highly atypical from what I know.  \n\n\nI think a third test might need to be done or an MRI(or CT scan angiography).   \n\n\nAlso, 3.5cm aortic size is still within the normal range. Still I would need to know your heigh and Body surface area, but yeah it is still kind of within normal range.   \n\n\nThe danger range starts at 4.0 - 4.5 (recommended surgical intervention at this point in patients with marfans) and for a person without marfan it is 5.5 for surgical intervention. Also, I am leaning towards the reading error because BOTH things increased in size, so that is very odd. so i had another echo today again at a different centre.. this time aorta measured 3.2cm and left atrium was still 3.5 cm..it was four months after my last echo....so most probably an error ..btw thanks for your time.. Okay, 3.2cm I do not even think that is considered dilated at all. well my height is 195 cm..weight at the time of scan was 100kgs....now it is 110 kgs...yeahh i have gained this much due to lack of exercising...maybe now doctor will not describe me as marfanoid habitus..lolz..  so i had another echo today again at a different centre.. this time aorta measured 3.2cm and left atrium was still 3.5 cm..it was four months after my last echo....so most probably an error ..btw thanks for your time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nanother query: if echo report does not say anything about diastolic function, then it is normal? Okay, that gives you an aortic z-score of negative 1.35.  \n\n\nThat is not considered dilated at all, you are well below in the median according to the marfan foundation z-score calculator.  \n\n\nyou would need a postive 2 or more in the z-score alongside a ghent nosology score of 7 (physical trait calculator) to be diagnosed. Also to put it into perspective, an aortic size of 3.6cm woudl put you in the 0.92 z score, which still is not 2, although your aorta would be wider than more of the population, but still not enough for a diagnosis. well i am tall and i have very thin forearms so i can wrap it around with my fingers...but still my eyesight is perfect,do not have flat foot,no back issues,no chest deformities and have difficulty losing weight..i do not know if i should even be called marfanoid habitus and also my mitral valve is fine with no regurgitation..", "You guys are rad This is a great community, even if we are small and sometimes quiet.

I really do not know what to do with this information, I plan on being cautious about it because the heart problems that might occur are very severe. \n\nIn your experience, what do you think, do I have reasons to worry ? What is the best test that could tell me if I am positive or negative on the syndrome ? And what is the best analysis for the heart problems ? ( I am guessing it is an EKG and an echocardiography but you guys know better)", "I think I have Marfan's  You do?", "Marfans, breast implants and ECGs? I have suspected marfans and my doctor has referred me for an ECG.\n\nI also have silicone breast implants and have read that implants can affect the test results and make it more difficult for them to get a good reading. \n\nIs there anyone in a similar situation? \n\nI just want to find out if I have heart issues :( ECG is generally not very useful for marfan diagnosis. We are at risk of something known as aortic aneurysm, and this is seen via an Echo cardiogram. I do not think breast implants should affect an echo. \n\nHaving said that, maybe the doctor wants to look at the electrical activity of your heart for some other reason which is why you are asked to get an ECG. You can inform both the doctor and the technician that you have implants and they should be able to factor that in their interpretation. I totally need to edit my post. She is referred me for an echocardiogram - I assumed the ECG acronym applied lol! I googled it and it seems like implants might indeed affect the quality of the echo. The good thing about the echo is that if the quality is not good, the doctor/echo cardiographer will be able to immediately see that it is not good. It might be good enough to see if you have an aneurysm or not though, precise measurements maybe difficult. In any case if the quality is not good enough, they should ask you to get an MRI or CT which are more accurate than an Echo. Your breast implants may affect the reading from some angles but generally they will look at your heart from several places. During my echos the tech looks at my heart from my abdomen side and throat as well as just to the left of my sternum. It makes it a tad trickier but I would not say it is anything to worry about. Thank you! Thank you!", "pregnancy and marfans i am wondering what exactly the risks are for having children? Not the risks of my children having marfans. just what about getting pregnant with marfans is dangerous. is it my heart? my uterus? Increased risk of: Incompetent cervix (cannot hold the baby once it gets too heavy), increased blood volume during pregnancy can contribute to a higher risk of aneurysms, especially in Marfan\u2019s patients. Uterine rupture is also possible. I am 22F with Marfans and this is something I have had to worry about. I am debating not having kids due to these risks, though I really want them yea i am 24F and idk if i want kids especially if there is so many risks I feel ya This is something you should talk to your cardiologist about instead of asking the internet as we are not doctors and we do not know your individual case. With that, however risk also heavily depends on what the condition of your heart is. If you have a dialated aortic valve/vessel, an aneurysm or if you have mechanical valves, your likelihood of aortic rupture/dissection is increased, as well as the need to change what you are doing to manage your INR/PT levels (if you have a mechanical valves(s) ).\n\nI have a pretty severe case, and have always been that way and have known since basically diagnosis that I will not ever have kids because of it. Beyond that I gave the yeet my uterus last year around this time due to other complications of a different form of sterilization 10 years ago. I also do not identify as female (non-binary) but regardless of all that, I have never wanted children as I would be a crap parent due to medical and mental health issues. The risks stated above, but I also reiterate that that is something you need to discuss with your doctor as he or she will have a better idea of the risks and how to keep you safe during a pregnancy. I am in my 30s now and though my doctor said my heart is okay to be pregnant, I am not sure I would risk it anymore at this age either. My mother also had marfan\u2019s and she got pregnant with me at 24, but because of it could not have more children other than me because it would be too risky. Also of course more than likely you would be looking at a c-section. \n\nTbh the biggest issue for me is do I want to risk my kids getting it and getting it worst? I feel like I would only try to have my own kids at this point if I had the money to ensure that the egg used did not have the gene for it. I am 28F with marfans. I have already had an aortic replacement and a dissection. I was told under no circumstances should I become pregnant.\n\nWhen you are pregnant the pregnancy hormones soften up your tissues making it easier for your body to grow and stretch to accommodate the baby. These hormones also help when it comes time to deliver the baby. The problem is because of Marfans a lot of our tissues are already softened. So with these added hormones it can make the symptoms of Marfans much more severe. So even if you have a mild case of Marfans, pregnancy will increase the odds of developing an aneurysm quite a bit. I really want kids someday but I am so sure if I got pregnant my spine would get completely destroyed. I think when the time comes I will look for a surrogate. Well, I do not think that is a big thing to worry about tbh unless your spine is severely bent already. I am not a doctor though, just a premed student lol I was being a bit dramatic haha but I am already starting to have pseudo arthritis, disk degeneration on the adjacent levels of my fusion and have grade II spondylolisthesis so not the best situation to begin with True. Mine is pretty bad too and got some decent curve. I would still say that it probably would not affect the pregnancy that badly though except for maybe later in the third trimester. If it gets bad enough, then maybe you could spend more time in bed/reclined to lessen the strain on your back. You could also request an earlier induction/Cesar\u00edan. If you really wanted your own pregnancy it would be doable, but definitely not a walk in the park.", "If an orthopaedic surgeon did not pick it up following a surgery and multiple meetings, x-rays and an MRI, there is no way they would not have seen it. Had scoliosis surgery, and thus pectus excavatum, and also am lanky and can do many of the hand tests.\nBut if nurses and surgeons did not pick it up during a 7 day week in hospital, there is no way they would not have noticed? Do not count on it. Sometimes doctors have tunnel vision and do not see the broader issues.

Thanks Yup, got them on my stomach and shoulders, but not very visible! I have them on back of legs, lower area of bum cheeks and inside of my legs up towards testicular area I have them across my shoulders, breasts, hips and legs. Most of those are old ones I got when I grew super quick but recently I have been finding random ones appearing on my stomach without any weight gain. Its the same with me, had a few growing up to to growth speed, but in the last year with only about +1 or -1lb weight change ive had some appear and tbh they are quite sizeable. Thankfully due to the location its only me or my wife that sees them The first time I noticed I had these tiny little red marks on the bottom of my stomach, not really noticable but now they have spread further up towards my belly button. I was horrified at first but now I have had valve replacement surgery theyre nothing compared to the huge scar all the way up my chest! Yea, it is very common for us. Did you ever find they were of a purple colour, itchy and sometimes painful aswell?  Yup. yes, brother and I both have them and neither of us are over weight.  We started getting them in high school when we were both bean pole thin.  Very odd, we also did not know we had Marfans until we were in our 30's. Yeah it is really common with marfans. I have got them on my knees, shoulders, hips and lower back that all appeared at the same time and then recently I have had new marks appear on my stomach without having any significant weight gain etc. Yup all down my lower back like tiger stripes I am not a doctor by any means, but this description does not sound like any stretch marks I have heard of or had.  (22 F with Marfan), I do have random stretch marks with minimal to no weight gain, mostly around my lower stomach area, knees and chest, but all have been a pinkish/cream/white color that closely resembles my skin tone. \n\nIf you are concerned (and with good reason, if these are itchy and painful) you should see a doctor. No one in this thread is qualified to tell you what is safe/unsafe/natural/unnatural on your body. Since I was a child, they first appeared horizontally across my back, then my upper thighs, then my belly. Despite never being over weight or pregnant I have more scars than my wife who is had 3 kids. A \"counter question\"; Is it very uncommon for \"Normally\" tall people to have stretch marks on their lower backs?", "How many of you have POTS and MCAS? Just wondering I had never heard of either of these until your question. Based on wikipedia articles, I am sure I have POTS, and I am reasonably sure I have MCAS. In fact, I have been having a lot of MCAS gastro symptoms for several years (as well as other symptoms too), but doctors keep dismissing it as \"nothing specific so we will not bother to do anything about it\" and my quality of life has been getting worse and worse. I am really glad you posted this, as it gives me something to flag with the doctors and a possibility of treatment to ameliorate some of my stomach issues.\n\nThank you. I am assuming that you have marfans as well, correct? Look into mast cell stabilizers like cromolyn sodium. I am waiting for my prescription to get sorted out and I will be starting it.  I bought some quercetin in the mean time which also is a mast cell stabilizer.  Most mast cells are in the gi tract so hopefully your gut problems see improvement.  Look up poor man tilt table test for the POTS to give you a better idea if you may have it. Awesome, very helpful. Seeing my cardiologist for my annual review in about December and sadly none of the general doctors ever have the slightest clue about Marfans so the cardiologist (who specialises in congenital stuff like Marfans and is very knowledgeable) is the only doctor who ever listens :( Great to be able to do soemthign myself in the meantime, thank you :)", "Joint laxity/ hypermobility Could Joint Laxity/hyper-mobility cause or contribute towards bad hand-writing (fine motor skills) Yes, absolutely.

Good to know there is a reason for it!", "Trying to gain muscle with Marfan's I am 21 years old, and I have been lifting weights starting at 16 years old. I have always lifted heavy throughout every session contrary to what is advised by people with the syndrome, I was not consistent as I would lift weights 3 months max and would stop for a couple of months until I start again.\n\nThroughout the years I find it extremely difficult to lift heavier weights, my strength does not seem to progress any further as I end up lifting the same weight (or lower) I have gained little muscle mass and my body fat remains the same. I feel that Marfan's syndrome somehow inhibit protein synthesis in the body, which is important in muscle building.\n\nI eat healthy, I usually am on a low carb and high protein diet, which I eat lean meat and complex carbohydrates. I take Whey protein and take supplements (fish oil, calcium, Vitamin C to be exact)\n\nCan someone recommend me an effective workout for weights, or even an alternate form of exercise? And if anyone knows the effects of Marfan's on protein synthesis/muscle building that would be great.  I do not know of any effects of Marfan's on muscle building. My father and uncle were both fairly muscular in their youth, and my brothers and I are all wiry muscle. I managed to put on 24 lbs once in a concerted bulk.\n\nI suspect your issue is the inconsistency of your exercise and your calorie intake. Gave you made sure to eat at a caloric surplus? Not very often. I am a college student, so its difficult eating the amount of meals required to bulk. I usually end up having three meals a day by preparing my meals beforehand (and eat them during my short breaks in between classes) but if I would have time I would increase it to 4-5 meals.\n\nAs for exercise, I am thinking that it is the inconsistency as well. But I feel that certain muscle groups are just weak/underdeveloped, inhibiting my full potential in certain exercises. I know that people with Marfan's would have a difficult time to gain mass, so i guess its part of the reason for underdeveloped muscles. I too encountered this issue, my Marfan's specialist said it was because I have no Fibrilin 1 in my genes... Which sucks... I have always wanted to test with steroids/growth hormones to see if that approach would make a difference Hey there,\n\nYou sound a lot like me.  I ignored the advice to not lift heavy weights because I wanted to put on muscle.  Then one day my aorta suddenly dissected and I came extremely close to death.  I ended up needing two 8-hour surgeries and years of physical, mental, and emotional rehabilitation.  I still struggle with fears of it happening again.\n\nYou should stop lifting heavy weights.  I know you are 21 and you want to look good and whatnot, but trust me, it is not worth risking your life for.\n\n Yeah not to sound like an ass, but coming from someone who was diagnosed at 3 years old, knowing my whole life I cannot do alot of physical things. Do not lift fucking weights, it is stupid and like someone above me said it CAN kill you.\n\nOur hearts cannot take a beating like normal peoples can, why risk death? Yeah it kind of sucks being a twig but I would rather be skin and bones then to die from a aortic tear or dissection. We have a spectrum disorder. He should get cleared by his doctor, but he does not need to live in fear. My dad has been doing heavy lifting his entire life and his cardiologist says his heart is in better shape than most men in their late fifties. \n\nJust because it happened to you does not mean it will happen to me, the OP, or anyone else with Marfan's. Monitor, accommodate, but do not let it rule your life.  That is great for your Dad but assuming he has marfans, he is clearly an exception, an outlier.  \n\n\nUnfortunately the majority of Marfans patients would be better off avoiding heavy weight lifting and strenuous activity, so I am going to keep advising that people abide by the widely accepted guidelines for physical activity.\n\n\n\n\n My dad, my uncle, my grandmother and one of her brothers, me and both my brothers. We have all done (or did in the case of grandma and her bro) a lot of heavy lifting. None of us suffered an aortic dissection. \n\nWe are not made of glass. Do not tell people to live in fear just because you had a bad experience. Crossing the street is dangerous, but everyone still does it.  Again, your family is clearly an outlier.\n\nI did not tell anyone to live in fear, I said OP would be wise to stop lifting heavy weights and switch to a routine that focuses on muscle exhaustion rather than heavy weight.\n\nI am not saying these things because of my experience, I am saying these things because they are widely accepted medical advice which can be easy to ignore when you are young and have minimal symptoms.   You know, you kind of raise a good point. Are we outliers? We' have the build, but we are not exceptionally tall. Our most obvious symptom is the detached lenses. How many people are undiagnosed because they have less extreme cases? It would make sense that the more extreme Marfan's would be more likely to be diagnosed and that would skew the medical literature. I would really recommend reaching out to ( for those kinds of questions.\n when i was 12 almost 13 i had my spin fused from top of my hips to the top of my shoulder blades. i weighed 117lbs. it was only when i went on the south beach diet with a couple i was living with for school. i gained 32lbs. i dont remember what all i ate but i know i had pizza on the weekends and ham and cheese sandwhiches. \n\nthe biggest problem with trying to be physically strong is the heart but its something else that causes that problem. weak connective tissue. after my heart surgery i started to get stretch marks on my belly. i now have stretch marks on the insides of my legs too. my shoulders are feeling looser too. ill be 30 in july. \n\nanother story was trying to get into archery. i got a 30lbs compound bow. it took me a year to get the strength to pull it at full power. \n\ngood luck!

Hi all, \n\nI am currently a 24 year old male, I was diagnosed with Marfans at around 15 for certain. I have been closely monitored since I was 12 and a problem I have is mitral valve prolapse causing mitral valve regurgitation. \n\nIn the last week ive been feeling a bit unwell, like it is been extra effort to get dressed and have a shower in the morning and I have just started a new office job with 2 really lovely team members. But going into the office this week I have been feeling nauseous and had cold sweats. I have also noticed a slight discomfort in my chest. Anyway I am not asking for medical advice because I have already been in touch with my cardiologist and we have a plan of action. \n\nMe being me however I have been catastrophising, looking at survival rates for mitral valve repair/replacement and aortic root replacement. And from what I have understood, after primary operation the expected survival rate is around 10 years. With me being 24, I am thinking that is obviously not great.. But then I have also read that people with Marfans have a normal life expectancy so I do not know what to think but I am leaning towards thinking negatively.\n\nIn previous chats with my cardiologist he said that if I need surgery on either my mitral valve or an aortic root replacement he will do both surgeries at the same time which in my eyes reduces my expected survival rate further. And I also have a sunken chest so I am guessing that would complicate things further?\n\nI am due an echo soon anyways, but I am also a bit unclear on whether my echo tells us anything anyway. Because when I was under the childrens department, my mitral valve prolapse was classed as mild. But as soon as I transitioned to the adult department the reference measurements changed and it was then classed as moderate. And then the next scan, the technicians report said it was severe. But my cardiologist after reviewing every scan says there is little change. So I do not know how bad my mitral valve even is from the echo.\n\nAnyways, that is kind of a summary of my situation and if I am honest my mental health is not that great right now thinking about all this.. So I was just seeing if anyone can give me any good news, or a better perspective. Like have I misunderstood survival rates? Or, I cannot see how, but maybe open heart surgery is not that bad? \n\nTLDR: Worried that I might need open heart surgery soon in my mid 20s, feeling like I am going to die young, does anyone have any words of wisdom?\n\nThanks for listening anyway! It is been nice to write down my worries at least, even if nobody reads this.", "I have been advised I require a replacement of my aortic arch soon. Has anyone had the arch surgery done as an isolated procedure? I am really fearful of what could go wrong and recovery time. I have previously had the Bantall procedure as well as most of my aorta replaced with a Dacron graft). I have not had it yet but will likely need it in the future.  From what I have been told it is a less invasive surgery than thoracic aorta replacement but the risks of neurological complications are a little more significant because of the corotids, etc.\n\nLet us know what you find out and what your experience is like, wishing you all the best! My boyfriend just had surgery to replace it as well as several other things. I wish I had more info but from what I understand they did not have to replace it when they saw it since it was not as damaged as initially thought. His recovery has included vocal chord paralysis (this was a complication), extreme leg swelling and feet blistering from being hooked up to the bypass machine and pneumonia. I wish I had more info but everyone is different and he is recovering well albeit in isolation because of Covid protocol.\n\nEdit:\n\nThey have a video of an aortic branch replacement on a Marfans patient on YouTube, it is graphic. Thanks for your response, and I wish both you and him well.  Could you please tell me more about the vocal chord paralysis? What has this meant for him and will he recover from that over time? Thank you - I certainly will. :-) These posts scare the sh\\*t out of me, being the father of a 13y/o Marfan patient.\n\nI thought these operations were often no longer needed due to the \"sleeve\" (do not know the correct English words for the procedure) method to fix the aorta. Is this something else?\n\nWhat is you age?\n\nI wish you well! Hi there, I am in my early 40\u2019s - totally get how scary it must be reading this, but I guess (and I should take my own advice here) medicine is improving all the time, so outcomes are often improving.\n\nI think the \u2018sleeve\u2019 you might be referring to is the dacron grafting which is fashioned to do the job of the aorta - it is a big surgery, no denying that - but the durability of the dacron synthetic anecdotally makes for a very reliable fix for one of the most dangerous aspects of Marfans.\n\nAlso, no two cases are the same - your son my well enjoy a life with minimal surgical intervention.  Wishing you the best. Thanks, you too.\n\nSo far so good with minimal (2.8mm) dilation and a normal life, still playing soccer at intermediate level. Takes Atenolol for his BP.\n\nHis main concern is his deformed chest (I spoke about that earlier on Reddit).\n\nThanks again. Well he is being monitored - that is fantastic!\nDoes he have a twisted sternum per chance?  I had a elective surgery for mine when I was 16, was always self-conscious of it! &gt;twisted sternum\n\nI had to search for an image that resembles his case best. He looks very similar to this. Not sure if it will get worse, he is in the middle of his teenage growth spert, 6ft now and (only) \\~46KG. He grew about 1cm/month the past year.\n\n ( I see, mine was not like that, but jutted out instead...ahhh yes, growing out of control, I remember that very well. I had the David 5, valve sparing, surgery in January. Boyfriend here! I had the operation 2 weeks ago where they \u201creplace transverse arch with branch graft and debranching, resection and replacement of ascending aortic aneurysm.\u201d \n\nUpon completing the surgery, I was taken to the ICU where I was intubated and sedated, and in critical but stable condition. There, they gave me overnight fluids and electrolytes. The vocal paralysis complication came after I was intubated. I had (and still do) a weak voice. \n\nI had to do some swallow evaluations/studies where they determined; \u201cThe patient presents with intact oral and mild pharyngeal dysphasia c/b flash penetration of thin liquids via straw and cup.\u201d \n\nENT was also consulted and found to have \u201cL vocal fold paralysis and pt will have ENT f/u as OP in 2/4 weeks with videostrobosopy.\u201d (Whatever that means.) \n\nAnyways, I am still recuperating at a physical rehabilitation center. I am 34 years old, and despite this being the biggest surgery I have had to date, I have felt better a lot faster than previous surgeries. That being said, having to take my pills by drinking thick liquids (so I do not choke) is kind of lame, as well as having a weak voice. Still, these are not long term issues. Many people assure me that my voice will eventually return in a few weeks, though you should definitely see an ENT. So glad you are on the mend! Thanks for sharing - really appreciate it! Take care! Did they not replace the arch previously with a graft as well? This is probably not exactly the advice you may want to hear and also the only worthwhile advice can come from your doctor since most people here are not qualified or legally supposed to give medical advice, BUT my opinion is that when you have the option to do a surgery for whatever serious chronic illness you are facing, it is better to take the risk and do it. This goes for Marfan\u2019s or any other very serious illness. The alternative is not really good. Of course, to get a truly educated and objective evaluation for whether to do some surgery or not comes from doctors who can see other known health risks from your medical history. \n\nApologies for adding those sentences about doctors knowing better. But it is also scary thinking that you may give someone advice not knowing what doctors know and the asker may get some unpleasant results if they just go by advice from someone online.", "Corrective Eye Surgery - Visian ICL I had a -15.5 and -14.5 prescription and I had Visian Implanted Contact Lenses put in. I tried to search for information about people with Marfan's using this as often we are not candidates for lasik or PRK. I know there is risks like increased risk of retinal detachment, due to higher eye pressure, but it actually went ok for me due to careful management by my surgeon.\n\nI had the toric (astigmatism correcting) lenses put in, and was told that rotation is rare. The lenses rotated in both of my eyes and I am assuming that it is because of how elastic my eyes are. Now I am considering replacing them with longer ones to reduce the ability for them to rotate, or having them removed all together.\n\nHas anyone else had this done?\n\nHow long ago did you have it done?  \nDid you have complications? So, I had IOL, and my vision was roughly the same as yours. The method which they stuck mine in was via gortex, which has been proven to be more stable for folx with connective tissue disorders/weak scleara. I had mind done at the end of 2017/beginning of 2018 (had to wait to make sure the eyes worked alright) I was not given an option for correcting my astigmatism, nor was I given the option for a multi-focal lens, so I am a fixed vision, regular IOL kind of person.\n\nI correct the astigmatism via very light glasses. Glasses so light they can *technically* be bought over the counter, but they do not typically fit my face and I need something for mid-distances as well since I work in tech and am staring at monitors in that middle-range where it just... is not great. Anyway, my glasses are at most a +3.50, trifocals where the farthest distance is null, middle and then near have their corresponding prescriptions.\n\nAside from a bit of connective tissue that was left in my eye after they sucked it out when my bio lenses were removed (and if they sucked any out when they placed the IOL's), I have had no problems of note. I guess my eyes are more sensitive now, they get fatigued easier, they are way more prone to being itchy, and they water way more often now. Otherwise? Totally fine and 10/10 would 100% do it again in a heartbeat. To be fair, however, I waited 22 years to get something permanent in place, but I still have had nothing but great experiences from it. I also waited until my eye surgeon told me that getting the IOLs would improve my quality of life to get them I had mine removed when i was 8, asked about permenant options when I was 18-19 (2006-7ish) was told they would require replacement within 10 years and would not really improve my QoL, then during a yearly check up at 26-7, my surgeon told me about goretex and that it would actually be a great option for me and that is all I needed. Within a month I had the first replaced and within 3 months I had both replaced, new glasses, and I can see ALL THE THINGS and its magnificent.\n\nUnless I need to look at my phone without my glasses up close cus them I am FUBAR'd but it is a small price to pay. So you had a biogical lens replacement then due to subluxation or something? The Visian ICL keeps the natural lens, and is basically a contact that slips between the cornea and the natural lense.\n\nThe reason that I went this way (and thankfully becasue of my complications) is it is revers able. I had my lenses removed and no lens implants and it was the best decision of my life.  \nI wear Proclear multifocal XR +15.5 and I can see nearly 20/20 for distance and near. However I do not have glasses, so if I cannot wear my contact lenses, I am blind. Yeah, basically. My bio lenses were removed when I was young due to severe dislocation, i went without anything except for high strength glasses/contacts until ~3-4 years ago. The way my IOL's are done, is that its more-or-less reversible insofar that should the structure of my sclera/eye deteriorate so much that its not feasible fore me to have the IOL's, they can be removed (likely the same way my bio ones were removed). There was not any hope for keeping my natural lenses, though, they were too far gone and the technology did not exist when I was that age (as though I am ancient at 32, ha!) Glad that you are doing better. It seems that most people with Marfan's that have had corrective surgery has taken the IOL path, but not the ICL path. I am 36, and luckily my biological lens in intact (for now). I have had 3.\n\nTwo in 2005 and one in 2013 (one of the lenses came loose).\n\nHave not had any issues since.  \n\n\n\nThis guy did the 2013 one, would highly recommend him.  The Dr that did the first two is retired Did you have the Toric? Did they have to go a size up for you? I wish I knew!  It was so long ago and I do not have any notes of it in my medical provider's app.", "I have been referred for testing for marfans but my gp said he thought I did not have it I am 16 (assigned female at birth) and I have known about marfans for about 3-4 years after I accidentally came across it when I was like 12 beacuse sometimes I had heart palptions and could hear my heart making a clicking sound. I did not mention anything at the time and brushed it off beacuse it kind of scared me, but I knew a lot of the symptoms matched me. I am tall, 6ft (granted my parents are tall), I have flat feet and struggled with a lot of pain as a kid till I got insoles, my feet are also really big like a uk 9/10. I had a huge overbite because of my small jaw that had to be corrected, and also the roof of my mouth had to be widened. My chest is slightly convex and I have often times near passed out when doing strenuous excerise. I had to have surgery on my toes cause they were curled over and my fingers are long and easily overlap around my wrist. Though the only issues I have had with my eyes is I am slightly short sighted but not enough for glasses.\n\nAnyway recently I have been going to the hospital a lot for pain in my abdomen and weight loss to have scans and such and on one of the visits I decided to finally ask if it was a possiblity. They did a few physical tests and asked some questions and said it was a possible and confirmed I was hyper mobile and refered me to a cardiologist, geneologist and optition. \n\nThen a few months later I booked an appointment at my gp since i also have issues with my legs getting painful when standing too long, and it was starting to become a problem. I was also starting to get quite a lot of pain around my joints and while manageable I thought I might as well also go for that aswell beacuse I wanted to know if there was anything I could do to help when it got bad or prevent it worsening in the future. I mentioned I was getting tested for marfans and that it might be related and I had some blood tests to rule out other conditions, which all came back negative. In the consultation my gp said he did not think I had marfans after only asking about if anyone in my family had it (which I do not think so but in 25% of cases I thought there was a random mutation) and the height of my parents (mum 5\u201d10 dad 6\u201d3), he didnt ask about my other symptoms. He then went on to say he thought I was just very anxious since I had also been in about a random pain in my side that is affected me over a year and a half now and has been accompanied by 18kg of weight loss. Then said that \u201cI am just a normal girl\u201d and \u201cI should not let this stop me from doing anything\u201d and that \u201cthis is when he would tell his daughter off for being too anxious\u201d. 1 how does having health issues make me not \u201cnormal\u201d?, 2 my pain is holding me back since I cant wait in a line for more then 5 minutes and my job oppunitys are a lot smaller and 3 I am not overly anxious I am just concerned and need to know if I have this condition since I have to make lifestyle choices and it will effect my potential children and I also wanted some advice on how to manage my pain. I did not say this as to the point as now however and he kept asking \u201cwhere my confidence went\u201d and this confused me more since I did not feel anxious and I did not feel my confidence changed but he kept saying that over again and that I was an \u201canxious girl\u201d, it could be my tics making me seem nervous but I was not.\n\nI am now just really confused, immediately I wanted to just cancel all my appointments and felt so stupid for even going to the doctor in the first place. I have not but now I am wondering if there is any real concern here or if I have been too anxious with my health. Do not cancel your appointments! Not a lot of doctors are knowledgeable on Marfan. My parents were told \u201ceverything is fine\u201d by quite a few doctors before I met a doctor who knew about Marfan and referred me to get tests comprehensively (like you have been). Turns out I have 14 of the 16 diagnostic criteria (I am part of the 25% mutation club). You are experiencing pain, heart problems, or other symptoms that can impede your quality of life, and with Marfan some of those symptoms can become deadly if they are not properly diagnosed and managed.\n\nYou deserve answers, and it is better to be safe than sorry. I am sorry your doctor treated you this way. A lot of AFAB chronically ill/disabled people experience the same thing from doctors (being told it is just anxiety, asserting you are fine without actually knowing, minimizing your concerns). Your concern is valid. Stay strong, I hope this whole process goes smoothly for you! Get the tests and appointments done. Maybe you are anxious, maybe you are right to be concerned. The genetic testing and cardiologist should help you either way.\n\nGPs are not necessarily familiar with every condition - not a knock against them, there is a ton of stuff to know. Go see the specialists. Thank you, that really helps a lot actually. Hopefully I get some answers on it, it would be great if I do not have it, but it is better to check, and if I do have it then that is how it is, it is better to know now then later on in life since I can prevent complications easier now. I wish if he did not know much on Marfans he did not say so definitely that he did not think I had it especially since I would already been referred on. Thanks again for the reassurance :) If one doctor says you might have it, but another says you probably do not, it is worth getting the tests to know for sure. It may be stressful, it may be time-consuming, but you health is worth it now so that you do not regret anything later.\n\nIf I went for a checkup with my GP, and he says \"you might have cancer\" (purely as a hypothetical example, I am not comparing Marfan's and cancer directly, so please do not read that from what I am saying) and another doctor I see between then and cancer tests says \"aaahhh, it is fine, it is probably not cancer,\" I am going to defer to the first doctor and find out for sure. Your health is worth worrying about now, that is perfectly normal, because with the proper knowledge and steps you will not have to worry about it later. Your right, it is best to be sure if I do or do not, especially since there is conflicting opinions. Thank you No problem. I had three separate doctors, including a cardiologist and geneticist who both specialized in Marfan syndrome, tell me that they did not think I had Marfan syndrome. At one point, the cardiologist even told me outright that I do not have it, not \u201cI think\u201d. But I had just enough aortic dilation to warrant a referral to the geneticist, and then just enough of the diagnostic criteria to warrant a blood test, and it came back positive for Marfans. It is definitely frustrating to have doctors doubt you like that, but I agree with the other responses that seeing the specialists and getting any necessary tests done will help you get peace of mind and/or treatment. Fortunately, the actual diagnostic criteria that determine if you should have genetic sequencing done are mostly objective, so even if you have skeptical doctors like mine, you should get the answers you need! Hope everything goes well (: Even if you do not have it - they could find something else. It is a really good idea to see a geneticist to have them check for any sort connective tissue mutations, and to see a cardiologist to have your heart checked (usually an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound of your heart) - and to see an eye expert to see if there is a problem with the lenses in your eyes. Cannot here to agree, and also that the anxiety comments are way out of bounds. Your GP should not be dismissing concerns you have about your body as anxiety. That is a classic modern use of \"hysteria\" and is completely inappropriate.\n\n Continue to get the marfan's test, and if it does not show something, than it does not show something, but it sounds like it is an appropriate test for you. Anxiety is a real and serious problem (unlike hysteria), and way more likely than marfan syndrome. To mirror what everyone else has already said, yes - absolutely continue on and get those tests. Even if you are anxious, you have enough physical signs/symptoms and another doctor felt you should be seen for further testing. That alone is enough.\n\nI am part of the 25% where my case was a spontaneous mutation. My mom and dad are both 6' and they both tested negative for what it is worth.\n\nBest of luck! Yes, anxiety is a real and serious issue.\nBut that does not mean that her general practitioner should dismiss her concerns as anxiety, especially when there are a, referrals in system by other doctors for diagnosis (at least in the US it is considered bad form to criticize another doctors reasoning) and b, when op is describing symptoms that can be a serious medical issue. \n\nThis gaslighting happens all the time, especially with women and POC. \nI worked in a nursing home for four years, and in a family medicine office for two. The number of times people with anxiety diagnoses were dismissed when they brought up their symptoms was seriously concerning, either resulting in delays of care resulting in more serious issues, or in years long continued mental health issues due to pain and undiagnosed conditions.\n\nBesides, an anxiety diagnosis was not the issue in this case-the issue was that op brought a medical complaint to her gp, who dismissed it as anxiety. The thing to remember is EVERYONE has different symptoms. I remember meeting someone at a conference who was under 6' tall and looked completely unaffected. After multiple hospital stays they finally got tested and cofirmed diagnosis. Get the tests. If you do not have it they may find something else. \n\nGood luck. Hoping for the best possible outcome! Doctors cant know everything about every syndrome or illness. Get tested Hi Desperate- I can imagine the anxiety you are going through\u2026it is REAL! Getting your testing done will ease that one way or another. Hopefully you do not have it and you are all good. Just remember either way you will continue on and live your best life. Stay positive! Trust me, my 15 yr old son just finished getting diagnosed, as tall and skinny! He had a few symptoms of Marfan but not enough to meet the criteria. He was seen by one of the best cardiologists specializing in connective tissue disorders at the U of Chicago, Dr Earing. My anxiety was through the roof at first while waiting for our appointment. Then I realized it was doing more harm than good. Stay positive, keep your mind occupied and not consumed by this. You will be fine. Bless you and bless all the folks here on this Reddit. Just reading the different experiences here has been very inspirational. Thank you. It has been really nice to see others storys and have that reassurance. I feel so much more confident now. Thank you for you kind works \u263a\ufe0f Of course \ud83d\ude0a Wish you nothing but the best young lady! You have a lot of the obvious signs definetly worth getting tested do not worry about what your gp said how they where talking was the same way all the doctors in the horror stories of spending a decade trying to get someone to test you talk like. Getting tested is a good idea and even if you do not have it that at lest narrows down what the issue is. Also i would look for a new gp since this one does not seem to be listening to your concerns regardless of the test results but that is just me :( what were they in the hospital for? I think it was multiple collapsed lungs, but it is been a while so I am not sure. Get tested! I have had it for40 years. You sometimes cannot tell just by looking at me.", "Reoperation i.e. additional open heart surgeries anyone? Anyone have to be re-operated on for open heart surgery? Was it easier to deal either physically or mentally the 2nd time around?  This covid shit is already stressful enough, trying to mentally prepare myself for the possibility of having my chest cut open again so soon after the first surgery is difficult. \n\nI had a root and valve replacement in Dec 2019 after an emergency dissection, recently went to another surgeon for a 2nd opinion on stenting and was told he thinks a redo of my initial surgery may be needed in addition to a TEVR stent, as there is a pseudo aneurysm and potential leak where the bentall procedure was done. I wish I had relevant answer, but both of my open heart surgeries were when I was 4 and 8, so aside from missing out on school, I do not remember being affected because big surgeries were my norm until I was in grade 6, so 10-12 (I was the youngest by a Longshot so I do not recall how old anybody is in the grades as they are). I have had my back opened up multiple times as well as having my eyes worked on within my memory that is a bit more relevant, and I would say those were easier because I knew what to expect as far as pain and the work I would need to put into things to get 'back on track' and also because they work your tuchas off while you are in there because being in a hospital for extended periods of time increases risk of infection, kills morale so you do not heal/gain strength as well, etc.\n\nBest of luck, hopefully you do not need surgery I had to have a valve replacement(sept2017) after my initial AAA repair(Nov2016)\n\nThe AAA repair went really long because my Superior vena cava was reversed, and they did not know that before opening me up. Also, I was about 2 months away from dissecting, sooo there is that. They were able to spare the valve though. \n\nHowever 5 days post op I had a stroke. So instead of doing cardiac rehab, I had to learn to walk and talk again. Therefore in the midst of hurricane Harvey, my valve failed. I found myself in Nashville,(where I grew up) needing another surgery.\n\nI spent a week in the hospital before my actual surgery, and was able to do a few things to prepare for it. My first surgery I was Intubated for 24 hours because I could not pass the breathing test, and I attributed that to the stress of not being able to see(wear glasses) and communicate. And I felt like the tube was choking me, so I was strapped down. \n\nI had one of my favorite podcasts queued up in order to keep me calm. And I told my mom to give me my glasses back since I could not see last time(joke was on me, because I still could not see) \n\nWhatever cocktail of drugs they gave me to put me to sleep was not fun in the wake up. I woke up before I was supposed to. Went back to sleep, then when I woke up for good, and they got my breathing tube out, I had super bad anxiety that I was dying. I started playing music to calm myself down, and that seemed to work. When they had to put a pacemaker In 5 days later, I told the doctor NOT to give me that same drug cocktail. \n\nMy recoveries were completely different. I spent the first one at a rehab hospital learning to walk and talk again, and the second one at my moms house. I did cardiac rehab the second time, but after I got back home to Houston.", "Worried about pregnancy Hello,\n\nI show some of the Marfan criteria and have worried about that a lot the last few months.\n\nI am not tall but have always been very slim, thin arms (problem of gaining muscles), quite long fingers, can do the Steinberg sign, narrow jaw and long face - I had a blocked nose as a child so I was a mouth-breather; maybe that is the reason for that, flat feet.\n\nI went to a specialist who checked my heart and aorta, both ultrasound and MRI came back clear (no changes in size compared to the ultrasound that was done 8 years ago). I got my eyes checked and they were fine - I am only slightly nearsighted.\n\nI \"only\" meet 4 of the Ghent criteria and therefore the specialist refused genetic testing (also no family history).\n\nI asked the specialist if it was okay for me to get pregnant like that and she said yes. I am worried because I might pass the illness on to my child even though I do not have any heart problems yet. I also worry that a pregnancy could make my symptoms worse.\n\nAs far as I understood I can have the genetic mutation without developing any heart problems but can still pass it on to a child. \n\nI know that I probably should not worry so much because even if I pass it on there is good medical treatment.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation? You have 3 options.\n\n-You can get IVF and select an embrio without the mutation\n-You can check after fertilisation and abort if the embrio has the mutation\n-you can roll the dice knowing that you will love the child either way and that with modern medicine and early intervention it is a low risk of affecting their life too much.\n\nThere is a risk having a child period. There are any number of complications or disabilities they could have, but the chance of these things happening is pretty low. Thank you for your response. The last paragraph is very true and my partner thinks exactly like that.\n\nI live in a country where embrio selection is highly restricted and if I cannot even get a genetic test myself because I do not fulfill enough criteria I highly doubt that is an option. \n\nI think what bothers me the most is that I never got a definite answer for myself. Some random doctor brought up the topic when I was 30 (nobody had ever mentioned anything about Marfan before). I of course saw experts and got tests done but that state of not knowing exactly is very bad. Yeah, it is. I do not know if I am lucky to have always known but I think not knowing or finding out really late might be worse", "Contacts Hello, was wondering if anyone have contacts that suit their prescriptions. They cannot give my eye prescription on my glasses because my left is like -10.0 and my right is -20.0 the difference is too big so they just set both lense to -10 -10. I was also told the place did not offer strong enough contacts for me and my doctor has not got back to me yet. Would love to know if there is a place I can get them. Thanks It might be difficult to get that prescription. I just check Ed Clearly and they show -20 as \u201cmade to order\u201d. What about wearing contacts and glasses.\n\nMy contact is a +18 if that helps. Yeah, I wear that combo too but not that often since it honestly seems like a hassle having reading glasses kn hand. Where did you get yours? Thru my optometrist in NZ I got mine from a contact lenses filter who works w my optometrist and my eyes are like -14 and -17 but somehow the contacts are both -12 and that works so perf, so its likely there are strengths that will work with you too! The brand of lenses is called ALcon Dailies Total 1. Hope this helps !! I used to have hard contacts and had to stop wearing them after detached retina surgery. I now wear soft contacts and there is only one brand that I can use (HydraVue). If you live in an area where you can find someone who specializes in low vision, I would recommend that. I am -10 and -16 so not quite as extreme, but still.", "Anybody gain muscle/weight? I know it is not safe for the heart to workout but I know some of us have and have been successful, how did that turn out? Do you look more proportional? Are your legs bigger? Ask your doctor about strength training. Eat the correct amount of protein, fats, and carbs. It takes a while but it is possible. I am 6\u20194\u201d and 200lbs. Gained about 40lbs in 6 years I am using ayurvedic medicine which has helped me gain weight within couple of months if you want I can courier you that medicine from India \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3 Absolutely agree , pretty much hop on a diet like your training but train really lightly , just repetitive and consistently I exercise three times a week, without issues. I have a fysiotherapist tho. I have only ever successfully gained muscle in my legs but I have gained weight by eating a lot just like anyone else. As I have gotten older I did have to seek treatment for a few other marf related issues that made me lose weight(dislocated jaw that made chewing painful, nausea related to dural ectasia that lasted most of the day...).\n\nIf you cannot gain weight you are not eating enough, and this is especially true if you are still growing. People with MFS are not immune to physics.  This gives so much hope. You have no idea. I have been 6'1\" and fluctuating between 125-130 lbs. since HS. I am 25 now. Right on man, I am 31 so I was about your age when I started picking up weight Dude that is so awesome to know. You have shed some light on an aspect of my life that has otherwise been pretty bleak! So thank you! Do you find its improved your quality of life? It did though my change in physique was a byproduct of strength training for my career. Learning some fashion techniques that compliment your body type and good old fashioned self confidence goes a long way. Totally agree! I am undoubtably starting to become more self confident although some days are better than others. Seeing your reflection and being reminded that you are not as big as you may feel nor can do much about it gets to me. What is your career if you do not mind me asking?", "Just Got Back From The Medical Geneticist / What I Wish I Would Have Known Prior To Visit    I began to believe I had Marfan's Syndrome back in December of 2017. I went to a cardiologist, had an ECG(Echocardiogram) and a stress test performed. Both tests came back \"stone cold perfect\". I am a 22yo male. Just about 30mins ago I was in Dr. Paldeep Atwal's office where we discussed the features of a Marfan's patient among other related topics.\n\n   We did a few tests and I was found positive for about 6-8 of the physical features. However, because my ECG was normal months prior, and my eye sight is 20/20(as far as I can tell), he would not diagnose me with Marfan's. I have a High palate, slightly sucken eyes, slightly recessed jaw and chin, the wrist and thumb test were positive (meaning I have longer than normal fingers), and my lower body to height ratio was .87 where as a normal ratio is 1. However, the lower body ratio was .6 - .7 points away from being positive, so technically I was in the clear on that specific test.\n\n   He agreed that I appear to have Marfan's on the surface, but obviously do not have any of the health side effects associated with Marfan's Syndrome. We talked about his studies -\n\n(  )\n\n - as well as some intricacies surrounding diagnosis of Marfan's Syndrome. Given my age(22), no aortic dialation, and no eye sight problems, he strongly believes that I do not have Marfan's. He alluded to the fact that I may be on the spectrum, but to no severe or life threatening degree. He mentioned that if I wanted to, I could have the Fibrillin1 Gene tested, but stated that it was just an option for clarity, and by no means a necessity. I declined.\n\n   I want people to know that roughly 2/3rds of patients with Marfan's Syndrome exihbit aortic dialation by the time they are 19 years of age. If you are a bit older, as in your 20s or 30s+, and you have no eyesight issues(near sightedness or other), no aortic dialation, but have obvious signs of Marfan's(regarding bone structure), you may not be in too much trouble. However, I must add that it is still possible to develop Marfan related health issues later in life, and that seeing a Dr is important to verify your condition. Nothing I have read explains this online, which is more than likely due to information being misconstrued, potentially producing false hope.\n\n   People must understand that it is possible to have the exact appearance of a person with Marfan's Syndrome, but not have it to a degree that would necessitate annual ECGs and other Dr visits. If you believe you may have Marfan's Syndrome, in my personal opinion, you should find a cardiologist near you that has experience with Marfan's patients, but if not, a regular cardiologist will suffice. You should ask to get an ECG done alongside a stress test. Marfan's Syndrome is one hell of a scary disorder, and my heart goes out to the lives affected by it. As far as looks go, I am right there with you guys! Hell, I am not 100% in the clear myself, as far as aortic aneurysms and eye issues go. \n\n   There is no telling what the future holds, but as of now I will try to forget about Marfan's Syndrome and move on with life as usual. For those fighting Marfan's, or those helping family members through their fight with it, stay strong. There is a lot of ground breaking work being done by professionals like Dr. Paldeep Atwal(whom tested me earlier), and others alike. There is hope for the future of Marfan's patients and one day, it will be curable. \n Ehhh I guess it can be scary, I have always known I had it as I was diagnosed at 3, my mother and eldest brother have it, it skipped the middle and I am the youngest.\n\nMy aorta started dialation around the age of 15 or 16, I constantly forget to take my heart neds but at the end of the day my echo, ecg, and cat scan come back good each year, 1-2mm of dialation a year which is expected. My only fear is loosing my vision but I know I can roll a joint ftom start to finish with ny eyes closed and can get music going and audio books so it woukdnt be that bad. Lol. Very nice. You seem to take it very well. Imo Marfan's is frightening. Do not forget to take your beta blockers, man. Can you lift weights or is that out of the picture? Stay safe and smoke up! The link is no good, can you post another? I am very interested.  It works now. Not all studies are Marfan related. Thanks! Thanks for sharing, this is interesting. I clicked on the link, which redirected me to a list of about 40 studies written or co-written by your doctor. I could not find the one you referenced with a quick look. But I will go through them all. Some look intriguing. \n     I am 40 years old and was diagnosed with Marfan Syndrome in September 2017 by genetic testing. What prompted the testing was a 5.4 centimeter ascending aortic aneurysm that was discovered by an echocardiogram. I had the echo because I was having a lot of syncopal episodes and they were often followed by an extremely low heart rate.       \n     After they discovered that enlargement it all happened so quickly. I fainted on a Thursday and by that Sunday I was being transported to another hospital in a larger city to have open heart surgery. I met the geneticist as I was recovering in the hospital. She was not able to give me a full look over and measure me because I could not move around too much. But based on health history they were certain I had Marfan\u2019s and sent blood away to be studied to confirm. A few months later it did confirm. \n     The odd part of this is that as a child I was extremely skinny. By 5th grade I was taller than my mom and wore a woman\u2019s size 10 shoe. By graduation I was taller than my dad but was no longer super skinny, but not overweight.\n    During childhood I had many doctor visits for my 1. Flat feet/fallen arches 2. Extremely poor eyesight/ nearsightedness. 3. very narrow and high arched palate and crowded mouth. Not a single doctor or specialist mentioned Marfan Syndrome. Therefore I never had any heart monitoring or tests. \n     Anyway, I never really experienced any other symptoms (expect for the few listed above that were treated with special insoles, thick glasses, and an orthodontic mouth appliance) UNTIL the discovery of the heart issue. At age 39!\n     My parents did not believe the diagnosis at first because they said I am \u201ctoo big to be someone with Marfan Syndrome.\u201d I am tall and, after my new found love for papa johns and beer in college, I packed on a lot of weight. Even after I gave up the pizza (for the most part) and the beer (completely) I never lost the weight. So for more than half my life I have been overweight. And as an adult obesity has been my only physical medical issue until the more recent diagnosis. \n     Also, nobody in my family has Marfan Syndrome. Genetics are weird. I am eager to read more studies. \nPs- \nThe fainting episodes that led to the discovery of Marfan syndrome continued after the surgery. It turns out I was not \u201cfainting\u201d I was actually having seizures. I was diagnosed after I actually had a focal seizure during an eeg. My diagnosis for this also came way too late in life despite years of symptoms. But that is an entirely different story.\nAnyway, I feel lucky to even be alive. So I guess I cannot complain. :) \n\n\n  &gt; 39!\n\n39! = 2.0397882081197447e+46\n\n Wow, I am glad you got it all figured out! Do you have an idea of when the dialation may have begun in your life? I will search for the study when I get off of work. I still have a small fear in the back of my mind that I could eventually have dialation later in life or potentially eye problems. If they did occur later in life than I would assume that I definitely have Marfan's too a further extent than I believe I have at the moment. Also, what we are other symptoms that you had growing up and around my age(22)? As I said, I am not 100% in the clear. The only thing separating me from a positive diagnosis would be the health problems. The only thing I can think of is my poor vision. But that is easily corrected and lots of people have poor vision. \nI always had stretch marks in odd places. That started at 12 or 13 when I was still thin. They seemed to appear overnight. Then, around 23 I got a lot of stretch marks on my stomach. By that time I had already acquired a little gut (ugh) but no stretch marks had ever appeared. Then, like when I was younger, they just seemed to come over night. I was not pregnant and I had not gained any weight recently, I was already carrying that baggage. \nI was in a bad accident about 9 years ago that landed me in the ER. They did some tests, one of which I think was an eeg that my current surgeon was able to compare with the new tests. He said there was nothing really alarming in the first tests. So this happened in less than a decade.  \nI do not know if I am some sort of freak. Like I said, I did not inherit this, it is just a genetic mutation. \nBut I was also not really good at pursuing the best medical care possible. I did not get second opinions. I never asked questions. I do not think I ever experienced respect from a doctor until last summer. So make sure your doctors are advocates for you and your health.  Will do. Family members and friends assumed I was crazy when I kept telling them I believe I have Marfan's, but then I go to the medical geneticist and he completely agrees that I look like I have it(muscle skeletal wise). Maybe I should get the FBN1 mutation test done. Other than being extremely lanky and long, I do not have any other symptoms. I do not know whether to proceed life with caution or to live like I do not have it. May i ask how did you start believing you had Marfan? I was having some serious palpitations that ended up being anxiety. Probably caused by drinking coffee and caffeine everyday. I also saw a post on 4chan about Marfan's. So I looked it up and saw that I seemed to fit the description. I have long arms, legs, tall, big hands/long fingers etc... sorry this is not aimed at you but other users that could be going trough the same.\nAre you hypochondriac?\n(nothing bad it is a manifestation of anxiety as many others, i have night terrors for example)  Yes, I have to admit, to a degree I am. When I have minor symptoms of something I look into the possibilities of what it could be, and usually, I come to the conclusion that it is the worst case scenario and call up a specialist for an exam. As far as Marfan's goes, I have the obvious skeletal features. Glad you asked though. I am getting help for the hypochondriac thing soon, probably an SSRI. Man, and i thought i wasnt eating enough. I am only 15 and 1 week away from GCSEs. Even though that is around the corner I am still quite concerned about marfan syndrome since it only affects the males in my family especially with heart problems. My cousin when he was born needed procedures because If i remember his heart valves or tubes were in the wrong places. Now that I am more aware of it I will definitely get the checkups. When I checked out the lists of traits and signs I have most of them:tall with a skinny frame, got this weird pectus carinatum, flat feet, long fingers, somewhat of eye dilation and already 6ft with a light birth weight of 3.1kg. Even if I dont live for long or have a very fulfilling and a good and long life I hope that there will be a cure for it. Sometimes I wonder if i should not probably have a child in the future because of this syndrome that i do not want to pass on to the next generations. There are plenty of surgeries that can easily extend the life of a Marfan's patient into late adulthood, ie. 70+. I would not worry about dying or anything crazy if I were you. I would do exactly what you said and get checked up. Worst case scenario they catch your aorta in the act of dilation and will be able to operate on it if need be. I would get on it though. Search for a good cardiologist near you and get an echocardiogram done. Hi there, I am interested in what you have to say but I have adhd, can I trouble you for a tl;dr?  Thought I had it. I do not have it, which was confirmed by an ECG and a geneticist. People may appear to have it, but may not. Ah yeah of course! Doctors thought that I looked like I had it until I was 26 then had a genetic test and turned out to have it. \nI am glad you do not have it XD I did not get a genetic test. They just assume I do not have it. The cardiologist and geneticist. I do not know 100%, but since I do not have any aortic dialation as of now, I will just continue to live normal and maybe get a test in the near future. My experience would say that is a wise thing to do. I would still be without a diagnosis and likely in a lot of trouble in a few years, had I not had the test. \nGood luck anywho!  What symptoms did you have, related to Marfan's, before your diagnosis and throughout your life? Eye problems, aortic dialation, etc...? Nearsightedness with an astigmatism;\nConvex chest.\nNot tall (182cm/5'11\") but very thin. I have a bmi of \"go eat something please\".\nLong fingers.\n\n\nLater on when I saw somebody who had dealt a lot with families who have the syndrome, he showed me other signs.\nLonger legs relative to chest size; longer arm span than height; slight scoliosis and apparently some facial features associated.\n\nI find this point interesting because this doctor is in Australia and my family are from the UK. Incidentally the gene is completely different too. I ask because all I have is long limbs, tall, facial features, and fingers. Nothing else. Perfect sight, straight spine, normal chest/ribs, etc... I believe that is why they did not rule it in. I have crowded teeth, high palate, narrow long face in general, wingspan, lower body ratio, etc... Interesting. How is you are aorta? When did the dialation start, if ever? Oh high palate was never checked until the geneticist, yeah. \nSo the aorta is OK, there appears to be some signs of dilation to 250mm but this is in the past 5 years or so. Valves are unreasonably good compared to anybody in the family at this age. How is treatment going? Are you only taking beta blockers and avoiding strenuous activity? How is life now compared to before the diagnosis? How did it make you feel?", "Are you able to play instruments with Marfan Syndrome? Have you, with marfan are able to play a instrument successfully?\nBack in high school I could not complete gutair class because I did not have significant enough finger dexterity to where it was very difficult to move my finger to each string. It was to the point where sometimes I would have to use another finger to move it to the correct spot. I also have horrible back pain when sitting upright so I cannot maintain a correct posture for long. I have been trying exercises for so long but I feel like it is futile to go against my skeletal anatomy. I did want to learn that instrument but it seems I physically cannot. All of my limbs will hurt eventually not being in a natural position, so I am not sure about wind instrument either. I have not been able to explore others yet, but many of them also seem like they will go the same way due to the way my fingers move, bones stabbing the back of my back thus eliminating proper posture, and maybe even my asthma like-symptoms from my pectus excavatum. I played saxophone all through middle and high school and into college. My dad has Marfans and has played guitar and drums all his life.   I have it and played Clarinet in school.   I hope you can find something that works.  Music is great therapy. Not personally, however my dad plays guitar and fife, and my uncle plays fiddle and guitar.  They can also both half ass play mandolin,  banjo,  and button accordion.  \n\nMaybe start with a cheap recorder? Nothing to press, just covering different holes while you blow. You are genetically built to pay guitar and piano. Embrace it as an advantage. I play piano. After tons of comments about having piano fingers I started when I was a kid. I have played trombone all throughout middle school and even in my high school career I continue to play.  My brother who has marfans as well played trumpet all throught middle school, high school, and onto college.  It should not be a problem if you continue to work on it.  Biologically we have an advantage to play piano and guitar, our hands are built for it.  As for posture that is still something I do not have down.  Slowly I have gotten better with it though.  Something that helped me is that if I am the tallest in the room, there is no excuse for me to be shorter then everyone when sitting down.  Finger dexterity is something you have to practice, I have built mine up through playing my instrument and doing card tricks.  Practice makes perfect after all", "Is viagra safe if you have Marfans? ", "I spoke with my doctor to get checked Hi.\n\nI spoke with my doctor today and said I wanted to be tested. She said in 2-3 weeks I could. She told me not to worry much. But said that my parents should check my arm length and body high. She said if my arms are shorter then my high. Then it is 100% NOT Marfans. My stepdad checked and said it was kind of equal to my high +/- Are arms much longer then body when you have Marfans. Or can it be 1-2 cm longer without problems?\n\nI need advice before I go check myself :) I have a marfan habitus- whether it is marfans or Eds I am unsure, but the height to armspan ratio would usually have to be over 1.05  mine was 1.054. I am not sure if it guarantees you it is not marfans but I would say it is at least a good sign. Can you do the hand signs (steinberg and walker?) and do you have joint hypermobility? ( search beighton score) No it does not mean you have Marfan or not - the most important factor is whether your aorta is larger than it should be for your age and whether you have problems with your eyes for example a retina detachment. Go to the Marfan Foundation website at marfan.org for correct information on obtaining a diagnosis. I can do the finger signs and I have kind of hyper mobility in my joints I do not think any of us can tell you for sure. But it is only my wrists. I do not s have hyper mobility in my legs? \u201cJoints\u201d does mean knees and shit right? Yep, so if it is only your wrists that is good sign. Did you get the height ratio? My ratio is like 1.012526373  and when I say wrists I mean my fingers as well. I can do the finger things. My elbows I can almost put the completely down (stretched) ", "Could I have Marfans based on these symptoms? ", "Marfans Chances? I know the only way I can know for sure is through a geneticist but I would like some input from people familiar with Marfans syndrome.\n\nMy parents are 5\u20197 and 5\u201910 the latter being my dad. No family history of marfans \n\nI am a 17 year old male around 5\u201911 - 6 with a wingspan a little longer than my height maybe an inch or so and I weight 130 pounds. I have a terrible diet. I have very skinny wrists and arms, the wrist sign is positive. My thumb does not cross the edge of my palm unless I force it to. My fingers are pretty long but I think they match the size of my palm. My palate is pretty high arched and my teeth were crowded before I got braces.i have stretch marks on one of my shoulders but I used to go to the gym and I do not know whether this is marfans or just from the gym. I do not have joint pains, angled tendons on my feet, any diagnosed heart or lung problems, flat feet or chest deformities. I think my fingers are pretty flexible though.\n\nPretty much all my life I have been very active in sports and stuff. I have done a lot of running and intense physical activity such as weight lifting and long sessions of basketball and Have not noticed anything wrong with my heart.\n\nIs it likely I have marfans?\n\nCan one with marfans do intense physical activities such as I have do not without noticing any effects?\n\nI am just really scared and anxious and I want as much closure I can get. Am I being overly anxious or is there serious cause for concern \nThank you for any responses Sounds like you are just lanky, mate. Mild cases can engage in strenuous activity without noticing problems.  That said,  if you are concerned you need to talk to a doctor.  As the Mayor said above,  you are probably just lanky. Is there a thresh hold of shoulder width that most people diagnosed have? seeing a cardiologist who is experienced with Marfan and getting an Echo or cat scan is the best first step to know where you stand.", "\ud83d\ude10  ? Just showing the aftermath of my feet reconstruction surgery", "Anyone with Marfan's have immune issues? Is there anyone with Marfan's that has frequent infections (like sinus infections)? I have really bad nasal allergies all year around which for a while did cause a lot of recurring sinus infections. I have not had an issue in about year though approximately since I started using an air purifier and making sure I use my allergy spray more regularly (along with Zyrtec every morning). That being said I have always thought I get the sinus issues from my dad who also had sinus problems, not my mom who is the one that I got the Marfan\u2019s from (and herself had no allergies/immune problems). I am in a similar situation \u2014 I take allergy meds (singulair) and nasal spray (dymista) all year round. Even with that I still get an infection or two each winter. And they never go away without antibiotics. I have not tried an air purifier though! Cheers to going a year without a sinus infection! Have you ever had your immunoglobulin A levels checked? Mine is below the normal range. I do t get sinus infections often... But I do think I might have immune issues. I get little rashes on my skin that seem to be allergic reactions, but I cannot determine what I am allergic to.  Seems like I am allergic to air! I have been doing some googling and it seems that sinus and ear infections can be part of Marfan\u2019s because of issues with the shape of the skeleton like deviated septum. The British Marfan\u2019s org has info about ENT issues on their site! Maybe we do not all have separate sinus issues!", "Should I freak out? Hey everyone,\nI am 29yrs, female and I have been to the doctor quite a lot lately because of breathing trouble, chest pain and sudden dizziness. I ve been told that I had a panic/anxiety disorder and they ve been running a bunch of ekgs without anything suspicious. They basically said that it is all in my head. Then I heard about Marfan syndrome (I have a sunken chest and thought my breathing trouble might have to do with it) and found out I have a lot of symptoms: 179cm tall, slim, very long arms, legs and fingers, can do the hand around wrist thing, and when I do the first I can see my thumb but only on the left hand, stretch marks, hyper mobile. I mentioned it to my doctor and he kind of joked about it, as if I was crazy but gave me an appointment at a cardiologist, but first mid January. Now I am freaking out whenever I feel something in my chest or stomach, avoid physical activity, and have generally gotten extremely tense in my body because of the fear, that my aorta will erupt before I have the doctors appointment. I am really effected by all doctors saying I am a Hypochonder, which might be true, but ofc that does not protect me from actually getting sick. What do you guys think I should do? I can hardly function normal in my job (I am a teacher) because I get so overly alert of my body. Should I go to the ER or just wait for my appointment and try to keep my cool?\nI live in Denmark, sorry for mistakes! If you are really worried, you should be able to get an ultrasound echo cardiogram done easily. It is a very simple non invasive test that can give you a fairly accurate measurement for your aorta and can buy you peace of mind. Does anyone in your family share similar symptoms? Marfans can be inherited or occur from a genetic mutation. There are many symptoms that cause discomfort (scoliosis, flat feet, etc), but the big concerns are the hidden symptoms like enlarged aorta. What makes Marfans so dangerous is that in  people with Marfans, the aorta can become enlarged rapidly, so there are different guidelines in measuring it. An enlarged aorta in a Marfans patient is not the same measurement as one in an average person. Chances are the ER would not look as closely as a cardiologist. However, if you are concerned, go to the ER. Marfans can be very dangerous if left untreated.  The thing about reading up on Marfan's online is that everything tends to focus on the most extreme cases. Which makes sense - they are the most dramatic and dangerous. \n\nHowever, even if you have Marfan's **it is not a death sentence**. Many of us live fairly normal lives that do not require more medical intervention than other people. Relax, wait for your appointment. If you are worried then about strenuous activity.  And it is important to realize that if you have do marfans,  you did not just \"catch\" it.  You need genetic testing to get an official  diagnosis.  But so long as you stay on top of it,  a previously undiagnosed case (like yours) should be very manageable. Thanks for the response!My mother is as tall as me, but all in all more \u201ccurvy\u201d, which does not make her features look so crazy long as mine. She has no stretch marks or chest abnormities either. She just had something with her heart which is related to a lifetime of smoking, but there was nothing wrong with her aorta. My father is shorter than both of us, he has hypermobile joints and also stretch marks, and was very skinny as a young man. In a way I hope symptoms are just because I am a mix of their body types, but none of them has the chest deformities. \n\nI should maybe mention that I had my heart checked when I was 18 (11years ago) and everything was fine (that is when my anxiety problems started. they checked me then with ultrasound and X-ray). But I guess that does not mean anything since it is so long ago, or would they have seen aorta anomalies then? I was not checked for marfan specifically. Some years later my lungs where checked after a lung infection and everything was in order.\nI do not know if I have scorlioses, cannot remember ever being checked for that, but I ve never had back problems if that is an indicator. No flat feet either, but I have had problems with ligaments in my knee and ancle, after a ski accident as a teenager.\nI ve never had eye problems, and I do not think I have typical facial features. Maybe a bit high forehead but both my parents have that, but I have quite dominant cheekbones, and a little gap between my front teeth, and I could even get my wisdom teeth, because the dentist thought it would push my teeth together and their by straighten them.\n\nSorry for writing all this random information but it helps me calm down somehow...\n Could they do that in ER? I live in a small town and the next \u201creal\u201d hospital is an hour away. When I called the emergency doctor (in Denmark there is a doctor you call before calling 911 that tells you what to do, like, if you re unsure if you have an emergency or not) he said even if I came to the hospital, there would not be a cardiologist late at night, but I felt he did not take me seriously, and kind of thought there should be someone there knowing how to use ultrasound..\nAnyway, thanks for your answer :) No worries! Half of my family has Marfans, luckily I do not, but there has never been a question as to who has it in my family because of all the symptoms and physical indicators. Is your arm span bigger than your height? If so, that is a pretty good sign that it could be Marfans. If not, you may be ok. Your symptoms do not seem to point to Marfans, but that is just my opinion! When I was born, my family immediately looked at my feet and knew I did not have Marfans! Still get your heart checked out as a precaution, but I would not stress too much about it!  I am not sure how it would work in Denmark, but in India we have these private labs/test centers that I could walk into and ask for an echo. Hospitals have the facility too, but in that case I would need to go through a cardiologist.\nI would imagine that the place that did your EKG would also have the echo equipment. But you should probably check during working hours :) Just wait for your cardiologisit, if for you the anxiety is too much, just take the train to the nearest city to get a private eco doppler (cardiac ultrasound) of your aorta, probably it is as cheap as here in Italy, under 100\u20ac, way less than the therapy to confront all that anxiety.\n\nRegardless, if all doctors have told you that you are hypochondriac and the Eco doppler is negative, i advice you to confront the hypochondria problem.\n\nSaying this with my father being slightly hypochondriac. The marfan(LDS to be specific) diagnosis was the worst just because of this. Not because of the heart (stable aorta for year by now) since he has an \"excuse\" for all his imaginary diseases that makes his life and mine (as caregiver, he has MCI that will lead to Alzheimer) a living hell of psychosomatization (I am also highly psychosomatic, and aware of it so i know where his symptoms come from). Thanks to everyone for your answers. I ended up freaking out when I got dizzy again calling 911, and being driven by the ambulance to the next bigger hospital. I told them about my fear of marfan, and they measured irregularities in my pulse. They took a ct of my aorta which luckily turned out out fine, which relieved me for a couple of days until I felt dizzy and generally weak again. I really try to stay calm, but now I have had numbness in my hands and legs a couple of time, yesterday the left side of my face went completely numb as if I had been to the dentist, it only lasted 2mon max, and I was laying in a weird position so maybe it was just that? I got quite afraid from it though, and really nervous that it will come back. I am supposed to get an echo of my heart done, but now the appointment it first in March (!). I feel so stupid being constantly afraid of something happening. Are those serious symptoms I should get checked at once, like a heart mistake, or is this just typical for stress and anxiety? I am supposed to get more tests done to rule out marfan, but the cardiologist in the hospital told me not to worry, because my aorta was completely normal. I feel so silly writing here again, because I can see myself that I sound pretty anxiety drivin,  it i am getting desperate and do not trust my body anymore :( Whatever your connective tissue status, you clearly are suffering from anxiety, even if you have sound reasons to worry. That anxiety will only get worse over time - you really must seek support in managing this. Do not let yourself support the anxiety, do not make excuses for it or avoid the issue - it is, without question, far from healthy to be constantly aware and afraid of of your breathing, heartbeat, and associated possible health conditions.\n\nWhether or not you have a connective tissue disorder, anxiety will harm you, significantly. Anyone with long-term anxiety is under constant *physical* stress that can impact cardiac health, among many other things. If you *did* have a health problem influencing your heart, anxiety will make it worse.\n\nYes, get checked, but you may or may not have a physical/cardiac/connective health problem. You *definitely* have an anxiety problem, judging by the information provided, so you should *definitely* seek therapeutic support. For your sake, for the sake of loved ones, for the sake of your students.\n", "Posture I was doing the walkout today for climate change and my upper back and shoulders started to get sore and painful. I know 100% that my posture is terrible, but is there a way to fix posture with marfans or are we stuck with the weirdly shaped backs? If you have scoliosis like a lot of us marfies it is likely due to that. Yeah I have had metal rods in my back for years but honestly if you get some of those bungee bands and exercise in a certain position it can \u201cmaybe\u201d make it better    There is definitely a way. My rounded shoulders and forward head posture I managed to fix. I always thought it was all skeletal, but not necessarily. Lately I am doing a lot of stretching and strength exercises, and my posture has never been greater. My next steps are getting rid of protruding left rib cage and lateral pelvic tilt. Major insecurities I always thought I could not help.   You can buy posture correcting braces that can help. What exercises and stretches are you doing for forward head and rounded shoulders? Chin tucks are godly for forward head posture, look it up on Google or YouTube. For rounded shoulders I for example do this one: \n\nMuch information on Google and YouTube.  Chin tucks are godly for forward head posture, look it up on Google or YouTube. For rounded shoulders I for example do this one: \n\nMuch information on Google and YouTube.  Posture can be improved.  I would recommend a posture brace to wear when sitting for long periods and walking. Yoga can help as well:\n\n\n Scoliosis makes it hard to find proper posture that does not hurt. My physical therapist used kinesio taping to help me out. It keeps everything in a position that does not leave my muscles fighting my curvature. My spine curves to the left in my thoracic spine so my shoulders are always uneven and everything gets bunched up and painful.  The tape stays on for days too. ", "Constant coffee intake? Hey everyone again, I am asking if anyone takes another stimulant constantly, this time, Coffee.  \nAs a graduate student, I constantly take coffee and I was wondering if anyone else is like me? Have you suffered any adverse effects bc of this? I am the same way, but I think it has to do with my ADHD. My meds make me mentally awake but physically tired and to be productive I am usually in taking caffeine I am not a huge coffee drinker. My cardiologist said I can have 2 cups a day. But you know, that can vary depending on your situation. Mild case of Marfan\u2019s, 2-3 cups a day with no issues; talk to your cardiologist if you have any concerns (and listen to what they have to say). No adverse effects (so far) other than my cardiologist chastising me for how much I consume. \n\nNote-I do not have high blood pressure and a very low heart rate (bradycardia) so coffee does not make me feel jittery or raise my heart rate. \n\nAnd I know it is bad for me, but I just love coffee so much and I could be doing worse things. Because of the heart issues, I drink coffee daily but it is the \u201cSwiss water method\u201d kind of coffee. 99-% caffeine free. I was so sensitive even decaf made my heart skip. I love it. I am pretty sure my bodies makeup is like 75% caffeine between coffee, soda, and energy drinks. My cardiologist has only ever waggled their finger at me for how much sugar is in some of them, otherwise they say to just pay attention to what my body is doing otherwise (shaking, vision problems, etc) did you have your aneurysm surgically repaired? I did. After surgery my doctors wanted my blood pressure as low as possible so I am on Losartan and a second beta blocker. I rarely drink coffee now and only decaf. how big was your aorta? I am 4.2 as of my last echo and scared of surgery..scared of a problem without surgery. I have naturally low blood pressure. First aortic replacement was when I was a kid. I believe they wanted to do surgery at 5 cm. In one month I went from 4.5 cm to 6 cm. So they planned the surgery much quicker. I was 10 so I am foggy on the details. The aneurysm I had dissected randomly without warning along the thoracic aorta after over exerting myself. I had a ct the month before and there was no sign anything was wrong. This goes back to how I said I am on the more severe end of the marfans syndrome scale. Do not be afraid of surgery. It is such a common procedure now I think most surgeons could do it in their sleep. When I was a kid and had my first surgery I was in ICU for a week. A couple years ago when I had the aneurysm and went to emergency surgery I was in the ICU for one day and sent home the next. I could walk I could drive. You will be sore but if you get enough rest and let yourself heal you will be fine. so you had a dissection after the first surgery? I am looking at the PEARS surgery if it becomes neccesary. Yes I did. I had no clue they was even possible untill it happened. I have read good things about PEARS.  I had something similar done to repair my thoracic aorta tear. Definitely better to customize the fit. Since I had my aortic root done as a kid I have grown out of it slightly and it might need to be replaced at some point down the line. I cannot believe you went home after surgery 24 hours? I am reading about PEARS which is supposed to be easier and I see people feeling quite shitty for a couple days and saying in hospital for at least 5. Idk exactly how PEARS is done. If it is like open heart surgery I can see that requiring a week in the hospital. My emergency aortic repair was done invasively which is a lot easier to come back from. what do you mean yours was done invasively? Minimally invasive surgery. It is when smaller cuts are used to perform surgery. So instead of cutting open my chest they cut into my femeral artery and inserted tiny robot arms all the way up into my chest and fixed my aorta that way. Ying yang. I get pressure headaches related to dural ectasia. Caffeine is hugely helpful. If I try to go without it gets ugly. Haha thought it was a Caffeine addiction  a few years back so I tapered myself off everything. Soda, coffee...all of it. After almost 2 months I thought my head was going to burst. I finally spoke to a doctor who explained how, bizzarely, Caffeine is used to treat pressure headaches. \n\nYour need might be based on something else.", "questions on sports and food restrictions for aorta dilation Hi, in my ultrasound scan my cardiologist told me that I have aorta dilation. After consulting medical personnels, I was told that I have a good probability of Marfan\u2019s, which would be further tested in my upcoming eye test (for ectopia lentis).\n\n\n\nFor me, I am more concerned about my aorta enlargement than if I have marfans or not, because from my understanding aorta dilation is the most severe condition a person with marfans could have.\n\n\n\nTherefore, I have a few questions on sports and food restrictions to prevent my heart condition from worsening : \n- Alcohol - yay or nay?\n- I would be serving the military : what types of physical activities should I avoid?\n- I jog at a moderate intensity, do sit-ups and pushups on a daily basis. Would this put too much strain on my heart and possibly worsen my condition? \n- What other lifestyle changes could I make to maintain my heart\u2019s condition and prevent further dilation?\n\n\nThank you !! I do not think serving in the military is a good idea with an aneurysm...\n\nOverall, light cardiovascular exercise is fine. As a rule, never get to the point where you cannot hold a conversation while exercising. Try not to do any sudden sprint or stop'n go either. It is better to start slowly so there is no sudden jump in blood pressure. You can do moderate hiking or jogging, just keep it low intensity.\n\nYou absolutely **cannot** do isometric exercises according to my doc and most scientific paper I have read. That includes pushups and sit-ups. Weight training is a no, unless you are using really small weights, and even then I would not really risk it. Overall, my doctor gave me this rule : never lift something that you would have trouble lifting if it was double its weight. This can include stuff like grocery bags if they are too full, for example. You also need to exhale while straining, never hold your breath and strain because it can up your blood pressure really fast.\n\nYou can drink and eat whatever you want, but like for anyone else, drink in moderation. Coffee is fine if it is 1-2 cups/day, but do not get in the habit of drinking Red bulls all the time.\n\nSource : got an aneurysm and met the cardiovascular surgeon last week. Thanks for the detailed reply! I will start to be mindful about the things you mentioned in my daily life. It is reassuring to hear that someone is in the same boat but sucks for both of us :( \n\nWith regards to isometric exercises, did your surgeon tell you that sit-ups and pushups are isometric? Because after some digging around online, it appears that they are isotonic not isometric... \n\nMilitary is compulsory in my country rip... I have informed them of the situation and they assigned me easier roles, I will think I will request to be exempted from strenuous and intense exercises.\n\n Oh yeah, sorry, pushups and situps are isotonic ! My bad ! :)\n\nI remember my surgeon saying not to do pushups though, because it is pretty intense weight training anyway. The Marfan org produced a document with a good summary of what you can and cannot do at ( This might be long winded but I will do my best to make it concise. I am not a doctor, however I worked in the medical field and after suffering a spontaneous aortic dissection that killed me, I have done a lot of research on the issue. \n\nMarfan Syndrome is a connective tissue disorder. It affects the connective tissue of the body and makes it extra \u201cstretchy\u201d or \u201cpliable\u201d. The spot where your aorta comes out of your heart is essentially held together with this connective tissue. \n\nWhen there is any strenuous activity, the body reacts by pumping more blood...which is obviously driven by the heart. Because your body is working harder, it requires more oxygen and blood flow. The heart will pump harder and faster to accommodate the need however, the highway (I will call it that just cuz I cannot think of another term to call it at the moment) out of the heart (the aorta), also expands (dilates) to allow for the increase blood flow because of the increase in pressure the heart is exhibiting. In a normal person, once activity is calmed down and the body is at rest, this highway will shrink back down to normal size. In someone with Marfan\u2019s, this highway does not have the ability to shrink back down because the connective tissue is \u201cextra stretchy\u201d. Think of it like an elastic band that is normal size, but over time of stretching it....it does not have the ability to go back to its original state. That is essentially what happens to the aorta in a person with Marfan Syndrome. \n\nThere is not any way to avoid dilation. I do not know if a sedentary life would prevent dilation, but that is no quality of life for someone who wants to be in the military. My advice to you would be to monitor it. Preventative care is the best care. They can monitor the dilation on a yearly basis and perform a valve replacement before you reach dire circumstances. \n\nWhen I had a spontaneous dissection, I did not know I had Marfan Syndrome. It was not until after the fact that we pursued an answer as to why it happened to me. Once I got my diagnosis, I tested my daughter, who also has it. \n\nShe has seen a pediatric cardiologist who is relatively knowledgeable with Marfans. He put her on a blood pressure medication when she was 8. He told me that if we can keep her blood pressure down, then hopefully it can help slow or halt any aortic dilation. Like I mentioned, the aorta expands when the pressure increases to accommodate physical activity. If your baseline blood pressure is lower than normal to begin with (with the help of a blood pressure lowering medication) then any subsequent physical activity will minimize any \u201cstretching\u201d of that connective tissue hence, reducing risk of dilation.  Her cardiologist also told me that some research have also shown that not only have ACE inhibitors (a class of blood pressure med) helped reduce the risk of dilation, there have actually been cases where the aortic root has shrunk instead of dilated. \n\nAs for answers to what you asked, I do not know if alcohol has any impact on it. Diet for that matter. Obviously you want to keep your heart healthy so maintain a heart healthy diet. \n\nDo not know if the military would be an option with that medical condition. Dissection can be spontaneous and is almost always fatal, in my case, I died but was brought back to life. I was not a super physically active person. I did normal mom things. My work outs consisted of walks with the dogs and kids. I also never experienced high blood pressure in my life. \n\nBe your own advocate. Do not stop until you are satisfied with a care plan. This diagnosis definitely is not the most ideal, however it is manageable as long as you educate yourself and stay proactive. \n\nLike I mentioned, I am not a doctor but I have done a hell of a lot of research on this. I am currently listed for a heart transplant because of how much damage my heart sustained during my dissection. So I like to consider myself knowledgeable about the heart and this disorder. Im more than willing to offer any and all advice. \n\nGood luck!!! When were you diagnosed? I am 26, have been struggling with finding a diagnosis my entire life, but my echo cane back negative for dilation last time I had it done (22).  I was diagnosed after I pursued all avenues trying to find a reason why I had a spontaneous aortic dissection at the age of 30. I was somewhat already familiar with the genetic condition, because I had worked in the medical field prior to my medical catastrophe. \n\nI was told, by my geneticist, that just because you have a genetic condition, does not mean you are going to exhibit all of the symptoms associated with it. I, however, just happen to check practically all the boxes for symptoms of Marfan. My daughter, on the other hand, has yet to exhibit any of the symptoms (with the exception of being really really tall for her age...5\u20195 at age 10) But that could also be attributed to the fact that her dad is 6\u201910 (he does not have Marfans...he is just tall).\n\nThe only way to completely rule out or get any kind of definitive diagnosis would be to get the genetic testing done. Marfans does not run in my family and I do not have the typical \u201cMarfans look\u201d. I am tall for a girl I guess, 5\u20198. And I have long legs but I am of average build and my limbs are not disproportionate to my height.  &gt;  but my echo cane back negative for dilation last time I had it done (22). \n\nUmm one Eco does not give definitive answer. You will need series of Eco over a period of time for test results to confirm if there is a aorta dilation. Only time Eco test will give a definitive answer is when you have a serious dilation. Many times radiologist will call the results normal, but when compared with past reports, it may or may not be a dilation.        Is your Aorata dilation is in abdominal or throadic region? I have had 7or 8 echoes from when I was around 12 to my last one at 22, and none showed dilation. I am just concerned because I have not had one in 4 years and I am 26 now.  Aorta does not have a fix size, but it has a range, any number within that range is considered to be normal. If I remember correctly, upper range for a male is 3.7 cm. Did the cardiologist compare the eco reports side by side? Its only then one can tell if aorta is dilating. Dilation may not develop on its own unless they are triggered by something like stressful exercises over a period of time.  I am not sure. I know I was recommended to him because my GP suspected Marfans, so he judged my echo under that pretense. I saw him 5 or 6 more times after that, and every time he said my aorta appeared to be normal. This was over a ten-year span.  If you were going to cardio just to check dilation, then he must have checked it. Why not get eco done now, just to be on the safer side?\n\nIn my country people get a copy of their medical reports, is it same for you too? ", "Vaccine side effects you experienced?

During almost exactly two years ago (May 2015) i had a joint in my leg dislocate while playing ping pong (Not exactly an extreme sport!) i am 6'5 tall (6'3 or so at the time) and my mom got a time at the hospital to check for marfans because of the joint problem. The first thing the doctor said when he saw me was something along the lines of \"I have seen many people with marfans, and you do not look like them\" so its pretty clear he was decided from the start. Anyhow; we meassured my wingspan (it was 3' longer than i was tall i believe), and he also concluded i was hyperflexiable (But so is my dad and both grandparents on that side). I got a time to check eyes and my heart. Nothing wrong with my lenses or eyes in general and also was told i had one of the better hearts she would seen. I had no weird spine, nothing wrong with my ribcage and only very slightly flatfooted. At this point my doctor was almost certain there was nothing wrong with me but to be sure he ordered a genetics test and that also showed nothing, so he concluded there was no way i had marfans since the only requirement i fulfilled was longer arms, hyperflexiablity and flatfootedness. I quickly forgot about it, but a couple of weeks ago someone commented on my wingspan when we compared and it got me worried again, should I be worried? Also worth nothing i have no male relative under 6'2 so its not like my tallness came unexpected\n\n If your genetics test was negative, you do not have Marfans. That would be the gold standard for diagnosis. \n\nTry to not focus on it so much and enjoy life :). It is easy to whip yourself into anxiety, but not worth it in the long run.  The problems that you have are not uncommon. Chill out, kiddo. You have had your genes tested, they came up negative. There is literally no other way you can have marfan.  The major danger of mafan is weakness in the major arteris and dislocated lenses. If you do not have those problems nothing to worry. Plus as was said above, the genetic test was negative.  Do not stress, think positive.", "Cataracts ", "Do you have to be hypermobile/ double jointed to have Marfan Syndrome? I recently learned that there is history of Marfan Syndrome in my family. A while ago my doctor was concerned because she thought I had traits of some type of genetic disorder, but my parent lied and told her there was no family history. I found out afterwards that was a lie and my parent did not think I had it, so I was never tested. Recently I discovered that it is Marfan Syndrome and I do not know if this is something I should get checked as an adult or if I am just over reacting. The two main things holding me back are that I am average height (5'5 female) and am not hypermobile. I would describe myself as the opposite of flexible (cannot bend back at a 90 degree angle, touch my toes, etc.). I have read that being hypermobile is a common trait so I was wondering if it is even possible for me to have it (maybe I just got some of the \"looks\"?). I would appreciate some insight. Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask. What made the doctor concerned? I am underweight for my height (98 pounds) and my limbs are longer, I have \"spider fingers\", uneven ribs, my spine curves more (front to back), very crowded teeth with a narrow and high arch mouth. I can do the wrist and thumb sign easily if that means anything. Not sure if this is a symptom but I do have slight \"knock knees\". My face is a bit longer and I have an underdeveloped lower jaw, not sure if that matters but I have seen those things mentioned before.\n\nAlso, my mom has a very similar build to me and I do not think she was ever tested. She is much taller though and I know that she has spine and joint problems. It might be worth getting referred to a genetic counselor to get tested. If that is negative and your heart is fine then I would just keep on living life how you were before. Get genetic testing for the trait, the best thing they can do is say you do not have it but if you do, it is not the end of the world. It is treatable and you can most definitely live with it. Speaking from experience, best of luck to you and I hope you get some answers! I think I will try to do that. Thanks for the advice. Thank you! I really appreciate the advice.

I have been ignored by doctors before. I work in healthcare but I still get nervous when I am talking about a diagnosis that I do not work with. \n\nHelp. Thanks.  If you want to get checked out, you can start by seeing a cardiologist and ask for an ECG(Echocardiogram). Tell him/her your concern.  My little brother is only 5'8\" and he is chubby. People put *way* too much emphasis on the tall, thin profile.  Marfan syndrome is autosomal dominant meaning the gene is not recessive and does not lay \"dormant\". If you have inherited it, you would have to have a parent who has the gene. \n\n My mom has not had genetic testing, so I do not know if she has it.  It is definitely easier to test if there is a positive genetic test in one of the parents. \n\nThat being said, genetic mutations happen. I was one.  I grew up with a lady who,  like yourself is not very tall (5'4) and she definitely has it. If you suspect it, push for an echocardiogram asap, also have your eyes examined.  There are several connective tissue disorders.

I had all mine out inmy 20's IIRC, but I do not actually have a Marfans diagnosis.   Had mine out 25 years ago, give or take a few. They were growing in wonky and had to be cut out, but as I did not have my diagnosis yet, there were no special precautions taken. The procedure and recovery went smooth as glass though.  The standard used to be antibiotics prophylactically for any oral surgery, because there is a higher chance of bacteria getting to the heart via the bloodstream, because mitral valve prolapse, or the aortic valve. \n\nI have since heard that is no longer required, but someone less lazy than I will have to research that to be sure.

When I was 17 I was all set and in the chair at my orthodontist office preparing to get braces the summer before college. I have pretty crowded and \"messed up\" teeth and although I was super nervous to go into college with braces, I was happy at the idea of having normal teeth for once. I am all set with the little bib on and a Morgan Freeman narrated movie on when my orthodontist rushes in and I guess he had just looked at my medical history for the first time??? He tells me he refuses to give me braces due to my heart condition (MVP in addition to my Marfan's) since he does not want to be liable. He kept beating around the bush and not flat out saying that until my dad just asked \"are you refusing to give my daughter braces?\" And the guy finally just said \"Yes.\" And we left and I never got braces (we could not get it worked out before college and then we did not have the funds in later years). Now I am 23 and my teeth are one of my biggest insecurities but I have heard from so many people that dental procedures are not nearly as dangerous for heart patients as they used to be. I will admit - I have not been to the dentist in far too long, but I do not think it is required to take those huge antibiotics anymore like I did as a kid. What. The actual. Shit.\n\nYou had an ignorant orthodontist, straight up, and you need to find better dental providers. Here is the rundown:\n\nThe fear is that of an infection traveling from the gums to the heart, because if the MVP issue (I have it too). However, that is only relevant for surgical or borderline surgical procedures. I do not even see how orthodontics would be relevant, they are not drilling teeth or cutting into the gums or anything. \n\nSeriously, I am sorry you were put off like that by an idiot, because homechicken was completely fucking ignorant and talking out of his ass. He should have his license pulled on account of clearly having no idea what he is talking about. \n\nFor the record, I had braces for years when I was younger. Even had permanent teeth pulled for it (I only have 4 bicuspids, not 8). That was WAY before I was diagnosed Marfans, so no precautions were taken, even with the extractions. Hell, just remembered, I had a weird extra tooth grow in the roof of my mouth, behind my normal row of teeth. Had that sucker extracted too, no extra precautions. \n\nThe risk is apparently a non-zero number, but it is incredibly rare though. To have an infection travel would be an outlier, not the norm.\n\nIn any case, as you seem to know, the only extra precaution taken is a large dose of antibiotics prophylactically. And if that is done, the risk is essentially zero. There is no real risk of \"liability\", that guy was a fucking idiot.\n\nBut in the last several years or so, I have actually heard that the risk is SO low, that the prophylactic antibiotics are no longer a hard and fast rule. Look, I have shitty teeth, had bad habits when I was younger. Even given that, I have had dental cleanings, cavities filled, etc, with no antibiotics. Because the risk just is not really there. Honestly, I have always felt it was theoretical. To my knowledge, there was not a rash of heart infections to start that standard.\n\nJust wow. So sorry you went through that. My advice? Find a new doc, and consult about getting your teeth sorted out, so you do not have to be insecure. Believe me, I feel you. I used to not smile ever, and if I laughed I covered my mouth with my hand. My shit looked THAT bad. \n\nGood luck, and again... fucking wow. I definitely would love to get braces and have my teeth sorted out one day it I doubt that is going to be possible for me any time in the near future :/ We happened to have the money that year due to a small inheritance and it is 6 years later and not something I can afford even with my parents' help. I really appreciate you taking the time to write back to me! It was so frustrating and I am pretty sure I cried about it for a while back when it happened. It was just so shocking to flat out be turned away while I was sitting there with the bib on in the chair.\n\nAnd yeah, ugh, I have one tooth that juts out and one that juts backwards.

", "Experiences with retinal detachment? Hello everyone, I was told by my ophthalmologist that I had lattice Petting in my eye that could lead to retina detatchment. I wanted to ask you guys for your experiences with this, whether it you had a surgery to prevent it or if you had it and lost your vision or what happened? \n\nThanks. I believe he could have said \"Lattice Pattern\" or \"Lattice degeneration\" \n\nFrom Wikipedia: 'Lattice degeneration is a disease of the human eye wherein the peripheral retina becomes atrophic in a lattice pattern and may develop tears, breaks, or holes, which may further progress to retinal detachment. It is an important cause of retinal detachment in young myopic individuals. The cause is unknown, but pathology reveals inadequate blood flow resulting in ischemia and fibrosis'  \n\n\nBasically it is a warning sign that your retina may develop tears in the future, tears can also progress into retinal detachment.\n\nI have never had this, but I always recommend that people trust their Doctors advice, especially if it is an ophthalmologist. I have had two detachments, a macular pucker, and multiple laser treatments after the fact.\n\nJust remember the signs of the detachment:\n\n1. New floaters - I had a LOT for the first one, all of a sudden. The second one, in the other eye, started with a the vitreus detaching which was a different sort of floater.\n2. Black/dark spot(s) in your vision\n3. Lots of flashes all of a sudden\n4. A dark curtain or snow coming over your vision\n\nA retinal detachment is an emergency that requires fixing within a few days. If you have these signs see a doctor immediately.\n\nMeanwhile, have regular checkups with a retina doc. They can do laser treatments (in the office, super easy) to pin any parts that look suspect. Damn that is a lot. How is your vision now? Better actually! They removed my lenses which helped things and the vitrectomies removed my floaters. I am glad you are better now. May I ask how old are u and when did your detatchments happened? Let me clarify: I only have one good eye. It got better. My other eye got worse. I noticed black around my outside vision, went to sleep, woke up the next morning and it was way worse. Went to the hospital, had emergency surgery to correct the detachment. Ended up having 5 total surgeries, each a couple months apart, because they could not get it to reattach! They tried (and failed) at the gas bubble method many times and finally it was the oil method that worked. \n\nMy vision now, 6 years later is basically non existent in that eye. I technically can see 20-200 in that eye but it is very dark with lots of splotches/floaters. My other eye is 20-40 with correction, never had a retinal detachment, just vitreous detachments. My brain has learned to ignore it and I just use my other eye for sight. When I concentrate on it, i have double vision. I have had retinal detachments in my left eye and basically cannot see anything in it anymore. I have had two vitreous detachments in my right eye in the last year and i am scared to death of having a retinal detachment and losing my vision. I hope that does not happen. I would also be terrified to go blind. Yes. I did not get told about lattice degeneration.  I just had a detachment.  You can read about it in my post history. We you able to get quick help? I am fortunate to live near a really good eye hospital. I am sorry you had to go through this. \u2764\ufe0f I have experienced retinal detachment in both eyes \u2013 both when I was around 10-12 years old (I am now 50). I lost vision in my left eye (it was later removed, so I wear a prosthesis), and have had stable vision in my right eye since 1984. My retina is scarred, and my FoV is fairly narrow. yes! i live near Emory and was able to get emergency surgery fairly fast however I originally waited a whole day before seeking care plus my retina was particularly stubborn and it took them 5 total surgeries to repair it which further led to vision lost Same. Had retinal detachment in right eye but doc says it has gotten \"auto-attach\" so surgery is not required and it may even be dangerous to do surgery because my central vision is okay. I can see from this eye but it looks like looking through water - hazy and straight lines looks short and curved. \n\nMy second eye is fine but still at risk due to high myopia. When I focus I have double vision otherwise it seems okay-ish. Focusing on screens makes the whole thing more apparent. \n\nThinking about future put me into depression sometimes. What future holds for people like us? Thank you for telling your story. I am in 20s, my right eye has detachment but it has gotten stable as doc says (no surgery though, it is been about years since then) my second eye myopic but healthy. I wonder if I would go completely blind very soon. It has been almost a year since I have had surgery for lens dislocation. Initially, that was the problem I have had for years, my right eye being monitored for lens dislocation ever since I was diagnosed. My vision was the clearest it has ever been in my life after the surgery.\n\n2-3 weeks after my surgery, I have experienced gradual loss of sight, like a shadow curtain covering 2/3rds of my vision. Went to the doctor again 2 days after experiencing it, I was diagnosed with retinal detachment, with the macula being teared as well. The surgery was successful in repairing the retina, but now my eye has Glaucoma, I would need to take eye drops everyday. Even then, my vision was not as clear when I had my 1st surgery, because of the macula being teared off, that leaves permanent damage.", "Worried about my girlfriend Hi guys.

This is why I need to be able to justify bugging her and her parents to do so. Is it necessary? l know this is against the rules and if a moderator takes me down, i totally understand.

She is 6\u20190 and she has long arms and legs and even longer fingers. So i asked her to tuck her thumb under and she showed positive for the Steinberg sign.

Being 19, it is possible for you and her to control your own medical affairs, and I hope that is feasible given your circumstances. Unfortunately it is not. She is in America on a green card so being emancipated could screw up her immigrant status, so she is kind of stuck listening to what her parents say. \nI spoke to her tonight about it and we are going to to figure out a way for her to see a doctor.

It is a short term fix but the hot water and extra buoyancy really relieves pressure on  the joints and it feels amazing. Especially if I have had an active day.

On the plus side, they did not last too long, as I was finished growing by age 15 or 16, I recently had pains like this in my calves, I played tennis during these growing pains, so my legs constantly hurt.  I tried icy hot and stuff like advil but it never worked for me.  This probably will not sound like the best advice, but I had to just deal with the pain and wait it out until it stopped, which was pretty much this entire previous spring. If it is the knees she can rest at points and take pressure of the joint.  If that is sortof not viable in her mind, possible try a compression support.  \n\nI did cadets and long marches were hell but this helped lessen the knee swelling and pain.

Thank you for clarifying more, but it is not just the fact that I am skinny &amp; have poor posture, the long fingers, small wrists and long arms is what is worrying me, it seems everybody with the syndrome has those same hands, wrists and arms. I really hope I am being stupid and I am sorry if I am because the last thing I wanted to do was be someone who totally did not have it at all and post in a place dedicated with people suffering with it. You are repeating yourself - anxiety! Please, please look into it and check it! I am telling you personally, I have been treated for and have had nasty anxiety before. You DO NOT have Marfans - even if you did, it is not deadly LOL. I had major heart surgery 2 years and I am still kicking around. \n\nYou are fine. It is fine. Find your center, or something.  I do have problems with anxiety, and you telling me I do not have it has made me feel a whole lot better, but if I could ask you one more thing. Why are you so sure that I do not have it? Because I know anxiety. The echocardiogram you had for one time chest pain is telling. I have also been involved in the Marfans community in various ways for a long time and I can tell you, its quite obvious to me when someone has Marfans. \n\nWe have skinny people with anxiety here and in other Marfans communities a ton - not to insult you, but I have seen this play out before. \n\nFriend - you. Are. FINE. Seriously. Stop worrying yourself.  I hope you are right, thank you for replying though. You made me feel better. Not to scare the shit out of you but if you are concerned, go see a doctor. Do you get tired easily? Do you yawn often during the day? Do you have scoliosis? Do you have siblings with the same \u201csymptoms\u201d?\n\nI am 5\u201911 and 180 lbs and I have it. 180.0 lbs \u2248 81.6 kilograms ^(1 pound \u2248 0.45kg)\n\n\n\n^(I am a bot. Downvote to remove.) \n\n_____\n\n  ^| ^( ^| ^( ^| ^( ^| ^( ^| ^( ^| I think I will at some stage, I would say I get tired easily because I do not do that much exercise, but if I am not doing exercise, not really. I do not yawn often. I do not know if I have scoliosis but I think I have lordosis as my back is arched and have had poor posture for a while. I do not have any siblings and nobody in my family has Marfans or any of the symptoms.  Okay I actually think you are fine. But if you want to be 100% stress free then get it checked I hope I am fine, honestly I am scared to even get it checked out in case I really do have it. Lanky and skinny is not the only symptom to go off for marfans. I had a hard time being diagnosed because my doctors were ignorant and were way too invested in that symptom.\n\nI am fat and small and I am diagnosed. I have nearly every other symptom except being skinny/tall. Apologies but I have a hard time catering to your anxiety because I too have anxiety and weird thoughts pop into my head all the time. I have learned to ignore them.\n\nIn the past, I convinced myself I had an STD that did not exist. In hindsight it was extreme anxiety, and the only way it stops is if you get treatment for it. Consider going on meds for 6 months - a year or so, they help to break your anxiety cycle and you can learn to ignore the thoughts.\n\n**You DO NOT have marfans.**\n\nI know you are not going to listen. I know how your mind works. The least you CAN do, however, is get treatment for your anxiety, and at least bring this up with your doctor because they will tell you exactly the same things r/Marfans has told you. It is stupid to not go to the doc because you are \u201cscared\u201d you have something you likely do not.\n\nEven if on the non-existent chance you do have it, it is treatable, but only if you interact with your doctor. I totally understand your frustrations, I do have anxiety about many things, but convincing myself of a disorder that I do not have is a first for me. This is not a routine thing where I have moved onto the next disorder to worry about. This i something I am genuinely concerned about. Although I have learned that the symptoms mean very little because people can have them &amp; not have Marfans, it is hard to shake the thought simply because I match so many of them. I will see a doctor at some stage though  I would like to point out that you simply do not fit \u201cso many\u201d symptoms. \n\nMarfan syndrome is a connective tissue disorder. That literally means the bendy glue between your joints, and your organs, is extra bendy. Essentially we are like jello. Think about how hard it is to keep jello still while walking with it on a plate. All that extra energy put into moving around is exhausting, sometimes painful as we often do not function correctly because of our jello joints.\n\nYou report no flexibility, no joint pains, no looseness, no heart problems, no eye problems (astigmatism, short sightedness), no extreme fatigue, etc. Just think about it.\n\nIt is possible you have not yet been health anxious before, but it does not mean that these worries you are having are true. This is the separation you need to make; it is the first step to combating your anxiety, and not just about marfans. Just because a thought is in your mind does not make it true.\n\nPractice mindfulness, go to your doctor, ask questions. I hope you get the answers you are looking for. \u2764\ufe0f Thank you, I do plan to see a doctor. How common is flexibility among Marfans? Yeah I have no flexibility, no chest or heart pain, no eye problems. I do not do much exercise at all, mostly a lot of sitting. The only thing I can think is that I get back or neck pain when I am exercising on the rare occasion. I have always put that down to mostly my posture being bad and lack of exercise. As the symptoms of bad posture include such minor pains.  They test your flexibility, your eyes, and your ratios (arm to height length ratio), from what I can remember. If you fit 2/3 they suspect you could have marfan\u2019s, and would consider testing for it (but like I said - they were still hesitant for me!). So yes, I would say that flexibility is one of the defining factors.\n\nPain after infrequent exercise is common among the general population, especially for someone like you with bad posture who sits a lot.\n\nIt just so happens that people who have marfans can sometimes be super lanky coupled with their other symptoms. Disproportionate long limbs is a symptom with or without tallness BUT not the only symptom, it has to be coupled with other symptoms such as pain and dislocations/flexibility.\n\nIf you have no other symptoms; you are just a thin person with long limbs. They do exist without marfans! ;-) If they did that test on me, I guess I would score 1/3. Just the long arms and hands. Funnily enough I do not think my legs are very long, it is just my arms that seem to have a greater ratio compared to my height. How severe is yours? If they were still hesitant to test you, you must have it pretty mild no? Hypothetically could someone get 2/3 or let us say 3/3 and still come back negative after testing? Thank you for your help by the way, you have made me feel a lot better and more educated about this. Mild? I would say yes and no. I would argue his hesitation to test me is his ignorance because I am not tall and thin. He was very dismissive of me, but it is not entirely his fault. When marfans was first discovered a lot of the textbook cases were super lanky people, but it is simply not true that it is the only tell-tale sign of Marfan syndrome.\n\nI have evidence of all the other symptoms in my body. Extreme short sightedness and astigmatism, flexibility, flat feet, high palate, autonomic disorder, extreme fatigue, pain, weak joints, long limbs. Etc. Enough to affect my day to day life? Absolutely. Enough to not function at all? No. I am lucky that I do not have major heart problems, yet, which may still come in the future.\n\nHypothetically: I do not know. The 3 point system is a means of them weighing up the likelihood of a person having it. If a person has all 3/3 yet comes back negative.. good for them, no? It means they do not have the disorder they tested for. If someone has 1/3, or none, with no obvious symptoms of it affecting their day-to-day life nor any health risk factors (such as heart problems), then I would argue it is extremely benign with very little risk if they did happen to have the disorder in question. So why would you even worry? Why are you so afraid? How old were you when you got diagnosed &amp; how old are you now? I looked up autonomic disorder and it says something about dizziness or fainting when standing up as a symptom, rarely when I stand up fast my vision goes a little black for a few seconds, I put that down to sitting down too much &amp; the rest of the symptoms do not really apply to me other than sweating. I would not be very afraid if I had it, but just the physical problems that I already have. But the thought of having to be on medication and having all kinds of surgeries on my eyes and heart makes me afraid. Normal people especially young people get dizzy when they stand up too fast. One can have an autonomic disorder (common btw) without having marfans. You might even simply have low blood pressure, it is not that deep. My boyfriend gets dizzy and can momentarily lose vision when he stands up too quick. Ask any of your friends. Very common.\n\nMy mum has it so I was always on the radar and was monitored. Had many symptoms when I was younger. Officially diagnosed when I was 17(?) although was pretty sure I had it prior. 21 now. Ah you got it from a parent. Thanks again for all your help, I really do appreciate it. You have made me feel a whole lot better &amp; I really hope I do not have it. I just find it interesting because of how anxious and paranoid this was making me, I am suddenly hyper aware of every sensation in my body. I am imagining pain that I never noticed before, the mind is a strange thing, I will see a GP at some stage, when I build up the courage just to be sure. Honestly your GP will kindly tell you the same things I have told you. In reality you need to get treatment for your anxiety.\n\nThis is why I have spent a lot of time replying to you. I really emphasise with those exact feelings you are having. I convinced myself I had diseases and suddenly noticed everything in my body. It is just your mind and body being in anxiety mode.\n\nThe take home from this whole discussion is that you need to start treating your anxiety rather than feeding it. Take care x Yeah you are probably right, take care &amp; I wish you good health. /u/seaasintheocean can you explain more about the yawning often that you mentioned? Always been an issue for me but never looked into it apart from assuming it is due to sleep apnea Yeah, I yawn often during the day because of reduced lung capacity due to pectus excavatum. The body constantly needs more oxygen hence the yawning. Do you happen to have pectus excavatum as well? Please do. I have been diagnosed with reduced lung capacity and weak lungs but not pectus exavatum. Although I do appear to have a minor case of it. I will ask my geneticist when I go back next.  I think those diagnoses might be the reasons why you are yawning, but ask and let me know as well! I am no expert haha No. Tall and thin people are extremely common. People with marfan syndrome and no genetic history are not. If the visible symptoms are possibly attributed to your poor posture, then I would not take those as Marfans symptoms. If you had an echocardiogram done on your heart when you had those chest pains, they probably would have noticed abnormal aortic dilation - if they did not, that is another good sign, as it is typically found by that age. My mom's Marfans was actually diagnosed by her eye doctor - have you ever been diagnosed with dislocated lenses?\n\nIf you are still concerned, I would schedule a new echocardiogram, but it sounds like you are okay. I do not think I had a echocardiogram done, I think it was more of a heart beat kind of monitor. I do not recall it having a screen showing my heart like I see after looking on google. I have not been to an optician in nearly 4 years, everything was fine apart from them saying I was slightly long sighted and reading glasses might be something I would benefit from. I have not noticed any drastic changes in my vision. Short answer is no. If you are really worried though go have another echo and they will tell you if your aorta is growing or enlarged.  Do not listen to the haters, you probably have it.", "20 M undiagnosed Marfan's Update Hello, I made a post a month ago about having undiagnosed Marfan's. As of today, I have officially been diagnosed with Marfan's syndrome. I was skeptical, and I did not think I presented enough of the features. My question now, does Marfan's get worse over time? I am not asking for medical advice, but specifically from individual experience. Thanks for any information you can provide regarding my question or things I should look out for.", "Absolutely Horrified I am a ~6'1-6'2 22 year old male. A couple years ago, I would say when I was about 16-17 (I do not exactly remember), I went to have a checkup on my heart due to some issues I had with an eating disorder, and we wanted to of course check if anything went wrong. Despite already being thin due to crap nutrition, my pediatrician and cardiologists at the time brought up the possibility of coincidental Marfan Syndrome. It was quite confusing at the time because I displayed some, but not all signs. What I have:\n* Generally quite lanky. It is not *too* bad, I could get away with just being a tall and thin guy with maybe a haunch of long arms, maybe a basketball player build, but you would still think at least something was wrong because of thinness proportions (again, tricky because of past ed). My height is 6'1-6'2 and my winspan is around 6'4-6'6. My forearms and tibia just kind of seem to go a *tad bit* longer than you would expect\n* Somewhat hyper-mobile finger joints. I can do the finger swan, wrap my fingers around my forearms, bend some back, but not all and not to the text-book case degree. I have the long fingers.\n\n* Mild pectus excavatum\n\n* Stretch Marks. I was also a little chubby, more pudgy really, as a kid, and I think a few came from that, but most of it is height related from a really quick growth spurt. I was always one of the taller ones at school throughout the years, though some periods I would stall and then later catch up. I was a late bloomer in puberty, and the other pubertal changes also hit like a bus.\n\nThe specialists, however, said not to worry at the time because I did not display all the features, and what I did display was not as extreme as many others that they knew had it. What I do not have:\n* Any eye issues whatsoever. \n* Heart issues from what they could tell years ago. No blood pressure issues either, though due to my current bad anxiety I measured today and got a reading of 134/69 which I think is higher than normal, but I do not check it regularly. At least no doctors brought something up when I went to a checkup. I do have othostatic hypotention (aka \"getting up to fast\"), but I usually attributed it to anemia and I honestly do not know how orthostatic hypotension plays into this.\n* Flexibility everywhere. Fingers and parts of my arm are basically where the lame party tricks end, everywhere else I am quite stiff. Cannot touch toes, certainly no leg behind back of head, etc.\n* Marfan feet. I have big feet (size 13), but I have a high arch (which I liked for running of course) and my toes seem pretty proportionate and no issues whatsoever. No hammer toes etc.\n* Low stamina or energy. I can outlast anyone in terms of distance running, and I only suck at types of sports that involve things things I never trained for, like soccer with quick bursts of omni directional motion, but even then I am not bad. I also recognize this is not much help though because even athletes have died from this disease.\n* Scoliosis nor kyphosis. I apparently have a damn straight spine.\n*Any miscellaneous physical issues or aches like joints etc. I only have had tendinitis from over striding when running, but that is completely expected, and was greatly reduced when I recently fixed my stride.\n\nNow, none of what I just mentioned is in any attempt to deny anything. This is just why I was told to not worry about it back then. Furthermore, I saw some of these features in other people. For example, when I went to college I met two people with pectus excavatum (who were about my height), one with pectus carnatum, some with hyper-mobile fingers, some with similar height related stretch marks, and of course, some with crowded teeth. Hence, marfan syndrome completely went over my head and I did not even think it was a possibility. I was fairly athletic (in a casual sense), and did distance running for years. I got in and out of strength training, trying to put on mass (I got stronger at times but I am a kept dropping and starting again due to lack of commitment and ~excuses~ school of course, I also felt like a hardgainer but that was also in part my constant hesitance to increase calories). In other words, I tried to be physically active, and more important to me, had the hope of being physically active and getting stronger/healthier, especially due to past ed. I just recently graduated college, and will be attending graduate school in 2-3 weeks.\nA couple of days ago, however, I came across many things about Marfan Syndrome, and it caught my attention again. While many cases where indeed visually extreme, there were a few I have now seen that look like me. I believe whole-heartedly that I do have the Marfan habitus/body shape, with worrying associated characteristics like mild spider fingers, general hand-signs, thin torso, pectus exc., etc. I have also seen about people who thought they were clear early on with insufficient testing, but they later suffered something like spontaneous aortic dissection. I have an appointment with a doctor this week, and will also be undergoing genetic testing. I am absolutely horrified at not only the results, but how this is going to affect my life. I will not be able to run (a major stress relief for me), I will not be able to strength train, and I will not be able to enjoy things like amusement park rides etc. I am terrified at the thought of an eventual heart surgery, terrified at the fact that my parents might outlive me, and terrified that if I do have it, I could have been susceptible to the aortic dissection this entire time, and there where times I physically pushed myself *hard*. Worse yet is the tease that I thought this was behind me, but apparently it is not. I had a skin cancer scare (skin mark that turned out to be benign) earlier this summer, and it was really tough, but this just overshadows it. This whole episode is also confirming my body dismorphia, and I *know* I am physically weird, and may not be able to do anything to improve it weight-wise. My anxiety has been so bad that I have to force food down and try not to vomit from nausea. I have been having constant panic attacks and do not know what to do. I am sorry for the long post, but this is one of the toughest weeks of my life. I hate to sound like I have given up hope, but I think I should start trying to cope with the very plausible reality. If anyone can answer, what is the heart surgery like? It would be great if anyone can offer any general advice. Thanks in advance for any response. You have it or you do not. Finding out will help you prevent issues by taking care of your health now. If you do have it, then the steps to prevent problems are well known, like being put on beta blockers and Losartan and getting annual check ups on your heart. \n\nI am 43 years old and was diagnosed at four. I have a great life. I have had health issues, sure, and some serious surgery but I have adapted. If you do have it, you will adapt too. If you do have it, its important to remember you did not just \"catch it\" you have lived 22 years not knowing.   And if you do,  stay on top of it.  There are good Dr's and treatments out there.  No one lives forever. Surgical options are getting better all the time:   What specific tests have you had? Echocardiogram? Genetic testing? Hey, I have posted a ton in my own threads about my recent experience with heart surgery. Feel free to read on and post and questions if they arise.

Why does everything I consume just go straight to my stomach? I am not talking about building muscle, I just want to put some fat on my bones and not look like a skeleton. Gaining weight is not the issue but the problem is where the weight is going. \n\nI have been told before I have to exercise and lift weights if I want the weight to spread out over my body but I do not understand. People lose and gain weight based on their diet, right? People get overweight by eating tons of junk food, people lose weight by reducing their calories, so why do people with Marfans need to exercise to put weight on their arms/legs/shoulders? I am confused. I have the same issue. I guess it is all of us. Same here :( Because that is where your body stores fat. \n\nCheck with your cardiologist first then get yourself some resistance bands, adjustable weights, or even just some gallon jugs filled with sand to start.\n\nDo curls, push-ups off your knees, dips, etc.\n\nYou can safely build muscle, you just have to do it slowly and with lower weights to avoid the big blood pressure spikes I am not looking to gain muscle. It is fat. I want meat on my bones and not look like a skeleton. It is not about looking muscular or fit, it is simply looking more average as opposed to stick thin.\n\nHow do people get fat on their arms and legs? Their shoulders? Are you saying chubby and overweight people only got fat on those areas by...working out? No. They ate, and it spread to those areas. I hear you, I have struggled with body image issues as a result of marfans too.\n\nUnfortunately you cannot choose where your body stores fat, just like you cannot choose where it burns fat.\n\nPeople who have fatty arms or legs likely either have a genetic predisposition to storing fat in those areas or they are overweight to the point that fat has begun to be stored on their limbs as well.\n\nObviously the first scenario does not apply to you.  The second would put you at a weight that will cause significant harm to your health.  Being overweight is one of the worst things for your overall health.  We are seeing it highlighted now with COVID. Respiration is labored because the lungs have to move a bunch of fat in order to expand, blood pressure is higher, inflammation is higher, insulin resistance (type 2 diabetes) is higher.\n\nWhy are you so opposed to the idea of building muscle? Thanks for the reply. Appreciate it. It does make sense but even then, I know friends and family who are maybe average weights and then they come back from holiday (after eating tons for a fortnight) and they are noticeably chubbier on their face and body. You know what I mean? I guess that tied in with your first scenario though...\n\nMy GP told me to avoid weights/gym \u2018just in case\u2019 I have Marfans. It is obviously easier and safer just to eat calories and hope I fill out my arms and legs that was as opposed to risking it with weight lifting. Here is how you gain fat weight on your arms/legs/shoulders: get really fat. Eventually fat will end up there.\n\nUnfortunately we cannot control where our bodies distribute fat. Take three different people and have them each gain five pounds of fat. One person might get a bigger butt, another bigger boobs, and the third a bigger gut. It is pretty much just random luck. \n\nI and my dad have Marfan and our fat goes straight to our gut, creating the broomstick with a trash bag tied around the middle physique. My younger brother, who also has Marfan, gains it pretty evenly for whatever reason. Again, just random luck.\n\nThe only way to gain bulk or mass in a targeted manner is to gain muscle. The only way to gain muscle is to overload your muscles, generally through strength training/ weight lifting. Strength training for people with Marfan can be dicey, as heavy weight lifting can put immense strain on your cardiovascular system. Talk to your cardiologist and maybe to a physical therapist or personal trainer about your goals and about what you can safely do.\n\nAlso, if you are trying to put on muscle mass, you will almost certainly need to consume both an adequate amount of protein (.8-1g/lb body weight IIRC) and a caloric surplus. You *can* gain muscle while losing fat and not consuming a surplus\u2014it is called body recomping\u2014but it is very difficult and I am not sure people with Marfan could do the weight training necessary. I say this often.  I do it for a reason.  Try archery.\n\nFor one, archery will tone you very, very well.  If you put the time into it, that is.\n\nFor two, it is actually a recommended activity for Marfs.  I know why, it helped my back immensely.\n\nFor three, weight lifting is not recommended.  Let me tell you a story.\n\nI spent time weight lifting when I did martial arts.  I could deadlift 325, which is not much in the grand scheme of things but it is really good for a Marf.  I did not know I had Marfan, so that is why I did it.  Now my shoulders will dislocate given any reason or no reason at all.  All three joints, sometimes requiring a hospital to put it back in.  \n\nIn addition, while I do not have significant aortic dilation, I have many other heart issues that I most likely aggravated.  I definitely have issues that I should not have because I did it.  Knee issues, shoulder issues, nerve pain, and my orthopedists say if I had known I had Marfan syndrome I could have avoided some of it.\n\nThe Marfan Foundation has giudelines for healthy exercise on their website.  I am in a position to tell you they are a good idea.  Do not break yourself like I did. What is average weight to you?  The \"average\" American (sorry, I am assuming you are in the US, because Reddit :D ) has a BMI of 29 which puts them on the cusp of overweight and obese.  If you care about your health, you do not want to be American-average.  My point is, do not compare yourself to others. Compare yourself to what is actually healthy.\n\nThey might have been drinking heavily too, which makes you very \"puffy\" as it bloats you and causes inflammation that lasts for a couple days.  Those people you are referring to also likely naturally have more muscle under the fat too, so keep that in mind.  \n\n\nThe Marfan foundation's activity recommendations are extremely conservative, as they should be, because they are catering information to people with varying levels of severity of the syndrome.\n\n\nHowever, If done properly, a person with a mild marfans case can safely and beneficially lift weights to put on muscle; but it takes quite a lot of discipline, lack-of-ego, and self-awareness to do it safely.  That is the tricky thing about marfans, it is not a cut and dry disease, it is a spectrum and everyone is body is different.\n\nI have been through some of the worst things marfans can throw at you (3 lens replacements, 1 open heart, and 2 thoracotomies to repair 90% of my aorta after it dissected and nearly killed me).  I have read hundreds of pages of research papers about blood pressure and exercise, I have discussed this topic at length with my cardiologist and my surgeon (who is one of probably the top 5 in the world for this stuff, he was recently the president of the international society of thoracic surgeons), and even he has agreed that my workout plan is safe and likely beneficial to prevent musculoskeletal issues.\n\nI apologise if this sounds preachy, I am just trying to show you that a safe light workout routine is a healthy and safe way to improve your health and physique.\n\nHere is a comment I wrote awhile ago that goes into some detail of what I am talking about:  \n\n\nAlso, if your GP is serious about thinking you have marfans, they should have gotten you tested and had you get an echocardiogram.  I would find another GP. As far as my knowledge goes, I am sure those with Marfan\u2019s can do HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training), which is an absolute fat burner. It also will build muscle in the long term without the immense pressure on your heart that heavy weightlifting would cause. \n\nAvoid big lifts like deadlift and squat and do hit circuits or very light weights with high reps.\n\nIf you feel woozy or light headed at any point of your exercise, stop immediately.\n\nI am NOT a doctor, nor am I diagnosed with Marfan\u2019s, but I have suspicions, and have stuck around the community a while here. As soon as this corona thing ends I will get an appointment but at the age of 21 I think I can wait some time for the nhs to recover. The curse of the marf. Fat distribution is fairly genetic, and so is marfan syndrome so it makes sense a lot of us store fat in that weird E.T sort of way. lol \n\nI am just happy this time when I gained weight I put on some thigh and ass. HIIT is strongly advised against for marfans.  Anything High intensity is no bueno for blood pressure. I assumed it was safe because it is more like cardio, not a doctor as said. Have edited my comment. No worries homie I am not sure why archery should be \"approved\" for *all* marfs. I know when I did it in school my arm joints could not bear the draw load. I would dread trying it now, when my joints are even more frail. ", "Is it possible that something has changed in 6 years? 6 years ago (2014) I did a heart ultrasound for suspected Marfans. The results were this: \n\nStructurally normal heart. No significant flap leaks. No mitral prolapse. No aortic insufficiency. No aortic root dilatation or dilatation in aortic ascendence. It may be of value to continue the cardiac monitoring if the boy meets the criteria for Marfan's syndrome.  \n\nThis was 6 years ago and I wasnt very active with my training as I am now. Could something been changed during these years? Yes it is certainly possible, especially if you are putting more strain on your heart than you used to. I would call your PCP or cardiologist and get their opinion. I have the most common symptoms for Marfan but nothing that is been confirmed. The doctor sended me on this heart ultrasound just because he was worried that I had it but after that, the doctor just said everything was okay and then never said anything. \nI got to meet a different doctor and he told me that my previous doctor was a bit dumb and that I should not be worried. I dont really know who to trust now 6 years later. So today I contacted the hospital and we will see if I can do a new ultrasound. I went from a normal aorta to needing surgery in less than a year. Yea that is what makes me worry. Hope you are alright today! That was 26 years ago yesterday! Still here! Mine was not normal, I had a dilated aortic root for as long as I can remember but it was an acceptable size for my body, but then it grew 1.5cm in a year and required surgery. It can happen fast. Yea I have heard a lot of things like you experienced and that makes me worried because it was 6 years since last time someone checked on my heart. They did a EKG/ECG 1 year ago but that was before I did start excercise really hard Woah ! That must have been a bit scary. If you do not mind me asking, was your echo basically normal when you got diagnosed for marfans? So they did a genetic test? Im wondering because i had a totally normal echo but then i check off every physical trait including the flexibility tests, except for height and flat feet! Im not tall im 5\u20195. But i guess they mean tall in comparison to family \u2026 in that case well im taller than both my parents but not that much just some inches hahah. So they are going to test me but im so confused I was 4 when I was diagnosed. There was no DNA testing back then. Nowadays if you are physical signs do not quite add up you can just spend $250 and get the TAAD panel from Invitae. My big lesson though is regular check ups on your aorta!", "Asking for support from r/Marfans ", "can a repaired part of an aorta grow again title Not the replaced part, but outside of it and down the descending aorta is all susceptible to growth(aneurism.)", "Can we have a conversation on penis size? I have always wondered about Marfan and what kind of an effect it has on certain parts of the body.  For me, it seemed to make everything much lankier.  My hands, my wrists, my arms, my legs, my face, my feet, and yes, even my member. \n\nMy question is, is this a common theme among Marfs?  Growing up I had concern with my penis being too skinny, as a kid I was very insecure and worried that it would not be enough, or whatever 13 year olds think.  It eventually filled out and I have no problems with size.  I think it is average but my 5\"4 girlfriend usually says that it is \"plenty big and would not be able to handle anything bigger.\". I think the skinny and long effect does make sex difficult at times when it hits her cervix.  So does anyone else have a similar experience?  I have never been able to talk about sex for Marfan syndrome people before, I have never even met another marf.  So I just wanted to find out if anyone else has a skinny dick like me.  I would love to see a study done comparing average size to Marfan size.", "Does anyone have Marfan-like features but not the full diagnosis? \\-Short torso, really proportionally long arms and legs (my dad and brother are both shorter than me with shorter limbs)\n\n\\-long fingers and toes\n\n\\-very skinny forearms and wrists\n\n\\-pectus excavatum + sunken ribs adjacent to sternum (right side of chest wall sticks out more)\n\nthat is it. i tested negative for any eye problems and my echocardiogram came back normal a few years ago. i have palpitations often but i have been told by doctors those are not of concern as the echo came back normal for everything. bc of the eye and heart normalness, i was told i could not be fully diagnosed with marfans. do i just have another less common connective tissue disorder or is it possible to have like \"half-marfans\". do not really know how the genetics work. Not a doctor but based from the doctors\u2019 diagnosis (from the echo and the eye), it is somewhat unlikely you have Marfans. If you really need to be sure if you have Marfans, might I suggest going to a medical genetic doctor. If the chest pain still persist, I suggest going to a different cardiologist/GP for a second opinion. Lmk if you figure it out. Pretty much described me plus some lifting injuries \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. Marfans is a spectrum with cardiovascular issues also ranging. If the echo came back normal do not worry, just manage stress as you can. Possibly scoliosis with the asymmetrical ribs...I know my symptoms get worse when my vertebrae move/press together. Same deal here. I have a family history for it, but no heart or eye problems. The technical term is Marfanoid I think I have a normal echo, but I have been told to get another one when I am thirty and if I get pregnant.\n\nI am quite tall for a woman (5'10, but I was born premature which might have stunted my growth). My arm span is 6'2. I have got very long fingers and toes, bad eyesight, I have got pectus carinatum... I am very flexible. I have got a very high roof to my mouth, crowded teeth, and I am very short sighted. I was told I am too short for Marfans and my heart is fine for now, so I have been diagnosed with Joint Hypermobility Syndrome. Too short for marfans - I kind of laughed there cause I am 5 6 and have pretty severe marfans (I am also a female) idk exactly why I did not grow super tall but I deff was extremely tall as a kid (like many inches taller than my older bro who is 2 yrs older). Guess it works in a weird way for some of us but I do hope doctors dont just rule it out cause some1 is 'short' u kno\ud83d\ude02 I stopped growing when I was 12, thank god. Wonder how tall I would be otherwise ! \n\nHope things are good with you. Yeah, I have had it ruled out. I guess my JHS diagnosis is something. I do not know why I subscribe here any more but I guess I do not fit in the ehlers danlos sub nor here so I am bit on my own. And I definitely have lots of the same problems as here. I hope nobody minds that I am here Im great thanks and no one minds dw, at the end of the day were all here to support each other, whether a marf or anything health related of that sort:) Thank you!! \ud83d\udc93 My husband is in this boat, we are currently pursuing diagnosis. All his symptoms/issues point more to Marfans than any EDS, but while he is tall, thin and has a caved in chest, his features are just slightly short of the Marfans signs.\n\nHe recently had chest pain (with no other heart attack signs) and went to the hospital. He had had a heart attack due to several SCAD (spontaneous coronary artery dissection) and the cardiac catheterization showed signs of connective tissue disorder, though we are still in the process of figuring out which. We had already suspected it though due to his anatomy and history of tendon issues. Please take any chest pain seriously if you have any suspicion of Marfans or another connective tissue disorder.", "How is is your heart today? \n\n(", "Indented chest uncomfortable feeling??? I do not have marfans but I have a severe indented chest deformation which I know can be associated with marfans. Doctors say it is nothing to worry about...\n\nBut for my entire life I have this horrible feeling surrounding the area of my chest. I do not know anything that helps it. I am not even sure how to explain it. It is not a pain or an itch or a warmness or any feeling I can describe. It is just uncomfortable all the time. Sometimes it gets bad and it is the only thing that I can think about. If someone touches the indent it feels so bad I feel like my sternum is going to shatter and kill me. Sometimes my shirt will brush against it and it is unbearable.  But if I take off my shirt it feels so awful...\n\nAnyone else experience this kind of thing? It is something I have just had all my life and today it is just driving me insane. If anyone knows what it is or if there is anything I can do to relieve it please tell me! Check out r/PectusExcavatum. Also try to stick your chest out and correct your posture.", "Anyone else got a whole in the roof of their mouth which they can press air through to their nose. Thought it was normal the dentist said it can cause infections. I have actually got loeys dietz but that servers dead How u got diagnosed with LDS? Btw I do have a hole in the roof of my mouth but I cannot breathe through it Doctors thought I had marfans. I think they did genetic tests and discovered it was not. Idk exactly I was only 10 I do not but I have LDS too and would love to revive the group. It is so hard there is almost no forums anywhere specific to us! Negative test  to LDS but it runs in family. \n\nIMHO we are so similar to the marfanoids that would be better to ask to get included here.

I have mild scoliosis (&lt;15 deg) and moderate myopia. \n\nI recently started getting frequent skipped heart beats after a round of prednisone (steroids) for my ear infection. It has since subsided but I decided to go get an echo cardiogram just to check it out. \n\nThe doctor found I had signs of mitral valve prolapse and given my scoliosis and myopia, I was diagnosed with Marfan's. No other enlargement of heart/aorta was found. I do not have the exact dimensions but my doctor said not to worry about it, except to come back again in 6 months. I was not given any medication. \n\nI had no idea what Marfan's was until recently. Now I am trying to learn as much about as possible. Has anyone had the same experience as me, getting skipped beats from taking medications? \n\nHow does one go about living with Marfan? My biggest dilemma now is, I am not sure if I should tell my friends/family or worse still my employer about it. ", "Do I have marfan? ", "Research to accurately portray character with Marfans I have a story in my head that I am getting ready to put onto paper or into pixels. One of the main characters has Marfans and I know a lot about general complications it can cause but almost nothing about day to day life living with Marfans. So  if you feel up to answering a few questions about your experiences that would be hella rad :) \n\nThe character's biggest struggles are with cardiac issues and spine issues from childhood scoliosis. He spent his youth in a back brace, a sternum brace, and in and out of the hospital. He is had a few surgeries to fix  some heart complications and spine issues. The story covers his early 20s through late 30s. he lives in the US. So if your personal experiences match up with any of that your knowledge is extra valuable to me :D\n\nThese questions are more a guideline to get started so feel free to add anything else I might have missed! Also, you do not have to answer all of them.\n\n* how many medications do you have to take daily? Are they expensive? What do they help with? What are their side effects?

Was it a huge pain to get?\n* How frequently are you supposed to have doctors appointments and what kind of doctors?\n\nthank you for any info you can provide :) I want to portray it accurately. You have described me nearly perfectly. The character should be funny. A lot of people with Marfan syndrome are. It is a typical defense mechanism, both to alleviate stress from the syndrome itself, and for dealing with the social issues that come from growing up looking different.\n\nI am happy to be an interview subject if you want to chat. (Too lazy to type out everything you want to know) I am interested in hearing more about the project. Feel free to PM me. Oh he is definitely accepted his role as the tall friend and frequently jokes about his societal duty to reach things on the top shelf for short people. He still has heart issues and dramatically jokes about not being able to do things because he is \"heartbroken\". Because of other things about him his humor is frequently unintentional from a naive bluntness. \nI am working on character design at the moment so I cannot consistently respond to a chat, but if you want to peruse the questions and answer whatever you feel up to they are literally all the things I have been wanting to know, lol. Feel free to message me though! I will tell you a little bit about him that I am too self conscious and protective of to state publicly. Pertinent details: I am a straight, white, 28 year-old, cisgendered male, born and raised in the United States. I spent the first twenty-ish years in Mississippi, then I moved to Rhode Island and have been here ever since.\n\nAlso keep in mind that every person's case is different, and while there are widely shared, common issues, our individual experiences with the specific issues will vary.\n\n&gt; how many medications do you have to take daily? Are they expensive? What do they help with? What are their side effects? (I do not need to know medication names or dosages, but if you want to drop deets on those I will not turn them' down)\n\nFour, all covered by Medicaid, so I do not have to pay out of pocket for them. Two of them lower my blood pressure (atenolol and losartan), one slows my heart rate and regulates its beats (flecainide), and one is a blood thinner that I have had to take since my heart surgery (warfarin, aka coumadin). I would recommend you research the side effects yourself.\n\n&gt; What do you have to do day to day that people without Marfans would not have to or would not give a second thought?\n\nBecause of how my particular case manifests, my muscles are *much* weaker than an average person's, enough so that I cannot drive. And because of how it affects my cardio, pulmonary, and skeletal systems, I do not have the strength and endurance to walk more than a few blocks in a given time period without stopping to rest. I also simply cannot stand for more than thirty minutes or so without experiencing physical discomfort that escalates to pain that worsens the longer that I stand, and the same goes for sitting. So if I ever need to go somewhere, I need to organize transportation ahead of time through family and friends, book transportation ahead of time through the state's paratransit service, or fork over the cash and use a ride share app. I am, in short, entirely dependent on others for getting around town.\n\n&gt; Is pain a daily issue? I have heard from a friend with ehlers-danlos that they feel daily body aches similar to the kind one gets with the flu and that its effected by barometric pressure. I know the syndromes are related, but not if this is a shared similarity.\n\nIt can be. As I said, standing, sitting, and walking too long all hurt. I also have random musculoskeletal pains in my chest and back that are common enough that I do not worry (much) about them, but infrequent enough that I do still worry a little. I also have dural ectasia, so I deal with pain in the back of my right hip and down my right leg (almost like sciatica) that is become more common than the musculoskeletal pain.\n\n&gt; What struggles do you have that someone without Marfans would not?\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned inability to drive, my muscular issues limit my lifting ability to about eight pounds, and I have to struggle to manage that. On top of that, many of my joints are deformed and cause limited mobility, particularly my elbows and my shoulders, so I cannot even reach high places. You can probably imagine how difficult this (along with the transportation issues) can make things like going grocery shopping alone, or even just trying to open a new jar. On top of all of *that*, no-skill jobs that \"anyone\" can do like retail and food service are out of the question for me. I cannot physically carry out the required duties of a day's work, so when I am looking for work, that immediately eliminates a huge swath of potential jobs. I am strictly limited to no-skill desk jobs, and you would be surprised by how many of those require you to lift up to 60 lb boxes of paperwork and drive around (at least around here).\n\n&gt;Does having Marfans affect your diet? \n\nI need a *lot* of carbs and calories. I cannot count how many variations I have heard of a doctor telling me \"Well, normally I tell people to cut down on the cheeseburgers, but *you* can have as many as you want.\"\n\n&gt; Do you struggle with gaining weight?\n\nNope, I just do not gain weight \ud83d\ude04 The heaviest I have ever weighed naturally was an even 80 lbs (usually I drift between 76 and 78).\n\n&gt; If you are on the thin side of Marfans, are you frequently cold because lack of body fat and blood circulation issues?\n\n*Ohhhhhh yeahhhhhhh*.\n\n&gt; If you get sick with a cold or anything involving a lot of coughing, would worry about a lung collapsing be realistic? Could it effect your heart if you have aortic problems?\n\nMarfan syndrome can cause a spontaneous pneumothorax, but a cold does not increase the risk. In my case, the problem with a cold is that I have a really hard time coughing phlegm up from my lungs, so it runs the risk of sitting there and developing into pneumonia or some kind of pulmonary infection. Also, colds just generally wipe me out worse than an able-bodied person.\n\n&gt; What discrimination/bullying have you faced because of Marfans?\n\nActually, very little at all. I know of one instance when I started at a new school where someone was mocking my appearance to a buddy of his, but another student gave him a talking to. Aside from that, everyone in the towns and schools I grew up in were very understanding, supportive, and accommodating of my needs.\n\nIf anything, their attitudes may have gone a little too far in the opposite direction. When I was in middle school, I had a huge crush on this girl I will call K, and in hindsight, I doubt I was very subtle about that. In the last year of middle school, there was a dance where they crown a king and queen. As they were preparing to announce said king and queen, I started to tell my friend about how I would never win something like that, but my explanation was cut short by the announcement that I was the king. And who just so happened to be queen? Yup, K. I have never been able to shake the feeling that that the faculty made that happen just to do something nice for the disabled kid, but I am self-aware enough to recognize that that could simply be self-loathing cynicism.\n\n&gt; What privileges do people without it have that they assume you have?\n\nI honestly do not know, I do not know what people assume of me.\n\n&gt; Are there medications, prescribed or over the counter, or supplements you are unable to take?\n\nAnything that interferes with the medicines I need to take. A simple example is any cold or sinus medicine that has pseudoephedrine in it (or ibuprofen, which also has pseudoephedrine in it) because it interferes with my atenolol. Again, I really recommend you do your own research on this. \n\n&gt; Are there any you find yourself taking frequently?\n\nMucinex DM for chest congestion, along with albuterol in a nebulizer.\n\n&gt; What are your exercise limits? Would a walk to the store in very hot, very cold, or generally inclement weather be out of the question?\n\nNothing more intensive than extended walking, and that would depend on what I need to get and bring back, as well as how far away the store is. Cold is more miserable than heat, but the real danger with cold is icy sidewalks and falls.\n\n&gt; What daily mundane things do you find yourself requiring assistance with?\n\nOpening certain containers, lifting certain things, and getting around town.\n\n&gt; Are hyper-flexible joints a big issue? What kind of issues do they cause?\n\nIn my case, no, not really.\n\n&gt; How does Marfans effect your sex life?\n\nPhysically, I have no idea. I have never even been on a date, let alone had sex. Mentally, I have little to no confidence in myself when it comes to romance. I have asked ladies out, but they have all politely declined, and while my rational mind knows, intellectually, that it is just because I am not the right match to interest them, I cannot ignore the feeling in my chest that maybe *somebody* would have given me a chance if I *at least* was conventionally attractive. That is a shitty, shallow thing to feel, but it is there, and I hate it. I also have some shitty feelings in similar veins that will pop up and tell me things like \"I cannot even open a bottle of water half the time, why the fuck would anyone want to go out with me\" or \"Yeah, I am sweet, so fucking what, there are thousands of guys out there that are sweet and *not* burdens on their loved ones, I have got *nothing*.\" Again, I rationally know these things are just shitty feelings, but they are there.\n\nI will answer the rest in another comment. Hey, the shitty feelings are also helpful in accurately portraying it! All in all, your answers are all super helpful! It confirms the validity of my character having reason to hate the cold weather because lung goop and his hobby crocheting warm things that he developed out of boredom being stuck at home or in the hospital. \n\nI will definitely look up side effects on my own since you gave me actual medication names. \n\nThank you for taking the time to answer :) I have to make a whole new comment because the Reddit app's formatting is not playing well with my phone. This is the second part of my response.\n\n&gt; How frequently are you supposed to have doctors appointments and what kind of doctors?\n\nI see a cardiologist, pulmonologist, neurologist, and primary care doctor, each about every six months or a year, depending on how things are going.\n\n&gt; how does it effect your vision? is your glasses prescription really strong? have you had Lasik surgery? If you have, did it only fix vision issues temporarily?\n\nI am really nearsighted, and because of ectopia lentis, I had to have the lenses of my eyes replaced, so I do not think Lasik is an option for me. I have to wear bifocals, and to be honest, I am long overdue for a new prescription. I do not think my current one is super strong though. I can see without my glasses (it is like going back to a CRT standard def) except that I cannot read medium print at a distance.\n\n&gt; Have you had any complications suddenly arise while going about your day as normal?\n\nOh totally. There are two separate occasions when I was going about my day until bad headaches put me in the ICU and they turned out to be subdural hematomas caused by spontaneous intracranial hypotension caused by CSF leaks caused by dural ectasia. And then there is the day my lenses dislocated.\n\n&gt; does marijuana (in any form, thc or cbd edibles, vape, etc.) help?\n\nHave not tried it yet. When I do, it will be in edible form. My deformed rib cage (pectus carinatum) constricts my lung capacity *a lottttt*, and I do not want to waste what precious little space I have got on smoke.\n&gt;  Smoking *anything* is a big no-no with marfans, right? What about second hand smoke?\n\nYes, that is also very bad.\n(also do not have to answer publicly if at all) have you done psychedelics and had unexpected effects or consequences because of it? yeah when I use the app I cannot see past my phone keyboard \ud83d\ude11 I got to use the computer for anything longer than a paragraph to prevent a tide of typos.\n\nthe headaches is a new thing to me so that is good to know \ud83d\udc4d\u2728 Yeah, the dural-ectasia-to-subdural-hematoma domino chain is really uncommon. People without Marfans can develop SIH, and that can occasionally lead to the hematomas, but at the very least, dural ectasia caused by Marfans increases the chance of the SIH. &gt; how many medications do you have to take daily?\n\nI take Losartan and Bisoprolol. They are cheap (around 6$/month). They help slow the progression of my aortic aneurysm. The only side effects are that I get dizzy more often than before when standing up from a sitting position, my hands/feets/nose are often cold, and I feel a bit more tired than before.\n&gt; What do you have to do day to day that people without Marfans would not have to or would not give a second thought?\n\nNot much. It affects the way I do some things, but except for my daily meds, I do not do anything I would not do if I did not have Marfan.\n&gt; Is pain a daily issue?\n\nIt is! In my case it is mostly joint pain, but I am also really hypermobile so that is not too surprising. Your friend\u2019s description sounds about right, though I would say the pain is mostly related to any kind of repetitive movement.\n\n&gt; What struggles do you have that someone without Marfans would not?\n\nPain, the fear of my aneurysm bursting, fatigue, and being prevented from doing some sports.\n\n&gt; Does having Marfans affect your diet? Do you struggle with gaining weight?\n\nNope. Never had any weight issue, be it being too thin or too fat.\n\n&gt; If you are on the thin side of Marfans, are you frequently cold because lack of body fat and blood circulation issues?\n\nI am often cold, but it is more of an issue since I began taking my meds.\n\n&gt; If you get sick with a cold or anything involving a lot of coughing, would worry about a lung collapsing be realistic? Could it effect your heart if you have aortic problems?\n\nNope. Well, it could *maybe* be a problem once my aorta gets a lot bigger, but right now I do not worry about that.\n\n&gt; What discrimination/bullying have you faced because of Marfans? What privileges do people without it have that they assume you have?\n\nNo discrimination/bullying. Only privileges that people have that I do not would be the lack of pain hindering their daily life I guess.\n\n&gt; Are there medications, prescribed or over the counter, or supplements you are unable to take? Are there any you find yourself taking frequently?\n\n&gt; Do not take cocaine, kids. More seriously, just got to skip on stimulants and some specific antibiotics that are linked to aneurysms and tendon issues.\n\n&gt; What are your exercise limits? Would a walk to the store in very hot, very cold, or generally inclement weather be out of the question?\n\nMy cardiologist described the exercise limits as such: do not lift something if you would have to strain to lift double its actual weight. No isometric exercise either (doing the plank, straining while holding your breath, etc). A walk to the store in any weather is perfectly fine. I live in Quebec, do not have a car, and have no trouble getting my groceries on foot even if it is -30 Celsius outside. Everyone is different, but overall it is still recommended to exercise to keep in shape. Just got to limit ourselves to light cardio. As long as you can still hold a conversation while doing it without straining, it is fine.\n\n&gt; What daily mundane things do you find yourself requiring assistance with?\n\nHolding the grocery bags if they are too heavy, lifting some other heavy stuff, but that is pretty much it.\n\n&gt; Are hyper-flexible joints a big issue? What kind of issues do they cause?\n\nA huge issue in my case. They mostly cause pain.\n\n&gt;  How does Marfans effect your sex life?\n\nIt does not.\n\n&gt; Is there anything you do daily to help alleviate Marfans related symptoms or symptoms of the medications?\n\nNothing daily, though I vape weed 2-3 times a week to help with the pain.\n\n&gt; Do you receive government assistance or disability? \n\nNope.\n\n&gt; How frequently are you supposed to have doctors appointments and what kind of doctors?\n\nOnce a year to check the size of my aorta, every 6 month if it has grown. I am also seeing an orthopedist for my joint issues, but that is less frequent.\n\n&gt; how does it effect your vision? is your glasses prescription really strong? \n\nLasik is not recommended for people with Marfan. I have got pretty big myopia and astigmatism, but my glasses deal with it fine. Never had any lens dislocation or other more serious issue.\n\n&gt; Have you had any complications suddenly arise while going about your day as normal? \n\nOnly before I was diagnosed. I biked a lot and nearly passed out a couple time. Otherwise, my hypermobility means there is some specific movements I have trouble with (got a tear in my shoulder labrum, for example, which makes it hurt a lot if I try to hold stuff higher than my head with my left arm).\n\n&gt; does marijuana (in any form, thc or cbd edibles, vape, etc.) help?\n\nIt helps for the pain, yeah. I vape dry herbs.\n\n&gt; Smoking *anything* is a big no-no with marfans, right? What about second hand smoke?\n\nSecondhand smoke is bad, but it is bad for everyone anyway, as is smoking. I would say it is worse for those with Marfan because of our potential heart/lung issues.\n\n&gt; have you done psychedelics and had unexpected effects or consequences because of it?\n\nNope.\n\n&gt; Edit to add because important!: What do you wish people knew about marfans in general? What are you getting tired of repeating over and over and over about things related to it?\n\nBeing tall and lanky does not mean you have got Marfan. People who worry about having it should ask their doctor. I see a lot of people coming to the sub, worrying for no reason, while I am pretty sure a short talk with their doctor would fix all their worries. Yessssss this is really helpful for the aortic issues. That is one of the things my character ends up dealing with eventually. Thank you so much for your input! I do not have scoliosis, no heart issues so far. I have very flexible joints, dislocated lens,loss in hearing. Flexible joint are good(party tricks) and bad at same time. If i fall or hit something, my bones gets dislocated easily. Every year i have regular check up with cardio to make sure my heart is okay. That Is actually how I found out about Marfans was going to school with a guy who could make his shoulder blades \"pop out\". I never considered how easy it would be to accidentally dislocate things on accident! Thanks for your input \ud83d\udc4d\u2728 That Is actually how I found out about Marfans was going to school with a guy who could make his shoulder blades \"pop out\". I never considered how easy it would be to accidentally dislocate things on accident! Thanks for your input \ud83d\udc4d\u2728", "When is it best to see the doctor, during an episode or anytime you can? I ask because for the last year or so my shoulder goes through episodes of debilitating pain. I am talking wake up crying and not able to work through it kind of pain.  I know eventually I will have another flair up. Should I just go to the doctor now or wait until I am in intense pain again?\n\nI am pretty sure I have a mild case of Marfans. If you look at my post history you will see that both my brother and father have been diagnosed. But this is not a \u201cdo I have marfans\u201d post.  I figured you guys might have the best advise though. Go now. Sometimes getting answers from doctors can be a slow process, depending on what they want you to do (for example, running tests, seeing a specialist, etc). So when you are not having an episode it will be much easier to go through this process, versus waiting until later when you are in a lot of pain and you need help immediately. That helps a lot thank you Pain management has been the biggest issue for my 12yr old daughter.  Advil, heat, compression, massage and relaxation... combined, are all that work.  We are trying to get into a pediatric pain management clinic.  Going to the doctor for reoccurring pain is just so disappointing.  But what it does is help document it and adds to her medical records.", "Genetic testing and specialists in Toronto? What would be the best what to get tested/diagnosed in the Toronto area? I did not find much online. Should I start with my family doctor? Thanks \ud83d\ude4f Yes, it is good to start with your family doctor and if they suspect Marfan Syndrome they will refer you to a geneticist and likely a cardiologist. Dm me, I am in Toronto and know a handful of good drs for Marfs, can deff point u in the right direction! Also in Toronto, looking to get tested. Did you end up finding someone? Ditto - would love to know what/who you found!", "My coronary buttons are dilated I am going to try to sum this up so it does not turn into a novel. I have what is considered a text book  moderate case of Marfan syndrome. I have every symptom that comes along with it and every complication it seems like.\n\nI am 27 had my aortic valve replaced at 10 y/o (it was 6cm dilated). At 23 my thoracic aorta spontaneously dissected (there was no dilation, no sign or symptoms that it could dilate or dissect. I had a CT a month before and there was nothing) The thoracic aorta dissected from my valve all the way down into my illiac artery. I had multiple surgeries over the past 4 years to deal with that. \n\nNow on to the latest aneurysm. The coronary buttons which I have been told are where my coronary and aortic valve meet. So the remaining aortic tissue is dilating. And they are about 3cm (when they should be like 3 mm). My doctor is currently shopping around my case with different surgeons. He says this is a rare issue and may not find a surgeon willing to take on such a case. In the meantime I am told to take as much beta blockers as I can handle. Dr wants my resting heart rate in the 50's (usually runs in the 90's) \n\nAnybody hear of anyone having a similar problem? Could they treat it with surgery? I have never heard of this, so I will be no help to you, but I just wanted to wish you the best in your endeavor to get it fixed. What your going through sounds downright traumatic and I cannot imagine having to deal with that. Much love and all the best for a speedy recovery. Have not heard of that, but get in contact with Dr. Joseph Bavaria at University of Pennsylvania Hospital, he is the best of the best.", "Ecstasy (MDMA) with marfans at a concert, been offered MDMA. i would love to take it, however will it adversely affect me? I would steer clear from it. Never done it before either, but i just would not risk it. You do not know what its been cut with and plenty of \"healthy\" people have been known to have cardiovascular complications from it.... \n\nMaybe one day when its pure, legal/controlled and it can be done in a safe setting, but i dont think doing pills from a rave is the best thing.\n\nStay safe! i would definitely steer clear from anything of the sorts. Similarly related, I also steer clear from red bull vodka drinks when I am out partying with friends. does not matter if someone bought it for me, i will refuse to drink it because of the known issues energy drinks can cause hearts. \n\nIf you are looking to party, I personally would stick to alcohol and maybe the occasional weed. Of course this is not medical advice and probably not good for you but I personally have had no issues with it. \n\nIt is just not worth risking it on the harder stuff. +1 for steering clear of the red bull vodkas. Made a couple bad decisions one night around that and will never do it again. haha yes! several times a boy will buy me one and it is awkward explaining to a random guy at the bar that i refuse to drink it bc i have a heart condition... but it is better to be safe than sorry. I care more about my life than embarrassment. of course it is hard to stay true to your word when you are already drunk. your mind starts thinking \u201ceh how bad is this red bull for me anyways\u201d If I even look at a Redbull, I start to get a migraine. Nasty stuff. It should not be a big deal.....it SHOULD NOT.\n\nBut that is the thing. Do you KNOW that is what it is?\n\nIf you would like to try it, I am not opposed at all to mind expansion &amp; experimentation using chemical compounds. For legal and policy/thread rules, I will not outright advocate for it\n\nBut you need to know that it is straight up X. Buy a tester kit online.\n\nAny psychoactive substances has the potential to cause panic, which can increase heart rate.\n\nAs far as bad effects, if you are worried you will fry your brain or something, not that high a risk if you do not destroy yourself with how much you are using.\n\nHappy safe space travels! I did a quick search for Marfan syndrome and MDMA on Pubmed and did not find anything, but I did find a couple of articles discussing aortic dissection in MDMA users that \\*did not\\* have Marfans.   \n(\n\n(  \n\n\nThey do not indicate that MDMA was definitely responsible (lots of people use MDMA recreationally and for medical reasons daily *without* aortic dissections), and they point out that it would be hard to definitively make that connection, so take it with a grain of salt. \n\nAs others have said, my personal take would be that what it might be cut with is likely to be more dangerous. If you can have an honest chat with a medical doctor about it, maybe you could get more clarity. That is a hard no man. No uppers. You do not want anything that is going to make your heart speed up. It will increase your blood pressure and put force on your aorta and make it dilate. It is a sure fire way to start an aneurysm or aggravate one you already have.  I am speaking from experience. Do not do it. No ecstasy no cocaine no meth. NO uppers. No caffeine for you ? Nope. I have had my entire aorta replace. My aortic valve, ascending aorta, thoracic aorta. I am more machine than man at this point. My doctor told me no stimulants. So just a quick thing about weed (and cigarettes too I suppose), people with Marfans are at a significant increased risk for a pneumothorax (collapsed lung) when smoking any kind of substance. So if you partake, try to use edibles if possible. \n\nAt least that is what my cardiologist has told me. can confirm this from personal experience. I smoked hookah once and got bronchitis a couple days later. Probably would have collapsed my lung too but i had previously had preventative surgery to prevent lung collapses. also i would not really recommend weed in general. i think it can change your blood pressure and can also give you anxiety/palpitations. From experience I think alcohol has been the safest for me but of course any substance it is probably harmful in some way Also re: weed (and sorry if you have seen me say this before).\n\nIt is a vasodilator.  I have personally had it sometimes (but not always) floor my BP.  Not to a level I needed medical care, but to a level where if I had not been with friends in my home I would be in a dangerous position walking home.  I have had more than once where I lost vision.\n\nWith the legalization I know it is seen in a different light (and rightfully so), but it is definitely something that can be different for \"us\".  Everyone knows to find a sober D if they are drinking.  Not everyone knows to plan where they are going to crash if they are smoking on BP meds. These are all very good points!\nI do not drink and I do not smoke weed if I do not have time to sober up before leaving where I am at. True! I imbibe in very small amounts to help manage my joint pain, but I have definitely had a panic attack if I have gotten too high. I was once at a party where someone broke out their hookah, and used barbeque charcoal instead of the coals you are supposed to use.  Pretty sure everyone got bronchitis from that hahaha Yeah, I was never able to figure out exactly what caused it, because it was a rarity.  I just always mention it because if it had happened it college and I had to walk home, I definitely would have woken up either in a gutter or at the hospital because someone found me asleep on a lawn.\n\nI would imagine with how you can now get stuff with insanely specific content it might be easier to monitor.  I think people can probably safely enjoy, you just have to be aware that it might be different for you than your friends. I strongly agree with you, it is important to know your limits and that you should always err on the side of caution with any mind altering substance. My best friend died at 36. He worked a double and was drinking  5 hour energies. Not sure how many he drank but he made it home after work and had a heart attack. I would not recommend them to anyone. I have marfans I have done it heaps of time  no issues  if you are healthy  do it just start off with a small amount and enjoy your life Red bull and vodka are worse for your heart then mdma  trust me that is the thibg to stay away from if you want to take drugs, take ketamine it lowers your heart rate.", "Confused About Correct Diagnosis I am a teenage girl who is pretty sure that she has Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, but there is a but to that. I am built very Marfanish, but I am only 5 foot 4. The maternal side that I think my disorder comes from is really tall and lanky. My mom is a normal height herself, but her mom was tall. My dad and his family are not tall and a lot of them are short. \n\n    I have a wingspan of 5 foot 8 at 5 foot 4, have long, thin fingers and long legs and I have been built like that since birth. I had to have treatment for a high narrow palate when I was younger and had to have years of braces. I am nearsighted in one eye. I am hypermobile and I have thin and stretchy skin with stretch marks without gaining, or losing a bunch of weight. I do have terrible allergies and I am looking into Loey-Dietz too because of that because my grandma had a club foot, I have wide set eyes and I have blue sclera. These things can go with vascular EDS too, but I am really confused as to which one I have. I know that you are not supposed to be hypermobile in big joints in vascular EDS and I am extremely hypermobile everywhere, so that confuses me too.  I also have varicose veins already, have livedo reticularis and flat feet. I can pass the Marfan hand and wrist tests too. \n\n    I am currently getting referred to a neurologist and getting an MRI because of ongoing problems triggered by a car accident. and I am going to wear a holter monitor because of tachycardia and chest pain and then I am going to go to a cardiologist to get checked for things. \n    I am confused as to what I have because of all of this and my family history. Am I some kind of connective tissue disorder mixture? Am I missing something, or over thinking it? I would share your concerns with the cardiologist. Unfortunately, I do not have a better answer than that. Your concerns sound valid but it seems like you would probably have to be a spontaneous mutation if that were the case. I wish you the best and hope you do not have either.", "Can a Marf who is gone through the heart surgery and gotten the machine put in work around electricity and electromagnets? I was told by my mom that the new iPhone 12 is affecting medical devices like pacemakers and the machine that Marfan\u2019s patients get (I heard it is either a synthetic or silicone valve and you can hear it tick). So I figured it is because the iPhone 12\u2019s electromagnet or frequency is what is affecting them.\n\nI ask this because I want to become an electrical engineer; I have not gone through the surgery, yet and hopefully never, my aortic root is doing fine and is stable, thankfully, but I know that the surgery is a very real possibility.\n\nAnd yes I have been diagnosed with Marfan\u2019s Syndrome, I was diagnosed at late 16 (I am 18). Any sort of valve would not be anything like a pacemaker.  There is a lot of technology involved but no circuity.  Typically they are either tissue (porcine) or mechanical.  Mine is mechanical and is basically fancy plastic (pyrolytic carbon).  Even a super strong magnetic field (like an MRI) will not interfere at all with it. \n\n( This is fantastic news! You just sedated my worries, so thank you! You are most welcome.  Best of luck in your career! Though I hope to never need a replacement done, my parents think it would be hilarious if semi-vegetarian me ended up with a pig valve. I cannot lie, it kind of would be.  Tissue valves have a limited lifespan though. They are often only given to older folks. The valve I have will almost certainly last longer than I will. The newest valves, like the on-x, do not require an much blood thinners.\u00a0\n\nI love mine and got to go to where they are made. I have a ring they have me that is made of the same material and even a tattoo of it :).  \n\n That is awesome!", "yoropens these controversial fine contraptions suit my talons quite well tbh xD :3~~~ senpai", "I literally just found out that marfans exists and now I got questions I am a 22 yo female. I am 1.73 cm (5'8). People have made comments on my skinny body, long hands &amp;fingers and feet&amp; toes. However it is nothing like the pictures I see when I google marfans. I do not look particularly out of the ordinary I guess. But I do definitely have longer toes, feet, fingers etc. than average. Just nothing crazy. Mosts people describe my body and limbs as skinny and elegant. \n\nHowever, my arms are incredibly flexible and I can bend my elbows the wrong way. My legs are flexible too. I can go around my own wrist with my thumb and pinky more than easily. I have had pain in my joints occasionally all my life. I always feel short of breath and my breathing has been bad all my life too. I have migraines (no idea if this could be related). I have always had a bunch of medical issues, mostly uncomfortable rather than dangerous, that are hard to explain and confusing for doctors.  \n\n\nI guess I am hoping some of you read this and maybe tell me what you think? Should I consider getting tested?  Also, if anyone has more mild symptoms of marfans, if you feel comfortable sharing, I would love to see some pictures that are a bit less dramatic than on google, to compare. First, if you are curious, by all means you should go a specialist. **I am not expert** but *maybe* you are marfan positive. Google pictures of marfans are really exagerated. I mean, there are people like that but I think average marfan people is more normal looking.   \n\n\nLet me tell you about my case. I am 25M and always been a really tall skinny guy. Long arms, long legs, long and flexible fingers but nothing like google pics, just sighly above average. Also, I have a really hard time gaining weight even if I eat like crazy. Some day when I was 16 or 17, some doctor suggested me to go to a genetist specialist because maybe my scoliosis was \"something more\". The specialist measured my legs and found out I have a leg larger than the other by a really really tiny bit, but that was enough to make mi spine go like a snake. The breathing and heart related problems start because your spine has no room enough to your lungs and heart work properly. Luckily, I am far from that. He measured my arms and legs, checked my hands and fingers, and he also checked my eyes, because some marfans have eye problems and I have been using glasses. Maybe your migraine are related to your eye sight? I also remember that he said \"Marfan is more common that you would think\".   \n\n\nI hope this could help. I could send you a PM showing you my case if you want. Hi! I do not have Marfan, but my child does (spontaneous mutation). I can share just some thoughts and considerations. First, I completely agree with another poster in that the pictures that you google are exaggerated...to an extent, as there are some facial and body similarities shared by those who have Marfan. Next, I urge you to keep in mind that there are many connective tissue disorders. One of the most common is Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (of which there are different types!). They have similar physical traits, but many differences\u2014for instance, Marfan markers include aortic dilation and ectopia lentis, while EDS does not, though they both include hyper-mobile joints(just for starters!). All that being said, I do urge anyone and everyone to bring up concerns with their doctor. I have heard that many primary care providers can be dismissive, so if this is the case, I think the easiest place to start is with a dilated eye exam. As it is a syndrome with quite varied expression, not everyone with Marfan will have displaced lenses, though this is one of the hallmark diagnostic traits of the syndrome. After an eye exam, ask for a cardiology referral and an echo. Not an EKG. I cannot stress this enough. An EKG will give a snapshot of rhythm and rate abnormalities, but what you are looking for here are leaky valves and aortic dilation. Even if the aforementioned diagnostics are normal, I would still ask for a referral to see a geneticist. A geneticist will perform measurements, take history, etc. that will be paramount in discovering the cause of your ailments/symptoms/signs. Further, the geneticist can order appropriate testing\u2014and will also know how to go about getting approved by insurance. So, long story long, make an eye appointment and an appointment with your pcp to start the discussion! Feel free to message me with any questions. Also, The Marfan Foundation website has some incredible information. If you are on FB, the Marfan Syndrome group has great suggestions and resources. There are a lot of variations in connective tissue disorders. I started going to my children\u2019s hospital when I was 5, as a kid they said I probably have marfans or mixed connective tissue disorder. I was pretty skinny and long when I was younger, but not too flexible, no eye issues, and I had a normal arched palate. What I did have was an enlarged aortic root, mitral valve prolapse, scoliosis, and pectus excavatum.  Stretch marks came in my teens and now I know I have MASS phenotype, which is a mutation on the fibrillin-1 gene that is also concerned with marfans. I would get a get a full examination because the heart needs to be paid attention to if you do have a connective tissue disorder. glad you found this community! Feel free to ask about anything.\n\nIt is not necessary to do the genetic test unless you want to, I know it can be expensive in some countries. The important thint to do is ask about it to specialist, get a check up in your cardio (with echocardiogram) and avoid high impact activities (like soccer).\n\nI am 21 (M) and found out I have mild marfs some months ago. I am tall and skinny/athletic but nothing unusual and I have never thought it was due to a syndrome. Only my feet toes were abnormaly large but I always thought of that as a cool trivia about me lol. But the height and wheight were only pros cause I was good at sports, now I am taking more care with physical activities but life remais the same.\nand feel free to PM for pictures :)", "Can you relate to any of this?

A main pulse then a smaller one just after.\n\nAlso do any of you get anxiety about having your heart stop beating or stuff like that?\n\nAlso kind of different but does mastabating increase blood pressure and make my condition worse? Why do I feel like the first two questions are the things you did not really need from the store, and the third question was the thing you are really there to buy...\n\n1. I do not think this is a Marfan Syndrome thing. I think most people can feel this.\n2. I cannot say that I do, but I have read comments from others that allude to that anxiety.\n3. No. It is a perfectly healthy thing to do. What this guy said:\nBut also, the heart anxiety does happen, but it is not actually rooted in reality.  When I got told I needed surgery, I could not listen to echo or heartbeat sounds in a movie or something without my hands getting sweaty. Well honestly the first two were just things I was wondering if u guys can relate but then I remembered the third and yes I was a bit worried about it Totally. I was just giving you a hard time. (ahem) Wowww we The double beat you are hearing is totally natural. It is the diastole and systole periods of your heartbeat. \n\nThe diastole is your heart \"reloading\" as it relaxes and fills with blood which is the tinier first sound then the systole which is your heart \"firing\" as it contracts to actually pump your blood which is the larger second sound.\n\nI have never really been prone to anxiety so I cannot comment on the second question.\n\nAnd for the third one, I cannot see that being a problem. But with all *ahem* exertion just do not go too hard.", "Who here got bars for days?  Story time: I had a metal rod fused to my back when I was in middle school because of my severe scoliosis. Was in a torso cast for what I was told would be 9 months. One day I was in math class, maybe a few months into recovery. Totally bored, not feeling math today. I  realized: I have not once taken advantage of this whole spinal fusion thing to my benefit, and maybe today is the day. My back felt a bit itchy under the cast anyway. Fine, reason enough. I excused myself to the nurse's office complaining that my back was bothering me. It worked, mom was coming to get me, I was going to get the rest of the day off.\n\nNot without cost, mom declares that we are going to to doctor's office to get the back checked out and make sure everything is ok. That is fine, they will check it out, nothing is wrong \"huh, must have been a fluke\" and maybe I would miss a bit more school. All good. We get to the doctor, they decide they want an x-ray. Sure why not, I do not glow yet. Pics come back.... they want to cut into the cast like NOW. oooooooook.... so they cut in...\n\nApparently, the rod broke loose from the fusion and was PORTRUDING OUT OF MY BACK.\n\nAnother surgery was scheduled. In the meantime, my poor parents had to, nightly, remove the cut patch of cast from the back and clean out the open wound/protruding rod to keep it from getting infected until surgery. They cut that rod in half and fused two more rods to compensate for the now-developing Kyphosis in my spine.\n\nAll in all I was in a torso cast for over a year. Weirdly, it did change my social status at school and somehow elevated it. I guess pity is a powerful thing? Good times. Sounds like it would be painful but it also sounds like you did not feel any pain? That was a really cool story. I did not feel a thing. And to this day,  the nerves in much of my back at the skin level are dead and I do not feel anything. So you can imagine my surprise, lol.\n\nThat said, I suffer from chronic back pain now and it is pretty debilitating. The consequence of a surgery like this. Ooh ( I am waiting to get mine.  Currently in the ER with one leg not working and most functionality below the waist impaired.  Maybe this will get them. is that a before and after? It is!

Since about one year ago I have been starting to suffer from problems with emptying the bladder and I have also lost the \"sensation\" (for a lack of a better word) in my bladder. Instead of feeling as if it is full, I start to feel discomfort and sometimes pain. Been going to several urologists and a neurologist but they have not been able to pinpoint any issue.... Is there anyone here who recognizes this kind of issue? I have started thinking that maybe it is related to Marfans but I have no idea. It has started to affect my life severely so I am quite hopeful to find some solution.\n\nI would very much appreciate any advice or thoughts about this :) Only found out about marfans a week or so ago, so idk about the correlation. I do know that I have had this sensation my entire life. While my bladder and pelvic floor are very strong and I can go hours and hours without peeing. When I do have too it always feels like I cannot get the last bit out and then I have the sensation of having to pee again and again and again. Idk, always thought it was normal, strengthen my pelvic floor to the point I can push the last bit out now, but who knows. The older I get, the weirder and harder the whole peeing thing becomes, Lol. \n\nNo idea if this helps you at all, but just my personal experience. If you have any questions I am more than glad to answer anything. I recognize this, it got worse over time for me as well. I always have to return to the bathroom several times and always feel as if there is some left. It is starting to interfere with my sex life which is devastating me tbh... Thanks for sharing I had something like this when I was younger.\n\nWhen I was very small (maybe 3-4) I was not able to tell when I had to empty my bowels and because of that, I became constipated because the signal was not getting to my brain that I needed to use the restroom. What it ended up being was a ( that was affecting a nerve that apparently told my body that it had to go, it was shunted (device put in so that it would drain the cyst) and it seemed to be fine.\n\nThen, when I was 8? 9? maybe? I was in grade 5 (I am in the US, if that helps/is relevant) i started having problems knowing when I had to empty my bladder. I would not get any sensation and then very suddenly it was an incredible emergency and I needed to go to the restroom NOW. not in three minutes, NOW. Eventually things got so bad that they had to remove the rods from my spine (scoliosis) so they could send me through an MRI to see what was going on. Turns out it was the rods pushing on that cyst/shunt which was shutting off the nerve(s) again.\n\nOnce the rods were removed and I recovered, I have been fine. Bladder problems and Marfan are correlated to some extent, pelvic floor muscles contract/release depending on what is going on and as per usual that means Marfans can affect things.\n\nI am not a doctor by any means, this is not advice, just my experience. It would be worth while to talk to your doctors (urologist and neurologist, and cardiologist for that matter) about ( which was initially caused the Tarlov Cyst when I was younger, and the problems as my life has continued.\n\nThis will also occur with heart failure (specifically the type where fluid builds up around your heart/lungs) or diabetes. Again, no doctor, this is not medical advice, just some extra things to chat with your doctors about.\n\nBest of luck! Also may be worth seeing if you are getting chronic UTI's or if it is something like ( as that can ALSO present the same symptoms. Though I would figure the urologist would have caught that by now, if it was happening. I have had issues with dural ectasia and with compressed nerves.  Both are better after a steroid epidural.  Talk to your doctor. Sounds like you might be biologically female?  Dude here so take with a grain of salt but:\n\nAsk specifically for a urology referral from your GP, and also talk to your gyn, but in the meantime know that that is not *super* unusual; I have had non-marf partners with whom that issue would come up.  Just another part of the experience. Haha no that is not the case, but thanks anyways. I will try to ask for urology referral again, last times the doctor just wants to \"wait a bit\" but that basically means they wont do a thing. This was very nice advice, thanks for sharing your situation. I have been checked for UTI but it seems as if that is not the case, though I have had it several times last year for some reason. The neurologist will book a scan for my lower back apparently to see if there is an issue. Hopefully anything unusual will show up on the scans. The urologist did one of those camera things before so i guess he would have seen this by now, but thanks for the heads up that could very well have been the case. haha my bad.  I guess I inferred from the comment above it lol.\n\nGood luck.  Docs tend to focus on the \"show stoppers\" a lot I find with marfans to the point where they will ignore other things.  I have random vertigo spells and my cardio hooked me up with all sorts of madness.

Through all of the information about supplements and treatments there is, I have not been able to find anything on pain management.\nDue to the scoliosis, and the arthritis(mild, but still there), on days where the temp drops below a certain point, the pain is pretty close to unbearable, but it is always there in her back and joints at a lesser level on other days.\nWhat have folks been doing to manage pain when it becomes \"breakthrough\", or even just to maintain an active life?\n\nThanks in advance.", "What does it feel like to have a CSF leak or a craniocervical instability (c1-c2)?  I have a freakishly huge dural ectasia/Tarlov cysts that has caused chiari malformation, which causes CSF blockages and possibly small leaks. Seriously, these things are usually barely noticeable but I have a big one the size of a grapefruit and then a smaller the size of about 4cm. \n\n1: The DE/cysts were actually found during a gynecology surgery, as they were confused for massive ovarian/fallopian cysts in scans. I was already in contact with a **neurosurgeon** for the chiari malformation, which they had previously believed was congenital like most cases. I was referred back to him for this as well.\n\n2: Massive, world destroying headaches. 14/10. Suicidal pain scale. My uncle thought I was having cluster headaches like him, but I did not have the right symptoms. Coupled eventually with undeniable nausea upon standing and moving as my condition has deteriorated. If I am untreated I cannot get out of bed. My left leg is very weak and goes numb, though physical therapy has helped with that.\n\n3: Strong NSAIDs and bedrest are the best treatment for me, as surgical correction could kill me. Being on my feet for too long tends to improve my odds for tears and other complications like pinched nerves.\n\n4: My area is fairly ill equipped too, after they realized my condition was not congenital they sent me to a new neurosurgeon at Cleveland clinic. That trip is not a close one (the first neurosurgeon was already an hour away), but the doctors are top notch. maybe this explains why you act like an asshole", "Getting heart surgery in 3 weeks, what should I know? My timeline for surgery got accelerated 10 fold, what should I know going into it and after.\n\nAny reccomendations on wjat to do when your hosputalized after the procedure? He is the pain?\n\nJust want to hear others experiences Dont do what i did. Dont drink too much water. Your going to be thirsty after surgery. A LOT. You can only drink one small water every hour i believe. Because your lungs are flat and they have to go back to how it was.\n\nDont freak out when you wake up. Your going to have a tube in your mouth. \n\nThey give you a pillow to hold to your chest when you need to cough out flem.\n\nPain. Depends on the person. Your going to be drugged. But yeah depends on the person\n\nGood luck. When you get out, do a little bit of physical activity each day. Do not walk up stairs as that puts a very big strain on your heart. But walk a little and then over time increase it.\n\nBe careful with the pain meds. It is okay to feel some pain to you know your limits.\n\nDo not rush your recovery. Watch Netflix, read books, listen to music, and plan video games to help pass the time and get your mind off things.\n\nIf you live alone, maybe have someone come check on your regularly and bring healthy food. Cut sodium out of your diet and this means reading the labels of the food you buy. DONT DO WHAT I DID... absolutely give yourself time to recover. Go slow and do not push too much. You will try to walk a little more each day but do not push it, trust me on this. I am one year removed from the aorta repair and repaired chest surgery at the same time. I started to feel ok and I pushed it a little too much with activity and messed up my vestibular system and it almost ruined my life. I am just now starting to get my balance back 13 months after I lost it. I was getting terrible dizzy spells and everything. I hope you do not have that experience and it is not common, but please give yourself all the time your body needs to be well again. \n\nRecovery is a lot like a rollercoaster from what the hospital told me and also my direct experience. I would feel fine for a few days or even a few weeks and then I would head back down the track and could not get out of bed some days. Seemingly for no reason. You just have to trust the process. You are going to feel bad a lot of the time and that is ok. \n\nMy heart arrhythmias were exemplified for about a month or so after surgery. That made things rather annoying and difficult as well. But they were able to autocorrect and I kind of feel like they are better now than before. \n\nCoughing sucks after surgery and you will absolutely want to use that pillow they give you. But the real nightmare is sneezing. Oh my sweet Jesus sneezing is another experience. If you can hold in or skip sneezes like I could you will be better off. \n\nEat better after surgery, this is a great time to reset and live a healthier life. It will be tough because the anesthesia will most likely effect your tastebuds. Everything will be bland and awful. For me, sugar was just so disgusting I could not even stomach it. Hard to understate how much anesthesia can affect you after the surgery in weird ways. Naturally I was one of the people that reacts to it poorly and puked my guts out whenever I woke up. Puking directly after heart surgery is not something I would recommend 0/10. But unfortunately it may be a consequence. The flip side of that is, because I could not handle the anesthesia they had me on, they had to give me a more powerful pain killer dilaudid. It was on a drip and I got to control it. That was amazing. \n\nI actually did not come to again after surgery until the tube was being pulled out. And it was a smaller tube, not the big one they give you before surgery so you can be on Bypass. So I do not remember anything whatsoever and I am ben fuzzy about my time in ICU. \n\nThey deflate your lung so you will have to do breathing exercises with a trumpet-like thing. Do them! It sucks and they make you take deep breaths but it will help and it will work. \n\nBring games or a computer or books to read in the hospital for recovery, it can get boring. \n\nYou are going to be pricked by needles, a lot. And they usually start early also, for me it was 4:30 am everyday is when they started. \n\nI had a tickle in my throat for about two or three days I could not get rid of because I could not do that aggressive cough to hack up something from my lungs. That was really really annoying. Just ask for a cough drop or lozenge if that occurs. It was just a nuisance dealing with that on top of everything else. \n\nWhen they make you get out of bed and walk, try your best, you are trying to impress anybody. I made it from my bed to the door and back. \n\nYou do not get to shower fully for a long time, but at some point after the nurses will bathe you, or should at least. This experience for me was one of my fondest memories. It was not awkward or sexual like the jokes usually are. It was really really therapeutic for me for them to help me clean myself. \n\nChest tubes suck!!! You will have 3 or 4 of them most likely. If getting chest repair you will probably go home with one also and it will be removed at a later date. Having your tubes pulled out eventually and then sewn back together by the NP is not a pleasant experience. Ouchies but you will get through it. For me the worst part is feeling the tube slide out of your body when they pull them. They are deep also. Like 10 inches of tube inside of you deep. It is crazy. \n\nWhen I got released I literally only had to take one pain pill, one early morning because my chest was hurting and I wanted to go back to sleep. I did not suffer from pain like one might think after those two surgeries. I was sore and did not want to be touched on or near my chest but otherwise I was good. \n\nMy overall experience with surgery in the hospital was good but my time in recovery was bad because of those unforeseen consequences I experienced. It made my life impossible for this last year. They still are not sure what happened but I had my one year check up after my surgeries last Friday and...my aorta was normal size. My aortic arch was normal size. My valves are working perfectly. My chest scans look amazing and that it is all normal. I do not have to go back for more CT scans for another 4 years and I do not have to have yearly ones anymore. The repair has worked as it should have and I am made whole again. \n\nIf you are having a pectus repair with it, then your chest will feel like there are rubber bands around your chest for a long time even a year after and more. My surgeon sad that is a common complaint of most people but  all eventually go away. \n\nI am excited and positive to be all the way normal again and resume regular life. I am excited for you to have the same victory and hope your experience is good as well. If you have any questions or concerns I will gladly answer them. You are brave for doing this. \n\nThe last thing I would share was the PTSD that can come after an event like this. Do not be afraid to seek help afterward. Talking helps. Medicine, if needed can help also. It did for me. The anxiety and worry after surgery can be a very real and wicked side effect. You can beat it. You are greater than your minds worry. I assure you. Allow yourself to get the help you need from friends, family and  psychologist/doctors. I was given Oxycontin for pain, did not work, made me sick, tired, and constipated.  Alternating between acetaminophen and ibuprofen worked much better for pain management. \n\nThey will tell you to hold a pillow to your chest if you are going to cough or sneeze, do so, helped with sleeping too. \n\nI was surprised when the first day after surgery they had me get up and walk the halls every hour, walking helps recovery a lot. When I got home I would walk every day. Do not over do it but do make an effort. \n\nI developed bad depression after my surgery, took a few years to get therapy, I do *not* recommend letting your mental health slip while dealing with your physical health. I think having a therapist going into this would have been ideal. \n\nBest of luck to you! Not being able to drink after having that tube removed from my mouth was worse than the pain for me (which was not too bad unless I coughed hard) \n\nWell, first I tried to rip the tube out. And then begged for water but they would only give me small ice chips to suck on every 45 mins or so. At the time (and still being woozy from drugs) I wondered why they were being so mean. Thanks you dude, I never have read anything quite this in-depth about the surgery. At least knowing what is ahead of me helps with some anxiety. This is my first time being pit under for anything so it should be interesting.\n\nI am happy it sounds like youre doing well \u2764 Thanks for your input, been askung around looking for a new therapist, I just got out of rehab as well so this should be a bit if an emotional rollercoaster Thanks, why do they flatten your lungs? I keep hearing that and domt quite understand it. I will probably try and not overdo it with the water but I know I will at least once.\n\nWhat Is the bathroom situation like then your in there? That sounds fucking terrible, do you know if they would let you swish water in your mouth just to written it up again?\n\nNormally ice is gas but that I cannot imagine What is the reason for no sodium? \n\nIf there was anything you could do after the surgery differently, what would it be? Well, I kind of found out why they do not let you take in too many liquids\u2014I begged a tech that was doing something in my room for a cup of water and they gave it to me! And after the first gulp I threw it all up. And my nurse came running in all upset. I felt bad. \n\nAnd they would let me swish around water to get the dryness out. After your body calms down and the meds leave your system it is so much better. Ima be having the time of my life in there it sounds like Aww, well I wish you all the luck in the world. Just follow the dr/nurse instructions and you will heal wonderfully. Let everyone take care of you. Sodium raises blood pressure. \n\nIf I had a time machine I would have loved Netflix, a smart phone, etc. I had mine done ~25 years ago. All of this. Just had heart surgery in November. Be well friend This is the best reply, and I am only chiming in because 13mo the poster is still going through some things.\n\n1) Do your best (I realize it is hard) not to freak out by any specific description of what goes on.  It sounds ugly.  and it is.  But you are VERY doped up.  Hearing about it (and describing it later) is worse than when you are in it.  Trust in that if you start feeling uneasy.\n\n2) You will feel better.  Every day and every 10 mins in the start.  There is always a posistion that feels comfortable, always something, and it grows and grows.\n\n3) Do not underplay the affect of what you went through.  People assume if you are not bleeding you are 100%.  Your body takes longer to heal, and your heart is hardwired to your emotional health for evolutionary reasons, ie: \"Critical system in repair, I am making you bummed out so you sit your ass down\".  It is not uncommon for a lot of heart surgery people to sleep with a light on for a while after the fact.  It will not make you non-functional, but knowing about it helps and makes it easier to be easier on yourself.  This was the hardest and longest lasting part for me.  Scheduled or not, you got in a knife fight and lost.  Your monkey brain is wired for that.  Be easy on yourself 10 months from now when it is easy to forget that because you are physically feeling so much better (and you will feel great, believe me!).\n\n4) Spend some time making your nest.  Helps you feel in control and makes recovery more cozy.  Put clothes on shelves at chest level.  Get one of those grabby deals for socks on the door.  Soap on a rope in the shower.  A lot of this stuff you wont need long but it helps for the first week or so.  Also:  GET A HOSPITAL BED FOR HOME.  The height and motion make it easier to get in/out as well as deal with comfortable sleeping posture.  Insurance should cover under \"durable medical equipment\".  If your policy does not, you can buy one of craigs list (does not need to be to fancy) and sell it for close to what you got it for.  If you cant do that, at least put your bed on risers.  Goal is to have your hips at matress level.\n\n5) Videogames and movies.  Doubtful you will make it through many books.  Get the TV close to bed, tie to controller (and remote) to a string incase they fall off (things on the floor do not exist).  Do not worry about sleep patterns for a bit, they will be all screwy.  Figure out the headphone situation so you do not drive people in the house nuts.\n\n6) Restating number 1.  ALL of this is way more intimidating before than after.  It DOES suck, but you just kind of... get through it.  The mental affect is real.  From when I knew I needed surgery my palms would get sweaty if I heard a heartbeat in a movie or something.  It is normal.  Everything you are going through is normal, it is been done before.  You are tough enough and you are going to do great. At least you had one gulp. I thought a janitor was a nurse. Asked him for water many times. Bad move. I almost od'd on all that water. I had to go to the icu to get my stomach pump because i drank too much. Not fun. Not sure. They get flat when they work on you. As for bathroom. They insert a catheder for that. As for num 2. If you can walk go to the bathroom. If not a bedpan. I also forgot. They have this little breath toy that you blow in to get your lung power back. Like i said. Lungs flatten. So its going to be hard at first since you are not 100 percent. When you go home. They give you the breath toy so you can work on your lung power. It is going to hurt. A lot. I do not know what type of surgery you are going to have, but I had a full-on sternum cracker when I had my aortic valve replaced. I have also had an exploratory stomach surgery to repair an ulcer, a laparoscopic hernia repair, and a blood patch.\n\nYou will wake up intubated, and that is a level of suck you did not know existed, until they extubate you (which hurts), and you are throat is so raw that you would sell your firstborn for a glass of water, which they will not give you. Eventually you will be back to eating (shitty hospital food) and drinking, but your chest is going to feel like someone sawed it in half (because that is exactly what happened) and you are going to have nurses poking and you and prodding you am interrupting your sleep cycle. At some point they will remove your drainage tubes (and that is an unforgettable experience) and yank the catheter. You will have to breath in to an intensive spirometer, and they will make you walk, which feels like climbing Mount Everest.\n\nAnd you know what? *You will live through it.* Pain is for the living. You will have a couple of weeks of misery, and *then it will be over.* And if you think about how miserable you are going to be in advance, you will be less miserable when the time comes. You will not *enjoy* it, because it is miserable, but you will *survive* it.\n\nListen to what your nurses and doctors say. Do not be afraid to advocate for yourself, especially if you are at teaching hospital and the trainees want to use you as a pincushion. Do not be too proud for painkillers. Try to get good food. Before you go in, have selected some movies and TV series to watch\u2014a lot of recovery is just sitting around being bored. \n\nBest of luck! Smoke and prayers headed your way. I forgot about the depression. Yeah some days will be like shit. 2006 for me. Netflix wasnt really that big yet. So i had a ton of dvds. All of this. So true. Lots of resting and sleep. I think it was 5 months in where you had to go for physio rehab. At least that is what i had to do. Not sure about other people.", "Activities for kids.. My son and I both have Marfan syndrome and I am just curious as to what other parents have put there kids in the case activities. I know he is not able to play 99% of sports. I want him to have something he gets to do though.. my mom growing up never really followed any of restrictions so I am not to sure.. Thanks in advance for the help!! My son is still a baby but I am just thinking ahead! In my teens and the only entertainment I really have is video games. Hiking and camping is an excellent thing to get into.  It is generally low impact and can actually have many benefits.  Its important to develop a sense of appreciation for what your body can do, not just what it cannot.  I was also able to rock climb which helped me a lot.  Heavy backpacking may not be advisable (although I was able to), but regular hikes are usually a great way to push yourself safely and a great bonding opportunity for you both.\n\nAs I got older I got really into dual-sport motorcycles, especially after surgery when I could not climb, but that is perhaps not recommended. It really depends on your son's individual symptoms. In my family the heart has not been an issue and we all played sports and work jobs involving heavy lifting. \n\nThat said, if your son does have restrictions try encouraging an interest in the arts. Music, painting, writing. Think outdoors. Hiking and camping are great family-fun activities. I would also advise getting your son in to target shooting and/ or fishing at an early age. In addition to being fun, both these sports provide opportunities for mentorship and mastery that are hard to find outside of organized sports. Swimming! Great at any age for marfan patients.\n\nThat said, our doctor advised us that at an early age, when sports are not yet competitive, they are an excellent thing for the child. Get them doing it while they can. Not OP but target shooting is an excellent idea! Gymnastics is good for toddler/preschool age. Helps with coordination.\n\nMy kids take swim lessons and do scouts.  My oldest is struggling to find hobbies but we got him an RC car and he is really enjoying that.   I love all of these ideas thank you guys!! I was actually thinking of gymnastics or dance maybe. Obviously getting it okayed first! I am worried about having trouble finding hobbies. His dad is very sports and military and does not really understand he will not get to do things. (His doctors have already mentioned surgery for when he is older if his aorta keeps growing)  I will have to ask his Dr. about it!! If he can at least play them for a little bit that would be awesome! And it make his dad happy for sure.  I live in the perfect area for all those things!! I will have to look into all of that stuff. And it is stuff that I can enjoy also which sounds even better!! Thank you!! I just want him to grow up knowing that is still plenty of stuff he can do also!  go on wintersport, he will love it  Thank is kind of what my surgeon told me when I told him my cardiologist told me I cannot run. He said if my aorta is going to tear it is going tear either way so to not my entire life on hold and still do the things that make me happy.  Swimming helps because it is not hard on joints. I do it a lot with my dad (he does not have it but i do)", "Experiences with COVID19 as a Marfan patient? Anyone with Marfans who was tested positive for COVID19? What were your experiences with having the virus? I noticed there has not been a thread on experiences of Marfan patients who were positive with the virus. Well I tested positive for anti bodies if that counts. The serology report showed 96% antibodies. I was very ill for about 2-3 days, self medicated with zinc tablets and other multivitamins and got better. It was like a seasonal flu in my case. Did not get the covid test done as the illness was quite brief. Just got the anti body test few weeks later for my peace of mind. I was positive on November of 2020 and I was not illness or something like make me weak, I think that I was very lucky", "Echocardiograms Hi all,\n so I have been assessed in the past by my General Practitioners (two different doctors, two different occassions) by matching me up to the criteria of marfans (the standard stuff; tall, slim, pectus excavatum etc). This was because it was, both times, brought up by me due to my similarity with some features; tall, slim, crowded teeth, high palate, mild pectus excavatum (although I believe that was because I was squashed at birth, as my arm fits perfectly into it). So, as I say, the gp's checked my heartbeat and neither were convinced on the seperate occasions, however one sent me off to get an x-ray of my chest to check that side of things was okay (the bone stuff). Results; all is well. The second time I saw my GP one said I could \"rule it out\".\n\nMonths later I went to a pre-op for a deviated septum surgery and the pre-op guy had it on his computer something about marfans regarding me. So they did a test (not sure what it was, my apologies) where they stuck loads of wires all over me and let this machine do its thing, to do with my heart. That was all good, then they listened to my heart and he thought he heard a murmur, another woman came in and she listed to my heart and agreed that she also heard it. She then spoke to me about marfans (explaining it and stuff). She asked about my family history, I said no heart problems at all (that I know of), we are tall skinny folk. Another doctor said it *could* be a mutation, but my family seem to look like me anyways and hold my features. I was sent for an echocardiogram anyhow.\n\nResults are I am fine, all is well. I should have said earlier, I am 18 years old, male. The man phoned me back up and said I have been cleared and that I have been assessed (with marfans being the primary concern). So he said distinctively I do not have it, with confidence...\n\nHowever, I *feel* as though it would be wise to maybe try and get another echo a few years? Not sure how easy that is (I live in UK btw) can I please have your thoughts? \n\nThank you so much for reading I know I ramble.

I See a cardiologist twice a year, and annual screenings echo/ ekg, and MRI if necessary. At this point it is still just watch and wait.", "Possible marfans. Anybody relate? Hi there. Not sure where to begin. \n\nLast August I got submitted to hospital for inverted t-waves after I went to a walk in clinic for persistent heart palpitations. I had a few ECGs and blood pressure taken, but the doctor suspected I had Marfan's syndrome. This was news to me as i have never heard of it, and i would just hit 31 years old. I was shaking like a leaf from cold in the hospital, and the doctor was feeling my hands and toes. \n\nI have had some follow up tests since then. Chest x-ray, echo, bloods. I think they were searching for a disease rather than possible Marfan's. They all came back clear. I also just had a seven-day monitor removed from me, and i am waiting on the results. \n\nI have been doing some gentle looking up on Marfan's, as I do not want to spook myself. However, it all fits. I am myopic, with astigmatism. I am only 6'1, but i am very lean - considered underweight by BMI even though I eat whatever and whenever I feel like. I have actually had times in my life where i have tried to get in shape and eat well, but i have not seen any difference in my weight. I feel the cold incredibly badly, especially in my fingers and toes (I know that is normal, but I shiver like a leaf). I have always had the odd palpitation with my heart too, but I put that down to my mother having a heart murmur. Worst of all though is my back and joints. Since my youth my elbows and knees have clicked dreadfully, but my back has been horrid since my early twenties, and i have had herniated discs. I live in near constant back and hip pain, but no doctors take me too seriously. This despite I walk a lot of the time, and try to stay active. My wrists, knuckles, ankles and knees click like tin drums, and my right shoulder makes more noise than I can possibly imagine. When I went to see my GP about it, he said my shoulders possibly hypermobile - he said that my joints moved really freely. My chest is only 34 inches, and my ribs are easy to spot. \n\nSince my little episode last summer my heart has been stressing a lot more easily. Just a simple jog up the stairs seems to take longer to recover from. I am also really feeling the cold this year despite it being comparatively mild. I am a twin (non-identical), but my brother has actually had weight issues in the past, unlike me. I am far more slender than my family, especially my mother's side, where all the guys are broad and bulky. \n\nSo that is my story. Does this resonate with anyone? I actually do not mind the idea of having this syndrome (if indeed I have it at all) because it fits. I have always been gaunt, skinny and looked underdeveloped for my age. I actually only look about 21 despite being a decade older. So this potential diagnosis would go some way to explaining it all. It would also mean maybe some doctors would start taking me seriously. \n\nThanks for reading. ", "Anxiety for heart echo I am 19 and I show some symptoms of Marfan. Doc ordered an echocardiogram. It is in 2 days and I am really scared they are going to find something.\n\nDo you guys have any stories or reassurances that might help me feel better or less worried?\n\nHow can I brace myself for if I do get bad news?\n\nAnd if everything looks normal, how do I deal with the uncertainty of still possibly having Marfan (this is, assuming I am not able to do gene testing)? Perhaps you are looking at it the wrong way. Consider this: if the tests come back that you have an issue with your heart, or even Marfan syndrome, yes it is a shock but if you stop and think about it, nothing has changed about you. The heart issue has been there, the Marfan syndrome has always been there. The only difference now is that you would know about it. And that puts you in a position of power, because now you know about it, now you can act on it, and now you can make sure you will be ok. Imagine if you did not take initiative and did not know? But now you can take action.\n\nI know that seems like little comfort, but if you can manage to approach challenges like this from a positive perspective, it makes a world of difference. The reality is that even if you do have Marfan syndrome, you will still wake up you tomorrow. You will still feel like you. You are not going to be a different person. Your life may not even change all that much. You will be restricted from contact sports and the like, but I think you will find that life will be what it always has for you. Do not get me wrong, it is totally ok and natural to feel anxiety about it, but that will pass. You will be fine. And we are all here if you need to talk. Do not worry! I remember having anxiety but then having the tests done and knowing exactly what the issue was (and what the issue was not) alleviated a lot of my anxiety.\n\nthe anxiety of not knowing is generally worse I was in your same situation just a month ago. You will get through it I promise. Went to a checkup on my birthday where my doctor thought she heard a murmur. Got my echo the same day where they found out I am at 4.3 cm. But the important thing is now I am on beta blockers and I know what to watch out for. I promise that if you find out something is wrong you will be glad you found out now instead of a couple years down the road. I have kind of accepted it in a way, I told myself I have been like this since the moment of conception and I have lived this far with it pretty much worry free. Hope you can come to terms with it my friend. I was in this exact same situation back in January man. I was highly suspected for marfan's in 2014 where I had an echo. Then I did not have another echo until this January lol almost 6 years!  \n\n\nbut what you have to know man, is that, even if your heart's aorta is dilated, the next step is just to keep an eye on it. Take medications and then come back 6-months to a year later to look out for any abrupt change.  \n\n\nFor your question on, how do I deal with the uncertaintiy of still having marfans - well, I am also in this same boat. The answer to this is, it does not really matter, as long as you get your heart checked constantly, you should live a normal life.  ", "So am I positive for the wrist sign? ", "How to Progress Hi Everyone first time here. I am a 22 year old male, graduating from college soon.\n\nI have Marfans genetically in my family, got tested, but came up negative even though I passed all the physicality tests for Marfans by the doctors. I have had the heart pain, where it feels like something is clamping on your heart, and you just hope to god that it stops. I have large hands, small wrists. 6' 8\" wingspan when 6' tall.\n\nI have difficulty gaining weight, been trying to put mass on my joints to protect them from injury. I have had injuries that have lasted years, physical therapy does not help, acupuncture, cupping etc. \n\nI guess I am trying to ask: how do you deal with it? I do not think I am unhealthy, but at the same time, I feel that if I do have Marfan's, how to deal with it because at the moment I let it dictate what I do and how I should live.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated, sorry my thoughts may seem skattered. Well, every one deals with it differently. For my pain I use a combo of naproxen and medical marijuana mixed with cbd, like a combo of half high thc half cbd green. In terms of cupping and acupuncture, the only value that will offer will be through any sort of placebo effect that you might be able to get out of it- something that can be fairly beneficial. \n\nIf you mean like how do you live with the idea of having a chronic disease, that is something that I think everyone goes through stages in their life. At some point you are able to accept that you are going to be able to live a fairly good life for a pretty long time thanks to modern medicine, with a relatively high quality of life-depending on how well you take care of yourself and take preventive care.\n\n\nMy perspective on that is mostly from working in a nursing home for a couple of years, meeting people with other chronic diseases, and watching folks pass and go through their own stages of grief. Chronic disease is kind of like that, in that there are different stages of acceptance that you will go through. \n\nBe really careful with your mental health as well. I have heard anecdotal accounts from cardiologists and psychiatrists about folks with marfans having higher rates of depression, and that can be an issue for folk with chronic diseases. Eat food. Get treatment for anxiety. Accept the results of your genetic test. You do not have it just because family members do, and you cannot have MFS without a genetic mutation. \n\nCalm down. \n\n22 is still really young for a guy to be worried about his figure. A lot of dudes do not fill out til their mid 20s or thirties. I could have written this about my DS. Everything positive except the gene. We were told by one of the leading Dr\u2019s in the field that he most certainly has a connective tissue syndrome and it just has not been genetically identified. Dr advised to use same precautions as if he had the gene. He gets an echocardiogram yearly to monitor his aortic root valve dilation. You are right to be concerned about your health.  Find a Dr familiar with connective tissue syndromes so they can be actively looking for changes during your yearly physicals.", "Do I have marfans? Worried  Hello.

This will probably end up being a long post...\nSo 2 years ago, my uncle died from an aneurysm in the aorta. He was literally having sex after taking viagra, and collapsed for the first time. He was taken to the hospital but sadly the medical efforts were not enough... he passed a couple of days after the incident. Heart failure.\n\nAfter the event, it was discovered that he had Marfans syndrome. Never diagnosed before. The follow-up to that was that earlier this year my mother finally took the dna exam. Today I learned that it was confirmed this past week that she also has the mutation. Which brings my brother (18yo) and I (26yo) to a 50% chance of having it (I believe that is how it works, right?).\n\nWell in my case symptons are the following: my severe myopia (that I have addressed with lasik surgery), countless cartilage and joint pain episodes (wrist, shoulders, knee, slight scoliosis). Dental structure problems growing up. My little brother, on the other hand, had only mild myopia, but is much taller and thinner than myself. He also suffers joint problems and also had his dental corrections at a young age (but then again, nowadays it seems like every kid had braces at one point). We have long limbs, long fingers. I have a big nose and big ears, just like my uncle had.\n\nWhat is killing me is that I have passions and my lil brother also has passions, that may have to be interrupted because of this potential diagnosis. We like to work out, I have recently picked up rock climbing and fell in love with it. I like running and hiking and swimming. The possibity of having marfans is giving me crippling anxiety, I have had 2 panic attack episodes (unrelated stuff) in the past and I am scared that knowing about my mom's exam might spiral into another one. I fear for my brothers health, I fear about my future children which may also have a 50% chance of having the mutation.\n\nI am trying to stay grounded until we both do our genetic exams and find out once and for all.\n\ntldr: uncle died from undiagnosed marfan. mom has confirmed marfan. I fear for my brother and I....", "Fingerprints do not work? Is there anybody else here whose fingerprints do not work for unlocking cell phones and laptops?  I also have a difficult time getting fingerprinted for work.\n\nScanners really do not like my prints. I am required by law to be printed for work, and the scanner they used required so many attempts at scanning that they almost sent me home.  My prints also do not really work on mobile devices. I can get enough decent reads to eventually set my cell phone scanners, but they then almost never subsequently work.\n\nWhen I eyeball what is different about my prints, I assume it is because they have lots of \"cracks\" in them - I can see lots of small broken lines through my whorls.\n\nI think, if I committed a crime, a prints expert could easily identify my prints bc they do not really look like those of other people, but when computers try to compare my prints, I think all the cracks confuse the machines - the shapes mine make are not readable by the pattern matches bc the machines are based on expected normal patterns - and mine do not comply.\n\nI have assumed this is because I am a marf - but I actually cannot find any research about it anywhere. Never heard of that as a characteristic of Marfans but it is great it you want to take up a life of crime! Hm interesting! When I was fingerprinted for a background check. My fingers did not scan well either but the tech told me it is probably because I use moisturizer so much even though I washed my hands and used sanitizer.. I also have deep grooves in almost all of my prints. Sometimes my phone takes a few times to unlock but I also blame this on moisturizer.. have not thought about it being related to Marfans Interesting, fingerprint readers do not really work for me either and on closer inspection there are sort of deep grooves across my fingerprints. I have trouble with the biometric scanners at work too. I always figured it was because my skin is pretty dry all the time and my fingers are always cold. Not sure if this would work for the scanner at your job but try scanning the same finger multple times onto your phone. I had this same problem but I entered in the same finger four times and it works now. I have never heard of that personally. How is your eyesight and how long are your fingers? I am just curious because very recently I had difficulty using a fingerprint scanner but it was totally my eyesight and really, really long fingers working against me. I have horrible eyesight - I just went to the eye doc for this year's glasses, and they are a -13.5.  My fingers are also quite long.  But I do not use my eyes for fingerprint scanners... not the one on my phone, or the one that is supposed to work on my laptop (HP Notebook).  I can occasionally use my phone print scanner, but it so infrequently works that I generally do not bother trying.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI might do what Under\\_score66 suggested and scan the same finger in a whole bunch of time, like they are all different fingers.  :)  That very well might work.", "Which healthcare insurance is best for marfans? I got a new job in San Francisco and have to choose between cigna epo 30, cigna ppo 500, or kaiser platnum. I am coming from canada so i have no experience with private health care. I need physio and massage for my joint issues, heart check ups, eye checks for my dislocated lenses etc. \n\nAny advice would be hugely appreciated :) Hey. American healthcare is awful, I am also in sf on tech health insurance.\n\nHappy to give you advice. But the policy names and numbers do not really narrow it down for me. UCSF has amazing support for Marfans, and Kaiser is another expert in the area. I would lean away from Kaiser. \n\nIf you want to dm me and share the policy documents that your HR team gave you I am willing to have an opinion. \n\nWith no context, ppo 500 is most likely to be best, but I need more info to give better advice. I live in the Netherlands, here you pay 120 euros per month and you are insured for everything.  It is also mandatory to be insured. I have had 2 open heart operations and have not had to contribute anything myself.  What is the cost in America for such an operation? Thousands without insurance How do you pay it then, it is mortgage money I have spent around $7-$10k (USD) per year on my medical since I have been 26. It is nearly impossible. A personal account of mine , when I was 16 my parents lost their jobs and also their insurance. In the states it is cheaper to go through your parents insurance until you are 25. Well since they did not have any, fast forward to me being 20, working minimum wage jobs trying to go to school. I have not been to the doctor in years so I go for a check up. I explain my marfans n they Recommend I get an MRI. Doctor visit alone to get a referral, $120, to get an MRI?? $1600. Just to tell me how I am lookin. Needless to say I was never able to schedule it. How could I ? It is been another 3 years and still have yet to receive an MRI simply bc I cannot afford it. So honestly I am just waiting for a more worth while time. I do not feel like anything\u2019s wrong but of course I would like to know. But what can I do. Just got to wait til I find a good job that will give me benefits or find a way to get the money through presumably my own business. It really sucks that this is the system people fight to keep rather than universal health care. Do not even get me started on pre-existing conditions which are loop holes insurance companies to get out of paying you even though you are covered. They can straight up say \u201cwell you heart has always been messed up so why should we pay for it?\u201d , they feel like they should only pay for unexpected things It is hard to live like this, hopefully everything will be fine for you, I am rooting for it Just had one. So far the bills to insurance are around $280k. \n\nI paid the yearly max of $4800. We have pretty good insurance. I could not afford insurance in my early 20s (temp employee, super crappy insurance would have been like 40+% of my paycheck). Buying through parents was not an option at the time. \n\nI ended up finding a medical study that did annual heart echos as a part of the study. Had to drive a couple hours away but beats being homeless or starving in order to afford medical care. Got a full time job with insurance around when that ended. I will look into this, thank you , really Yeah, American health insurance sucks. My parents literally sold the farm after my uninsured dad had to have open heart when he was young. Not being rude, but I would stay in Canada just for the health care. Healthcare in the United States is very expensive. Unless they are paying for the whole policy. I pay almost $250USD every two weeks from my paychecks. I also have to pay a $1,000 deductible and a $3,000 out of pocket max. The stuff that is paid by the deductible is not always counted toward out of pocket and vice versa. But those two things need to be fully met before my insurance starts to think about paying for 100% of everything. Usually it is they pay 80%, I pay 20%.\n\nIn the late 00s/early 2010s I had a slew of surgeries and hospital stays that involved drilling into my skull as well as opening up my back. JUST to open up my back cost almost $150,000. Thankfully my mom had good insurance and I was young enough to stay on it.\n\nAn ambulance ride isnt always covered by insurance despite it being an emergency, and going less than a mile easily runs you at $1,000-2,500.\n\nTechnically not all hospitals can kick you out or prevent you from getting help, but usually they want payment up front so a lot of people with medical problems but no insurance will go as long as they can without getting looked at, usually when it is fully unbearable and you can no longer ignore it. Then what? You sit in debt for the rest of your life.\n\nI am still paying off $20,000 from two years ago when I could not breathe after moving.\n\nThe American healthcare system does not exist if you are poor. It is pathetic and awful. But being disabled keeps you from leaving to other countries as well as you are viewed as a burden and can easily be denied citizenship due to being ill. You are pretty much stuck.\n\nSorry for rambling! It sounds awful, the headaches you can get from such debts, and the time you cannot work. \n It is very special because if you can no longer work completely, how do they solve it in America, you are simply dumped in the garbage.  Mandatory health reduces a lot of the stress and burden.  A lot of strength", "Retina detachment, eye floaters Have you ever had eye floaters? Yeah I do not think much of it should I? Floaters are quite normal and common. I have always had a few small floaters, sometimes they come and go. They are most noticeable for me when I am looking at a white wall.  \n\n\nHowever, if you have a sudden increase of them or your vision seems like it is \"snowing\" - it is cause for concern.\n\n Retinal Detachment Symptoms:\n\n* dots or lines (**floaters**) suddenly appear in your vision or suddenly increase in number.\n* you get **flashes of light** in your vision.\n* you have a dark \"curtain\" or shadow moving across your vision.\n* your vision gets suddenly blurred.  \n\n\nSource: ( My son has Marfans, which is why I sub here, but completely unrelated I had a retinal detachment diagnosed a couple of months ago and had emergency eye surgery.\n\nIn retrospect, the big warning sign was a brownish/greyish 'patch' in my vision. I could see through it but it would appear sometimes. The big different here is that it was always in the same place.\n\nI was approximately 3mm from losing vision in one of my eyes.\n\nIf you have concerns, go and see your eye doctor immediately. Mine saved my sight in that eye. My retina got detached last year and i had seen a floater that did not go away. But if u see only floaters then its nothing but if u see flashes then its time for the doctor I have floaters and flashes. I was told by an ophthalmologist that the flashes were harmless and basically to only go back if I had \"the curtain\" effect. So I found a new one who hopefully knows what they are doing because I am pretty sure flashes are not okay\\~ I have a TON of floats, like a TON that block a lot of my vision. This is due to some trauma I sustained when I was younger. I have been evaluated more than 5 times by retinologist and several different ophthalmologists and my retina is fine.   \n\n\nWhen it comes to retinal detachment, the most worrying sign is the sudden onset of a black curtain that is coming down through your vision. Sudden onset of many floaters might also be a sign. However, more commonly people experience flashes.\n\n  \nIf you start seeing flashes of light and/or a dark curtain in your vision, then head to the hospital immediately. However, you should still get your floaters checked out in the future just in case for any subtle retinal tears which could, in the future, lead to a retinal detachments.  \nRetinal tears are treated with lasers in the office, so, it is nothing major. How you coop with your floaters? Have you gotten used to it? Yes, mostly. There is a very large amount of floaters in my eyes though. So sometimes they really annoy me and do not let me read. So, what I do is that I \"roll my eyes around\" until they get out of my central vision. I am very gentle when I do this, though.   \n\n\nAlso, despite being huge, they have lost their intensity over the years and the brain does 'filter' them out mostly. Sometimes they are only visible when looking at a lit white background or the sky. Are you asking if floaters happen with a detachment? Yes. They do. I had a retinal tare followed by a complete detachment. First there was a pop in my eye. Like a light show went off. Then I was missing a tiny corner of my vision and I was seeing crazy floaters. Eventually my entire retina detached.", "Dislocating a shoulder to the point of passing out? Just wondering if this has happened to anyone else.

I did not hyperventilate, I was not even nervous, but after the pain of popping it back into place I actually fully fainted. \n\nAnyone else?

He never does exercises and is kind of healthy but with exams he discovered a fracture on his shoulder that he has no idea where it came from.\n\nHe is now ok but it is good to get it checked. Maybe can be solved with some physio or gym. Almost fainted the second time. It did not feel any worse than usual. Third time felt like usual. \n\nYou are not a wimp.

As it does you feel a slight tug at two points across from each other at the edge of the eye. Interesting Same thing happens to me, and it is not painful to me it just makes me sometimes nauseous or dizzy and it is very distracting.

Now I know you guys cannot diagnose, and I am not even necessarily looking for a diagnosis, but I am worried about his heart and want him to get it checked out. What is the front line test which screens for Marfan's heart problems -- an echocardiogram? Can he just walk into his GP's office and ask for an echocardiogram, or will they need \"signs\" that something is wrong before they give him one? Would a simple EKG show it if something was wrong?\n\nAnd -- I guess my biggest question is -- should he/do you think he will have to first get tested for Marfans before he can get screened for the heart stuff? I know getting the Marfans diagnosis can be complicated and lots of docs do not know what they are talking about. I worry that pursuing that diagnosis will just be exhausting and for this reason it seems easier to just skip to checking out the heart to see if anything's wrong there. But I am not sure if docs will be willing to go along with that logic.\n\nFor what it is worth, he does have a high resting heart rate (have not measured yet, but when we are lying in bed his breathing is like 2x as rapid as mine), but that might just be because he takes stimulants for his adhd. \n\nThanks guys for your help.

His GP will probably have some basic understanding of what to look for in Marfan's. As you noted, the biggest issue to be concerned about is the heart -- an aneurysm, specifically. With a fast heart rate and Marfan's appearance, he should be able to get a referral to a cardiologist who can order an echo and make sure his aorta is not enlarged and look for any potential valve issues. Thanks! I have many symptoms of Marfan's but not a diagnosis yet. Around 1 week ago I got an echocardiogram and next week I have an echocardiagraph. While I am only 17 and my heart may not yet be affected by marfan syndrome, my GP still directed me to the ECGs. If they cannot find anything wrong with my aortic, I will probably get a genetic test.

It has caused me a lot of trouble and I owe it some good percent of my insecurities and low self-esteem. \n\nI do not often go to the beach/pool, I never dare to use the gym showers, it is weird to hug people or even tie my hair with people standing in front of me. But in the last couple of years, I have started to think about how it would be to have sexual contact with someone and suddenly have to deal with a weird or questioning look telling me \"what the heck you got there?\"\n\nIt scares the hell out of me.\n\nI have had chances of getting some sexual contact with boys, but never really go any further. I immediately avoid it, take a step back and try to distract them from their intentions but I am sure at some point of my life I will not be able to do that anymore.\n\nMy breasts are small, so there is no way I can cover it.

My experience with both men and women that like breasts, is that they like breasts and they are not at all as concerned with my ridgey sternum as I am. \n\nIt is a really hard thing to *personally* overcome, though, and do not underestimate seeing a therapist if you have the resources. Putting all your insecurities on a partner that sees you as perfect despite your imperfections is burdensome and can ruin a relationship. Because of your unique situation, I think it is really important to make sure you are in a committed, loving relationship with a person you can trust before you get physical with someone. \n\nOnce you have trust with your partner, talk to them about your insecurities with your body. Tell them what you are worried about and what you are afraid of. This needs to happen before you get physical. You will probably learn that your partner is insecure about a few things with their own body too. \n\nOnce you have talked about it, you will be able to relax, have fun and be in the moment when you are getting physical with your partner.\n\nYou have a beautiful body. You deserve to be loved physically and to enjoy the experience without feeling paranoid. So you need to talk about how you are feeling with your partner first. Ok, so... older dude here. Married, kids, all that.\n\nFirst, I want to tell you that what you are feeling - the insecurity, etc. - is totally normal. I do not just mean for people with marfan syndrome, but in general. Granted, we tend to have a bit more to feel insecure about, but I guarantee you that probably most women out there are insecure about their bodies, and low-key panicking that one of their breasts are bigger than the other, or for a million other reasons.\n\nNow, as someone who grew up with a concave chest, I know exactly how you feel. I only went swimming with a shirt on. I was excused from gym, to my great relief, so I did not have to deal with that. But I was terrified about what girls would think about this giant cave-in in my chest.\n\nYou will be relieved to know that literally no one cared about it. In fact, it had weirdly the opposite effect. My partners actually found it to be incredibly intimate. Something only they got to see. A secret only they shared with me. And it did not bother any one of them. And believe me, it was a deep cavity. \n\nNow, you might be thinking - 'ok, it is different for women and men' and you are right. For you, this will probably be even less of an issue. Boys around your age, and I am going to get a little real here, we do not give a damn if you have a unique feature like that, a deformity, whatever. Those are boobs. Awesome.\n\nNow, me telling you this is not going to magically make you feel better. But you will see what I am talking about the first time you share with someone your secret. And as you get older, I promise you will care less. I swim without a shirt now, and now it is even worse, cause I have massive scars all over my torso. People notice, of course, but we all have scars. You are beautiful. Go get you some. Jumping in to say \"what this guy said\".  Same experience.\n\nSex is gross and wonderful.  Bodies are weird and amazing.  There is no exception to this rule.  Every single person you meet will have insecurities as a result.   People with Marf just have a name for it.\n\nThe best thing is to not be shy about it but not let it define you.  Your partner may have questions, and very likely from a good place.  And do not worry about any physical preferences that may result.  Before surgery I would routinely have to move my partners hand if they were resting it on my concave chest (did not hurt, just uncomfortable).  After surgery I can only have their head rest on one side of my chest without it being uncomfortable.  When you are self conscious this seems like a big deal, I can promise it is really not.  Sharing a bed with another human always involves their little \"quirks\" re: physical/spatial needs.\n\nHere is the breakdown on the deal we get with marf:  You are going to be insecure, and you will have to work through that.  All of us saying that is not going bring you to peace with your body on its own (although always feel free to vent!).  The upside of this deal is that while most people without a named condition never come to peace with their body, you are forced to.  Once you have you will find it is an incredibly rare, attractive feature people will be drawn to. \n\nSimilarly, every relationship requires communication of physical preferences/needs.  Most people suck at this, but you will be better.  Your partners are going to be more comfortable communicating on their end as a result, and the relationship is going be more satisfying.\n\nSounds like halmark movie stuff, but it is why I have wound up with partners I had no business \"getting\" more than a few times over the years. I am a 24 (m) and I have a convex chest. I get where you are coming from, but I did not chance anything at all when I was in middle/high school and I absolutely regret it. I am not saying it will be easy, but you should take a chance with a guy you like and trust. All I can say is that like the others your post is a \"been there\" one. I was also very insecure about my chest - I went to great lengths to avoid showing it to anyone. In the next few years of your life you will meet people that are wiser than high schoolers and you will realise that it is not as big a deal as you thought it was. \n\nJust ask yourself whether you would care about something like that in your partner, the same applies to most other people too. You sound exactly like me when I was younger (32f). My protruding chest bugged me so much that I  had corrective surgery for my sternum. Surgery honestly did not solve any of my insecurities- my collarbone still protrudes and now I have weird scars. When I first started becoming intimate I did it completely the wrong way in that I relied on alcohol to make me brave. And before I would take my shirt off I would say \u2018oh btw, my bone sticks out a little\u2019. It took a few years of dating different guys to realize that none of them actually cared. I have tiny boobs so I do not think a big boob guy would have been into me enough to get to that point if that makes sense. My husband, who I think is the best guy in the whole world, did not care at all. He did ask questions, but more because he was concerned from the health perspective. Anyways, you will be perfectly fine. You only live once so do not let this hold you back. Everyone has their issues, Marfan just happens to be ours. My partner has Marfans and I remember the first time I saw his bare concave chest I was concerned. \nThere was nothing gross or disgusting about it - all I cared about was not doing anything that could cause pain or discomfort.\n\nAnyone you are with who cares for you would be more keen on making you see how they view you which is beautiful. I know you mean well with this comment, but I do not think this applies to many people\u2019s lives. I think you should make a decision to have casual sex or pursue a long term relationship, but the syndrome should not dictate that. I am 20 year old with similar insecurities (only difference-sunken sternum). It was hard for me to accept Marfan syndrome and this body.  I do not know what should I say but I guess reading these supportive comments whenever we feel insecure might help us be confident again.", "Does anyone else here have issues dating? Like my confidence is so messed up. When I diagnosed with marfans it shocked me. I had always been really skinny and insecure but I though maybe I had a high metabolism. Turns out that was not the case. I was also diagnosed with hyper mobility syndrome to go along with it. Everyone growing up told me to eat a cheese burger or get some muscles cause nobody will date a guy who is skin and bones. I am not mad at them ofc cause at the time I did not know I actually had a medical condition. But dating just seems so much harder for me. I hate it when girls turn my condition into a fetish to. Idk where to go and do not know what to do", "Looking for Marfan's that also have fibromyalgia, and some advice (x-post r/chronicpain)  I do not have fibro, but I do have some pretty severe pain issues when they are around, most days I am okay, but some days are just too much. Mostly cold days during the US upper midwest winters, most other days of the year I am okay.\n\nMost of my pain is in my hip(s) and one particular spot on my back. My back they attribute to a nerve in that area being pinched, this is aggravated when my posture is exceedingly poor, otherwise I am usually fine. My most problematic area is my hip(s). My hips are collapsing in on themselves and well, that comes with a lot of pain. Mostly arthritic pain, so I am not sure how helpful I will be.\n\nThings they have suggested to me to try and help with my pain, (I am very sorry in advance, I am not sure what they would be called outside of the US):\n* Effexor\n* Gabapentin\n* Zoloft\n* Tylenol\n* Meloxicam\n* Diflucan Gel\n* Physical Therapy\n\nThe only things that have really done any good is Meloxicam, but I have to take Meloxicam at the first inclination of pain or it takes upwards of 4 hours to kick in and make any sort of effect on my pain, after that it is a wonderful relief. There is also the fact that it is not technically safe to take regularly with my heart problems, but it is the only thing that works, aside from marijuana, but that is not legal in the US, let alone my State.\n\nAnother thing that I found is that a lot of my pain when it was at its' peak was due to major depression and other problems in life. Ever since I removed myself from the situation I had been in, my pain is a lot less frequent. I am not implying that this is relevant to your situation, but that is what I found to be a major factor.\n\nI hope you can get some sort of relief, I know that the first thing that they will probably try to put you on will be Lyrica, which I have heard will either do wonders or turn you into a complete zombie, there is not really any middle ground, but I have heard that there are some really bad withdrawals and I know its incredibly, incredibly expensive here in the US.\n\nI hope you get some sort of relief. I know how dismal life can seem when you are searching for some sort of answer but not getting anywhere.\n Hey! Thanks for the reply! I have actually tried most of those meds, or am on similar meds from here in the UK. But you are definitely right about cannabis, it is a life saver! Unfortunately it is hella expensive here, usually nearly \u00a315 a gram, unless you are buying in bulk. No bueno.\n\nThanks for your help! :)", "What percentage of MF peole with enlarged aorta get surgery? If I have a slightly enlarged 4.2 cm does that mean that it is going to continue to grow and surgery is required sooner or later or do some MF people's aorta grow a bit and then stop? How old are u? If you are very young, you may need surgery in the future. That is what I have heard I do not know where the research stands for people currently, but a decade ago with mice who had marfans induced in them genetically and then treated with losartan, a reversal in aorta size was actually shown (went back to the normal range for size/height).\n\nThen interestingly enough, I found a different study at the time that showed the same results for non-marfans patients who had an enlarged aorta- it stopped growing in size but reversed, just like in the mice. This was all great news to me and stood to reason that the same thing may in fact occur in marfans patients. I praised God for this. I would guess there may even be research by now backing this up for marfans patients. Hope that puts any potential worries at ease. Of course discuss this with your cardiologist and dive into the current research. The foundation is another great resource for this type of info. 42 I have heard Losartan is not really any miracle for humans. Can you link me those human studies? That sounds very interesting indeed. I was recommended to take Carvedilol 6 mg because they said losartan was too strong for my age and I am afraid I will have to take it in the future. Where can we read about these studies? tsm! Here is ( - the exact studies I looked up a decade or so go I do not have readily, but this one already *at a glance* sounds fairly promising, but I would need to read it more thoroughly to give an educated answer on this one. Was just a quick google search so forgive me if this is unreliable in some way,  but at a glance sounds and looks reliable so far.\n\nAlso, I would not call it a miracle either as miracles are miracles, medicine, at best can be described as \"like\" a miracle. But, at the time, the projected life expectancy for marfans (I believe) was 25 yrs give or take, then after losartan, 70+ (aka normal male life span), and that was something not miraculous, but still quite inspiring for me. Interesting! How old are you if you do not mind me asking?\n\nI went ahead and linked it (an article) in a response to one of OP's comments, but if you cannot find it for some reason, shoot me a message and I will link it again for ya I am 20 but I have been taking it since I was nine or ten. Before that though, I took Propranolol which from what I have heard is essentially the same but did not do much to stop my aorta from dilating.\n\nThank you! I foundd it. I am definitely going to give it a read and look for more info about it! I was in one of the human studies, though mine was on irbesartan (same family of drugs but Ibestartan is more potent)  \n\nI remember being so excited because my cardiologist had been telling me about the mice studies since I was 11. He reckoned it was a miracle cure that could reverse the effects of marfans. \n\nOverall both Lostartan and Ibestartan are about as effective as atenalol. No more, no less. Them Ibestartan study I took part in (the AIMS study) found that the aorta increased in size by 30% less when taking Ibestartan Vs placebo and that seems to have been pretty much mimicked in the Lostartan trials.  \n\nThe main advance appears to be fore people (like me) who cannot tolerate beta blockers. Having both be about as effective gives doctors more flexibility. Prescribing Lostartan does seem to more more of the norm in the UK now as a result. I am currently taking it and it is fine, but it is no miricle. My doctors have always been clear that this will only delay surgery and whilst my aorta is still within the normal range medication can only slow its growth. \n\nAIMS Irbesartan study: \n\nThis seems to be similar in results to Lostartan. Both these studies and the one you liked show a reduction in the rate that the aorta expands at. This does not mean it has stopped expanding, nor that it had reduced in size (which they did find in some mice studies) just that it is now expanding slower. \n\nAtenaelol Vs Lostartan: \n\nLong term lostartan study: \n\nThe life expectancy for marfans has increased to 70 long before Lostartan was prescribed. Previously it was 46 for men and 48 for women. There are a variety of factors for this. \n\nWe now are more likely to be diagnosed, at one point post postmortems diagnosis were the most common form. Life expectancy if you are not diagnosed has not actually changed. \n\nBetablockers and angiotensin blockers (Lostartan and Irbesartan) help. If are lucky they may slow your growth enough that you never need surgery, or they may just let you be older for it. This has reduced child mortality for kids with several marfans, many of whom had a life expectancy of about 5. Being able to make to to adulthood before you need heart surgery greatly improves your chances\n\nAnd then there is the better aortic monitoring.ECGS and echos and MRIs are all great and more common than the used to be. This means problems can be monitored and delt with. Your more likely to survive if you ahve preventative surgery than if you only find out the scale of an issue when your aorta dissects. \n\nWe are also more likely to survive aortic surgery. Aortic value replacement was only created in 1960 and for a while people just didnt survive. My great grandparents were both amount the first to have it in the UK and both died on the operating table. My grandad also died from complications of it I take Lostartan and I am 24. I have actually never heard of age decorations for it. I know the pediatric unit near me is moving towards preceding Lostartan/Irbesartan over beta blockers but I aged out of that. \n\nI did take Ibestartan on top of my atenalol from 14-18 as part of a medical trial \n\nI took atenalol from 11-17, celiprolol from 17-18, Lostartan for 6 weeks at 18 as my doc forgot to but it on repeat prescription and I was then unmedicated from 18-22 when I began lostartan. I had been ill on atenalol but was very very ill on celiprolol which is why I have swapped over. \n\nLostartan is good if you cannot tolerate beta blockers but it has its own downsides, just like any meds. Hopefully as the studies in humans are known about y more doctors the will be able to advise you better in figuring out which treatment is right for you. \n\nThe main issue with Lostartan is that it can cause kidney issues so that has to be monitored with yearly blood tests (at first they are every month or so). \n\nAtenaelol Vs Lostartan: \n\nLong term lostartan study:  You are opting out of surgery at 7.3cm? You know ruptures hurt like a mafk right? I would reconsider. That shit is equivalent to a condom stretched over a watermelon. Going To pop any minute", "Is it possible to have the physical characteristics but not have Marfans? I am worried I have Marfans and am in the middle of testing. Had an echocardiogram last week and am waiting for the results to come back. I have convinced myself I have it judging by the symptoms, but was wondering if you can have the physical symptoms and not have the condition? Just hoping for the best here really but expecting the worst.   I will try to explain this. You only have marfans if you have say 10 out of the 50 issues. You do not have too have a ballooned aorta but you can have other diagnoses. As well all of those diagnoses are not only strictly only for marfans. You can have spider fingers and only spider fingers. Yeah makes sense. The reason for the echocardiogram was palpations, so I suggested to my doc I get a Echo for Marfans. So I am really thinking I have it. Palpations are surely a bad sign. I guess time will tell.  My mother and younger sister (many more besides) have marfans. My sister was diagnosed when she would a 4 and I had yearly echocardiagrams until I was 16.   \nI have long fingers, I am incredibly skinny and have a bunch of other symptoms, but no valve change.  \n\n\nI am 26 now and last year, after moving to australia and getting settled, I had a genetic test that confirms marfan syndrome. I have a slight dilation of the aortic route but nothing serious yet.   \nIt places a lot of the aches I have had all my life too that I did not even notice until I had a reason for them.  \n So if I do have Marfans, is surgery guaranteed? Or can you live with it without surgery in cases? Of course getting it checked regularly. I will get my Echo results this week but if it does not show anything I will still be asking my doc for the genetic testing.  Not necessarily, my auntie was 55 before surgery was on the table, my mother 29. With medical advances and a good handle on your health you might never see a table. I have Marfenoid like symptoms but Ive confused the cardiologists that have looked at me as I dont match the text book Marfans case.\n\nStill waiting on my genetic test to get back to confirm anything though.  I guess my question would be why does it matter? If you have physical symptom a, b, and c, you have physical symptom a, b, and c. That does not change if they happen to call it abc syndrome.  \nNo two people with marfans have the same experience, so just take care of whatever symptoms present (whether they be from marfans or not)\nIf you are having heart palpitations have your heart looked at by an appropriate doctor. and maybe do not play football, it does not matter if it is from marfans on any other connective tissue disorder or anything else  \nIf you have long fingers, idk play piano. \nI understand there can be a desire to be able to point to an underlying \"why\":.  \nWhy am I tall and skinny and cannot gain weight.  \nWhy do I have terrible eyes.  \nWhy do I have an aortic aneurysm.  \nIt is convenient that I can point to one mutated bit of dna to explain all that, but if I got genetic testing that showed I somehow did not have the mutation it would not change that fact that I cannot play contact sports and am more susceptible to aneurysms and cannot find pants that fit in regular stores.\n\n\n\n There are several Connective Tissue Disorders that have a lot of overlapping symptoms with Marfan. Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, Loeys-Dietz Syndrome, and MASS Phenotype are a few possibilities.\n\nSo yes, it is possible to have even several symptoms associated with Marfan but not actually have the disorder.\n\nThis does not invalidate your symptoms, though, and it is important to continue to be monitored if any Connective Tissue Disorder is suspected.", "I think I have Marfans... I am 6'5, with average arm span for my height. My fingers are a little over, but for the most part average for my palm size. I am skinny with a minor case of indented chest. No family member in my family has it, and my dad was the same way when he was young, but he does not have it. My thumb and pinky can touch, but only slightly on my wrist. I am short sighted. I have had no history of heart or lung problems. I have been doing strenuous activity every summer for JROTC. Can someone tell me if I am experiencing Marfan?\nHere is a pic of me (On the right).", "Sorry for the super depressing post, but I really need to get this off of my chest, it feels like few others can relate  I am absolutely MISERABLE with this condition. EVERY DAY I hate existing because i cannot fix the visual symptoms of marfans without DYING. People do not respect me because of how I look and they see me as less and it makes me hurt SO bad. Few want to be my friend irl and I am pretty much invisible to everybody. I do not know if this is just my experience or something but I hardly ever see this talked about in the communities. ALL I wanted was to look normal, have a significant other that did not settle, and to enjoy the human experience. But no, I am cursed with this shit and after months of research and trying to visually fix it almost NOTHING works. But guess what? I am done. I am going to lift and in the future when my heart bursts as a result at least I will have been happy as a fit, normal looking person. I am going to try to experience everything I can (so is, friends, respect) before sudden death. I just cannot live like this anymore. It is not fair. Again, sorry for the harsh post. I had this all bottled up. Thanks for listening. I cannot speak for others, but I feel like a lot of it comes down to when you find out about and how effected by it.\n\nI think I was \u2018lucky\u2019 in that my mum found out when I was 2 after my dad died from it so I do not know anything else. I would get tired easily and never had much fun in school so I kind of ended up picking solo\u2019ish hobbies like computers and 3D printing these days so cannot imagine how tough it would be to go from a \u2018normal\u2019 life to finding out I had Marfan\u2019s.\n\nHowever I can see where your coming from with the friends side. Schools years were terrible and barely had any friends until I learnt to drive and had a car so could go out there were a few years where it was great being able to go out and have a laugh, get into some trouble.. lol\n\nBut sadly with age, came a decline in health and it is hard to try and explain to people why there is times you really just do not have the mental energy to reply to messages or phone so have lost most of them them and back to just enjoying messing with tech stuff. (Which was a good move when your health declines but you now have robot hoovers and voice controlled lights, lol)\n\nSo maybe it is not the most inspiring post but I do not think anyone has an easy fix. I live in rural area so we are limited with jobs and everything but I volunteer when I can which helps keep me busy and I enjoy things as much as I can but I know there is some things (like dating) I just have to admit defeat and move on. It was tough enough when I was younger, but now... I would need a miracle! lol. \n\nBut there is plenty of interesting things to do besides that, it is just finding that interest. The best thing I have learnt though is to not care what others think. It is hard, I still see people staring and saying things but what can you do? Get annoyed or worked up, or just take a deep breathe? I had valve replacement and a pacemaker, I learnt what happens when I got worked up with that thing. It is a horrible feeling and I could not drive for a month! \n\nMe... bitter? Nooooo... \ud83e\udd2c\ud83d\ude1b\n\nI am just going to enjoy what I can, while I can, for as long as I can and maybe someone will come along with that miracle! \ud83e\udd14 Depression probably is not uncommon at some point in a Marfs life. I understand what you mean and I have felt similarly at certain points in my life. All I can say is that you need to trust that things can and will get better. Its beyond frustrating to know that u cannot and will never be able to change somethings, but there are so many other beautiful aspects of the human experience. Have faith in the process and enjoy the little things in life. I am truly sorry you feel like this, just kno that this community is here for u while u feel such feelings, you are certainly not alone. \n\nNot to shit on any of our feelings but there is a lot of conditions worse and more painful that marfans. It was not until I really understood that a few years ago, which is when I really started living - and emotionally overcoming what marfans had done to me (depression/suicide wise). \n\nBe strong, you are so so so so much more than this condition. Wishing you all the best\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd  man, I am highly suspected marf guy - I have literally all of the skeletal features (i.e. extremely skinny 6'0/129lb, arachnodactyly, slight pectus carinatum, long legs, no ass, etc). Yeah, during my time in school (high school-middle school) was pretty hard to get dates and stuff.   \n\n\nHowever, as I grew up, I noticed that if I did not improve myself as much as I could, then I would be stuck in that gloomy state of mind. So, I worked hard and tried to be confident (do not push it, just tried not to be awkward in social instanced), tried to be funny (failing at it is kind of funny at times lmao), got a decent career (medicine), and along the way I met a lot of girls who were interested. In the end though, while chasing some weird dream of mine to learn a third language (asian lang) I met my SO, who was, in fact, in the other side of the world lmao and we have been together ever since.   \n\n\nAnyway, what I am trying to say is, you have to first attempt to fix yourself, however, this does not necessarily entail getting muscle and looking all \"chad\" body like, I mean, the inside of you, the way you look at the world is a reflection of how you behave around people, even if you do not notice it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S \n\nabout working out lifting, this also really depends on your marfan diagnosis, have you talked to your cardiologist? how is your aorta? I was not diagnosed yet but i have a lot of symptoms not just skeletal. I used to feel depressed ab my body and i was so busy working to pay the bills, get some savings. I lost connection with a lot of friends (only got a few now). I realized it does not make me feel so bad, since I cannot choose a different body. Of course breaking the mental norms takes time and is painful, but now i think everyone is just an individual among other humans, even if i die eventually people will forget ab me after 1-2 generations, so it is not so important. I do not think much of having a partner (my 4y gf dumped me long ago- since i started showing signs of weakness i guess). Just kind of scare of the potential physical pain. Dude, plenty of ladies and guys into the marfanoid look. I have been with my wife for the last 14 years, but before that met plenty of folks who wanted to be with me. \nJust work on yourself, develop your interests. Get a therapist, and think about meds. I really relate to your post. I was diagnosed with Marian syndrome at 15. \n\nI am 5\u201911\u201d and weigh 110 pounds and I get asked in the grocery store by strangers \u201cdo you eat?\u201d \u201cYou need to eat a double cheeseburger\u201d \u201cyou are nothing but skin and bones!\u201d \n\nIt was hard to go out in public when all people do was comment on my weight. \n\nBut fuck those people. They do not understand that i eat all the time but just cannot gain weight due to marfans. \n\nI hate the comments but try not to dwell on them and try to just stay as positive as I can. \n\nI am here if you need to talk! Talking about things really help! I am currently 20 and have been diagnosed for 7 years. I am 6'2 and weigh 139 lbs. My step father and his side of the family did not understand why I was so skinny and would day things such as \"boy you need to eat. Got To put meat on your bones. Linky boy. Look at you. Eat this boy.\" It was pretty great for me because I basically ate all day cause they literally would not stop giving me food. On week days after school I would regularly walk to my grandmas house and she would have a homemade potpie on the stove, and she would tell me \"Boy the only way you are getting on that danm computer is if you eat that lovely pot pie I made\ud83d\ude01\" and sure enough id eat the whole thing and shed look at me wondering were it all went. Often times I did not even know were it all went when I was little, I would always joke with my family that I had one straight shoot that went top to bottom. Other than the pectus, I rarely thought of my body as off. My biggest concern was my heart wich still gives me the most anxiety and stress. I mean in the back of my mind I am constantly thinking \"H.A!\" And then I would have to reassure myself \"no,no,no\" especially when I am trying to fall asleep. Not sure if anyone else has the same issue but it takes me an extremely long time to fall asleep. When I am in bed with my SO, I am afraid to roll around cause ima bother them, but I reassure myself that if their snooring does not wake them up, then I will not either. Keeping up to date with friends and family is a challenge,  mainly due to the lack of mental energy I have. The only real stimulating things are working on cars and playing video games. Man let me tell you I am skinny af but I am vastly more efficient then my friends. I have such a big brain that ill be way ahead of them mentally in a project. When a problem arrives ill literally have a solution that is so out of this world that actually makes sense. Video games are fun but they are not the best thing for my marfans, I am pretty sure sitting to much is putting more harm on my heart, and I can be skinny but that does not mean I will not develop fat around my heart. My solution is purchasing an Oculus Quest 2 VR Headset so I can be standing and physically active. I have been doing calisthenics too wich involves using my body as a weight. I do draw so I have a couple pretty good hobbies. I will go to car meets and see all these dudes with more meat on them than me but that does not deter me from enjoying my time. Also its weird cause not one has said anything, maybe they are afraid to ask, I am probably just an odd on out though. All in all there is most certainly something for everyone and we are the 1% and it is us who are going to experience something that others will not and that itself is an extremely humbling thing. What we have is not a curse, but a blemish, a big blemish, well really big, as well as really big \u2764 to go with it. &lt;3 you all.", "Do you have anemia? Is anemia related to Marfan or is it just iron deficiency? I do not believe, from all I have read, that there is any substantial link between anemia and Marfan's in research, but Marfan's research is not exactly a booming field, so it is easy for it to slip through the cracks.\n\nI do not know if I have anemia, but I am pretty lethargic on a daily basis, so I display *symptoms* of anemia regularly.\n\nI think at the core, since many with Marfan's have underdeveloped muscles, blood vessel abnormaloties, heart/lung problems, or a combination of these and more, we can get exhausted from what would be no problem for others. So having elevated heart rate, diziness, fatigue, shortness of breath, etc. when doing things others may have no problem with, we can outwardly *seem* anemic, but like you said, it could be due to other things like iron deficiency, underdeveloped muscles, etc.\n\nIt is kind of like how many people can read about the outward symptoms of Marfan's, or any other condition/disease, and then see all those symptoms in themselves, but not necessarily have Marfan's, etc. at all. Outward collation =/= internal causality. There is a good chance there is some relation. I have marfans and I am also anemic. Thither's a valorous chance thither is some relation.

Even though you are not diagnosed yet? My doctor sent me. Thank you Are heart doctors specialized with marfans? If your doctor sent you it is a good idea, if you are not diagnosed looking at your heart can help the doctors figure it out and see if there is something they should keep an eye on. Good luck!

Hi, I am 23 years old and was diagnosed with my Marfans about 6 years ago. Recently I have been feeling some periodic chest pain around my heart. It is not a horrible pain but I do feel it and it seems to get more and more common. Is this a symptom of aortic dissection or just something minor? I have little time and money for visiting a doctor so I have been procrastinating. Thanks. I would definitely get it checked up. Find a job that will give you health insurance because my sister died at your age from an aortic dissection but she had a renal failure too as well. You should definitely see a cardiologist. Mine told me subtle pains are not a huge deal, but I still see him twice a year for checkups. He said the subtle pains just indicate the gradual worsening of the condition. Aortic dissection is a medical emergency and he said I would know immediately, as the pain is pretty severe. \n\nStill, you need to be examined.  If you have chest pain you should be seeing a cardiologist.\n\nIf you have a dissection in the ascending, or upper part of descending, then you will know it instantly - or at least know somethings wrong and you need an ambulance.\n\nEvery patient is different, but when I was being scheduled for aortic root replacement surgery I asked the doctor if there were things that I was feeling, even if unaware, that would change.  For example might my chest feel better in some way, or would I have more energy, after the surgery.  They said no and that most people with a dilated aorta or aneurism do not have any noticeable symptoms and only rarely do patients have a sense of pressure there from the aneurism.  Of course all that changes when a dissection develops - but then the pain is extremely intense unless it is restricted to lower descending aorta in which case it varies.\n\nBackground:  I do not have marfans, but do have a family history of aortic dissection with two siblings having had dissections (one died and one had life altering complications).  ", "Very WORRIED! I have marfans and bicuspid issues. ", "Feels Unstable while walking? Anyone else feel that legs are not in my total control while walking mostly when try to walk quickly. Not really sure what you are feeling. But I went to physical therapy last year and my the trainer said, that my pelvis was really unstable and tendons in my legs were tight. \n\nAfter few months of therapy I felt more in tune with my body and had no pain in my lower back. What he did,some exercises he recommended ? I feel like when walking my feet are not stepping in same angle like a step before.it happens mostly when I walk alone. I did a lot of leg streches, very simple balance and strenght exercises. The thing is - you dont have to work hard, but you have to do everything correct. That Is why it is not enough to look up online. You have to have someone to monitor you and to teach you how to stand, move and breath. \n\nI would talk to my doctor if I were you. Or look for a \"Healthy spine\" center where licensed therepists work. Thank you. If you mean balance issues you may want to get your spine checked from top to bottom. Dural ectasia can mess you up, and it is really common for us. But it happens mostly when I walk alone,walking with my friends feels normal,maybe it is anxiety Sounds like you may have a weak core. Try some yoga! What about pullups Situps are pretty bad for your back, most trainers these days recommend more compound core workouts like planks, bird-dogs, etc.\n\nYoga is great because it trains your core and your balance, stretches you out, and teaches you to be mindful of your breath which helps immensely with stress and anxiety. Ok will try You may be able to orientate yourself better with other people, too. What about if you are walking in a narrow space vs a wide space? I think when I walk alone,I feel like people watching and I try to walk fast,at my home or with my friends I feel calm,no issue.Narrow space feels more comfortable than wider but if there are less people wider would be comfortable Yes I definitely do, I myself was going to post asking about this too.  The best way I can describe it is I feel like a newborn giraffe taking it is first steps.  I do not know if this is why but I have chronic joint pain almost everywhere but mostly in my arms and legs (knees, ankles, wrists, elbows, and shoulders).  But yes, I definitely do struggle with this too, it is more of a nuisance than anything though", "Sex and blood pressure Usually my blood pressure is very healthy, but during masturbation I see it rises to 122 over 83. Does that mean I should be on a beta blocker just for sex? 122/83 would still be very healthy for at rest blood pressure, but during exercise your blood pressure will rise, this is normal for everyone.\n\n  \nLosartan and/or Beta-Blockers are given for Marfan patients because they help slow the rate of dilatation (growth) of Aortic aneurysms, and even though these medications are used for blood pressure, **the blood pressure lowering aspect of these medications is not the reason why they are given to Marfan patients**. Lowering blood pressure by itself does not necessarily slow  the growth of aortic aneurysms. The mechanism of action (how they actually work to slow the aneurysm) is different for people with Marfan Syndrome and is not a result of the blood pressure being lowered.   \n\n\nHaving a healthy blood pressure is very beneficial though in general. Thanks. I see online they want your systolic pressure under 80, though? I do not know if that is just when resting or also when exercising/sex.\n\n I tested negative for marfan gene variant and do not have enough criteria to meet for it, but do have a variant of a MYH11 connective tissue gene; a variant of \"unknown significance\". My aorta was 3.7 in 2015 and 3.8 as of 3 months ago (learned my aorta was maybe an issue 6 months ago)..lifted a lot of weights and had plenty of sex or masturbation in between 2015 and 2020. I am 42 now and hoping this steady/very slow growth of my aorta stays put..\n\nI was scared to find out the threshold for surgery with the MYH11 gene with variants they know are pathogenic (they do not know yet about mine) is lower than that of marfan. As a rule of thumb, healthy blood pressure is 120/80 or less when you are at rest.  \n\n\nAerobic Exercise is healthy for Marfan patients. Light weight lifting can be fine (depending on the patient)\n\nVery heavy weight lifting is almost always discouraged in Marfan patients or people with Aortic Aneurysms.  \n\n\nI am not an expert or a Doctor but 3.7cm -&gt; 3.8cm growth over 6 years does not seem concerning at all, to me that would actually be very reassuring. I suggest you ask your cardiologist what it means for you and what exercise you should or should not be doing. Thanks. I did not know if that number is safe at rest or if one should never rise above it. I was very relieved to hear it barely moved..this all started for me when I got an echo that said 4.2 which was more concerning. My cardiologists have said the standard stuff ..do not live anything that you have to hold your breath to do.  I hear stories of dissections out of the blue so I am wary to even lift 15 lb weights now. If someone has a mild aortic aneurysm, as long as they go for follow ups as recommended by their Cardiologists there really is not anything to be worried about because an Aortic Aneurysm usually goes through stages before it can rupture (ruptures are the most life threatening).\n\nSee the image here: (   \n\n\nFirst the vessel balloons (dilates) which is called an aneurysm, then there can be very small tear, then there can be a dissection where blood starts going into another layer, and then finally there can be a full rupture of the vessel.   \n\n\nAs long as you get an echocardiogram every couple years (or as your Dr suggests), they can monitor this and intervene.  \n\n\nIt also sounds like you do not have Marfan Syndrome?  People with Marfan syndrome are at up to 250 times greater risk of aortic dissection than the general population. ((  \n\n\nIf the Aortic Aneurysm gets to a concerning size, there are quite a few options for surgery. But generally before the Aortic Aneursym gets too big the cardiologist would prescribe certain medications - this medication will likely be different if the patient has Marfan syndrome or not.  \n\n\nOther important factors to consider are:  \n\\-doing regular aerobic exercise is very healthy  \n\\-eating healthy, maintaining a healthy weight  \n\\-not smoking or drinking alcohol  \n\\-checking for diabetes or pre-diabetes. 3.7 to 3.8 in 6 years? You are fine dude. That BP is nothing to worry about. Your BP should go up during activity, that number is completely normal. depending on the BB being used (propranolol) your weiner might not work", "Please help me... I think I am overreacting.

I would definitely get another doctor's opinion and have a genetic testing done ASAP. The results may come back as uncertain significance(ours did), but it is another piece of the puzzle.

If you of some company doing this, please let me know What does PEARS stand for? Sorry if this is an awfullll question ahah  Somebody posted in this subreddit saying it was covered. (\n\nE: oh man, missed opportunity to rickroll people. :-D You are probably referring to me. I got it covered by my US insurance company. I am scheduled to travel to England here in a few months for the surgery. \n\nI sent the insurance company all the information I could gather on the procedure. I sent letters from my cardiologist here in the states and a letter from the surgeon in London. The biggest selling point though is the cost. This procedure costs less than $65k with everything included. In the states, aortic surgery runs approximately between $150k to $200k. \n\nLet them know that if you are forced to have the surgery in the US, they will be paying 3x more though, with the possibility of another person in 10-15 years. \n\nLet me know if there are any specific questions. I will answer anything, except questions about who my insurance company is. I do not feel comfortable sharing that. \n\nId also reach out to Exstent, the makers of the PEARS sleeve.  They can help guide you in the right direction. Thanks for the Reply! I called my health insurance and they said they only cover procedures in the US. But I was talking to pretty low level people on the phone. Did you need to escalate? Same thing here.  You need to go to the pre-authorization department and file a claim. Before doing it though, you need to have as much info as possible to better present your case. awesome. Was this a massive email you drafted or something? Or you send something in in person? I sent about 35-40 pages of documents via fax. Facts about the surgery, the hospital, the surgeon, letters from cardiologist and surgeon outlining my need for surgery, and pricing information.

Even though I have a marfanoid habitus but not marfan syndrome (deformed chest, long limbs, underweight, scoliosis, and other stuff) as sad as this is, I just avoid people in real life. Now do not get the wrong idea, it is not the main reason why I have avoided real life connections with people for years, it was mostly due to bullying/trauma issues I have with people like trust issues and stuff, however, lately I have been making myself a super loner because so far there is no explanation to my marfanoid habitus yet so because I do not have a label for a diagnosis I just avoid people. I do not work but if I did, I would avoid getting phone numbers from coworkers, I avoid getting close with strangers. I only talk to my friend who is online. However, even though people will find this isolation unhealthy, I do not cry over it, I learned to be a loner over the years. A lot of people are mean. I only trust myself. Sorry to hear that.

I look completely normal unless you really pay attention to my feet and knees hyperextending a bit.) diagnosed at 14. Some people do not show many obvious signs and still have it. Some people show lots of signs and do not have it. It is weird If you are in a developed country, just go for a test. I am in a developing country, i can only go check my aorta and lens despite the indifference of the doctor since the odd of Marfan syndrome is small. Guys your hypermobility; is it general in all your body or limited to certain joints? How did you get the clue to test for marfan? Is your heart/aorta normal? Or your lens? Yup, I have the wrist sign and the thumb sign. After a long series of tests it was determined I have EDS and not Marfans. I am 31 and have been diagnosed since I was 6. With that being said, what blood test are you talking about. I am not aware of any blood test to confirm marfans. You need a genetic test.

", "Progesterone &amp; marfans contraindication (Please note, this is my personal experience and I am not giving medical advice) \n\nI was diagnosed with **Marfans** about 5 years ago (30 yo / Female / UK).\n\nI have always had problems with hormonal contraceptives - specifically ones that contain **Progesterone**, it eventually **affected my joints** to the point that walking was difficult and my elbows, shoulders and fingers hurt almost constantly; when moving and at rest.\n\nAfter having the **mirena / jaydess coil** for just a few months I felt like an old lady. My doctors dismissed this and said that it could not be caused by the contraceptives and instead I was tested for early onset arthritis (negative). After much self-experimentation and some research I have found out that progesterone (the active hormone in mirena / Jaydess and the mini-pill) is very bad for those with hyper-mobility. It seems the same is true for Marfan's.The progesterone released during pregnancy enables the mothers body to adapt to the pregnancy and birth by loosening the ligaments. **For those with connective tissue disorders this can cause extreme discomfort.**\n\nI just wanted to post this here in case any other women have the same symptoms and are disregarded by their doctors. Fortunately for me, I eventually found a nurse who believed me and am now using the copper coli instead of the hormonal one). If you are experiencing these symptoms and have marfans / hypermobility maybe find an alternative contraceptive method before it gets as bad as it did for me. And of course, tell your doctor.\n\n**Question:**\n\nIf any marfan suffering mums are reading this I would be really interested to know about your experiences during pregnancy. Were your joints extremely painful or do you think this is more caused by the levels of progesterone used in contraceptives? I have EDS and the Mirena affected me in this same way, plus it worsened my cramps and IBS. A doctor told me to wait it out and that it should improve with time, but 2 months later I was miserable so I went to a Planned Parenthood and had it removed. I felt back to myself again within a few weeks.\n\nI wish there were more research and knowledge about this. Mirena is the only birth control I can use without horrendous side effects, and the only one that has worked to control my menorrhagia and the extreme pain from that and dural ectasia doing a duet. Definitely not the same case for me. Very interesting, thank you for posting! I will ask my gynecologist about this the next time I see her.\n\nI wonder if that is related to my exercise-induced headaches...My specialist and I have chalked it up to the dural ectasia and potentially blood pressure...but I wonder... I am glad it worked out for you as I think it can be a great option!\nI am sure my case will not apply to everyone with marfans but just wanted to put it out there as the Drs had me thinking I was going a bit mad! This is very interesting... I am currently pregnant after undergoing IVF/PGD to ensure not to pass on Marfans, and taking very high doses of progesterone to support the pregnancy.\n\nHave only been taking it for three weeks, and have had a couple of days with body / joint aches.\n\nI too get exercise-induced headaches (or migraines), which I am certain is due to dural ectasia and placing pressure on my lower back. I have not taken any contraceptive products in over 10 years. I suggest that if your doctors are not taking you seriously about your medical complaints you may need to look for new doctors specifically ones that specialize in Marfan's Syndrome. I personally have no experience with any kind of hormonal birth control since all of my doctors have been unwilling to prescribe it because of my Marfan's. I also second this, after moving to a new city I had a cariologist who to me seemed inexperienced with marfan patients and giving himt he benefit of the doubt sticked with him. The doctor's visits were nothing like the cardiologist I had before never checked my heart through a stethoscope or other means because i already had heart surgery; I know it is simple thing, but even when I go to my regular pcp they check my heart rate. Doctors visits were very short (max 10 minutes) and when I had questions he seemed very unclear or unsure. Luckily I am moving back home and can go back to my old cardiologist who is just wonderful. \n\nI also have been given progesteron birth control but I had to ask for it specifically because my regular PCP doctor never even gave me the option. I noticed a huge difference, my headaches were less frequent, and wasnt as tired with regular bc.", "Should I visit a doctor or am I paranoid? (Think I might have it) Hey guys, I am 16/M. 60kg and 6\u20190.\nAfter a while of having different issues surround joints and bones, I think I might possibly have it. Reasons;\nJoint pain. For the last 8 months or so I have had joint pain. Sometimes it is really painful clocks, other times it is just a burning kind of feeling. I have been to the GO 2x and been discarded as growing pains even though I have hardly grown in the last year.

I can see my heard beating through the indent, and can feel it throughout my whole chest especially when I am trying to sleep.\nI have also been going to the gym last 1.5 years, and have really struggled to put on any mass, and lifting heavy even with good form often leads to painful wrists, elbows etc.\nReally thin wrists- like 6\u201d would be mad. I can touch my thumb and pinkie around my wrists.\nI have also always been really skinny, and have probably reached just \u201cskinny\u201d throughout my gym.do I sound like there is a realistic chance I might have it? Should I go visit the doctor a 3rd time? (Firsttime it was only the joints I went for)\nThanks Is your arm span taller than your height? Do you have scoliosis or flat feet? Those are pretty good signs. Regardless, if you think you have it, it is best to see a doctor just in case. Marfan\u2019s syndrome can be life threatening, so an early diagnosis is key.   Nah do not have really long arms or scoliosis. Slightly flat feet when I was younger by fine now. Also got some stretch marks on lower back and a small lower jaw like it says in the nhs. Cheers What have you got to lose by getting checked?  Do you have any family history? \n I have Not that I know off nah You are extremely unlikely to have it then, just based off that. You are probably right that you are just paranoid, and when you tell a doctor that you have no history and you go off your inability to put on mass and soreness, they will likely tell you to get a trainer and dietician. The only thing I know is my parents do not have it. My grandparents died when o was young and I would not know their medical history. Its mostly about other things than mass -Loose joints, Pectus ex, wrist thumb test, crowded teeth, small lower jaw, flat feet when I was younger, tallest in family and stretch marks. No one in your family knows anything about them either? \n\nLike most of the people who come here, you are listing pretty common things. You are going to go to the doctor and say \"I think I have a rare genetic disease because I am not doing well in the gym and I read Web md\" and the first thing they are going to do is make you fill out a family history. \n\nI mean if it gives you peace of mind you can go to the doctor, but it is not going to give you the answer you want.  it sounds like you are just not using proper form for lifting and not eating enough. Always keep your wrists straight, never bent when lifting unless you are doing isolated forearm work and push and pull with your elbows, not with your hands Yes. You should definitely visit a doctor. More specifically a cardiologist on JUST the pectus alone because even if you do not have marfan syndrome, chest wall deformities can interfere with your heart. (I have marfan syndrome/diagnosed clinically as a child and later confirmed with genetic testing when I was an adult) \nI assume your familiar with all the mathematical probabilities of having it vs not? \nJust to make some sense of it - marfan is autosomal dominant meaning you either have the gene or you do not. If you have inherited marfan syndrome then that means one of your parents has it. The gene is not recessive or dormant. You either have marfan syndrome or you do not . So if say your mom's dad had marfan but she did not, you could not have the inherited form of marfan syndrome because the genetic marfan \"link\" was broken when your mom did not inherit it. \n75% of people that have marfan syndrome inherited it from one of their parents. \n25% of people with marfan syndrome are spontaneous mutations. I was a spontaneous mutation.\n\nMake sense?\n\nFirstly I would ask for a referral for an echocardiogram to measure the size of your aorta. The an eye doctor to check your lenses and retinas. \nI would also ask to see a genetic counselor. \n\nNormally height and thinness are not enough but the pectus is HIGHLY suspect.

If anyone has an answer or sources I really appreciate it! There is no evidence of that in the literature. Blood calcium levels are normal for sure, so extracellular is unlikely. Increased intracellular calcium would have effects on neurotransmission and muscle contractility, which there is also no clinical evidence for. Calcium levels are dictated by organs that do not have known Marfan manifestations: thyroid, parathyroid, kidneys, gut, and bone. Obviously there is connective tissue everywhere, so those organs are \"Marfan\" organs, but fibrillin is not known to be involved in calcium homeostasis.

My great uncle has it and had to get heart aorta surgery a while back.

Tall, skinny, elongated hands, dip in chest, etc. I am 16 and 6\u20193 130 pounds but I have been focusing on eating a lot recently but still after a couple of months I am not seeing any gain in weight at all. Is it possible to get bigger or get into weight lifting at all with my condition? Thanks First you should see a geneticist to verify if you really have it or not because an inability to gain weight can be for a myriad of reasons including just simply youth. Then if they do confirm you have it, your doctor (usually cardiologist) will be the one to advice you best on what is safe for you. I only have a slight aorta enlargement (some doctors do not even think there is anything abnormal about it) and my doctor still told me I should not lift more than 10 lbs. Thanks bro I will look into it What size is your aorta? Mine is 3.7 or 3.8. CArdiologist said just do not bench press. Not sure if I believe it is okay. Though up until covid I had been lifting heavy weights for a good 20 years. About 3.7 How much do you weigh and how heavy weights do you lift if you do not mind? Also I am not sure my aorta size but I am pretty sure it is what the average or not too far from the average of a normal person. Interesting your doctor was much more strict.  Does she // he think lifting causes dissection even at this size or would just make it enlarge more? Do you know how long yours has been this size? Are you on meds? Do you have any idea what percentage of people never have to have surgery? Thanks When I was lifting I was 205 lbs. I am down to 170 now. 6\u20193\u201d. I got to my strongest ever before covid. I was able to bench press 225 once or twice.  I forget my shoulders weight but I could bicep curl 40lb sets of 10. I neglected my legs for my life but would deadlift about 135. I have not lifted since covid started. Was just doing intense cardio until I found out about my aorta. Originally thought it was 4.2 after being 3.7 in 2015. Now mri says it is actually still 3.7 or 3.8 but believe I have marfan and worried about it growing. Not sure what is safe now. I do not know about the surgery percentage. I currently take Atenolol and have been since I was diagnosed at 13. I do not think it is changed much since that age tbh (I am 32 now, if it is changed it is been maybe .1) and I have been the same height since then too.

Good old Dr. Google to the rescue. ", "Worried mom. Can you guys do an ELI5 on Marfan's. Basically, we moved to Poland and the Dr. basically spoke English. We got that our teenage son has Marfan's but all we have at the moment is Google and are apparently waiting 6 months for a heart exam. \n\nI am really worried about my son. He says that even showers are painful for him. Playing on the PC.... I am trying to figure out how to best help him. Anyone with more experience, please chime in with your experiences or advice that was given to you. Showers are painful? That does not sound like a typical Marfan issue. In what way are they painful? He has a chest that is concave. When he was younger his pediatrician called it pectus excavatum, but now that he is a little older they are saying Marfan's. He says that sitting in the chairs at school are painful, that the water from a shower is painful... He no longer has to take gym here but used to complain that it was painful. He does not dislike sports, he just complains that he feels pain. Hey there!  So, step 1 is the easiest and the hardest:  Breathe.\n\nMarfan's is a lot of \"hurry up and wait\".  Lot's of monitoring and not doing much until you have to.  It is can be hard to keep perspective sometimes.\n\n\nRe: Initial diagnosis\nI say this a lot here, but do not get to focused on the genetic testing.  I have actually never had it.  The important thing that your doctor is keeping an eye on problem symptoms (especially heart and aorta).  I always say: There are differences in how you fight an alligator vs. a crocodile, but the first priority is not getting bit.\n\nAs you get into this, a lot of marfan's things can sound very scary, but there is excellent out comes for all that.  The hardest part, for me anyway, is all the garbage that comes along with a chronic health conditions.  Taking time for appointments, continued monitoring, it is a pain (be sure to come vent here!)\n\nSome things to consider for your son:\n\n1) a modified educational plan:  When I was in gradeschool, my hands would fatigue easily.  I was headed for remedial classes until my mom got the school to give me a laptop for class.  All my classes shot up 2 letter grades.  You will want to talk to the school about considerations for your son *especially* around gym (contact sports and weight lifting are a big no no).  As a note, many sports which he should not do repeatedly are probably fine with friends and the like (basketball team is bad, playing basketball with your friends is probably a-ok).\n\n2) I have a friend who games while sitting on a big inflatable ball as a chair.  He says it helps his back quite a bit (his postures actually amazing to boot!)\n\n3) If you have not already, check out the national marfan's foundation.  They are US based, but the resources are applicable.  I am not sure how it works for folks outside the US, but consider getting your son involved in the mentor program.  It can be really beneficial for him to have someone to talk to as he grows.  All growing kids are insecure, it can really get in a kids head being monitored and tested all the time even though they are mostly \"normal\".  85% of what I do as a mentor is remind folks that their life is going to have all the usual ups downs twists turns and that pretty much the only thing they wont be able to do is be a professional athlete.\n\n4) Regarding the \"it hurts to shower\".  I am sorry I have been pretty lucky as far as chronic pain goes (apart from stuff from surgery), but hopefully someone else will chime in.  The national marfan foundation does have some resources on chronic pain management, and as you get a handle you may want to post a thread specific to that.  Can you describe it at all?  Is it a soreness?  Or a burning as in a extreme temperature sensitivity?\n\n\nI am happy to elaborate on anything, just go ahead and fire back.  Just remember; this is a marathon not a sprint.  Managing a chronic health condition can be really draining, and it is at LEAST as important to take care of head as it is your body.  This goes doubly for you as a caretaker (I swear it is harder on my mentees mom sometimes).  Generally speaking, things happen pretty slowly, so you will always be able to go here and other places to vent, get input, and figure stuff out. That is interesting. I have the same thing only it does not cause me pain. I did not realize it could be so pronounced in people to the point of causing pain; that is a new one for me. Thank you for clarifying. And for sharing! I know this is all very overwhelming, but finding out you have it is a positive thing. He is already been living with it since he was born. That has not changed. The difference now is that you know about it, and that puts you in a position of power. It will take time to get used to, but this is something many people have, and we live full, happy lives just like everyone and so will your son. He will just have a few more doctor visits than most :-) I wonder about the type of pain.  I get pain sometimes from my surgery now (sharper, more focused/acute), but when I was younger I definitely had things that were *incredibly* uncomfortable (but more dull/diffuse so I would not have called it \"pain\").\n\nDepending on the how \"cramped\" it is there, vibrations (possibly even water from the shower?) can feel freaking *weird*.  I would go to a lot of concerts and would occasionally have to move because I could not handle the vibrations.  As a kid I also always fought with my mom about cleaning the usual detritus out of there because it was so uncomfortable. &gt; When he was younger his pediatrician called it pectus excavatum, but now that he is a little older they are saying Marfan's.\n\nSo, \"petus excavatum\" describes the shape of his chest, and is a symptom of Marfan's.  Some people with Marf may or may not exhibit pectus, some people who exhibit pectus may or may not have Marf.   Your doctor likely observed additional things that, together, made him think it was Marf.  I am glad you are here though, your doctor should have explained how diagnosis is a process in conditions that vary in how the individual presents symptoms.\n\nRegarding showering, is it scrubbing his chest that is painful or the water itself?  If his chest is tender, I had good luck just using one of those puff balls instead of a wash cloth as a kid. He will *probably* be OK at least until the tests are done.   I would like to know more about *where* the showers hurt, and maybe if OTC painkillers help?   Maybe just schedule an hour or so every week to share with each other what you have learned, or keep a journal of pain and progress. We want to do the DNA so that we are absolutely sure. Apparently we will have to travel by train for 4 hours and pay out of pocket, but it still seems like we should do it so that we know for sure. \n\nOk... so to respond, it sounds like it is a good thing that he does not do sports anymore. They said it was optional here so we did not push the issue. I really appreciate what you said when you mentioned that you can still live a very fulfilling life even if you are not going to be the next professional athlete. He has never seemed to want to be an athlete, so we are good there. Unfortunately I did buy him a set of weights for Christmas... Looking back now that was probably a lousy gift. He is my only son though and I had no clue what to get a teenage boy. Maybe I will make up an excuse to return them and get him a video game instead. \n\nSo.. I noticed that several people inquired about the shower pain. I genuinely do not know, but he keeps complaining about that specifically. I will ask him this evening when he is home from school and try to get a better understanding. He does have Asperger's and has always been sensitive to tags and socks. Maybe what he feels as \"pain\" is more related to that and not Marfan's. I am a total newbie at this Marfan's thing so I do not know. \n\nThank you for taking the time to respond so in depth. It is very much appreciated. It is unusual in the sense that he is my only child that would get vaccinations and not cry. He is also my only child that had a broken bone once... It was sticking out of his arm after he fell from the monkey bars and completely freaked me out until they put a cast on it and reset it. All of that and no real reaction. \n\nFor him to say that the shower pains him does worry me. Then again on the flip side he hates tags and has issues with socks. So I am not sure if this is related to something sensory or to the Marfan's. \n\nThank you for the kind words. I am still worried, but I will try to just treat him as I do my other kids. If you do hear about any successful research studies that help to extend the life expectancy and all that, please PM me. He is an amazing kid and I just want him to have the best of the best. I am reading your responses hear, and I am sorry I should have started at the very top level:  **Marfan's is a VERY manageable condition and is not going to limit your son**\n\nYour son is NO more sick now than he was a year ago.  While any diagnosis can be scary, Marfan's is not really progressive.  It is not like cancer where he is going to get sicker or Parkinsons where there is an onset of agressive symptoms.\n\nMonitoring the aorta and heart and understanding that surgery might be needed someday is the most important part.  Some people do have worse/better presentations, but, generally speaking, we are all pretty dang \"normal\" (if a little pissed off about managing all the bills/paperwork and some body image issues we had to work through)\n\nYou might compare it to diabetes:  You cannot ignore it, it means you cannot be an astronaut, but, other than that?  Pretty normal.\n\nLife expectancy's with monitoring are pretty close to inline with general population (I forget the exact numbers but it is into 80s).\n\nYou will find a ton of different people/hobbies in here.  I have been backpacking through the dessert 14 days at a time before, and I have got an on/off road motorcycle that I will routinely fall off of in the middle of no where.  Hell, I used to do local rock climbing competitions.\n\nRe: Weights:  Not a lousy gift, but yes, weight lifting is a big \"no no\".  Basically, any activities where the *point* is straining, or \"bearing down\", is going to be bad (your blood pressure skyrockets when you do that).  Things like hiking, kayaking, all these are good and important for mental health.\n\nRe: Shower:  Being nuero-typical myself, I do not know a ton about autism, but like I said before sometimes those vibrations through your chest can be really odd even without sensory sensitivity. I think this is a great point since he does have sensory issues. He went to sleep immediately today after school but I am going to ask him more specific questions later to see if it is just his chest that hurts or something else. I really appreciate your comments because this will help to narrow things down. He is been able to get the Nuss surgery for a few years but he does not want to go that route so we are open to any other treatments. We are thinking about trying to hire an interpretor for his next Dr visit so that there is less of a translation issue also. OK, I looked up SPD, and apparently it IS associated with ASD,\n\n\nas is Marfans, IIRC, so you might want to get him checked for that, eventually. I will second getting a IEP (Individual Education Plan) for your child.  This is covered by federal law and schools have to make reasonable accommodations.  PE was an issue for my daughter and the IEP saved her from coming home hurt and bruised.   It also allowed her to eat small snacks in class (gaining and maintaining weight may be an issue).  She was also allowed additional classroom time to finish tasks if she was in pain (chronic leg cramps since birth).\n\nThe best thing we ever did was to maintain 100% transparency with her.  From diagnosis to every single doctor visit and email she is been involved.  We never sugar coated things and always talk frankly about it.... she is going to have it longer than she will have us.  \n\nAnd finally, if you do not have access to a MARFAN clinic like the one at Stanford, then you will need to be the loudest most active advocate for your child.  You will be seeing a number of different doctors because so many different parts of the body can be impacted.  Do not be scared to ask for second opinions either.  Also, look into meeting with a pediatric dietician and a pediatric pain clinic for help.  Hopefully you have quality insurance. I followed my husband to Poland so it is complicated.

Unfortunately because of my reoccurring Pectus Excavatum they were unable to to get clear enough images from the normal Echo so i am going in for a TEE next week and i am kind of terrified.

I have known that I have Marfan Syndrome since I was a little girl. They found it in my brother first. I have had the genetic test and my family has a known mutation. One family member has it pretty bad (open heart surgery at 19) but the other two of us seem ok on meds. ", "I lost the genetic lottery.  Ehlors danlos from my mother, Marfans from my father. Ive posted before but just got genetic results back. I was expecting one or the other, but not both.  I am 5'11 115 lbs, pretty bad scoliosis, aorta is 4.1cm, slight prolapse in my mitral valve, elastic skin that is translucent, severe pectus excavatum. I am also starting to have severe back problems including ruptured disks. I made it 37 years without these holding me back till now. I have lost about half the strength in my right arm due to pinched nerves at my c6/c7, had to give up racing bikes. And I struggle to get through to day at work. I have been eating ibuprofen like candy lately too but that barely helps. Just needed to vent to people that understand what I am going through. \n\nI am just praying I did not pass this down to my kids. 29M and feel you and the pinched nerve in the c6 c7. Cannot even straighten my arm right now without my tricep feeling like it is being ripped in two. Backs been bothering me for a year from 2 years of working out and work.   How long have you been diagnosed and what is it like having kids? I am getting the same pain in my tricep and shoulder.  I have started trying to train myself to be left handed last few days just to avoid using my right arm. The kids are good. Havnt been tested yet and none appear to have any of the severe problems info yet. But they are all watched closely by doctor's already.", "Lens replacement Hi! I have recently been told by my doctor that my lenses have started to loosen from the \"threads\" holding them in place in my eyes. Apparently, I need to get synthetic lenses to recover my vision, which has declined greatly since about one year ago. Initially, I wanted to get intraocular lenses, those that can correct both short and long sight as well as astigmatism apparently. After consulting with the eye surgeon is was told that that kind of lens is not appropriate for people with Marfan's, since they have to sit perfectly in order to work. Since the threads in my eyes are loosening, that is apparently not a very good idea, so It was suggested that I get the most basic form of lens, one that corrects only short sight or long sight. \n\nHave anyone here done this and gotten another form of lens? And if so can you recommend where to look for this kind of surgery? I would really like to get as good a lens as possible. I have lens luxation since my childhood. I totally recommend you to take lenses. Surgery leads some complications. If you wish to safe accommodation of your sight, it is the best way to live. \nMy doctor said the same. He recommend to take mono intraocular lenses if I want to have surgery. \nBut I decided to wait medicine development. \nIn theory, you can inject virus vector into your ligaments To change the volume of fibrillin and recover their power. I had a lens ectomy and scleral lens implant in both eyes last year. Both of my lenses were subluxed (not centered and tilted in my eyeball) so my vision was always awful, and could not be corrected all the way due to the off placement of my lenses. I was 20/60 with +10.5 contacts, which is why I went ahead with surgery options. Because the trampoline springs that hold our lenses in place (zonuals?) are loose due to marfans, we are not good candidates for eye surgery that attatches the lens to the zonuals.    \n\nInstead, my scleral lens implant took out my lens and zonuals, and attached my new artificial lens to my eyeball walls using eyelit stitches. This was also a good option for marfans bacause it requires a small incision to the eyeball wall, which can be weak due to marfans. I was told I would still need glasses to correct my vision, but hopefully I would be able to get to 20/20 with glasses. \n\nI did one eye surgery at a time, healed, then did the other one. I ended up with amazing far sight like I have never experienced before. Trees? Clouds? Amazing \ud83d\udc4c. I wear progressive lenses that correct my vision to 20/20, and allow me to read. (my near sightedness was much worse after surgery, which was hard to get used to, I cannot read a book without my glasses or grocery store reading glasses now. I am so grateful I went through this process, it literally changed my life and I feel so much more comfortable with my independence driving everyday. My one recommended is to always get multiple opinions! An optometrist told my parents when I was very young that i should have my lens removed because of how subluxed they are. My parents decided against it and i am now 24 still with my lens and doing fine! I wear -20.5 contacts AND glasses on top of that but my optometrist has me seeing 20/40- 20/30 with that so I will take it! i have never heard about this idea of injecting fibrilin, can you link any articles on this?  I have been recently reading about the syndrome marfan and I have came to the conclusion that I might possibly have it and might want to get diagnosed soon. I am a 5\u201911 freshman who is entering 10th grade with a wingspan that is well above my height and with abnormally long hands and legs too with a relatively long face but my chest does not sink it actually protrudes instead and my lenses are not yet dislocated, do you think there is a high possibility that I might have marfans? Oh and flat feet with toes that are seen as long Don\u00b4t take advice from me or anyone here when it comes to that, go see a doctor instead. They will help you  Do not put it off.  My lense dislocated and got stuck between the iris and cornea causing Acute angle-closure glaucoma and an emergency lensectomy.  Resulting trauma left my cornea with hills and valleys instead of a smooth dome.\n\nAs far as the lense goes, get the recommendations from the doctor.  I personally had this model implanted and perfectly centered by a very skilled surgeon.  The type of leanse that does both near and far was just not an option for me.  (\n\nWith the new lense and a hard contact lense to flatten out the cornea, My far vision is so good I told the doctor it did not even feel real.  My other eye still has the natural lense and it is a bit near sighted.  I often just put the contact on the right eye for great far vision and use no correction on the left.  This gives me mono vision and it is amazing how the brain sorts it out and I only see the image that is clear.", "So you think you may have Marfan Syndrome We often get posts asking for medical advice, and more specifically asking for opinions on whether someone has Marfan Syndrome, or should see a doctor to find out. The answer is always: See a doctor. They are the only ones qualified to tell you whether you have it, no matter how many symptoms you present. And this does not mean you should make a post asking whether you should see a doctor. You should. Specifically, see a cardiologist.\n\nIf you need help in this endeavor (it is scary and intimidating, we know) please visit the Marfan Foundation (link above).

The thing is that I am rather 0% flexible, I dont have hypermobility of any kind and have never had any injury or dislocation of my joints. Anybody stiff but also marfan positive? Thanks! Yep. Fat, inflexible Marf here. Did not get any of the good ones lol. But in all seriousness, it affects everyone differently. I have dislocated lenses, had aortic root replacement surgery five years ago, and I am 6'4\". Even in the same family signs can vary widely. My dad has Marfan as well and is only 5'8\", and my brother required scoliosis surgery as a teenager but I did not. Yoga can help increase flexibility and is low impact, but check with your doctor for recommendations. That is odd, I didnt think there were any marf's on the chubby side? Then consider me exhibit A Yes. I have never broken anything or have had surgeries other than my lens removals at 4 years old, and all of my family are Marfansers including a condition of muscle weakness in the legs so it is not fun on top of not being flexible whatsoever! I have never been able to touch my toes, do the splits and I can barely cross my legs for more than 5 mins. Try to stretch everyday to prevent anything getting worse. Some areas are flexible, others not. I would say my torso and hips are kind of \"still\" and I cannot touch my toes because my scoliosis (I think that is the reason but I do not know for sure) but my arms can bend a little bit more than the other people, I mean, my elbow can \"bend\" a little bit more towards the outside. My fingers are flexible as well and I can sit with my legs crossed easily too, even having long ass legs. It hurts if I am too much time stading up or sitting down though. being thin is only a symptom, and as such, is not a strict requirement. The \"strict\" requirements re: marfan's is the genetic mutation. That is it. You could argue the aortic dilation and lens dislocation would be considered 'requirements' but there are folx who do not get those symptoms until they are well into their 50s. Some people never present any problems short of having the mutated gene.\n\nSymptoms are more of a set of criteria that help to diagnose and find things, but are not fully required. In the facebook groups, there is a good number of Marfan folx who are under 5ft 8in and are over 180 at those heights.\n\nSyndromes are weird, man.

I know its taller than average, but by how much? Have any studies or surveys been taken about it? I do not really think you can go on height or Marfan habitus I do believe. There are 2000 variations of Marfan that they know of and still discovering more. Everyone exhibits different features. A friend of mine who has Marfans as well is only 5\u20194\u201d. True there are giants with this condition and exhibit \u201cclassic\u201d Marfan Syndrome but it is not the case for many of us. I am only 5\u201911\u201d but my wingspan is 6\u20197\u201d! Goofy looking indeed. It is unfortunately a really difficult condition to put one thumbs on as the saying goes. So the focus is not on height for some of us and on extreme display for others. And those extreme height individuals are the most notable ones because it is so obvious and apparent to everyone. I was always a little jealous that I got so many of the features but not the height. My sister and grandmother are both taller than me and they do not have Marfans. (Can you believe that?!)\n \nBut to be a little more direct to your question, I would say average height in the Marfan population is close to the average height in humans UNLESS you have the height as an feature. Then it will be considerably higher than the rest of the population even from an early age according to the studies I have read. If you just took the tallest of us then our curve would be skewed more but if you added in everyone with the disorder I think we would find it is only slightly higher than everyone else without it. I asked because I know Marfan's usually correlates with longer legs. I am 6'7\" but my sitting height is the same as most people. I see you asked because you are worried you may have it. Do you have any other features? My husband is 6\"3 and 19 year old son is 6'4 This could be wrong, but my parents are both above average in height so I think maybe that is why I became really tall (6\u20192 F). Could it be some people with Marfan are only average because they have short parents? I would like to know more about this. My mom is 5\u20194\u201d and my Dad is 5\u20198\u201d. But like I said, almost all of it is legs. Ah, my parents are much taller than that. does not make sense after all then. Marfan will not make you taller than the general population, but it will often make you taller than the rest of your family. So yeah, if everyone in your family is 5'2'', you probably will not end up 6'7'', but you will probably be taller than your parents.", "What are some un-expected (fun) things that are a part of your life? Hey all,\n\nSo I see a lot of new diagnoses here time to time, and a recurring question seems to in some way or another revolve around being able to lead a \"normal\" life.\n\nI would love for some people to share some things they do in their life that people would not expect you to be capable of.\n\nI will add the disclaimer that **Cases vary, and just because someone mentions something they do does not mean a) it is medically advisable or b) that you can to** you should always work closely with your doctor.\n\nI will start in the comments.", "I am confused (I read the pinned post at the top) I am 18 and about a year or two ago I was \"diagnosed\" with Marfans. The doctor I saw said I had a majority of the symptoms and that I had it but then about a half a year later when I had a bunch of tests done I was then only suspected of having it. I am recommended to get my heart checked out yearly. I still have over a majority of symptoms and I am going to be making an appointment to get everything checked out again but I was wondering if there is a definitive way to find out if I have it. My Dad's side has a huge history of heart problems leading to multiple deaths on that side by heart related issues. They were all built like me skinny, long armed, etc.  Also I occasionally have trouble breathing and my heart/ area around heart feels heavyish. My mom usually says it is nothing to worry about though so I do not think it is that important but I figured I should still add it. You can get genetics testing. Marfans is a mutation of the FBN1 gene. It can be important to get tested for some because there are lesser known syndromes that have similar symptoms of marfans (like loeys-dietz syndrome) and getting tested can tell you this info. But you would want to go through a genetics counselor who is very familiar with marfans and the similar syndromes so they can request all the right tests. \n\nThe comment you posted sounds like a pneumothorax. I get them all the time (about once a month). Usually it is trouble breathing and pain in the chest area. For me I cannot lay flat and it will sometimes last a few days before it resolves itself. The problem with getting these is that the chance of getting another one increases exponentially. So if you get one, you are likely to get a second one. If you have a second one you are even more likely to get a third, etc. what many experience (myself included) is that you eventually have a full lung collapse and need surgery. I have had both lungs fully collapse and had pleurodesis surgery for each. Now I am experiencing pneumothoraces again so I am in process of getting more lung testing through a pulmonologist. If this sounds familiar to you, I would definitely recommend getting these checked out. In the worst cases, a tension pneumothorax can occur, and they can be life threatening- basically the void your collapsed lung makes causes your other organs to move. When someone has a pneumothorax, it can usually be confirmed pretty easily by an X-ray. But any pain in the chest area for someone with marfans (or suspected marfans) should always be taken seriously. It is good you are going through testing now. Best of luck!  I think I went through genetic testing, I will have to ask my mom because everything kind of blended together. I was also the first in my family to maybe have it. Before the doctor suggested it and started me down a path of check ups, no one in my family had ever heard of Marfans. I was the first in my family too. And I know you are super young to be thinking about this, but just something to keep in the back of your mind- by knowing your mutation (if you do have marfans) you have more options when it comes to having kids. My dr. says they are starting to develop early intervention science that could help form the FBN1 gene for even babies in the womb.  I am probably not going to have kids but it is nice to know if I do have kids they might not have what I might have. It is hard to imagine now, but many medical conditions (including Marfan's) were discovered and named before the mechanism around heredity was discovered. This means that they were categorized by outward symptoms rather than a DNA sequence.  It was the best they could do: \"These symptoms, when presented together, imply certain treatments will be effective\".\n\nWhat that means is that you may or may not have a mutation in the FBN1 gene.  More importantly, however, whether or not you have that mutation you may have overlapping symptoms that, Marfan's or not, should be monitored and treated.  As others have mentioned, LD is a different but similar condition. You could also just have heart issues that do not really fall into a category but are important to keep an eye on.  Point is: your heart health matters, not necessarily a name.\n\nDefinitely go see the cardiologist.  Not to discredit your Mom, but sometimes heart issues can be subtle.  I had surgery about 2 years ago, and I had no idea how sick I was until I got better.  It happens a day at a time so you just adjust to the \"new normal\".  After surgery I had more energy, was far more alert, etc.  The thing that floored me was that I ran around for 2 years with issues and I had zero idea.\n\nNot saying you have an issue (or even if you do that you will need surgery, there is lots of meds that help), but my point is that is why monitoring is important; sometimes things can be subtle. I would get a 2nd and even 3rd opinion. I was told by a doctor that I had it, had a bunch of tests done, x-ray to the heart. Met with a different doctor and He said I did not have it, met with a third doctor and he said I didnt have it, met with a geneticist and she confirmed that i did not have it.  I have read before that sometimes they are not sure that you have it until you are completely finished growing due to all of the physical symptoms. For example, they thought my brother's aorta was dilated but it was not. His mitral valve expanding and destroying itself was still enough with the rest of his symptoms to be considered Marfan syndrome, even though his aorta is fine (for now).\n\nMaybe with all of your symptoms it will be enough for your insurance to cover a genetic test (assuming you are American, if you are not, lucky you). \n\nEven if you do not have Marfan syndrome, a history of strange cardiac deaths is worth keeping up with a cardiologist. But I can say my family and our assorted doctors did not pull Marfan syndrome together until my little brother came around (I am also diagnosed, but I was not diagnosed until my 20s). *Someone* has to be the first, and with the increase in medical technology, the spread of knowledge and better record keeping, people like you and my brother will be more common.", "Questionable ", "body image issues i am an f with marfan's and recently i have been feeling so down about the way my body looks. i am a classic marf: long limbs, very skinny, i have even got pectus!! what a fun time! and every time i feel like i have made peace with the way i look, something happens that makes me realize that nope: you are actually gross and no one will ever love you! (exaggerating of course, but it does feel like that sometimes). like sometimes i will see photos of women/men who look like me and get really happy but then i scroll down to the comments and they all say \"eat a sandwich\" or \"she looks like a holocaust victim\" and it brings me back down like *that*. i know that this is probably just a bad day for me and eventually i will go back to being semi-okay with how i look again, but it really fucking hurts sometimes. i know some of you guys can probably relate, so yeah, feel free to pour out your insecurities in the comments as well! some of us have probably been where you have at some point so why not spread the support :) It is hard. We are surrounded by perfect photos of tons of \"perfect\" body shapes, but those bodies are Photoshoped, have the exact right light and stand, basically one good photo. Hard to not compare ourselves to those standards.\nFirst and foremost, get yourself to the gym, walking daily or just get moving. Endorphins are amazing. After a week of very moderate weights I am all like \"yeah look at those muscles!\" Being skinny I swear we get results so fast!! It is helps me feel better when I am having a off day.\nAlso there is someone for everyone! Tall and thin is largely coveted in the male brain. They have been told by the media for decades that is the ideal. YOU are the ideal! Rock it. Wear the heels!\nAnyways at least that is what I tell myself when I am having a low moment. We are pretty awesome.  thanks for your comment! you are right, body standards nowadays are weird and there is no use in comparing myself to them. and i am so shit at having enough self control to exercise regularly lol but you are correct, it does a lot!  \"eat a sandwich\". Sage medical advice I have received more than once.\n\nAlso heard the holocaust one. To borrow from game of thrones \"everyone is got a joke, and they all assume there is is original and hilarious\".\n\nI am not sure how old your are, but it tends to get a bit better as you get older (although never really goes away). When I was in highschool, I was so positive that I just was the kind of person no one would be with.\n\nThe thing is, everyone has insecurities. Marfan's can force you to come face to face with yours in a way most people never do. Eventually, people are drawn to that. Understanding self doubt, understanding pain, and understanding insecurity, and being able to talk about them, are what have made me a good partner in the relationships I have had. Let alone the tool set that comes with managing a lifelong medical condition. People are eventually drawn to that.\n\nRomantically, which is where validation on this stuff usually plays out, you will have your ups and downs like any other person. And it IS definitely hard to avoid that nagging voice when, as happens, a relationship ends, but managing that pain and doubt adds to who you are as a person and that becomes something more and more valuable the older you get. Someday, if you choose, it may even make you a better parent.\n\nInterestingly, most of the partners I have had loved my pectus. After all of those teenage years I was so self conscious about it, it was actually something people found uniquely \"me\", the same way a birthmark on an intimate part of your partner has a certain charm to it.\n\nI have had relationships that led to living together. I have had relationships with partners who model. I have had meaningful commitments and casual dating with all the bumps, bruises, ups, downs and scars that go with it. I am not trying to humblebrag, I am just trying to say that for all the insecurities, my body type did not limit me. The biggest limitations I have had in the end had to do with the kind of person I was, in ways that had nothing to do with my FBN1 gene or my body.\n\nJust like every other human on the planet.\n\nMarfan's puts miles under your tires, no doubt. You will hear people say shit that they will forget 5 seconds later and you will remember for years. All of it makes you a better partner in the long run. Every person, of every body type, has their insecurities. People I have been with who modeled, who had the most clear validation of their body type, were no less insecure than I was.\n\nThe experiences a life long condition give you make you stronger and more well rounded in ways that continue to surprise me. At 28, I have had my heart stopped for almost 12 hours and was walking the next day! My body and my scars do not bother me that much anymore. It is a badass machine and I am not to worried if people do not appreciate that, power to them wherever their path takes them.\n\nPeople dig scars. On the inside or out.  Do your best to get  them healed and be proud of them.  When that gets hard just come here for a pep talk. If it is medically advisable, consider climbing.  Long reach and high strength to weight ratio make it wonderful.  It also holds your interest way better than a weight room in my opinion.\n\nNot to mention, seeing your body perform is amazing.  We do not always get to do that with Marfan's (it is not like we are known for pro-football). I had similar issues while growing up and I sort of figured I was not going to ever find any woman who would be romantically interested in me. But it turns out that I was horribly wrong in my assessment and I gave too much importance to the \"average\" persons ideal of good looks. I now regret the fact that I did not \"go out\" more. There are plenty of people who are not as dumb as the person talking about eating a sandwich. And there is a lot of variation in everyone is idea of beauty. \n\nSo the good news is that apparently there are people who find you attractive. Visiting foreign countries is also a good idea, it seems like people are more accepting of foreigners looking weird than their own kind. Go forth and lose your chains! thanks for the reply! you are right, everyone is preferences are different and not everyone is an idiot asshole who makes shitty sandwich comments. definitely think I could benefit from being a little bit more optimistic about other people\u2019s views :) thanks for the suggestion! I will look into that, seems fun! And you could also consider the fact that you are getting rejected by superficial people as an automatic filter that operates in your favor. How old are you, if you do not mind my asking? (range is fine) I am in HS I had a feeling. I remember being in HS and also feeling very self-conscious about my appearance, which is already a huge problem during that period of life, even without marfan syndrome. All I can tell you now as an old dude with a beautiful wife (with no marfan syndrome) and two beautiful kids is that those self-conscious feelings get a lot less the older you get. At some point, you will forget entirely that you have it. People start seeing you for who you are. Cold comfort now, but hang in there. You will get there. Thanks, that is pretty comforting :) yeah I have pretty much learned how to function with it, but there is definitely been some growing pains haha", "Anyone have poop issues associated with marfans?

Thank you,for your great response.The thing is he has ignored doctors for years and years that is why probably ! He may not have it. Can you explain in detail what his features are? If he has Marfans, does heavy weight lifting, and is 34, he would have likely already had a major cardiovascular event related to Marfans. I mean, he may want to start by mentioning it to his doctor, and see what his doctor says about it; not everyone who has the physical features commonly associated with Marfan syndrome actually has it. If you are concerned that there still may be something going on, I would definitely start by encouraging him to talk to a medical professional about it.

It looks like you do have some crowding that is somewhat signature of high palate but that does not mean it is because of your palate. \n\nIf I compare it to mine (all I can really do) mine seems to have more bone by my teeth and is a bit more pinched where yours is nicely rounded, even though I had one of those torture devices to fix it in middle school. Mine is still so bad they have to use children's tools to get xrays of my teeth.\n\nBut asking your dentist/hygienist the next time you go for a cleaning is your best bet.  Oh, it is you again.\n\nSee a professional. Thanks! If I am right the only crowded teeth are the big two , but that is because I knocked one super hard ages ago  Could you at least respond? As I have said in previous threads my doctor has dismissed me having it but I am still unsure  Go see a doctor. If you really do not like his answer, see another. If you notice a trend in the doctor's answers though... maybe stop looking so hard for something that cannot be found by the trained professionals. Thanks I have, he gave a quick glimpse but then shrugged it off.. do you think it is normal? I am not a doctor. If you do not like the doctors response, find another doctor. If multiple doctors think it is nothing, then leave it alone. Looks normal to me", "Difficulty Diagnosing, DNA results inconclusive For a long time I have suspected I have some kind of connective tissue disorder, possibly marfan. I will start off by just listing off the symptoms that lead me to believe this:\n\n* Positive wrist/thumb sign, although my hands are definitely much wider than the marfan hands i have seen\n* very slender figure, difficulty putting on weight\n* slight chest indentation\n* overly flexible joins in fingers and arms\n* extremely stretchy skin\n\nI am probably forgetting some, but you probably get the idea. I do not have any vision problems, and as far as I am aware no heart problems - but this could just as easily be due to my very relaxed lifestyle. I had an echo cardiogram done in 2018 because of concerns about fatigue during exertion, although I feel fine now. The test showed no abnormalities.\n\nRecently my doctor referred me to a dna test because she was also concerned by my odd physique, and put me down for EDS and marfan. However, I could not go through with the test because they wanted me to meet a whole bunch of unreasonable criteria (basically, they will not test you unless your heart has already ruptured at some point or some other life threatening complication).\n\nSo, I ended up just having my DNA sequenced by 23andMe so I could see the genes associated with these illnesses. I checked my COL3A1 and COL1A1 genes for EDS, and they are both basically normal. What I did find though, are two poorly documented mutations in my FBN1 gene, which is responsible for marfan. \n\nFirst is rs397515835 which should be CT;CT, while mean it T;T.\n\nSecond is rs397515834, which is supposed to be TT;TT, while mine is T;T again. \n\nOn ( they are both listed as potential markers for marfan, but specifically when an insertion or deletion is present, hence corrupting the rest of the FBN1 gene by putting it out of sync (or at least, this is my understanding). However, in my DNA, these positions are equally replaced on both sides, so the rest of the FBN1 gene checks out normally. I am just confused as to what this means, since I seem to have an unusual variant here which is not documented anywhere. I am not sure what you want from us. Surely you should be talking to your original referring doctor, not a bunch of randos on the net.", "Workouts post-surgery??? So I had my aorta replaced about 2 years ago now so I cannot do weight lifting but I heard there is a thing where you do tons of reps with smaller weights but really slowly. Does anyone have a workout routine that builds muscle while not spiking my blood pressure? Anything helps. Thanks!", "Question How were your teenage years during high school with Marfan? Currently a sophomore in high school. Rough. Lots of bullying. But it got better and life's pretty good.\n\nHealth-wise, I ended up having my heart surgery at 20 and was fairly sick 18-19.  Rough at first. Once I found my high school theater program, life was amazing. This was Junior year. Senior year was even better. I became nearly a celebrity at my school. Not kidding. I would run into kids outside of school I did not know who would gush that they loved my work. It was rad. You just need to find your group. Try new things. Meet new people. Find your group. My brother dropped out as 16 fuel to bullying to the point he told my parents if you force me to go back I am taking your gun and shooting as many kids as possible. He hasnt been the same since and isolated himself from the world, went to college but skipped his first internship because it wasnt 100% what he wanted and now cannot get another offer so my parents wanted $40k on college for him to not do anything but gamble(fairly successfully) in our basement.\n\nI wasnt bullied much, I didnt let kids put me down and was well prepared to punch someone in the mouth for trying shit with me. I sold drugs and used drugs often in highschool, leading to a polydrug addiction starting at the age of 14, I am currently 21. \n\nI left my original highschool once I got into drugs to go to alternative highschool, so instead of 5 8 hour school days, I had 4 3 and a half hour days and graduated a year early. Ultimately giving me more times to use and sell drugs.\n\nI overdosed at 18, went to rehab, did decent for a bit, relapsed hard totalled 3 cars in 2018 and went back to rehab and was clean from dope for over a year until like a week ago I shot a few points and shot like $200 worth of coke, which I never did before I just was curious.\n\nMy addiction stems from curiosity, my dad selling drugs with me and my parents overall lax rules for me, they thought I was just experimenting as a teen only for the drug use to take full grip of my life.\n\nOverall, shits cool now. I had cataracts fixed in both eyes this year, dont do too many drugs outside of weed and psychedelics and have a decent job, although I am on a temporary lay off. \n\nAs shitty as all of this sounds I probably would not change much, I reccomend if given the opportunity to go to the annual Marfan Syndrome conference in your teenage years and build friendships and meet others going through what you are going through. I went in 2016 and it opened my eyes to the complexity of Marfans.\n\nAlso do not do stimulants, seriously our hearts arent built for excessive stimulant use and although I get a ekgs, echo and C/S yearly and my aorta is at normal dilation, it is not worth the risk. Not great but a lot of that was my fault for being bitter and angsty.\n\nJust embrace who you are and who you want to be and be confident about it. Very regular to be honest. Went to military school and did what everyone else did. To be honest I seldom ever thought about having Marfans. \n\nJust be you, and screw everyone else. Do not take shit from people either! Have fun and love life as this is our only go round. Senior in high school currently, 17 F. Have a scar down my back from spinal fusion, and down my chest from mitral valve repair done only two weeks ago. Overall, I just get shit for being extremely flat. No chest, no ass. It is hard to accept myself with beautiful girls developing into women, when I am an average-looking girl in the face, with the body of a 12 year old boy. The scars are not brought up as a flaw (nobody has seen the chest scar yet, but I am sure that will be the same). Get called lazy for not pushing myself in gym because I exhaust easily. Accused of starving myself, etc. The worst really is the body shaming, whether they mean to hurt you or joke about it (such as me being FLAT). Overall, not the worst experience, in regards with Marfans.", "Post OP problems I recently had open heart surgery to fix my bad valves in my heart, and I knew my ribcage was wired together but I did not notice or feel it until now. I first noticed it when I kept feeling like I was being poked by something in my chest whenever I had something put pressure on my scar. It is not a terrible pain(feels kind of like a pinch) but it is still a little annoying. I heard you can get the wire removed but I really do not want to have another surgery.\n\nAnyone with a similar problem what did you do? I am pretty sure the wire is supposed to stay in there for good. The scar and your sternum is bound to be very tender when you are healing, I remember having some discomfort when I was fresh out of surgery too. If it really hurts tho, you should bring it to your surgeon\u2019s attention at your follow ups so he can make sure the wire has not moved or dislodged or anything along those lines, in which case then they will have to go back in to do salvage. How long ago was your surgery, if you do not mind my asking? I was also told that they could go back in and remove the wires if they bothered me, but at this stage (had my second surgery in December 2019) the only pain I have is around the top of my incision where the nerves are still tender. I agree that I would not necessarily want to have another surgery to remove the sternal wires, but perhaps the surgeon can give you some guidance  based on where you are in your recovery and expectations of the discomfort you are feeling now and might feel in the future, if any? Had my surgery in December of 2019, it is not so much the scar that is bothering me but under the scar, like I can move the wire under my skin. My dad also had a similar surgery and ended up having the wire fixed almost 20 years later, I am just not sure if I should wait that long It is not so much pain, but more like a pinch that kind of makes you flinch. I guess it would be like getting bit by a bug or something Oh, wow! So quite recent! I know it is sort of a broken-record saying with Marfans, but probably best to ask your surgeon for his/her opinion. And yeah, 20 years is a long time to wait... if it is really bothering you, sooner rather than later is likely the best route to take :)", "Question on Heart Surgery and valve size So went and got my yearly echo today and while my past 3 echos had not seen any increase in size, this year it went from 4.4 to 4.9cm. Now im scheduled to have a CT scan and go back to the heart specialist in 2 weeks. They said if it gets to 5.5 then surgery needs to take place. People that have had this surgery what was the experience and time you were in hospital for? any changes after the surgery? anyone had a similar timeline to me where im now 24 and after 3 years of nothing have seen a significant increase? \n\nAnyone from australia know if this is covered by medicare or will require private health insurance which i currently dont have but assume if i signed up now will cover if i need the surgery in a years time.", "Concerned that boyfriend has Marfan's, not sure how to present it to him I have been dating this guy (33 years old) for just over a year and care about him a lot. I am really concerned because he has quite a few of the symptoms of Marfan.

Your digestive tract is basically all smooth muscle, a connective tissue. You will have slowed gastric motility and periodic episodes if you are affected.

", "Tonight I made an important decision that I feel a lot of people with Marfans can learn from. Hello, \nI would like to give context before I begin on about my decision, my apologies for the length, \n\nIn January of last year and up until very recently I had crippling insecurities from Marfans about how it made my body look. I weighed the least I ever did at that time and little did I know my pain was just beginning. it was a hellish year \u2014 I would develop body-dysmorphic disorder and hardly ever left my house or room for fear of how people saw me and their judgements of how I looked. Every day I was miserable because I so badly wanted to look \u201cnormal\u201d and the intense realization that I would never be able to \u201cfix\u201d it was too much for me to handle which left me suicidal. In retrospect I am grateful I had not the tools to take my own life, and god knows I would have if I had the resources to.  \n\nIn June of 2020 my continual, intense pain inspired me to look deeply into the world of fitness, our condition, and how I could reconcile the two together to safely achieve an aesthetic that made me comfortable in my own skin. It was not easy. Our limitations are very, *very* restrictive in terms of muscle building because the vast majority of muscle building exercises or methods raises blood pressure, which as you know, is very bad for us.  But guess what? I did not care. I thought \u201ci am going to hate myself forever, I should just lift, because even if I die it would be better than living like this.\u201d but yet in the back of my mind a fear of aortic growth and dissection was always there, so I would still attempt to pursue a safe routine, however the pain and the strong desire to look aesthetic was too powerful so I ultimately did not care. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nOnce I was read up on bulking and how to lift weights safely with our condition thanks to the many awesome members of this subreddit that chimed in, I began to lift. Now, I will say this, I did achieve my goals. 3 months in and I was fit which over the next few months crushed my BDD as well as insecurity. For the first time in what felt like an eternity I felt happy, healthy, and confident. People in public and in general respected me more and were friendlier, I could finally wear shirts in public, everything was great, **but I still had that thought at the back of my mind that my aorta could be growing**. \n\nAs I kept lifting and lifting, getting bigger and bigger, I would frequent the popular marfan facebook group which had its share of members that felt the same shame, misery, and hate that I felt about myself for so long. A lot of these members would go on to lift as well with the same worry that growth might be happening, but like me, this did not dissuade them from powering on. I remember a picture of a teen lifting a barbell that looked like it weighed a lot and people were trying to tell him to put it down. I scoffed at these people - \u201che is killing it, he is muscular and happy, how could these people tell him to stop?\u201d and jumped in the comments to show my support towards him. I was all for lifting with marfans, and I would even get in arguments in the group about how it is really important to lift. \n\nAs you know, I was being an ignorant jerk at that time, egging on a young man to risk his life over something silly that he did not need to do. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nTonight, a powerful realization came to me after a day of anxiety about my aorta growing: **I do not need to do this. I do not need to put my life on the line anymore to please others. I am happy with myself. I have marfan syndrome, i am exempt from these activities, I do not need to put pressure on myself to look a certain way, I do not need any of it.** and then I made the decision. to retire from lifting. My health and well-being is more important than being muscular. It was not worth it for me, and when it comes to our health and safety, it likely is not for you, either. \n\nMany people here often post up asking for advice on how to build muscle and a lot of the replies are just downright dangerous in the long run. I also know how many people here struggle with insecurities and depression about how they look, but i have been to the other side, and let me tell you: **You are a beautiful person, and a syndrome does NOT determine your worth or value.** NEVER let anybody tell you or convince you otherwise.\n\nI know this is a lengthy write up, but I think its  important for at least someone here on a similar path to see this. Thank you for reading.", "Is taking testosterone bad if you have marfans? I am born with very low testosterone levels and was wondering if i should concider them. Im 19. I recommend you visit the Marfan Foundation. This is the perfect question for them, as they have really experienced doctors on hand to address questions like these.

Haha has many of the physical features and spoke about her mother\u2019s heart surgery to correct an aorta issue a while back. She is a nurse, so I am not really thinking she does not know, but she has not mentioned anything to me. \n\nShe has made random comments about her body that makes me think she wants me to ask more, but I am not really sure.

I really care about her and this would not threaten the relationship in any way for me, but I feel like she wants me to know, but is scared I may have apprehensions of some sort of I \u201cknow\u201d. \n\nWe have been together for some time now and live together. I just want her to know I am not completely oblivious and that I do not would not see her differently. I have honestly knew since we first met. \n\nI was actually tested for Marfans as a young child since I have a couple characteristics, but ultimately nothing came from those tests. \n\nAny advice or firsthand experience would be appreciate. Thanks! Talk to her about it openly. Good communication is the key to a good relationship. She can then get tested and proactively manage her health.", "I think my son has Marfans, feeling very overwhelmed My son is 14, middle child. He was my biggest baby and now, he is 5'11\" and maybe 110 pounds. He has almost every sign. Disproportionately long arms, legs, fingers, toes. Concave breast bone, slight scoliosis, small palette with over crowded teeth, flat feet. He breaks so easily. At 12 he fell at school and broke an arm. This weekend he fell skiing and blew his knee out (unhappy triad). \n\nWe have not had insurance in a while, so we use the health department for check ups and immunizations, and luckily, they rarely have emergency situations. I got them insurance recently (just in time for this skiing thing) so I am taking him to the doc once they have openings. Hopefully they listen and do something to confirm or deny. \n\nJust venting really. I do not think it is inherited, no one in my family has this, and I do not think anyone on his dad's side has it. It is a lot to process at this point. Thanks for listening. It is a LOT to process! My son has Marfan. Message me anytime! thanks for sharing that I know it can be a lot.\n After a diagnostic and doc supervision things get easier and less scary, just ensure he goes to a cardiologist and schedule an echocardiogram. It would be great if he avoided intense and high impact sports until he sees a doc. Thanks! I feel like a failure, if that makes sense. He rarely ever does anything. He is a computer guy. This was a random one off trip to get them out of the house after being cooped up for so long (they are still not doing in person school by us). He was not even supposed to ski, he was supposed to snow tube with his little sister, but they took the ski class. He did so well that we figured he would be ok. It was not even 10 minutes later that it happened. I can empathize. When we got a clinical diagnosis\u2014first from eye doctor, then cardiology\u2014I wanted to climb into a hole. No parent wants their child\u2019s life to be harder. But. It will be okay. You will climb back out of that hole and learn to live with a new normal. He is skiing! He is active and healthy! He is enjoying life! A Marfan diagnosis will not change any of that. Thanks. He is always been my problem child, for lack of a better term. ADD, other behavioral issues. I thought he had type 1 diabetes when he was failing to gain weight. I was worried he was malnourished (he lived with his dad for a while). It is been a rough road and I have not been a good parent. Hopefully we can figure it out soon. They better hurry up with this universal healthcare. Oh that sucks, I have seen some people mess with their knee like that in ski. Sometimes when we fall the ski starts to rotate and things get ugly, always been an snowboard fan because of that. The injure may not be related to marfs but its true that marfs can make your tendons a bit weaker.\nIt is great that he is a computer guy, it is difficult for some people to give up on sports. If later he gets interested in exercises and sports, there is a lot of modalities and hobbies that we can do or adapt for practice like swimning, jogging, golf, archery.... I personally love table tennis and hitchhiking. Mine was passed from my grandfather to my mother (she is the only one out of his four biological children to inherit it) and then to me. \n\nPlease do not blame yourself. I cannot stress this enough. My own mother has expressed guilt at passing on the condition, and honestly that does not do anyone a bit of good. There is absolutely nothing you did wrong or did to cause it. I have never once blamed my mom for it.\n\nIf your son does have Marfans, he can still live a good life. There may be some challenges but everyone has something in their life they deal with. What you can do for him is help him accept these things and learn to adapt. When I was a kid I was not allowed to play contact sports but I could take dance. I was not brought up thinking I was sick, however I knew I had a condition other kids did not and that it meant I could not always do what they did. But there was always stuff that I could do instead. \n\nI hope this helps. If you have any questions feel free to message me. Thank you so much for your kind words. I struggle a lot with things related to how I raised them, so the mom guilt is not new. But I guess that is just a thing for all moms? Hopefully we can get in with a doc soon and get all the tests he needs. Hi, if it is any comfort, when I was 14 a few years back I got genetically tested and the results came back negative.\n\nThis was even with me being having, s-shaped scoliosis, small jaw with overcrowded teeth, wing span long than height, mitral valve regurgitation, faster than average heart rate, poor circulation, flat feet, the thumb around wrist test, tall and thin, broke easily (5 bones so far), and needing glasses.\n\nNot saying do not get him tested obv, just that having the signs does not automatically mean he will have it. I mean, a little, but then you are still left wondering what the problem, you know? Have you gotten any answers? Nope, only a precautionary cardiologist checkup every couple of years to take measurements and that is it tbh. I guess that is better than nothing, right? Thanks for sharing, be well! And you, good luck!", "Eugenia clooney I learnt of her some hours ago. \n\nNormally, i do not pay heed to possibly mentally ill people partaking in controversial behaviours in order to provoke public reaction and scrutiny.

I very much prefer to ignore them. \n\nBut this woman (i have no other descriptor of her)... i googled her weight out of intrigue. She is either overrating herself massively or is roughly the same weight I was (40kgs at 175cm) around 2015 to late 2018, back when I had the utter hell that was my back-rods sucking the fuck out of me (im now 48kg after their removal, which is still scrawny as hell.) Its not something im proud of - it left me sedantary and unable to move for hours on end without bed-support.\n\nIts... uncanny, looking at this. I dont know who this woman is, or she has mental issues leading to the state she is in. But Ive never felt a fraction of physical insecurity - ones that would warrant regulation of food-intake, other insecurities aplenty - my entire life (besides the pressure to *gain* weight). I dont have aneroxia or bulimia. I dislike most foods, their taste, and the process of eating them..... but damn. Its weird seeing a reflection of myself in her.\n\nAnd its even more frightening to read a vitriol shes getting. Did people think i was crazy, back then? Did they fetishize me? Did they wish to be me? Did they see i was sick and reckoned it was my fault (ie my own personality disorder) desire to be stark-thin? Did they hold me in contempt or pity or fetishization?its just weird looking at people discuss her so thoroughly and thinking - \"I *was* her.'' It feels like theyre analyzing a reflection of me. Ive just been made familiar with just how *different\u2022 I looked back then and now im just thinking about how that affected my social life. \n\nAnyone else? but i mean - her body type is extreme, and she is at risk of those things you have mentioned. it is an issue that is wrapped up in a lot of hotly debated topics today, so of course she is going to get extreme comments.\nthat does not mean the attention grabbing headlines represent what most people think though. Theres another element to this.... i didnt choose to have marfan, and surgery &gt; losing weight is involuntary for me (keeping weight after surgery is largely a struggle). Is she really at a risk of organ \nfailure, death and brain-damage? because if my weight decreases as hers, then...\n:/", "Okay I already posted about worrying over someone else, but now I am looking at my own hands. I am not tall or slender, but is having the hand sign worth checking for marfans?  If it puts your mind at ease see a doctor. \n\nI personally do not think this looks like marfans. I will mention it in a checkup soon. My friend mentioned marfans at a hangout in regards to my boyfriend recently, and I am a hypochondriac and am spiraling into marfans paranoia. \ud83e\udd26 My whole family is pretty lanky and has long fingers, so we are all getting kind of panicky about it. Does not mean much tbh, you appear more flexible than I am, and I have confirmed marfans. Do you have other hypermobilty traits? It is just my hands. I would not worry about it, but ask your doc anyway. Marfans usually has generalized joint hypermobility  I have EDS not Marfan\u2019s and have the hand sign! You may have EDS. You should not necessarily be worried about marfans.  But it is associated with risk for aortic aneurysm.\n\n\n\n", "Anyone had surgery to rectify club foot or contacted fingers?

My wingspan is 2 inches shorter than my height as well Echo came back normal as well How often do you get injured? Plenty of people are tall, have high arches, wear glasses. If none of the major debilitating symptoms are present and it is not impacting your life what difference would it make? Never been injured. Just freaked out as I had a doctor that basically told me I had Marfans even after I went through this testing and he claimed I was \u201cin denial\u201d about the situation What made your doctor think that? Nothing you have described sounds like things that would set off any alarms to me but I am not a doctor. If you are that concerned get a second opinion. He said I had flat feet, a wingspan that was taller than I was and that I wore glasses. Besides the wearing glasses he was wrong about both my wingspan and feet and got defensive about it when I brought this up. I had the echo done and had a second doctor tell me that I had no abnormal symptoms it just has still given me anxiety Aside from getting your heart checked somewhat regularly I would keep living life however you were going to do before. Sure. Hey thanks for your time I appreciate it Are your fingers bendy? Not at all I have a similar body frame and weight as you, also flat feet, but I am somewhat flexible and my eyesight is decent, not really bad at all. No family history. \n\nI had something similar happen to me, got an echo exam, everything came back normal. So I got a 2nd opinion, also met with my primary doctor for a 3rd opinion, and also met with a medical geneticist, a doctor who specializes in genetic conditions such as Marfan syndrome. All three doctors looked at me like the 1st doctor was crazy for even suggesting this to me, all three confirmed and said that I do not have marfan syndrome lol\n\nI get what you are saying about the anxiety part. I had so much anxiety after the first doctor said this to me. I doubt you have it but getting a 2nd, 3rd, and even 4th opinion helps. I recommend meeting with a geneticist to calm your nerves. \n\nI do not see that first doctor anymore. Fuck that guy. Thanks for the reassurance I will check out a geneticist!", "Do I maybe have Marfan or something similar?

We are in.  Daughter felt she 'has to'.... almost like it was not an option.  Crazy girl.", "Safe caffine alternatives? I wws recently diagnosed and my doctor told me I have to kick my tea and red bull consumption, or switch only to decaff. But now I am tired all the time to the point of being near unable to engage with life, are there any good go-to alternatives for simple energy without putting my hewlth in risk?  Sorry to hear about the diagnosis but it is not the end of the world. I am a third generation Marfan and before my aorta replacement I would drink half caf or just one cup of coffee supplemented with other caffeinated drinks that are not energy drinks.  I was told the same so I switched to green tea, and I drink black tea on days when I need more of a boost. It also helps to drink plenty of water and Powerade/Gatorade, and it forces me to try harder to get more sleep and naps in. If nothing works, I go for a walk outside or do a light exercise routine to feel more awake.  If the doctor is recommending they do not even drink tea, they should not be drinking ANY caffeine at all... this is terrible and dangerous advice. This is going to sound weird, but eating a very crunchy and sweet apple with PB and drinking some water when I am feeling like I need caffeine has helped me so much. Sometimes my body just needs a little raw fruit and the protein and good fats that are in PB and some water for hydration. Afterward I feel much better and have more energy! Glad to know that is not just me, apples and peanut butter are the only thing keeping me awake lately. Still, I will ksep at it more now that I know I am not just imagining it.  Green tea has always been a staple in my diet, I am worries about going back to black tea though now that I am totally caffine free. Hadnt even thought of poweraid or gatoraid though. Thanks for the tip!  Dont worry, I should have been more clear they told me not to drink tea with caffine. I appriciate the advice, but I wasnt going to go with it tbh. If I am quitting caffine I am doing it 100%. I do appricate the attempt though op.  Haha that funny that you already do that. Do not forget the water as well! Even very mild dehydration can make you feel blah and tired.  I must have misunderstood. I thought you were trying to wean yourself off of caffeine so you would avoid the withdrawals. I was in no way condoning the massive amounts of caffeine intake. Making sure you are getting enough water throughout the day can help with feeling sluggish since most of the time our bodies are dehydrated.  Again, my apologies for the misunderstanding, I am only human.  Its all cool, thanks for taking the time to try and help, and dont worry I am drinking tons.  It is not a big deal, or at least not as dangerous as one would think. If they have put you on blood pressure medication that is going to zap your energy.  Maybe ginseng?  It has been hard for me to find though.   \n\nMaybe try a post at /r/Nootropics,\n\nor ( Once you adjust you will feel better than ever. \n\nEat a more nutritious diet and stop trying to use drugs to substitute for sleep.  Well, in all fairness I wasnt asking for drugs, more just a dietary choice to offset the loss of morning tea and the addition of marfans medication which has destroyed my stamina. I eat what I should and get 8 hours most nights. But its not enough now that I am taking that medication, its good for my heart but making me an absolute zombie.  Caffeine is a drug. If you are already eating a vitamin rich diet, there is not much to be suggested. You could try adding a B12 liquid but I am not sure how fond your team will be of that, either. \n\nThat said, you will adjust, both to the loss of caffeine and the addition of the medication. If the medication does *not* get better, talk to your doctor. Keep an eye on your blood pressure, as well (when I had the same complaints, my diastolic pressure and heartrate were down in the low 40s and I had started fainting). They want it *low* but consistent tiredness is a sign that it is *too* low.\n\nAre you taking one dose a day? If so, taking it at night will help. \n\n", "How often do you get imaging for your aorta? ", "Thin arms and ungodly vascular arms and hands, Should I be concerned? Well, I am a likely candidate for marfans because of my many physical features buts I am waiting to see a geneticist in October to verify or not, luckily I have no aorta issues known yet. However I am incredibly thin especially in my arms and legs, but when I let my arms hang down every vein in them bulge out this happens down to my hand, which gives these body parts a much older look (Im 21) Is this likely because of low body fat? I am just kind of freaked out because I read about vascular eds which says that is a symptom. But I dont bruise easily and lack any facial features of VEDS and have never had any issues, so I have my doubts. Again I am just concerned but am thinking its because of low body fat. Any other marfs have this issue in the past or preset? ", "I got diagnosed with marfans today. Im kind of worried and would appreciate it if people help me learn more about it. Idk know much about I know it has something to do with my heart. I am 19 never even knew about this until I had chest pains for the last few weeks. I was wondering what are the procedures they do and like if needles are incolved cause I have a phobia of them. So, Marfan's has to do with a lot more than just your heart, I suggest going to marfan.org and learning more about the syndrome in general. Alright, all I knew was I had issues with my heart. I will it has a lot to do with the connective tissu3 as well but I do not know how it effects it What were the chest pains caused by? Did you have a dilation happening to your aorta? \n\nI only ask because I was 18 when I was diagnosed and I had the same thing. Chest pains for a while and then a whirlwind of hospitals and doctors after finding out my ascending aorta was dilated and about to tear(aortic aneurysm). I got it from my dad, who had died from it. I had the corrective surgery, am now 29 years young and thriving. Still discovering things along the way, the surgery did not take me out of the woods but as long as I keep taking my medicine and doing regular check ups, I have a good prognosis. I have an echocardiogram every year and an MRI every other year.\n\nWhat is your game plan from your doctors? With the right care plan in place, you will be fine. Just got to make sure you take care of yourself. And follow the doctors orders obviously. Do your research, that is where I got a lot of my info was that marfan.org site. Feel free to reach out to me if you need someone to talk to. That is a really scary age to get diagnosed with someone like that. Best of luck to you! I appreciate this so much. I am going to my doctors tomorrow and hopefully I will know more. I know I have a heart condition  they never knew about until yesterday. Jesus surgery scares me ecspecially when it is open heart. I wanted to be a pro wrestler as stupid as that sounds. now I cannot do that probably. Well you never know, ask your doc. I am a patient transporter at a hospital so I am pushing and pulling for 8 hours a day, sometimes 400+ pounds. I only weigh 120, with like no body fat on me. My cardiologist loves the physicality of what I do because it is actually really good cardio work so it keeps my heart strong. Obviously if I ever notice any changes from it I would stop and talk to my doctor. I do not know how physical pro wrestling is but I imagine it is doable.\n\nAs for the open heart surgery, I will not lie I do not really remember much from when I first came around. But I do remember the pain was not as bad as I thought it would be. I was also on a high dose of morphine. Once I left ICU, the recovery was not so bad. Honestly, I think getting out some of the mainline IVs and the chest tube hurt the worst. The chest tube was not my favorite at all. A couple of the \u201cwires\u201d holding the chest tube in started healing into my skin so that felt really not great when they pulled out the tube, I almost passed out even though I was already under a twilight drug. But honestly after those came out, the rest was a breeze. It is kind of annoying when they want you to poop afterwards and you are on narcotic pain meds which make that hard lol I kept looking at my chest scar and wondering what it looked like under the bandages and when they pulled it off, it was not that bad at all. Pinkish/red line going down my chest covered with some steri-strips which fall off on their own. I would say I was lucky I was the age I was when I had it done because I bounced back easier. The chest X-rays looked pretty radical, the stitches on your chest plate show up after you have open heart. The breathing thing they bug you to use is annoying as fuck but it is a necessary evil to protect your lungs from developing pneumonia because obviously, it is kind of scary taking deep breaths after having your chest cracked but so so soooo important to do. \n\nAnd please do not think I am trying to scare you, that is the complete opposite of my intention. I wish I would have had someone to fill me in when I had mine done so I am just trying to help, promise. If you do have to go through open heart, your experience will not be the exact same as mine obviously but you will get through it. Just make sure you have support, that was a big thing for me. Relying on people for the recovery at home. The showering is hard because they do not want you doing certain motions. Not driving or doing anything drove me nuts! My boyfriend, now fianc\u00e9 worked his butt off to make ends meet while I was off work. It always bothered me. Car rides were not that great but it was the seatbelts that sucked so I took a pillow everywhere I went lol \n\nI wish you the best of luck talking to your doctor, I will keep my fingers and toes crossed for you. \u2764\ufe0f You are so nice I appreciate you so much. I also appreciate you helping others. Your job must be incredibly stressing. It is going to bug me taking the tubes out. Like they have you awake for that? And you see your insides? I hate the country Sept of anything poking in my body that is why I have a phobia of needles. You did not scare me, you said exactly what I wanted to hear. This came so sudden cause I thought it was just anxiety. I will keep my  fingers gers and toes crossed for you as well and hope all things go well\u2764. Thank you again. Happy to help, it is a stressful job but man it is rewarding. Yeah they had me awake but the twilight sedative put me in a fog. It is normally not supposed to hurt bad when they take the tube out, that is what they told me. I just healed faster than anticipated. You got this man. You will pull through just fine. Stay positive. Thanks for the well wishes \u2764\ufe0f Welcome to the family! It is natural to feel anxiety about your diagnosis. Just remember: it is not that you suddenly got Marfan Syndrome. You have always had it. You are the same person you were last year. The only difference is that now you KNOW you have it. And knowledge is a very powerful and empowering thing. So as weird as this sounds, you are incredibly fortunate to be diagnosed. Because now you can better care for yourself. You are going to be just fine. \n\nAs far as living with it: the routine year-to-year checkups are super easy. An echo (ultrasound) of your heart, maybe an EKG, vision tests, all of it non-invasive and easy. Yes, you could need surgery in the future. But maybe not. Who knows? But now you can monitor yourself and be prepared. This is a great thing. \n\nWe are here for you. And go to marfan.org! Get that knowledge bruh. I feel very welcomed to the family. I have had it all my life which is crazy. I did cross country, track, and wrestling. I always had pains in my body. But they always said it is me out of shape or synopsis. Now a new doctor is telling me I have marfan which is something I never heard of. I will get that knowledge bruh. I appreciate the kind words and advice\u263a\u263a We have \"fibrillin\" genes which are apparently pretty big.   With a gene that size, there are lots of chances for mistakes.   \"Marfans\" includes lots of those mistakes.   Can be severe or mild, but impacts more than just the heart. I hope to God it is mild. I do not want to worry about this to much. I am just really scared a bit. Like idk what is going to happen. The doctor was very vague If the doctor is not a specialist (in Marfan's) he just may not *know*. Yea he is not a specialist in marfans. He is going to guide me to the best doctor though tomorrow. I will reiterate what other commenters said, you have always had marfan\u2019s, you just did not know. Marfan is like any other syndrome, we all share a common \u201clook\u201d, but we all have unique and individual symptoms. It is like Down syndrome, in people with downs look the same, but they are their own person with unique needs and abilities. \n\nThere are 6 people living in my family with it, and each of us is different. My mom is the only person that has not had to have an open heart surgery, but I have had 2. My sister and aunt are runners, so it is will not necessarily limit what you can do, \n\nWhere do you live? I highly recommend getting a doctor that is familiar with marfan\u2019s right away. There is an active community on facebook too:  I also recommend the same Facebook group. It is a super helpful forum for all your concerns! Plus, you can learn about doctors in your area that specialize in the different aspects of Marfan. They helped me through my heart surgery in 2015. I was 32 years old. My 2nd is coming, I just do not know when.\n\nI have e been in therapy for 15 years trying to cope with the fact that I have Marfan. Honestly, the depression and anxiety are more crippling symptoms than the physical pain of it all for me. I was told not to have kids because I could die in child birth and possibly pass it on (50% chance). After surgery, I did have kids. I had twins and I passed it on to 1 of them. \n\nWe have known about Marfan in our family for 4 generations. I am the 1st to be treated for it. Knowing you have it is one of the most important things. Now that you know, you will want to see a geneticist, cardiologist, ophthalmologist, and orthopedist once a year. There are other doctors that you may need depending on how Marfan effects you. It is a spectrum. Even for parents and their children it can radically effect them differently. Good luck with your diagnosis. Welcome to the family! My sister was diagnosed at age 25, and  even that she had some light physical symptoms, and had a heart surgery at age 19 no one ever question the possibility of her having Marfan's until she went to a random cardiologist for a yearly check up. Because of her, our family had to learn a lot about Marfan's and the limitations that comes with. One of them is no high impact sports, because you blood pressure needs to be kept on the lower side. Depending how developed or severe is your Marfan's there is a lot of little things to be careful about, specially if you are young and active. Also there is a lot of Marfan's community centers and online groups that help you understand the disease. But rest assure, you have a lot of medical support on this country and if you go to a specialized Marfan's Cardiologist he is able to direct you on the right path to understand how to live with this.", "Is it possible to have Marfan Syndrome without any heart or lung problems? I have a sort of physical appearance of someone with marfans since I am thin, double jointed, nearsighted, and have a dented chest. Doctors said thaty heart and lungs are perfectly fine  yes it is possible It is possible, but always get your heart checked just in case. With people who have Marfans, the aorta can get enlarged rapidly and dissect with little to no warning. It is always better to play it safe!  My dad's heart was fine until he was about 50.  I show no symptoms in the heart/lung/eyes of marfan.... yet. I am 22. I did 3 cardiologist appointments with no major problems, and they told me to come back in five years, which will be December of next year. Three older family members with no known heart/lung problems either, arthritis will be an issue though. ", "Getting surgery in a little over 2 weeks.. Hi, im 20, f, and finally going to receive my aortic root surgery..im super nervous and worried about how terrible the scar will be lol, stupid i know. Can someone that is went through it just talk to me? It will be prominent. My brother had it and it still does show. Try to take care of the wound and see what the doctor says for minimizing scarring.\n\nLike many other problems, you are going to have to just roll with this one.\nWhen is your surgery? I am a 31 year old female that had it done about a year and a half ago. Feel free to ask me anything about it!  Hi \ud83d\ude0a How was the recovery process?  Yeah, i know youre right. Just sucks, didnt expect this so soon. Its set for March 5th 28 y/o hear who had his pectus and valve done last year.\n\nThe scar shows, but it is hardly off-putting.  I have actually gotten compliments.  Even only a year later, it is faded.  You can tell it is there but like I said there is nothing \"grosse\" about it and it is actually kind of badass.\n\nRe Recovery:\nStraight dope, it DOES suck, but it will be OK and, for me at least, the anxiety was worse.  The drugs do their thing quite well.  A few notes, you may not be yourself for a while after surgery. Some people do not respond to painkillers well (I was a complete jackass at times). Talk to people in your life ahead of time ESPECIALLY if they are not normally the touchy feely kind.  I basically went through puberty again, complete with hair growing and mood swings.  At 28 it was a surprise.\n\nIf your insurance covers it, I cannot recommend a hospital bed enough. You can also buy one of Craigslist and sell it when you are done.  You do not need something fancy, but the height, and being able to swing in and out helps a lot. Other than that maybe put your bed on risers.\n\nOther than that, if you want details on what the day of and the first two weeks will be like you can PM me.  It is no picnic, but every day you will feel better than the last and that will blow your mind.  It makes it easier to remember that this will all pass.\n\n Honestly not as bad as I expected. There was pretty minimal chest pain after the first few days. However the back pain was pretty annoying, I guess it was from the position you are in during surgery. Another big thing I noticed was how short of breath i was the first few weeks. Let us see what else... I felt hot all the time the first month or so. I was walking a few miles a day by a month in. Getting up from a lying or sitting position was annoying because you cannot use your arms to push up until your sternum is totally healed. \n\nI did get some weird anxiety issues for about 6 months. My brain got super obsessed with death, not my own but friends and family. Especially at night Id have dreams every night about someone dying. Finally went to a psych doctor and got started on Zoloft and it all went away. But I think depression and anxiety is not unheard of after open heart surgery so definitely be mindful of it and do not blow it off!  Me to!  It turns out there is a huge link between your heart and your brain as a evolutionary hold out.  With a primitive nervous system, basically if you were having heart issues your body was wired to make you feel depressed so you slowed down, took it easy, etc.\n\nBut yeah, the anxiety was weird.  For anyone else reading this it is definitely manageable, I just wish someone would have warned me! Yup I totally agree. I kept trying to hold out thinking surely it must get better soon. But it got to the point that I could not even say goodbye to someone casually without thinking in my head \"they are going to die before you see them again! this is it!\". \nAlso as a side note I was on the Zoloft for 6 months and did great, stopped it cold turkey when I got pregnant and I am 5 months along now with zero issues. So I do believe the anxiety/depression is something that does go away over time on its own. However that does not mean you should ignore it before that happens!  Wow. That Is pretty nerve wrecking considering i already have bad anxiety and depression lol. Wow. That Is pretty nerve wrecking considering i already have bad anxiety and depression lol. Thank you for the response! I am starting to feel a little more confident, but hearing all the stuff about anxiety is nerve wrecking because i already deal with it haha. Hoping i react well but i wont know until the time comes i guess. Honestly, the fact that you already deal with it may help.\n\nIts not something I normally had to deal with, and was bad at communicating.  You will be OK, just keep talking.\n\nIf you are doing any medication plan on checking in with your brain doc a few weeks to a month after surgery, there may be some adjustments that make sense. I am sorry I did not mean to scare you! But I think it is good to be ready for it. I was not, and blew it off for awhile. Seeing how easy the fix was I wish I would seen someone sooner  Had it at 19 feel free to chat with me.   No worries im very thankful for the heads up! Thank you\ud83d\ude0a As someone who themself might be going through a similar situation soon, I hope your recovery is fast and well (: please update bc id love to hear how it is in your experience  How did the surgery go?", "Did a DNA test and found out my first cousin is paralyzed from an aortic dissection due to Marfans.

I recommend starting here: (\n\nThey are a great resource for helping you figure out diagnosis and what to do. Find a good cardiologist that is familiar with it I personally would not bother with a GP (many are super unfamiliar with Marfans syndrome, and it is the kind of thing where you should be getting specialty care), although maybe in Los Angeles you will have some luck. If I were you, I would be using this as an excuse to make some weekend trips up to Stanford.\n\nYou may or may not need a genetic test before a Marfans specialist will take you on; mileage varies.", "Conflicting information Hey friends hope you are doing well and you have had a great start to your new year.\n\n\nI have what doctors say is likely Marfan's. The gene test did not show I carry the genetic marker, but due to my other characteristics doctors are loosely diagnosing as mild Marfan's. \n\nDoctors have told me for the past 10-12 years I should be swimmin (supposedly best exercise for me), but I have read articles and studies where unless you choose to approach it leisurely it is not advisable. \n\nMy heart issue is what is considered a mild mitral valve prolapse. I like to push myself if I am going to to dedicate time into something.\n\nThe more I read online the more restrictive Marfan's seems to be.

And after this I need to start on my cataracted right eye :/\n\nI am so tired of being sick and dirt poor, but I do not want to give up. Wish me luck I guess Good luck! I made it through a whole bunch of eye surgeries as a kid, and a valve/aorta replacement 18 years ago, so there is a life beyond the operating table. When I was little my doctor told me that realistically my life expectancy would be 40 so this is really reassuring.  Well, it probably would be, if you did not have the surgery. I believe I read in my early twenties that the life expectancy for Marfan folk was 35, and I have now (post-surgery) made it to 47 with no further upsets expected. Good luck.  I am just parent/spouse of marfs and I am exhausted (and sometimes depressed) from the surgeries and doctors visits and I do not even have to experience the hard stuff.

Hi there not asking for medical advice just genuinely curious about the syndrome. Does anyone have just a few of the symptoms? Or can people have mild marfans?\n\nThanks! Hey! Marfan syndrome can present in different \u201cforms.\u201d Some have it mildly and some can present aggressively. Most Marfan patients usually have a heart condition (usually from the aortic/mitral valve) and some present with scoliosis and some eye problems. Yeah Hi thanks for the reply, it is nice to learn about a syndrome that is not well known. Thanks for the reply! Yes! I am in the minority that does not have heart problems (just regular ultrasounds to confirm) but I do have various tissue issues (eyes, joint problems, and \u201clook\u201d like a typical marfan's patient). For example, retinal holes are super common because Marfan\u2019s affects soft tissue. Yes, my presentation is pretty mild. Joint pain, double carpal tunnel, flat feet, scoliosis, hypermobility, easy dislocations, difficulty in gaining weight, and occasional heart palpitations. However, my eyes have better than perfect vision and my heart/aorta look perfect on an echo (currently anyway). My brother also has it, and he has (severe) pectus excavatum, the classic lanky figure, an almost total inability to gain weight or muscle, and a widened aortic root, but almost no joint pain or hypermobility. He also has perfect vision. Both of us tested positive. Sometimes Marfans just presents differently, even within the same family. Thanks so much for your reply! Yes - I have one symptom from each of the major and minor Ghent criteria: \n\nThe genetics doctor whom I saw said, without having had a confirmed family history - I would not have satisfied enough of the criteria to warrant a test.

I dont feel tired, I dont have problems with my back, I dont have any serious eye problems, and my hearth rate and pulse was fine.\n\nIn 2-3 months, I have to visit a hearth doctor to take ecco of my heart, and see if my major artery has expanded to a dangerous limit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHearing I had this syndrome, made me sad and afraid of things that will happen to me in the future.. like dislocated linces in my eyes, hearth problems and punctured lung.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow common is all of this? Is there a mild form for this syndrome where you do not get that problems I just described? Because, I have read about people that is at my age having a lot more problems than me.. I dont have any problems except my collar bone, and I am going to check my hearth but my doctor said he thinks its fine.  Ok bud,  deep breath.  *You are going to be ok.*\n\nYes,  there are mild forms.  Marfans exists on a spectrum.  In my family it has been pretty mild: four of the five of us who currently have it are able to do heavy lifting on a regular basis.  My grandmother lived well into her 80s with it.  \n\nEven if yours is more severe it can be managed.  Find a doctor familiar with it and get their advice.  You will need to monitor your health,  and probably make some changes to your lifestyle.  \n\nYou can still live a full life. Chin up,  and good luck. Hi! 19m with marfan here but I have known since childhood.\n\n\nYou should know marfan is at times hereditary, your offspring have a chance of getting it. \n\nPersonally I have experienced a punctured lung, but the adults in my family have experienced worse.\n\nIt is a bit tough to come to grips with but you are going to need to be careful with yourself, do not overextend and turn solitary but seriously listen to your doctor when they tell you what to abstain from. Regarding marfan it is pretty important to not lift heavy objects (25+ kg for me, 5+ kg for my post aortic surgery relative) or do contact sports.\n\nEveryone has a different experience though, and there is no guarantee you will be afflicted by any of the more major complications. I for instance, unlike many people with marfan, do not have a lot of a anesthetic symptoms such as a different shaped chest or shoulders.\n\nAs long as you listen to your doctor and check up regularly you will most likely be fine. Do not take medical advice from anyone on reddit please.\n\nLastly some people get offered the chance to have a surgery preemptively to prevent future problems. You can discuss that with your doctor if interested.\n\nAs for the coping with marfan, give yourself some time. Remember that you have always had marfan but have now just become aware of it, which is good because it means you can take control over your fight against it. You can adjust your life accordingly where you could not before and now have control over your health. Life is not over and until your doctor says otherwise there is plenty of hope that you will live a long and happy life. Thanks for your answer, I appreciate it.\n\nI am just worrying about the unsure medical things that can happen to me.. (hearth, eyes, lunges..) Thanks for your answer, I appreciate it.\n\nI am just worrying about the unsure medical things that can happen to me.. (hearth, eyes, lunges..)\n\nI will not take any advice here, and my life doesnt change with first.. I will just be more careful to not lifting too heavy, but still excersise at a reasonable level. I will also do eye test, hearth test etc every year or so. Well then my friend you sound like you will be healthier than most people without marfans. As long as you keep an eye out and try your hardest to stay healthy you are already doing everything you can, and more than most others will.\n\nOf course there is always a chance you will have complications, but that is a risk the rest of humanity takes as well. Aneurysms kill countless healthy people each year without seamingly much rhyme or reason.\n\nAs long as you are attending your checkups and following doctors orders that is all you have control over and all you can do.\n\nThat might sound a little dark but in my eyes it is really a reason to not stress over the inevitable. If you cannot change something (like the chance of complications) then why let it also stress you out I always say. 20y ,197cm 66kg, i got diagnosed with marfan when i was 16 years old only because of my fast growth between 10 to 14y and my back and chess (my left part of my chest is not down but up xD), only at 19 i had some eye problems like  Near-sightedness and astigmatism (only noticed in classes and when i was as driving)\n\nNone people from my family was diagnosed but my great-grandfather had 2.07 meters.\n\nI think the severity of the disease changes person to person\n\nIts not the end of the world,live your life but you have to be carreful with somethings as normal, go to the doctor from x to x time, keep doing exercice live you life man\n\nPs:also i can pop and unpop my colar bone and my friends think it is lit af xD Like canadairy said, it is manageable.  Breathe deep.\n\nAbout the lens specifically, it tends to be more of a concern during/before puberty.  Lung issues are a pain to watch for, but correctable.\n\nRe: The ticker: I am not sure if they were concerned because it was abnormal by general population standards or abnormal by marfan standards.  Either way, as scary as the prospect is, the outcomes are *excellent*.  It is no picnic, but you do get through it.  Come here for support and tips as things progress.\n\nWith all of this coming out of left field, be aware of panic attack element of it all.  Your head freaking out can really throw you off if your not used to anxiety (I generally was not).  Knowing a lot of it in your head does not make it go away, but it can help a bit.\n\nYou might have to make some adjustments, and you will learn more about insurance than you ever wanted to know, but it will be fine.  Just keep coming back here with questions.  Insurance, \"Does anyone else...\", general life style stuff.  You will find we are all pretty normal with some notable exceptions for each of us.\n\nFinally, your Doc may want to investigate some related disorders (Ehlers Danlos, , Loeys dietz).  Getting the correct diagnosis is important but secondary to overall health, so do not let it overwhelm you.  My go to line is: \"Crocs and alligators are different but if you are fighting one the first priority is the same: do not get bit\" Please check on your heart. You are at risk for aortic tears and aneurysms. If you ever have chest pain, even mild, go to the hospital and get a CT scan. An EKG will not do shit and they will think you are ok so they do not do anything. You can even put that in your phone under the emergency function. My aunt died when she went to the hospital and just received an EKG when she should have gotten a CT scan (78). However, she also lived in the middle of nowhere in South Georgia and had to go to a small town hospital. You will have many doctors because connective tissue affects literally everything in your body, but as long as you stay on top of it, you will live a long life. My suggestion is to make sure you live somewhere with access to healthcare. People with Marfans should always be somewhat close to a decent hospital. \n\nAnother notes, it is a dominant gene so if you have or want kids, there is a 50% they will get it. However, some have very mild cases, others severe. Regardless, your heart should be your #1 priority. Though, watch out for your eyes too...detached retinas are not fun. \n\nPlease visit Marfan.org and subscribe to them. They will email if there are any medicines that could harm marfans patients. I do not have this condition myself, but many of my relatives do including my mom. Feel free to DM me if you have any questions!\n\nEdited for Note: the good thing is once they patch your aorta, you cannot dissect there. My mom had a bad dissection a while ago that could have killed her, but she survived and now that long patch they put in cannot dissect. She also had her aortic valve repaired and is healed totally fine. My grandfather many years ago had a collapsed lung but he made it too. Medicine has come a long way and as long as you see every doctor, though it is a pain in the ass, never miss an appointment and pay attention to what your body tells you.", "How do I gain weight/muscle? Hey guys, I am a teenage guy with marfan syndrome and have found it near impossible to gain weight and muscle! Any advice or tips? If there is one thing I wish I could go back and tell teenage me now that I am a broken 40 year old, I would tell that kid to stop trying to compete with people who do not have Marfan syndrome. Accept that you cannot do everything others can, like lifting heavy weights. I know it seems like you can do it fine, but what you cannot see is the damage it is doing to you. And 40 year old you is going to have to deal with daily pain and daily painkillers because you forgot to be kind to your body. You tried to live like you did not have it. \n\nSo I guess what I am trying to tell you is: you have Marfan Syndrome. Gaining weight and muscle is sometimes not in the cards for us, and all we are really doing is putting ourselves at risk for future misery when we try to push back against it. \n\nEither way, be kind to yourself. This is perfect advice. It is hard to hear but they are right. I have the same desire as a 34 yo male but it just is not going to happen, long and lanky is what I am and it is what I will be forever. I have been gaining weight after a surgery by tracking calories with an app, low impact exercise under supervision, having nutritional drinks and smoothies. But I am not muscular or plan on that happening. Well first you should talk to your doctors and see if they think it is safe for you to be lifting at all. \n\nAs others have said, do not compare yourself to other people.  You can gain some muscle safely but it is going to take longer than it would take others and you will be using lighter weights. Do not let your ego get the best of you.  It does not matter how much weight you are lifting!  Do not push yourself too hard, do not hold your breath to finish a set, do not force anything.  I learned this lesson the hard way via sudden aortic dissection and trust me it was not fun.  Be confident that you are lifting in a way that is safe for you. Everyone, especially at the gym, is way too focused on themselves to be thinking about what you are doing.\n\nThe safe way to lift is with a low weight high rep routine that exhausts your muscles via repetition and time under tension, this will also build a lot of muscle endurance which is very practical for real-life tasks (yardwork, etc.).\n\nI cannot stress enough how important it is to eat enough protein and calories, especially if you are tall.  Without enough supplies, your body cannot build much muscle.  I am 6'8, was about 235 when I lifted a lot, and I ate about 3500 calories and 200g of protein a day to get there.  It is honestly hard to eat that much, so supplement with protein shakes and whole milk if you are struggling to eat that much.  Try to avoid eating too much red or processed meats, they are terrible for your heart and are proven to cause cancers.\n\nNow for lifting, a good guideline is to find a weight that you can do 12 nice slow reps of, and your 12th rep you should be struggling a bit to finish because your muscle is tired, not because the weight is so heavy.  That means you should not be holding your breath and you should not be feeling like you are pushing yourself really hard.\n\nSpeaking of breathing, it is very important to match slow reps with slow breathing.  You want to be exhaling for the entirety of the positive part of the rep (the part where you are pushing or pulling the weight).  On the negative part of the rep (where you are letting the weight back down, slowly) you want to inhale nice and full.  This does a few things.  One, it keeps you from holding your breath while moving the weight, two it helps keep a nice slow pace for your reps, and three provides plenty of oxygen for your blood and muscles.\n\nFinally, be patient.   It is going to take a month to even get in a routine.  Then it will take another month before you start to see small results.  But if you stick with it, after a year you will be pleasantly surprised that you have some muscle on your frame and all this will help prevent injury too. Speaking of which, watch some YouTube videos about proper lifting form, you can slowly but seriously screw up your bones and joints with bad form.\n\nTL;DR - Double check with your docs.  Do not compare yourself to others, be confident about the fact that you are lifting light weights because you know it is the right way for you to life safely.  Eat, a lot of, healthy high protein things.  Use light weights and high rep counts (12-15), lift slowly, exhale on the push/pull, inhale when you are slowly letting the weight back down. Be patient and persistent, and use proper form! I was never into working out hardcore anyways. I always thought it was overrated, however, I do think a little toning on my arms would do, just, not an alpha male or anything. I seem to have a feminine soft face and lack body hair as a 24 year old male so I can pull off a fem look just fine, but as far as gaining weight goes, I am trying, nothing is working. I drink this thing called the \"1,000 calorie shake\". It is on the better humans site if you search for it. So far, no results, but I am still trying to gain fat. I am mostly into getting fat on my bones if anything. I have pretty much just accepted it, however, my mentality as a \"male\" is a little less stereotypical and I can accept that I do not need to be \"alpha\" or whatever, I think that is all societal nonsense. Some people are different, and I choose to rock it!", "Should I get checked for marfans? Hi everyone, I hope you are doing well!\n\nI am wondering if I should go get checked for marfans syndrome. I suffer from anxiety and panic attacks and a large part of my anxiety is about health even though I have been really healthy throughout my life. I am a 20 year old male.\n\nSo some reasons I think I might need to get checked: I am very skinny always have been as well as my parents (until they got in their mid twenties). I have mild sternum excavation. And with my anxiety comes heart palpitations and odd sensations on my chest. I also had a minor heart condition at birth that lasted until I was about 12 but resolved it self. I also have bad vision but so does my mother.\n\nSome reasons I think I do not have it: my limbs are not disproportionate. I am not very tall, only 5 foot 10 inches. No back problems. My fingers and Hands are thin but completely proportional. No flat feet. No family history of marfans are heart problems, only diabetes, not sure if that is relevant.\n\nThat is all I can think to say right now. Just hearing about Marfan syndrome have sent me into panic mode with my anxiety. wondering what this community thought. Thanks every one!  Hello! I think the best thing to do would be to talk about this with your doctor. Let him/her know your concerns, and see what they suggest.\n Yea I will. I had a recent stint with severe panic attacks with physical symptoms and I went to my regular physician for a check up that included an ekg and everything checked out fine. I am wanting to go to a cardiologist to check more thoroughly, is this who I should talk to about it? Also I know you are not a doctor but so you think it is likely or unlikely that I have it based on what I told you? Well, the ekg findings are a good thing, in that they came back normal. If you still want to see a cardiologist, the best person to ask would be your primary care physician. They should be able to refer you to a specialist, though they might not think it is necessary based on the lack of symptoms.  Afaik the only way to know for sure is to get a genetics test. \n\nObviously I cannot diagnose you but it does sound like you are missing some key symptoms. \n\nMy advice is to worry less, read the internet less, and take action. I know that is hard, but worrying about a problem is like trying to solve a math question by chewing gum. Gets you nowhere. \n\nSource: my son has Marfan's.\n Google \"Ghent Criteria\" and look it over. If you score above a 7 you clinically have Marfan Syndrome and would then be referred for genetic testing. At least that is what we had to do in order to get my son diagnosed. We could not even get a referral to the geneticist until our pediatrician checked him out. Even then it took 3 months to see them. It is not a fast process but very worth it if you score high enough. Call your primary care doctor and tell them you want to be screened for Marfan Syndrome and see what they say.  My geneticist told me it is possible for someone to have some marfanoid expressed phenotypes (physical appearance), score above a 7, and have the genetic tests come back normal, meaning there is no genetic mutation in the gene that causes Marfans.\nLook up Dysautonomia. I have not been officially diagnosed by a doctor with it but It explained a lot of my anxiety problems with having marfans and the way it manifests itself in my body and overall health.\n\nEdit: I have been diagnosed with Marfans and have confirmed it with genetic testing. I have not been diagnosed with Dysautonomia. It does not sound like you have Marfans based on the info in your post but it can never hurt to be sure and I will not discourage anyone from inquiring about anything with their doctors Hi, I posted this two months ago but did not get a chance to go to a cardiologist until about 4 days ago.

I am so insecure about how I look, particularly my chest. I have pectus excavatum, I am pretty flat chested as well so it does not look great. I avoid wearing low cut tops and going swimming. I am so insecure to the point where I cannot have sex with the light on. I will not be able to get surgery anytime soon &amp; im so sick of being insecure. Does anyone have any tips? I wish I just had a normal body. Hi, I have related to all of what you have mentioned. I am 21f and I have given this a lot of thought throughout my life. I was bullied in school for my looks and the fact that I was always a loner. People always look at me funny, I have heard them whisper things and all that. It sucks and it brought me down so bad, I was not even willing to leave the house anymore. \n\nBut I got tired of all that and the fact that I was missing out on so many things not only for my health conditions but for my looks too. So I decided to stop giving two fucks at people, buy a swimming suit and go have a swim at my local pool. I figured they would look at me if I wear normal clothes, baggy clothes, whatever. So why not a swimming suit? And you know what, they did. But after a while, everyone was doing their thing again and I felt good and comfortable because I was finally being able to swim without many layers of clothes and breast pads. \n\nI am not saying it is easy. It took my damn while to get my shit together and do it. But it is definitely worth it because it will help you to be more comfortable in your own skin not only there, but everywhere in every aspect of life. I still have my lows and days where I just do not feel okay about the whole thing. But my theory is that that is the result of years being insecure about myself. So do not blame yourself for the lows or how your body looks. Embrace your body and think of it as a way for your thoughts, hopes and feelings to reach out to the world. Wish you luck and all the happiness in the world. This is cold comfort, but I can assure you, insecurity goes away with age. You are at that age where insecurity is at a bit of a peak. Rest assured, even if you did not have marfan syndrome, you would still feel insecurity about your body. That just comes with the territory at 19. But it sounds like you are indeed attracting people, so my advice would be to try and focus on your strengths. You are clearly doing something right. Beauty fades eventually, anyway. I am a man so it is a bit different but I can relate. I have never been the \"ideal\" body shape and was teased a lot too.\n\nHere is the thing though, I do not owe anything to anyone in terms of my looks or my body. Anyone who demands something of me in that way can get stuffed basically.\n\nAnd yeah, I am 40 and can 100% confirm it gets easier. I am married, I have lots of friends, I am a DJ sometimes and I spend 0% of my day worried about the people I went to high school with. As a marf I often get insecure with my body and I cannot promise a magical cure to it. But sonce I started going to therapy I have improved on self-acceptance and anxiety towards my body.

I used to have terrible posture from years of slouching, trying to play down my height and curving my shoulders to hide my pectus. The chiropractor has helped tremendously, along with standing tall and proud the older I got. I no longer have posture issues. Any advice for seeing a chiro? I have been warned against it. I have EDS though, not margans. Physical therapy. Strengthening your muscles will help. I have a lot of joint/neuro issues and the thought of seeing a chiro scares the shit out of me.

Am I able to go to the gym at all and build muscle then? My doctor kept saying it is fine if I go to the gym and that there are plenty of ways to build muscle that do not involve lifting weights (the one thing he told me to avoid) but I am not entirely sure that is true? Surely other exercises and workouts are still going to put stress on my heart?\n\nCan anyone clear this up? What size is your aortic branch, is it enlarged? \n\nThe specialist specialist cardiologist I saw (I have seen 3 so far) stated I should not be lifting anything over 12kg or something like that until they can confirm if I actually have Marfan's. \n\nIt is still up to you if you take the advise on, I didnt and was lifting weighst until I got lazy and stopped my regime.\n\nWhich reminds me I really need to get back into it.  Well, we are not your medical advisors, so take everything said here with a healthy scepticism. I will try to share my experience. \n\nI had my aorta get larger (stretch) three times in my life. Everytime it was when I started a sport that made my blood pressure really high (For me it was swimming, dancing and running). The last time, I will not lie, I was not very thoroughly taking my beta blockers. Also for a long time I was really competitive and it was hard for me to stop/rest if everyone else was still going. \n\nThe problem with aorta - it can get larger in any person that has Marfan. Really fast. And you do not feel it. \n\nSo if you do any sports, you should have regular check-ups. And you should try to build your stamina slowly. If you are out of breath, your face is read, your pulse is fast, you should not push yourself as hard. \n\nIf I were you, I would listen to your doctor. But if you are not going to listen, then be careful. \n\n\n I have not been told any details. I have just been told \"everything looks normal\", \"everything is fine\" and to be cautious because I have some Marfan symptoms. I have not been given specifics at all which is quite frustrating. I am basically told that because I have some symptoms (the pectus and the long, skinny limbs as well as being underweight) that I should not lift weights just in case. Surely that cannot be the case for every single person who just has a couple of the symptoms? Of course I will listen to my doctor but it is very frustrating because I am thinking well if everything is fine, and always has been, why am I being cautious?  Sounds exactly like my situation, I am still waiting for the genetic test to come back to confirm if I even have it.\n\nHow old are you? I am almost 33 and I am at the critical point for anything to happen if I have Marfan's. When I was first getting chekced out, my cardiologists were worried. Now they are pretty chill and are just watching to see if anything does come up. \n\nIn the end, it is up to you how you handle this.  Live a normal life or wrap yourself in bubble wrap just in case. \n I just had a similar thing-- my doc is rooting for me to do cardio, pilates, yoga, cycling--anything low impact. I went to two boxing classes and it was so fucking fun but he thinks the repeated impact is going to put a strain on my aorta too much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApologies, I am not really offering any insight into your issue, mostly just sharing my venting and frustration with feeling limited physically. My biennial echos between 2010 and 2017 showed no changes in the aortic root measurements, and most doctors I talked to do not seem concerned about me working out. As far as I understand, one of the diagnostic criteria for Marfan's is aortic aneurysm, without it you might present many \"Marfanoid\" features but not have the CTD itself -- assuming no familial history.\n\nI stopped lifting after a recent pneumothorax and scheduled another echo, but I have been waiting for that for over two months now and started working out again because I am tired of waiting.\n\nI think there are many factors that should come into you deciding what you want to do. My reasoning was that I am 29 now and with five scans spanning a decade, some signs would probably have presented by now. My alternative is to atrophy over the span of a year waiting for an echo or maybe longer than that for a genetic consult.\n\nThe easy and safe answer is to say not to work out, be patient, etc. There are safe-ish ways to build muscle that are less optimal, that will not shoot your blood pressure through the rough and stress your heart. You can always compromise with something like that if you want to do something while still being safe.", "Marfan's and weightloss? Hello, I know most people who have Marfan's  are underweight but I personally have always been on the chubby side. Since I started birth control I have been putting on some more extra kgs and that is a huge concern because I can already feel more strain on my lower back and knees. Have any of you had a successful weightloss journey? Did you follow a specific diet to prevent muscle loss? I worry a lot that by losing weight I will lose a lot of muscle mass and that is so hard to build for me...\nAlso if anyone has any other recommendations I would be so grateful to hear them! Thanks a lot If you eat lots of low fat proteins and do some weight lifting or machine exercises then you can maintain or build muscle mass while losing weight. Thanks for replying! :) I have lost weight by simply using My Fitness Pal and counting my calories. So marfan's can be very cruel for weight.  As a male, when I did start putting on weight is was almost exclusively in my gut.  Couple that with activity restrictions and it can be incredibly frustrating.\n\nBest advice I can give is cardio.  Walk walk walk.  Elliptical if you can do it.  Mantra is low impact high reps.  Anything where you are \"bearing down\" is bad, unfortunately. I tried to lose weight by normal dieting before but I felt way too weak after losing about 5kg, even though my diet was pretty balanced. I was thinking I might need some type of supplement or something. I was always pear shaped, with my weight distributed somewhat evenly, but this kgs I have put on recently went straight to my stomach as well!! I have had spine fusion and after 10 years I am finally beginning to be able to exercise but it is so easy to accidentally overexert myself, then the pain makes me want to give up even trying, so I am constantly really frustrated too :(\n\nI actually like the elliptical better than walking! I feel like it puts less stress on my knees and I can be more stable on it. I can only do max 30 min though before getting exhausted but I hope ill gain some resistance soon.\n\nThanks so much for the advice, sorry if my English is kind of rusty hope it is understandable! The elliptical is definitely lower impact on the joints, but no less good a workout!  However, in some cases, the impact is actually *good* for the joints.  Talk to your doctor, everyone is different, but it may be a good idea to mix in something harder in say once a week or every other week.  Obviously though, if it hurts it is not helping!\n\nAnd half an hour on an elliptical is great!\n\nAlso, your English is fantastic.  I would not have known it was not your first language if you had not told me. Oh that is a good point! I am trying to all my doctor's appointments up to date and I will be sure to ask the orthopedist about it.\n\nI do the elliptical slowly so I always think it is not enough haha but slow progress is still progress right :)\n\nAnd thank you so much! I am a little late to the table but I am new to this sub. I lost 50 pounds on keto in 10 months. If you can put up with high protein, low card and sugar, you can totally loss weight. All the Marf\u2019s in my family have been overweight until now. Good luck! Wow that is incredible!! Congratulations! To be honest I tried a high protein diet for 3 days and had mood swings so hard I gave up. I read a little more about them after and it sounds like the first week is the worst? How was it for you? I was already thinking of giving it another try and now you have made me want to do it even more.\nThank you so much for the suggestion! The first week was really rough! Terrible mood swings! But now, I feel great! I do not crave sugar or carbs like I used to.

I know that joint hypermobility is supposed to be a symptom of Marfan's but I am curious if anyone diagnosed has the opposite problem \u2014\u00a0namely, very limited overhead mobility that does not seem to improve with stretching or training. In my case, I cannot seem to get beyond about 70 degrees of shoulder flexion, even hanging from a pull-up bar. Are you sure it is not injury? Even without a significant cause (like a traffic accident or fall) we are fragile and even day to day activity can destroy our joints. \n\nI needed surgery to repair my jaw/remove scar tissue, for example, because the joint was destroyed just from eating. I had significantly reduced mobility and pain (average person can open their mouth something like 40-55 mm, I could only open about 10, 20 if I forced it) as part of the diagnostic criteria. I (for the most part) have less mobility/flexibility than what I hear from most people, the exception is my knees and my hands, but they do not dislocate, I can just hyperextend them.\n\nHypermobility is just a symptom, and as such, not everyone has it.\n\nDo you have kyphosis or scoliosis or shoulderblade(s) that stick out more than normal/the other? My right arm has less range of motion, but that is mostly because of my kyphosis and the fact I broke my arm about 1/4th inch away from needing an airplane cast (the type that has your arm propped up away from yourself).\n\nHope this helps! I have got moderate kyphosis but it is not noticeable if you do not know what you are looking for.

I dealt with some TMJ when I was younger but I seem to do ok just avoiding really chewy foods. I cannot remember ever having a shoulder or back injury though. You are saying it could have just happened without me noticing? Well, it sounds like you *are* noticing. I am just saying that our more fragile joints mean it does not take an accident or something significant to injure it, just use. If you have not got the joint checked, I would definitely say you should. I have pretty poor overhead arm mobility.  The only thing that has ever really had an immediate and noticable impact is electro-accupunture.   After just a minute of that, I was able to move my shoulder further than I ever have and it was much stronger too.\n\nI would recommend you start my strengthening the muscle underneath your shoulder.  Google scapular push-ups, they are a good place to start. I have exactly what you described - I also have pectus carinatum and kyphosis, had my spine fused like 6 yrs ago but my kyphosis isint that that bad, my right shoulder blade protrudes more - looks a bit unnatural. But like u said it is not noticeable unless people really look, that is how mine is as well. \n\nI have tried little in terms of professional therapies but was thinking about it and will do more research. Ive been told that Osteopathy is great for this kind of thing so might look into that and go once covid subsides.I used to have a full spine massage way back last year, and she would work quite a bit on my right sholder, neck and traps - my right trap is super tense and looks more \"swole\" that the other despite 0 upper body exercise\ud83d\ude02 from the massages I never noticed any further mobility - all just remained the same and I went every 3 -4 weeks for a year and a half. \n\nI can swing on a pull up bar and hang for a bit but it causes weird pain in my right shoulder. Without using gravity from the pull up bar my arms could never go that straight up\ud83d\ude02 I will deffo keep trying as I recently got into yoga and if things really improve I will shoot u an update:) \n\nAll the best, I hope ur shoulder mobility improves!! Take care xox", "Ok men, hit me with your clothing solutions: business edition So I appear to have reached the point where I need to adult way harder than I am currently adulting and I need to up my wardrobe game. Specifically, I am talking dress shirts. I am tired of buying things that are long enough and too baggy or fitting, but too short. I am even willing to go full-on tailored if I need to. I consider this an investment. So tell me, /r/marfans: where do you get dress shirts that fit us? What is your amazing solution that none of us know about? Also, I am in California if that helps. Aaaaaand  go. When I was a bit thinner (have a bit of a belly now), the skinny fitted dress shirts at Banana Republic fit me really well. Arms were long enough but not too baggy, and the torso fit really well while being long enough to stay tucked in. Usually around $60 a shirt. Business wise I wear a lot of Jack London, they design stuff with a thinner cut and make them to look good. \n\nI am 194cm(6'3) and 60 kilos (130 pounds) at best and their stuff makes me look good. \n\nThey are not cheap, but they are not as high as complete tailoring.\n\nWe also have a brand here in au called Conner, who tend to have thinner cut dress shirts as well. 6\u20197\u201d and between 210 and 240 for most of my adult working life.\n\nI have mainly worn Stafford (a J.C. Penney house brand) dress shirts. They carry my size, which is 16.5 x 39. Not many do. I have had a couple of their premium 100% cotton ones tailored. \n\nIf you have got shorter arms, or are okay rolling the sleeves, then I will wholeheartedly recommend Lands End and L.L. Bean shirts. Their sleeve maxes out at 37\u201d.\n\nAmerican Tall has a bunch of tall and extra-tall products. I bought one and was impressed with the quality but it was the wrong size for me (I was too fat), returned it and did not buy another.\n\nI would also recommend getting at least a few made-to-measure shirts, whether from an online tailor like M Tailor or Indochino, from a local tailor, or from Nordstrom\u2019s made-to-measure service. They will fit you better than ANY off-the-rack shirt, and should last a good long while with proper care. I would get at least one white shirt w/ French cuffs and one blue shirt.

Sorry if this is not really right for this sub, I have tried googling it but all that comes up is heart surgery info. \n\nBasically I am having tests to check if I have Marfan syndrome.

I guess its a finer line of what they have to hit. Theres also another medication some of us have to take before dentist stuff iirc That is good to know, thank you! I do not think it makes surgery significantly more dangerous (i could be wrong) \n\nI have had a number of surgeries without any danger i think, its more of an effectiveness issue\n\nDural Ectasia is very common in Marfan's syndrome and this can make anaesthetic more complicated and less effective (studies suggest that between 65% and 90% of Marfans patients develop Dural Ectasia) \n\nI know Anaesthetic makes me very nauseous and i woke up half way through a surgery once- though whether this is marfans related is unknown\n\nyou may also take slightly longer to heal from the surgery \n\nyour best bet will be to raise it during your pre-op assessment and see what the doctor and anaesthetist say Thank you! I will be sure to do that! :) heyy, usually we have valve/aortic conditions that elevates a little bit our risk but if you are healthy you dont need to worry. \nIt is good to check with an cardiologist that is used to marfan beforehand , maybe an specialist (it is common to find cardiologist that dont know a lot about it) and keep track of your Ecocardiograms routinely if you have an aortic dilatation or valve insuficiency.\nIm young, been to 3 big surgeries and recovered of them without any comolication and if you are healthy and is well amparated by good docs, you dont have to worry.  Reposting this in the right spot\n\nTo my knowledge, no. I am not a doctor but have ~20 surgeries in my 32 years and have not had complications, and I have had some pretty major stuff.\n\nYou run a risk of internal bleeding **IF** you have had valve repair (replacement with mechanical valves, specifically) and that is due to having to be on blood thinners.\n\nThe only concern I have heard of marfans and anesthesia is whether or not your lungs will handle going on/off the ventilator if you are being put under.\n\nBest of luck with the procedure! Good luck be strong you got this Thank you, that is very helpful :) Thanks, I will be sure to talk about it with someone who knows their stuff Thank you ^.^", "26, un-insured, still unsure if I have Marfans or not. ", "Having Marfan Syndrome and deciding to have children? Hey guys, recently I have been thinking about this a lot.  \n\n\nKnowing that marfan syndrome is a genetic condition that is inherited in a dominant fashion, this gives me a 50% probability that my children will have the condition. Honestly, all my life I have thought I never really wanted to have kids, but recently, my girlfriend is the type of girl who reeeally loves kids and she is been giving me all these indirect signs so I have been thinking about this a lot recently.  \n\n\nHas anyone here had kids? Could you tell me about your decision regarding this issue? First of all, if you want to have a lasting relationship you need to be completely open with each other communication-wise. Hints and such do not work, especially for big decisions. \n\nYes, each time you have a 50/50 chance of passing it on. The child could be less affected then you or more affected.  \n\nMy dad had detached lenses, pectus, and that was it until he needed aorta surgery at around 50. \n\nAs for me, dislocated lenses and multiple retina detachments. Multiple spinal surgeries and difficulty fusion. Heart surgery when I was young. Chronic pain, Dural ectasia, lung issues, etc. \n\nYou can use PGD with IVF to only implant unaffected embryos. That would mean you have a kid without Marfan. \n\nThe mother needs to know all about this. It is her body. She should do a ton of research on Marfan, just as my wife did before we got married.\n\nGood luck! I didnt want kids because i never wanted to pass Marfans onto my children, but life doesnt work out like that. I have an 8yo daughter, shes positive to the Marfan gene, and is quite tall, but so far doesnt have any other symptoms. In the future, it is possible to go the IVF route with a tested sperm, but cost could be an issue depending on your country. I have Marfans, and I have two kids - one with Marfans and the other without. \n\nEveryone has something that is not perfect about themselves, that is normal. We know what our thing is, or at least one of them, and Marfans is actually pretty manageable. Why not adopt? There is not really a wrong answer here but depending on what you both decide to do, just be prepared to be judged a little from others. If you decide to have kids naturally, there are those who will judge you for potentially passing the gene along, and if you decide to go a different route, there are those with Marfans who take it personally. \n\nI did not want to pass on the gene, so we decided to do IVF with PGD. It was successful and we have a daughter Marfans free. This was a very tough road both physically and emotionally. We tried IVF again four times for a second child, but unfortunately it did not work- I had two failed embryo transfers and two miscarriages. But we still want to have more kids so we are in the process to adopt and are really excited about it. \n\nIVF for us was a good choice, but it was also covered by insurance, which we were so thankful for. If it was not covered, we might have made a different decision. It is a lot more involved for the woman- many injections, and you have to do at least one egg retrieval. They combine the egg with the sperm, an embryo forms, then after about 5 days, they take a biopsy of the embryo and send it to a lab for the Marfan testing. You have to work with the lab ahead of time so they know what mutations to test for. The embryo is frozen while you wait for the testing results, if they com back good, you schedule a frozen embryo transfer and pray it works. \n\nGood luck with your decision! Piggy-backing on this, I am not sure where you live, but I am in Canada. I had genetic testing to prove I had Marfan\u2019s, and was told because of that proof, IVF would be an option (where they test for Marfan\u2019s, as she said), and I believed it is covered. We chose not to have kids, but it was great to know that option was available to us. I just want to jump in to mention to any women with marf reading this that there are risks you need to evaluate before becoming pregnant.  I am not sure if that is just one of those things women know because, well, it affects them, but I (a dude) only recently became aware of that. Hi not sure if that is just one of those things women know because, well, it affects them, but I (a dude) only recently became aware of that, I am Dad\ud83d\udc68 Very cool bot to show up in a thread about the descsion to have children with a lifelong condition.  Thanks so much for making! Well, if you just try the \"regular mode\", you know that there is naturally 50% chance of having it.\nBut since your girl seems to be open minded to talk about it, tell her about the conditions and the things that could happen, and tell her about in vitro method, in which could really decrease the chance.\nAlso, what are your other fears?\n\nI am a woman, got pregnant, lost the baby, and after that I have not only thought about having a baby, but also: with all the things in my condition, will I be able to be a good and caring mother as all she needs? Will my conditions allow that?\n\nWe know that there are different levels of marfan, my parents do not have it, and I do. I know I have aorta issues, I frequently have to go to the hospital, and I really think: do I want my child to be someone who needs to frequently visit his/her mother often in the hospital as her daddy takes care of her?\n\nSo, you really need to think about all the pros and cons, all the possibilities, and talk openly to your gf. Yep, I am not interested in having children and I am pretty gay but I have been warned by my cardiologist, neurosurgeon and gyno that I absolutely cannot have children. Best case scenario is I would end up paralyzed.\n\nOf course, this is not true for all female marfs, but getting pregnant is not something that should be taken lightly. You could adopt or go the PGD/IVF route to make sure that gene is not inherited. I (F) will go with one of those options if I decide to have kids.  \n\n\nSomeone mentioned in the comments that you might get judged either way. The way I see it, there is no way in hell I would have a child normally if I knew there is a 50/50 chance of them getting Marfan from me. They could end up having it way worse than me. Not sure why anyone with Marfan should feel insulted by that. We want our kids to be as healthy as possible, right? Yep, a lot of this. I do not have Marfan, but my husband does, and he is like you - a random genetic mutation, neither of his parents have it or had ever heard of it. He is also on the severe end of the variable expression scale, and just got out of the hospital after a 2-week stay; he had to have his spine fused from his pelvis to T-5. It was actually a fusion and revision, as it was fused the first time over 20 years ago, and kept deteriorating until it had to be re-done. Those are the types of things we thought about when we decided not to have kids. Who would take care of the kid while he/we are in the hospital? What if he needs to go to the ER at midnight, and I have to take the kid with us? What will that do for their school schedule? Also, would he always feel like he was missing out on something by not being able to do all the things w/a kid that his did did w/him? He cannot lift more than 15 pounds on a good day. PGD/IVF? Interesting, I will also have to read into it Yeah it made sense as soon as I heard it, but I was surprised it was not something I was aware of.  Again, was not sure if that was because of my \"Y\" or what, but I would rather put it out there redundantly than... not.\n\nI am glad to hear it sounds like people make you aware early. I am sorry if I sound harsh, but I would never forgive my parents if they had passed down such a life-altering condition onto me with full knowledge of the likelihood that it could happen, and, as such, cannot in good faith support a Marf's decision to have biological children without IVF.  It depends. My wife and I decided to have kids naturally, but we also have several family members who live near us and are supportive who also have marfan's. I think it is about your individual situation, and family mutation. We talked allot with my family cardiologist before we went through with pregnancy, and It is certainly not something to go into lightly.\n\nMy eldest does not have marfan's, and my youngest does. My father and brother have marfan's.\n\nI want to add that before we had kids I took care of a woman in her eighties in a nursing home who had marfan's, and talked with her daughter who also had marfan's quite a bit. Everyone makes different choices. I think it is much much harder for women with marfan's, but that medically it is much more of an option and safer than it used to be.\n\nEdit: I'ma guy. We talked about kids for years before we decided to go ahead 50% Chance of carrying all the physical pain and health issues down to a person who does not deserve it.  I did not inherit my Marfan from anyone, but if I did I would be more then angry at that person for reproducing.  \n\n\nJust adopt or take responsibility for a child that has to be forced down the same hardships from Marfan you have went through I absolutely refuse to risk inflicting this horror on an innocent child. My hypothetical children deserve better than that. Every child deserves better than that.      \n\n(Not to mention the countless poor kids that are *already here* that desperately need a home and someone to love them.)\n\nI encourage people to not be so selfish as to risk that just because they want a 'biological' kid.    \nIt is not about you, or your life, or what you want. It is about someone who has no choice in the matter. It is about suffering that could so easily be prevented if people would just use their damn brain and ignore their unnecessary &amp; outdated animalistic urge to reproduce. Update: I do not think there is a clear answer to this question. I know it might sound selfish, but after thinking for awhile, I think the answer is really influenced by where we are located in the marfan spectrum.   \n\n\nPerhaps for those of us that have a milder version, the decision is in this grey area, whilst those of us that lie on the more deeper end of the marfan spectrum, the answer less grey in the sense that, you should heavily think about the health of yours and your child. As a young person, it is really great to hear I have options like this for the future. I most likely will not have a biological child (F/29) . I spent many years toiling with this question. My parents had 7 children. 5 of us have Marfans. My Dad did not properly disclose his condition to my Mom. Men with Marfans have an easier time passing down Marfans bc their contribution to the baby making process is negligible. (Do I sound resentful? Lol...I am very resentful.)\nA doctor told me when I was 23 I would need to get a valve replaced in order to have kids. \n\nI was scared to date seriously. I thought I about just dating women. But I met a dude who loves me and my Marfans. I told him pretty early in that I will not have biological children. He is supportive. \nToday I was talking about estate sales and children. He joked that I want an estate sale baby. It is true. I am super interested in fostering/adoption when I am ready.

Does anybody has experience diagnosing marfans from 23 and me raw genetic data? I was diagnosed with 7.3 centimeter aorta root aneurysm last summer and have pectus carinatum (pigeon chest), finger hypermobility and some other marfans symptoms. Have dr appointment march 1st and want to learn as much as possible to make a qualified decision about treatment. I am 64 male, perfect health otherwise,  no aneurysm symptoms. i dont think they diagnose this ?? do they ??? not 23 and me directly. But there are sites that is possible do download the raw data from 23 and me and they analyze the genes. I was looking if somebody has experience with it That aortic root number should tell you right off.  I have never seen one that high without it being positive. I am almost sure that i have marfans. I just want to have it confirmed before my dr. visit. My dr. does not like what i eat and might blame it on my diet (eating keto for the last 6 and a half years). My blood pressure was never over 120/80 in the last 6 months (i measure several times a day). My blood work is either perfect or picture perfect. No medications whatsoever. Keto cannot do that.  That is essentially exclusively a connective tissue disease. i did not mean keto causing marfans. I want to exclude keto causing aneurysm. He is 64. People can have aneurysms without having Marfan at that age, and at 7.3cm he really should get surgery as soon as possible, symptoms or not. Surgery is absolutely right.  It is useless to argue why, the point right now is to seek help.\n\nAlso, did not know that about aging, so thank you, extrasolar Pater. 23andme does not contain your fully sequenced DNA in the raw data they provide you, only a very small portion of it. I do not know that you would see the genes in question if you were to look at it. There are other DNA companies that will do a full sequencing for you, but those kits usually cost around $500. thank you I am not excluding surgery, i am still doing research about it. It is which one of Russian roulettes i pick. Dying during or shortly after surgery probability is about 5%, similar probability of death is during emergency surgery after aorta dissection. Probability of dying without surgery based on my height and aneurysm size is about 12% within a year.  I am also not sure about the quality of life after the surgery. Right now i am in excellent health, blood pressure averages 110/70, perfect lipid profile, can do 64 pushups on a drop of a hat. The aneurysm was found accidentally when i requested coronary calcium scoring last year. Without that it might have gone undetected for several more years. I just want to make a qualified decision based on all factors, not just on the size of the aneurysm. Just putting my thoughts together. As someone who is experienced both: you really, really do not want to have a dissection. There is no pain quite like it, and it is by far the most painful, agonizing experience I have had in my entire life. It still haunts me, five years later, and that is with therapy focused on PTSD treatment.\n\nQualifier: I am not a doctor, but below is what I know of life after it, both from personal experience and research:\n\nAs for quality of life after, are they suggesting a valve sparing procedure or would they be replacing the valve as well? If it is calve sparing after recovery it should, in general, be back to normal after recovering. If they offer a cardiac rehab service I highly recommend it, I found it really helpful.\n\nIf it is valve replacement, you will need blood thinners from then on, and everything that goes with that. Otherwise it is similar to the above. This is correct. The ancestry stuff at the cheap places will not get you the confirmation. It used to be thousands to get the marfan gene targeted results done because it is a totally different thing. Go through your doctor if you have health care &amp; depending upon your insurance it may be free after your deductible. You may be able to get it through a private place deductible but ask them. \n\nAs for your quality of life, it is not my place but obviously surgery is not for everyone. Good luck. Invitae is what my genetics office went through for me. It was 250 for diagnostic testing. The only reason I used them was The Greenwood Genetics Center $1500, and the doctor even said it was faster than their own. Thank you", "Life after heart surgery? Hello, I have read on forums that after you have a heart surgery for marfans your lifespan becomes the one of a normal person (I know some marfans live up to 70 but I did not know how to rephrase the question). I wanted to ask you guys for your experiences and how healthy have you been after surgery? Thanks! I am about a year and a half out of my surgery (I am a male in my late twenties). I would say its been normal! There was some pain for about - 4 weeks? post surgery. But after that i did not really get any pain. I have been exercising and have not had any issues. Now that i have a mechanical valve - i do have to take warfarin but it has not really given me any major problems. My heart does always tick now. I guess sometimes i get abit annoyed /embarrassed? But then i remind myself that it is nothing to be ashamed of. It doesnt bother me 90% of the time. \n\nLet me know if you have any specific questions! Diagnosed at birth. I had an aneurysm repaired on my aortic root in 2011. Also have an artificial aortic valve from the same ordeal. \n\n\nI will say that the one thing I was not prepared for after the surgery was fatigue. It was a few months before I could make it through the grocery store or a hot shower without becoming winded.\n\n\nI am 33 now. I work a fairly labor intensive job as a warehouse manager. Most all of my pains and discomforts are musculoskeletal and not related to the surgery. Sore hands, wrists, and shoulders from stacking boxes and unloading shipping containers. \n\n\n\nMy previous job was as a skilled laborer for a masonry crew. I mixed mortar in a wheelbarrow 6 days a week. Extremely hot and heavy work. Even then, my real struggles were not ever related to my surgery. Just joint and muscle pain.  I started with that crew in 2013. Something like 18 or 20 months after my surgery. Damn bro you really like tough physical job! Good to hear you are doing good heart wise now. Thanks for the reply Man.. I can relate to that lol. It gets really loud if I take a deep breath and puff out my chest. Makes an echo chamber in your lungs. When I first had the mech valve put in, the sound would wake me up at night. I rarely notice it now. \n\nMy wife says she cannot sleep without hearing that \"tick, tick, tick\". Thanks for the reply. Here is a question: did your doctor told you you could engage in more heavy physical activity now that your valve has been fixed? Or you remain the same about the restrictions? For sure! I do enjoy hard work. I also suffer from it at times. I get intense migraines from muscle spasms in my back. After an unusually heavy day my hips, knees, and shoulders hurt like hell. Even if the day is not heavy, just long, it will be my ankles from so much walking. \n\nIt sounds bad, but the pain i get in my back from setting at a desk is much worse so I will take a labor job over a desk job most days lol. Well... I think the consensus is that you do not engage in heavy physical activity. Having said that - my cardiologist did say that he was happy for me to do light weight lifting (things that I could do 15 reps of without getting out of breath or straining). I have not yet done this as I am hesitant, but that what he has cleared me for....\n\nI have been sticking more to cycling, swimming, golf, jogging, yoga and stretches. I may look at doing very light weights to condition my muscles. Here is a recent study: (\n\nYour aortic root has been fixed but the rest of the aorta still can have issues. I am in my 40s and had my heart surgery at 20. I have had no additional heart surgery but lots of other stuff has gone wrong. I am basically fully disabled now and in near constant pain.\n\nTake care of your body. Your aorta may not kill you early but the rest of your body can give out and really impact your quality of life. May i ask why are you disabled right now? Also, glad you did not need any more heart surgeries. Dural ectasia, heart issues, stroke(s), nerve pain, back pain from my old school fusion, arthritis, stomach issues, etc. I have had two valve surgeries, mitral @ 4yrs and aortic root &amp; descending aortic graft (I think? never remember which one). My life has been more impacted by the OTHER things related to marfan, like lungs, eyeballs, etc. I had a stroke at 22, dural ectasia led to CSF leak which led to other complications. My hips are 2x older than I am, yada yada. \n\nSome days are hard physically, others are not. Most days are a struggle with depression than anything. Do not neglect your mental health either, it is just as important as your physical health.\n\nBeyond that? I am rounding 34 in August and life has been... well... normal? but I suppose that subject as to what is normal. Kind Of depends. I had my first open heart at 16 for mitral valve repair. My energy improved greatly after that!! Of course there was recovery but after a few months i really could tell how much stronger my heart was and once fully recovered I felt so great! I had my aortic root replacement surgery at 23, so less than a year ago. I am still recovering from that and actually had a ton of complications leading me to need another open heart surgery soon to fix a leaky aorta valve. I am hoping after that i will be back to feeling like my stronger self again! how is the dural ectasia diagnosed? I am curious bc I have never heard about this before but i am seeing it is pretty common for marfs For me, DE was found during a routine MRI of my heart/torso as an adult. Apparently a saggy bag around your spine is pretty easy to see if you know what to look for.\n\nCSF (cerebral spinal fluid) leak tends to depend on the person as to knowing it is there. Usually the biggest indicator is low pressure headaches since the fluid up round your brain is not right because of the leak. the low pressure headaches tend to go away when you lie down. Other people tend to say they can feel the pressure change from their skull to spine, other people do not even notice and it is just something to keep an eye on.\n\nI tend to be of the sort of luck of Murphy's Law. If it could go wrong, it will. My DE led to a CSF leak that led to brain sag which led to two torn vessels which led to two separate brain bleeds, which led to surgery and yadda yadda. I am typically an extreme case, I do not recall what I have posted prior in this thread, but I had two heart valves, an aortic graft, Harrington rods placed, spinal fusion, Harrington rods removed,  tarlov cyst shunted, both lenses removed, and a pneumothorax all by the time I was 10. I have since been mostly stable but boy howdy, when something goes sideways, it really does so for me. So take my stories with a grain of salt. No two marfan patients are the same.\n\nThese are all also questions that you should and could bring to your doctor. They know your situation better than anybody here does and they will be way more helpful than we could be 'round here :) i have not needed the surgery yet but my father had it 15 years ago, he used to be a really active person and had to slow down a bit but he is now doing great!! he is had cancer in the last year and is doing okay with that as well and living a pretty much regular life. He had his surgery at 33 and is now 48 :)) Thanks for the reply\u2019s and I am glad you and your father are doing okay. :) I had PEARS eight months ago and was completely back to normal in less than 3 months. If it were not for my itchy scar, I would not know that I had surgery. I can do everything, if not more, than I could do before. \n\nPEARS is the surgery of the future. No cardiopulmonary bypass, two hour operation, no life long blood thinners, quicker recovery, and you get to keep all your own parts. Good luck!", "Is it ok to stretch? I have some back pains and I realized stretching my upper/lower back, legs and knees really helps with the pain. As I am progressing I am getting more flexible and I worry it can make my joints and tendons weaker and increase the chance of rupturing it. What do you think about it? Stretching is fine. I am not a doctor, but that is why you asked this sub. Everyone else here will say things like \"ThAt MaY bE fInE fOr YoU, bUt....\" fuck them. You know I am not a doctor.

I was told my mother and I  had Marfanoid characteristics but neither of our arm spans met the requirements.\n\nI did my own research and discovered MASS Phenotype.

Finding communities online is awesome so you do not feel so alone &amp; can build confidence to be able to talk about what you are going through. when I was young I did not have much support from my family and they told me I could not do anything etc this went on until 24 years but they did that out of making sure I will not be around anymore from this I learned to always  to indicate your own boundary. through which you can build a pretty pleasant life, but sometimes you cannot keep up with the rest of the people. long walks and cycling are no longer really possible, because of this you often feel alone compared to your other peers.  think in options, go to the movies more often and enjoy the little things.maar the operatis can be intense but afterwards you usually feel 10x better.  and mentally too because you have different views.  being sick is a good eyes opener you appreciate everything much more.

The result has not came back yet but it is fairly obvious since all my 3 siblings have symptoms. I am 23M and I would greatly appreciate all your advices regarding working out!\nI love lifting and running, but I just got an echo done and it shows that my lower left chamber is a bit larger than usual and my aortic sinus is 3.42cm (I think it is very bad at 5cm). My doctor told me a yearly check up is needed but I can still regularly workout and run marathon. However I am a bit worried that doing so would make it worse. Does anybody have any advice on this? Should I monitor my heart rate and if so, how many bpm should be max so my heart does not work too hard?\n\nThank you guys! Hey welcome to the club! Here is a extensive list of what they recommend: (\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst, do you exhibit marfanoid features?\n\n&gt;Your doctor may be a little too willing to risk your health in my opinion. I was 19 when I found out and 3.9 cm dilated then. I was fine for 13 years and then started to swell either randomly or through lifting which I was attempting since the doctors were on the fence about me having it or not for years. Then once I reached 4.2 cm they were like yea you have Marfan's, do not lift anything over 10-15 pounds. So i understand why you want to lift but it can absolutely aggravate the condition and cause your aorta to swell. I hope you do not have it, but if I were you I would exercise without the risk of causing anything to happen to your aorta. You do not want to have replacement surgery most likely. People do dissect before 4.5 cm and below that are Marfanoids also, 5 cm dilated is bad but it can happen anytime. Why heavy-lifting is so scary for us is because it causes the veins to dilate too much already. Think of a body builders veins when they flex, that is the exact thing we are trying to avoid because of the FBN1 deficiency. As for the heart rate that may be a little more tricky especially if you are on beta-blockers as that will slow your heart rate anyways and helps to keep it regulated even while working out. Also running a marathon might be out of the question also for the heart and your joints. I think they only recommend jogging and walking moderate distances, no sprinting or long distance I do believe. Its mainly swimming and biking and other low impact no contact sports. I know none of that sounds exhilarating whenever you know you can do more but dont forget Marfan's is hidden and can cause a good illusion on the person afflicted with it. \n\nHope this helps and I can answer any other questions you may have. If you find out you do have it you may want to use a doctor that is very knowledgeable about Marfans. \n\n&amp;#x200B; Thanks for the reply! Yeah I have been heavy lifting throughout my teenage years and I am planning to stop but will probably keep lifting lightweights just to stay fit. I am currently not on any medication. And the doctor is pretty sure we have Marfan even without the lab result. My brother who is 18 has worse symptoms than I do, although his heart is perfectly normal (but that is maybe because he did not work out like I did)\n\nIf you do not mind me asking, are you getting any surgeries on your aorta or just taking medication? I am taking the medication but I am swelling regardless. The condition is degenerative and it only slows the swelling. There are some studies about it preventing swelling but most likely if will get to the point where you need a surgery which is why it is so dangerous to lift. And you can ask them anything anytime. And this is not to scare you, I lifted just the same and I regret it. I should not have done that it was dumb for me too. But it did not cause too much damage luckily.  Yep, after seeing doctors and talking to other people, I think I am going to only do fast walks and very light bodyweight workouts now. Thanks for sharing with me! I have known I am abnormal for quite some time but it did not hit me until last week just how serious this is so a lot is going through my mind right now. We understand for sure. I was in denial for a long time. Why me? No way I have this phase, like I am sure a lot of us did. But do not forget biking and swimming to change it up to keep the workouts engaging. I also walk all the time but I find it more interesting to listen to music and podcast or audiobooks. But you are not abnormal you are unique ;/) Keep is posted on how everything goes.   Yup I heard swimming is good as well but I am kind of conflicted because I heard it is good because it is noncontact, but then swimming also requires holding our breath, which is bad on the heart? I do swimming and light calisthetics and I (not to sound cocky) am in great shape. I am not very bulky but I am very lean and defined. So swimming would be my recommendation if you were worried because it does not put strain on your joints while weight training does. I do do gym workouts but it is mainly stuff like pushups and sit ups. If I ever do use weights it is always light kettle bells and squats with weights. Essentially weighted movement. I am no doctor and I could be wrong but pure weight training would be a no-no for me", "Do those with Marfans grow longer?

If you want you can contact me at the Marfan Foundation in NY -  Vermont has a couple families, but I am not in contact with any of them other than my own. Hey , I am a 19M currently living in Montreal ! I just saw your post and I would certainly be interested Hey! Awesome! That would be nice to hang out and get to help each other. PV if you are comfortable with that :) Hey, I am a Marfan F18 and I just saw this post. I would be interested :) Hi! How are you? Super glad you answered this post!", "New to this - help me understand the process for getting dx and treatment Hi, I am new to this and do not gave Marfans, but my husband might and also my son.\n\nBackground: years ago Marfans came to my attention because my daughter did a bio project on it. My husband was joking that he had all the symptoms and I looked it up and realized he did have a lot. Caved in chest, tall thin build, very flexible joints, history of tendon injuries. My son, now 14, has the same build &amp; chest. Their dimensions are not exaggerated enough to quite pass the Marfan \"tests\" they show online, but only just short of it. We brought it up with their doctors and were brushed off.\n\nFast forward to this week. My husband (age 46) starts having chest pain. Saw the doc, slightly elevated BP (140/90 I think) and elevated troponin sends him by ambulance to the hospital. Cardiac catheterization finds several scad tears in his arteries (everything else is fine, no plaque or evidence of heart disease). Cardiologist says what he saw indicates a connective tissue disorder, that it looks like Marfans, but \"not the typical case\" (likely because his dimensions are not quite over that line). It is possible he has a different connective tissue disorder, but Marfans is the best fit to my untrained eye.\n\nI read the post about no one here being able to dx, I completely understand that. What I am wondering about is the process. We live in the Boston area and there is a Marfans clinic at the Brigham. We will seek a referral there. But I want to know how do they diagnose? What kinds of tests do they run? Do you see a cardiologist? Did you see a geneticist? Those who are Marfan dxed what kind of doctors do you see regularly for ongoing care? And how regularly?\n\nI am also wondering about what to do for my son. My husband already having a serious heart issue I know they will take it seriously now. But I want to figure out how to get my son diagnosed if he has it and how to handle getting my son the proper care he needs to prevent issues from developing later in life. Any guidance on how the process works for kids who might have inherited the disorder but are not having any issues yet would be greatly appreciated. The singular best way to know, is a genetic test: it is a mutation of the FBNI gene so any kind of malfunction there will be the key indicator. It would be smart too to take your son to a pediatrician at the earliest convenience you can as catching it as early as possible helps in the long haul Thanks! Do you have to see a geneticist to get the gene test or could a cardiologist order it? Would it be to be someone who specializes in Marfans? I was 6 months old when I was getting the battery of tests (both a severe case and a spontaneous mutation) so I cannot say for certain, but from what I understand from my stories that any geneticist should work (a Marfan understanding one would be preferable) but a cardiologist most likely could not figure that out for you, unless they called in a favor during your visit so if you can, find a geneticist In my experience it is all done through a geneticist.  My family went through a geneticist in our town in Spokane Washington.  We are also lucky enough to have a Marfans researcher at University of Washington that we saw but we did that through the genetics clinic as well. \nAt our visit they took a lot of measurements and asked a lot of questions.  They ordered echocardiograms for me and my children.  That was when we got introduced to our cardiologist that specializes in congenital heart issues. (eventually they recommended echos for my parents and brother). \nIt was a bit of a longer process for us to get genetically tested.  For us, the insurance company does not want to pay for it and the geneticists only push for it if it would effect their treatment plan.  The reason they gave us that they do not just jump in to genetic testing is because of expense and because it can have ramifications for your husband and son when it comes to things like life insurance.  My 2 sons that have it will probably never qualify for life insurance because if it.  \nAnyways.  It is a bit of a process.  Good luck with everything.  I will keep you all in my thoughts and prayers \u2665\ufe0f Thanks. I had not thought of the life insurance angle. I am not worried for my husband, we already have term life (which we can just continue without further health checks, plus he has already had cancer so getting a new policy now would suck anyway) and given our kids ages, etc will really not need him to be insured for much longer, but it could be an issue for my son as he gets older.\n\nMy concern with having my son diagnosed is around making sure any heart issues do not go unnoticed because he seems healthy otherwise. Thankfully he is not the athletic type, so he is not putting himself at risk running track or playing football. This is very helpful to know. My husband would almost certainly be a spontaneous case too (by which I assume you did not have any relatives with it), though mild, because there are no other cases or even suspects in his family tree. Okay... s I am new to reddit.  Why does it say intentionally bad at the top of this comment and my comment to you?  Did it get flagged for some reason? Ha! No, that is my username. Had to come up with something! Yes, neither my cardiac surgeon nor my cardiologist were able to assist with testing beyond putting in a referral.  I \\*likely\\* do not have marfans but I am going to see a geneticist later this year to hopefully confirm it is not marfans or another genetic connective tissue disorder.  I am going through the UW genetics department. Good luck, you hope you get some answers! That is hilarious.  I though for sure I messed something up \ud83d\ude02", "Feeling undesirable. Hello everyone. \n\nIt has been already 1 year since I am conscious about marfans in my life. I thought that the sudden news of never being able to change my very skinny physique would not bother me for too long, but it has already been 1 year and there is not one day that passes that I do not feel like I am very physically undesirable for women. I am 22 years old and I have been very sad about feeling like I am missing out on fun things like dating, going to clubs, meeting new people, partying etc. I know that I could physically do these things, but the experience is vastly different when one is so unnattractive. This has severly affected my self esteem and confidence. I do not know what to do. Any one else has a similar experience? \n\nNote: I know this could be considered as a minor/strictly superficial challenge compared to what marfan syndrome truly is, because of that I just wanted to recognize the real struggle: Any heart, spine, lung, eyes, joint etc issue. For anyone who is right now going through a surgery recovery or who has a surgery scheduled soon, all of my respect and best wishes. I have had the same experiences you are describing now, it still affects my life up to this age(32).  \nbut you will be fine, you want to do and experience the things your age enjoyed.  and believe me just do it.\nno one is going to drag you with such an and additute To quote a famous (in Canada) tv show, \"If women do not find you handsome, they should at least find you handy.\"\n\nOr witty, or charming,  or intelligent, or fun, or sweet,etc.  The point is that we have to make the best of what we have to work with. My success with women improved as I moved through my 20s, and it certainly was not because I was getting better looking. 100%. Women are not so shallow as to only want a guy for his looks, and if they are they are not worth your time. there are plenty of people who will find you attractive, trust me! You are not unattractive, you just have bad confidence. I was in your situation until i actually tried asking girls out. After that it wasnt so hard, went very well and got some experience. Being tall will get you far my friend, dress well and challange yourself. Just dont end up feeling sorry for yourself, nothing eill change unless you ask her out/hit on her I do not mean this in an offending way, so please do not take it as such, but I have to be honest with you, it does not sound like you think highly of yourself. So why should others? You need to learn how to love yourself. Build up confidence in yourself. Only then will others do the same. Many of us at one time or another have felt undesirable. Knowing that there is something \"wrong\" with us certainly does not help with that perception, but it is **wrong** to think that way. \n\nPersonally, I had a very hard time dating and meeting people when I was in my early 20's. By the latter half of that decade I had learned to be more confident and not self-deprecating. Confidence is key; no one wants to date someone who hates themself. You need to work on the things you can and learn to ignore or let go of the things you cannot. It sounds clich\u00e9 but it is true.", "Making Marfan Syndrome work for you: Hollywood Edition  This is a (very old) picture of my twin and I when we were in Pirates of the Caribbean 2 and 3 playing Two-Head - part of Davey Jones' fish pirate crew.

One of the few symptoms he is not had are Tarlov cysts, and it looks like our luck just ran out there - he had a CT done on Friday, and the radiology read just came back today that confirmed multiple large Tarlov cysts on his spine. The silver lining is that we live in St. Louis, MO, and he gets treatment @ the Marfan clinic here at Barnes Jewish, which is headed up by Alan Braverman. He is expecting a call from his spine specialist to discuss the next step, but I was wondering if anyone has any experience w/these cysts. All the info I can find seems to say that no one can agree on the most effective treatment, so we are kind of wondering what we are looking at here in terms of what they can do to help him. Thanks for any insight you can offer! I was diagnosed with tarlov cysts briefly last October, but they were rediagnosed as anterior sacral meningoceles (though from my understanding, the difference between these, tarlov cysts and dural ectasia are pretty narrow) and mine, unfortunately, are apparently inoperable. \n\nIt seems symptoms and treatments vary by patient. Mine are pretty painful and they were making me lose feeling in my legs because a lot of nerves are in them, but a lot of people never even know they have them. It seems like my husband is in the same boat as you - he has severe pain, shooting down both legs, and intermittent numbness. So far, no one has been able to give us an effective treatment option.\n Has he tried physical therapy yet? For me it did not do anything for the pain (unfortunately- nothing has yet) but it cut down the numbness almost entirely. And I had periods where my left leg (where the larger 7cm mass is) was completely losing feeling. It can work wonders with some effort, even if sometimes that twig still feels like a tree trunk because of the pain.  Every time he tries, it irritates something else. His hamstrings are too short/tight, which causes his posture to be weird, but when he tried to do PT to help that, his back got screwed up.", "Shoulder blade pain Hi, when Im laying down I always get pain on my right shoulder blade and I have had this for a long time now. Is this something I should ask a doctor about or is it just bad posture? \nI have read that this could be a sign of a aortic dissection but it disappears when I walk around. Ask your doctor. Do you have scoliosis? That can cause one shoulder blade to stick out more than the other. Probably from scoliosis or tight pectoral muscles. Try to sleep on your back if possible, and gentle doorway stretches are also good. Do not hold your breath and make sure hips are in alignment \ud83d\udc4d Does the pain go away when you move your shoulder to a certain position?  \n\nTypically aortic dissections cause left shoulder pain since your aorta I would on the left side of your body. Also the pain does not go away with positional changes.\n\nMost likely just musculoskeletal. Hi!! I am a 22f diagnosed at birth. Is it a deep aching pain? I have had this my whole life and doc has told me not to worry. If it starts to impact daily functioning, go to your doc but otherwise I think it is fairly common Thanks a lot! Yea feels like deep aching pain. Im not sure if I have Marfans but got all the signs of it. August 11th I will do a heart ultrasound to check my aorta.

Systemic score 6. No family history. Anxiety issues. I worked at a genetics testing startup so I was familiar with NGS tech and common disorders.\n\nResults: Echo was normal (Z=-0.3). Testing was negative for changes in FBN1, TGFB2/3, TGFBR1/2 and SMAD3 (not a comprehensive aortopathy panel, but these are all the genes conclusively linked to syndromic, Marfan-like TAAD).\n\nSo, what is the \u201cdiagnosis\u201d? None for now, but joint hypermobility syndrome, which does not have a clear genetic cause, is a possibility if I were hunting for one.\n\nWe are entering an interesting era of medicine with respect to heritable connective tissue disorders. 10 years ago, genetic testing was prohibitively expensive without insurance. Now, anyone with a positive thumb and wrist sign can self-pay to sequence a whole panel of Marfan genes. Pretty cool! &gt; in the absence of family history\n\n25% of people with Marfan have a spontaneous mutation: \n\n\n\nMy dad\u2019s Marfan was a spontaneous mutation. He had had no aortic issues until later in life. He ended up having surgery at age 50. I had it at 20. \n\nMy genetic mutation was only identified a few years ago.\n\nSo I guess if I were you I would regularly check on my aorta and get a dump of my DNA to recheck every few years. Occasional chest pains is a symptom? I agree, that is why I say probably. If the rate of Marfans is about 1 in 5,000 and 25% of cases are sporadic, then about 1 in 20,000 have sporadic Marfans, and even fewer would have \u201csporadic Marfan-like illness caused by an undiscovered genetic variant\u201d \u2014 the rate of skinny anxious people is much higher. But evidently it does happen so I will keep tabs on it as you suggest.\n\nEdit: according to  a genetic cause cannot be found in up to 10% of Marfan patients. So to put it in more concrete terms, the rate of \u201csporadic Marfan-like illness without an identifiable genetic cause\u201d is about 1 in 200,000. That is approaching the same risk as driving on the freeway, etc. Technical speaking, no. Even in a Marfans patient it is probably not cardiovascular in origin. But it could motivate the patient to seek a diagnosis and / or the doctor to run tests. What the rate of Marfan with a score of 6? I do not think that study exists. But even the distinctive signs are not unheard of in the general population \u2014 1% of people can do the thumb sign.\n\nEdit: would be cool to have more population level studies and phenotype-genotype correlations but it is just the beginning. Here is an example of the kind of research that NGS is facilitating: ", "May I ask why people feel insecure about being skinny? I do not have Marfan\u2019s, I joined this group because my bf does and I wanted to learn more.\n\nOne thing I keep seeing so much on this sub is people wondering how to cope with dating and body image. Not the health aspects of the condition, but the social aspects. There are lots of people on here who do not seem to like the outward appearance.\n\nEmpathy is not my best thing. I often have a hard time understanding others so that is why I ask. I also recovered from an eating disorder a few years ago so I still do not see how anyone could not appreciate being able to eat whatever they want and stay skeletally thin. I personally love the way slender bodies look. I think it is charming, elegant and sexy.\n\nI asked my bf why he does not like his body and he said he did not really know why, so I chalked it up to that \u201cnever good enough\u201d depression where the actual problem is not that he dislikes his body, but that he dislikes himself.\n\nI know women are more pressured into staying thin than men, and men are pressured to be skinny and/or muscular but I thought either would generally be equally appreciated.\n\nI know many people with Marfan\u2019s have depression, but do you also feel societal pressures to not be skinny? I have never heard of societal expectations to NOT be skinny. And do you think your appearance causes you trouble in dating? I always thought I had a harder time in the dating world as a short girl with Asperger\u2019s and food restrictions than my bf has had as a tall skinny guy. I have met people who will not date short people but never someone who would not date someone tall and skinny. I thought that was the ideal. What do you think?\n\nI hope I am not asking anything inappropriate. I know Marfan\u2019s comes with problems and I am not saying I wish I had it, I just wonder why the thing I would see as a silver lining is seen by so many as a negative thing. I am a male. I always said time and time again, there is nothing wrong with being skinny, just as long as you are at a healthy weight with BMI. Skinny people, specifically males, are sexy to me, but as long as they look healthy and are in fact healthy, furthermore, I never bought into the whole \"get muscles\" thing, I have, however, tried my best to gain more thickier but I could never get to that point, I am 100 pounds and I want to be 150. I do not have marfans, but I seem to have a medical mystery similar to it, a lot of people in my life pressured me to lift weights and whatnot, while, I always was more focused on gaining weight, I do not follow gender roles of this \"All men have to be tough\" stuff. I just want to be average weight. My weight causes me no trouble in dating, for guys at least, girls do not pay attention to me but that is fine because I am not into girls, so I am glad they do not want me, but guys do. They like me because I have a skinny feminine shaped body and voice and personality, so a lot of straight leaning bisexual men will gravitate to that. I try to eat 4 to 5 meals a day, over 2,000 calories to get fatter, but I never do. I am 5'7, so I am taller than my parents but not the tallest person out there. The only reasons why I feel bad for being skinny is being 100 pounds, that is too low, and also, even if I get to at least 130 or 140, if people still find me skinny, then whatever, because, when I get to at least 120 or 130 or 140, my weight will probably not bother me much, until haters say stuff, which will bother me, but I do not know. I just ignore the toxic forced masculinity males who tell me to get muscles when I do not want to, because again, I am more focused on gaining weight, not muscles. I feel insecure becuase I have always received comments about being too skinny, even during childhood.  I have been told many times that I look awful, and would look better if I filled out.  And it always gets me really down becuase I try so hard to put on weight but it does not happen. \nI am female, 180 cm, and 55kg, I do not need to be constantly reminded that I am underweight and look lanky and awkward. It comes down to social norms. In many places men are generally not skinny. Women might find hanging out with someone skinnier than themselves odd. People comment on your appearance, asking you if you do not eat enough. Others say things like \"you are so tall, if only you had a few extra pounds you would be handsome\". You might also have wierd skeletal features that anyone who sees you naked would comment on. All of this adds up to make you feel uncomfortable especially when you are young. It all comes down to judgmental jacks. I am sick of them. Lol. They never seem to leave me alone. They just dislike my stuff, say stupid stuff in real life, and do not care, but life is short, so basically, I say, I am healthy, so forget them. I do not need to waste my time on some hecklers. I got my lovers who love my body, and that is what makes me metaphorical money at the end of the day. Do not listen to judgmental jacks, as long as you are healthy, and eating fine, then you are good. Some people cannot put on weight, so what? Just keep eating. Forget the haters. Yeah that is definitely a good attitude, but it might take time to get there. If you eat enough throughout the day but cannot gain weight, you are healthy, maybe not visually, but internally, you are, so forget SOCIETY. Society I hate to break it to you, in case you do not know, is a lie. A lot of people in society are nothing but jacks who want to judge you, control you, I do not fall for this anymore. I do not know what you have learned in your life but if anything I learned is a lot of people in society are nothing but snakes in the grass ready to bite you and poison you, so just forget what the stupid media tells you on what is beautiful. Just make sure you eat meat, or at least fatty foods, I would say, for me, I eat 5 times a day, I should probably eat more though, but I eat LARGE meals, so, just, society, it is a mind game. I often suspect that a lot of the people who feel the need to make these comments are upset with their own weight. \n\nPeople are weird, and can often be jerks. I am fat I never think of being lanky as being awkward. It looks so elegant and perfect.\n\nI am 5\u20191\u201d (155 cm) and about 105 lb (48 kg) and I always worry I am too fat. My bf is 6\u20191\u201d (185 cm) and not quite 120 lb (54 kg) and he is just the image of perfection to me. Like a model, tall and thin and unbelievably perfect.\n\nLuckily for me, he likes short \u201cthick\u201d (what he calls fat, although he insists it is somehow different from being fat) girls so it works. But I always feel he deserves someone taller and slimmer, I guess there are differences in what society expects of us and what we want in others when we cannot have it ourselves.\n\nI feel so bad for the people who get made fun of for being perfect because other people are jealous. I am sorry you had to go through that. \u201cChange yourself or embrace yourself\u201d\n\nThat is so inspiring A lot of people give up their interests, sexuality, and beliefs, because of other people, and I am sick of it. You should only get rid of an aspect of yourself if it bothers you from the beginning. Too many times have I seen other people change for others and it makes me sick, it is mind control if you think about it. It is emasculating for a man to be called skinny. It implies that we are incapable of protecting ourselves or our mates. At 18years old I was 6\u20194\u201d and 160lbs. I am 200 lbs now and in great shape and I still get called skinny even by people who weigh less than me. It is because my limbs are so long and it still bothers me but not near as much as it did. For me, a lot of it has to do with not having control over the way my body looks and having my features be determined by and be characteristic of a disorder Female here. \nI have been harrassed, bullied and faced so much unwanted attention due to underweight. \nI have had strangers asking me if had anorexia. And endless comments, like 'eat some cake, you look like you are dying'. And that is some of the lighter comments.\n Thin may be ideal, but being underweight is generally frowned upon. People straight away assume some sort of eating disorder(I am not trying to talk shit about eating disorders). \nNo matter what, I do not think people will ever stop saying dumb sh*t. I have been underweight, normalweight and overweight. People have to say some shit, no matter how I look. The difference is just how much I cared.\n\nYou just got to pay attention to the love around you(not that easy, but you get the point). And really notice the compliments. They really matter. I am a woman. When I was younger, my teachers would sometimes talk to me in private and ask me if I was not eating properly at home, if I was abused. Some of them would call my grandparents over (I was raised by them) and call them out but at that time, we had no idea what Marfan was, since I was diagnosed when I was 18. My grandparents would just say that I ate just as much as any other kid but could never put on weight for some reason. Teachers would make sure that I ate my lunch every day. Looking back, I cannot really blame them, but it was never a fun time, I would always feel like I was being observed.\n\nWhen I was a teenager, some of my girl friends would tell me that they wished they would look as skinny as me. Like, no, I swear that you absolutely do not wish that. I have always hated my body and knowing that there are young girls who want to look so scrawny makes me really sad. Being underweight is just as unhealthy as being overweight. I was also hospitalized many times and had so many hypercaloric diets through my childhood and teenage years, and of course nothing worked - I am currently 4'10\" (because of kyphoscoliosis) and barely 75 lbs.\n\nI have met my first and only boyfriend (now fianc\u00e9) at 24, my attempts at relationship prior that have been pretty unsuccesful.\n\nStrangers look at me weird. Random people I do not even know still come to me and tell me that I look awful, sick, and tell me that I should eat. The worst instance was in a hospital, a random woman I was taking the elevator with looked at me and said \"How come you are so skinny? Do you want to die!?\". I was hospitalized for depression at that time. So, yeah.\n\nSorry it is ended up being a bit of a rant there. I would just say I think there is a huge difference between being skinny and healthy, and being skinny with Marfans. It is just a different experience entirely. There is a difference between being healthy skinny and spooky scary skeletons skinny.\n\nWhen you get called a holocaust victim because you cannot eat because your jaw is dislocated and your CSF flow will not stop closing off, making you throw up, you would feel a lot different than just \"being skinny.\" It sounds like you have unhealthy ideals. You are not an alt for that creepy marf fetish chick are you? This is my only reddit.\n\nAnd I do not think I have unhealthy ideals, I just like lots of different body types and hate how under appreciated some are. I wish I could help people see how perfect they are.\n\nIve never posted anything about a marf fetish, I did not know that was a thing. I follow some ssbhm subs but that is kind of the opposite.\n\nThere is a fine line between appreciating people\u2019s bodies and objectifying them. As an aspie I have to be extra careful with that so let me know if I am making anyone uncomfortable or saying anything offensive. Except seeing yourself as too fat when you are not while idealizing people who are unhealthily thin as perfect (and we *are* unhealthy when we are underweight, just as anyone else is) shows that you have a dangerous and unhealthy mindset both about yourself and others. I am 5'11 105 lbs. Everyone tells me to eat more. It is kind of like telling an overweight person to eat less. In my eyes I look like a prisoner from a ww2 camp That is 1 day away from starvation. this is late but i am 16 and i hate seeing myself in the mirror as i am mostly bone and it is uncomfortable, it is uncomfortable knowing i cannot gain weight having to go to school with people that say i look like a African child because i \"do not\" eat, i do not like that i cannot have big muscles like dywane johnson or not having to cover my arms and legs so people will not stare at me It is a massive complication. At least 4 of my surgeries come from having my rod pierce through my flesh and pop out. I am certain 2 other infections that resulted in surgery was caused by my health being shit. I was once 35kg (at 5'9) so I was lying in bed 24/7 for months on end as being active was exhausting. \n\nI, fortunately, gained weight later on, BMI's 16. I am insecure and wish I was not flat and lanky\nbut it is not big of an insecurity thing as much as a health concern. I have had both admiration and condescension; \na woman said she wanted to be my weight (the grass is always greener I guess), while my dad called me a beanpole, some people tell me to eat more and some say that a wind would blow me away. I am insecure because clothes do not look good on me. I cannot wear jeans because they make my legs look like sticks, I cannot go out with a t-shirt or shorts on because they are baggy and it exposes my long anorexic looking limbs and even hoodies, jackets and tracksuits are huge on me. Nothing is comfortable or attractive. I dread the summers because I cannot go out comfortably without people staring at or commenting on how skinny I am.\n\nI can deal with being regular thin like most guys but I look malnourished and extremely boney and gaunt.

We are both in our early twenties and I have been with my boyfriend for around 2 years now and I love him so, so much but I am also very scared.\n\nThis time last year, he underwent aortic dissection surgery and mechanical valve replacement surgery.

During this summer, he has been diagnosed with pneumonia twice and he is currently in the hospital as he has bacteria in his blood which may have infected his valve (which is obviously really, really bad). \n\nEver since his surgery he has had to give up his passion of playing sports and I can tell this has taken a toll on his mental health.

I do not want to overwhelm him by endorsing physical activity but how do I help him eat better &amp; have more fresh air when he is by himself? \n\nSorry for the long post i am just real anxious right now lol I have been lucky in the heart department (aortic dilation, but it has not grown for years now), but I know after major surgeries I have had I got severely depressed. Apparently this is common and thought to be a side effect of anesthesia. While it is nearly impossible to get someone to seek help if they do not want to, doing some research on this front and presenting it to him may help, especially considering that he has many aggravating factors (like giving up his hobbies and chronic pain). Even if he just starts getting meds from his doctor it might improve things for him. \n\nI do have to wonder, though, because my brother had no history of migraine before his valve replacement and now he gets them, too. The same kind I get (severe ocular, where we go partially blind for a time). Does anyone know if this is a known side effect of heart issues? Our neurologists cannot seem to figure these things out. After my aortic root replacement I developed major depressive disorder. I wish I had gotten help sooner. I hope you can talk him into therapy. I am sorry things are not going so well for you all, I do hope he gets better. wow i would feel so lucky to have you as a partner. just reading this it is clear you truly care about him and love him and i know that has to come off in so many ways through your actions and words already to him. but it is lovely you want to find more ways to support him. \n\ni just recently got my diagnosis of marfan. but i was already sick and disabled by other illnesses. i go to so many appointments and have so many tests that my partner knows since we have known each other 4 years and lived together. one thing he does that helps me is comes to my appointments. i do not let him always go back though. his support in the waiting room means so much to me and i always let him know. i am not sure if you already do this or not. if you do not, you could try telling him you would like to be there for him in those times to support him and show you care and love him and just see what he says. he may appreciate the offer but still want to keep that private, or he may love to know you are interested in being there for him in that way. \n\nyou could try to help your partner meal prep some easy meals so he can cook them or make them easier for himself. there is a lot of good meal prep subs. if he has a yard or something you can just try to hang or with him outside a bit more if he can and he may choose to even when youre not around from good memories. just try to ask him how you can help him continue to enjoy things he loves too. if he loved his sport, see if you all can watch games or even go to one if possible. same with anything else he may he into. it is really hard to give up your dreams Wife with marfan in advance state of decline. Love him. Help him navigate the INSANE and often impossible medical landscape of appointments in front of him. Be his partner. His other half. Remind him that he is not just a diagnosis \ud83d\udc96 you sound like my husband. Eager to help. You are awesome. I can talk about the loss of sports, considering I had to stop all physical sports... I had to mourn it, and rationalize it to myself that it is over and will not ever be the same again. That is an incredibly hard pill to swallow, knowing something you loved is gone forever.\n\nHe will have to come to terms with it, just as I somewhat did. I am still in my teens, so I still hold disdain and anger a bit, but overall I found other non-physical hobbies, like tinkering and researching of stuff. Maybe try to find him a new hobby, be it video games, planting, reading, movies, or anything else that he can do.", "Ring fit adventure Nintendo switch Is it safe to play this game like doing squats and stuff should you put it at a lower difficulty?

I have been doing research on it as I would rather be prepared IF something happens - we all know I would hate for something to happen. I was wondering if there was some kind of list that would help me better understand her symptoms as they occur, etc. or at least things to be aware of. Best. This disorder varies so wildly in how it affects people individually so really the only answer is for you to ask her this stuff. None of us can tell you.  It is great you have taken an interest in her condition but Marfans can vary widely and affect almost anything in the body. You should ask her what she struggles with the most and if there are any limitations she may have or if there is anything you can do to help her.\nI have Marfans and my boyfriend of almost four years took me to my physical therapy and doctor appointments when we first started dating, and I thought it was really sweet just FYI. But if she declines the offer for you to take her do not push it.", "Transgender and wanting to take testosterone with Marfans, I need your help. Hello, I need your help. I am a transgender male looking to start hormone replacement therapy, specifically testosterone, however I can find no data or information about taking testosterone with Marfans syndrome. I have mild mitral valve regurgitation, and aorta problems, however my heart has been totally stable since 2019, I am 17+4 months so it being stable to me seems like a good sign. I am aware being both transgender and having Marfans is a rare thing, however if anyone knows anything about this, if you are transgender and on testosterone, links to things would be particularly helpful, if you are a medical professional (specifically a cardiologist or endocrinologist) who knows anything about this please please tell me. I have another meeting with my gender specialist in June where we will be discussing this more and I need all the information I can get. I am terrified about getting denied testosterone, I do not know how I will live without it. Even if you cannot help please upvote this! This is something discuss with your cardiologist. They are heart experts and will be able to give you more guidance than we can. \n\nMy brother identified as trans and took oestrogen oestrogen for a couple of years before detransitioning and he suffered no ill effects\n\nOne of the things we learnt in this time is that there is next to no research on the effects of HRT on the aorta (or really much on the heart) there are no studies on HRT and marfans. \n\nThe main thing to remember is that half the people with marfans naturally produce testosterone. So it is less likely to be a major risk factor\n\nIn addition they usually do a lot of monitoring whilst on HRT especially on the first few months which should keep you safe.\n\nThe main consideration is that puberty is more of a risk time for aortic growth as you are growing so fast etc. My cardiologist had us come in for extras during puberty for this reason. You would be doing puberty again.   We are not doctors here, so we cannot offer any advice - this is something that you need to talk with your cardiologist and your gender specialist, you are not going to be the first person who has medical problems that could complicate things.\n\nHowever, from an AFAB enby, typically the thing that is most concerning is aimed more at transgender women and it is because of estrogen which causes increased chances of stroke and clotting (I had my bun-cooker removed and I inquired about if I would need HRT) when you talk to your gender specialist, give them a run down of what marfan's is (marfan.org has a good little handout you can print out and bring). I do not know if clotting + HRT (estrogen/progesterone, specifically) is as much of a risk if you do not have mechanical valves. I have had them since i was 4, so I do not know anything else.\n\nBest of luck! I wish there was more trans representation among us, i know there are several of us, but it seems like we are all pretty quiet... when the imposter is sus! Yeah I agree, I am also in the U.K. so it is harder to just see my cardiologist! I likely will write to him and ask I was just wondering if anyone had any resources or information to help for my next gender therapy session! Hopefully they will do a study at some point! It is nice to know that I am not the only one! Yeah I will definitely talk to my cardiologist, hopefully more studies about HRT and Marfan related things will be done soon so that there is more information! I am also UK\n\nAt the moment a.lot of hospitals are doing phone apts, not for the echos etc but just consultations\n\nIf you know your cardiologists name and what hospital you go to, on the hospital website you should be able to find the number for their secretary \n\nPhone them and say that you are being seen at XYZ clinic and you need to ask your cardiologist about how hormone therapy will affect your heart due to marfans. They may be able to get you a phone apt\n\nTo be honest though if the gender clinic are at all unsure they will write to your cardiologist, looping in your GP and delay treatment. I know that sucks. I really do but its just for your safety. I really really doubt that it will be a hard no, more of a \"we need to check with your cardiologist \" and they will check dosages etc Hey finally someone in the same situation as me! I am also trans with marfans in the UK and I am hopefully starting testosterone in September. I have a pretty mild case of marfans but my cardiologist said its OK for me to start t, I just have to keep an eye on my blood pressure and keep going for my regular checkups and echocardiograms. As others have said, definitely ask your own cardiologist about this though just to be safe. The realistic answer is that since marfans does not have 100% symptom parity or expression it is going to be based on your specific situation. Keep in mind not all people diagnosed with MS have aorta issues so knowing you are own situation in that area is key in your own expectations setting. Your age will also likely some role too as I would wager sub twenty five you are more likely to be considered low risk for complication. It is mid thirties when you start really hitting the moments where aortic stuff becomes serious usually. \n\nAs someone else noted estrogen is more likely to cause clotting issues that could cause complications with your blood pressure that could lead to dissection. So you do have that in your favor. I do not know the UK system but I think even if you are rejecting the first time persistence may pay off in the end. \n\nIt is worth noting that there are also ways you can more subtly manipulate your hormonal balance, notably exercise &amp; diet especially for transmen where working out a lot will give you a big boost in T. The benefits to being heart healthy &amp; fit as well will help you not only with your checkups but also likely your actually getting approved if there is any concern from your doctors. \n\nAlso I know it is an unpopular thing to remind people these days but I think it is also worth mentioning that you WILL live if you are denied hormones. You are valuable no matter what your body or hormone balance is like. Do not let the peer pressure of other people\u2019s transition make you fell lesser should you end up not getting approved. Good luck.", "Sexual drive Does Marfans affect your sexual drive somehow, or do you think it does? Is there any reason to think that Marfans affects sexual drive? Nope. Sex drive is normal, if not high. The only thing it affects is stamina and/or positioning (for me, I have less lung capacity than 'normal' so I am more easily winded). I do not have dislocation or hypermobility, but rather a lack thereof, and those with dislocation/hypermobility can, i would imagine find themselves having trouble keeping themselves from dislocating hips and the like. But I have not heard of it happening amongst the people I talk with that have Marfan's. The idea that Marfans itself effects sex drive does not seem to be evidence based, but the idea that someone who does not get access to physical/psychological resources/education they need to manage their disorder and/or developing the view that having Marfans (or anything) has adverse consequences on life absolutely does. I would caution you to interpret anecdotal answers with care, there are so many reasons that large amounts of the population, Marfans or not, have a change in sex drive.\n\nIf you want another positive anecdotal answer though, I am 33F and if anything, my sex drive is high, but I have worked hard to find access to good doctors, therapy, resources and support. When I was not taking care of these things, I had almost no sex drive for years. Everyone take care of yourselves! I think all of the heart medications that I am taking is causing issues downstairs for me, or it could be post op stress and or depression. I was fine before I started taking my heart meds.  All this to say, if you are taking a lot of medication, check their side effects. I have the same experience. Not hyper mobile either but also issues with the lungs etc. I would assume though that my beta blockers can effect drive and function however. That is annoying but not a problem with Marfans directly, but from the drugs helping treat Marfans. I have not found that Marfans affects my sex drive in any way.  In fact, I would say mine has always been higher than normal.  Still have a pretty high sex drive at 36.  As mentioned below it does affect stamina, which is to be expected. Blood flow to the brain, and other obvious parts can be an issue. Exercise helps this tremendously. A bit of mild to moderate cardio at some point in the day can help tremendously if you plan to have sex later on. Cardio is a huge game changer in my life I have discovered. Also, my beta blockers were hindering me a bit as well.  Talked to my doctor and we switched things up with some alternative heart meds.  Seemed to help my sex as well as overall level of energy. In my experience there should not be a problem, but I have had times in my life when I had to slightly adjust my medication to make sure my blood was pumping the right way when needed What all are you taking? I am on heart meds but I have never experienced any trouble down there but hey maybe it is cuz I am young try smoking weed or eating edibles maybe that will fix it idk though for sure I am not a doctor", "Do you have Pectus excavatum? (Sunken chest) \n\n(", " Blood pressure-independent inhibition of Marfan aortic root widening by the angiotensin II receptor blocker valsartan  Abstract, note the mention of losartan and its limitations:\n\n&gt; Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a genetic disorder that results in accelerated aortic root widening and aneurysm. However, management of MFS patients with blood pressure (BP)-lowering medications, such as angiotensin II (AngII) receptor blocker (ARB) losartan, continues to pose challenges due to their questionable efficacy at attenuating the rate of aortic root widening in patients. Herein we investigate the anti-aortic root widening effects of a sub-BP-lowering dose valsartan, an ARB previously linked to non-BP lowering anti-remodeling effects. Despite absence of BP-lowering effects, valsartan attenuated MFS aortic root widening by 75.9%, which was similar to a hypotensive dose of losartan (79.4%) when assessed by ultrasound echocardiography. Medial thickening, elastic fiber fragmentation, and phospho-ERK signaling were also inhibited to a similar degree with both treatments. Valsartan and losartan decreased vascular contractility ex vivo between 60% and 80%, in a nitric oxide (NO)-sensitive fashion. Valsartan increased acetylcholine (Ach)-induced vessel relaxation and phospho-eNOS levels in the aortic vessel supporting BP-independent activation of protective endothelial function, which is critical to ARB-mediated aortic root stability. This study supports the concept of achieving aortic root stability with valsartan in absence of BP-lowering effects, which may help address efficacy and compliance issues with losartan-based MFS patient management.\n\nIf you have a provider who is open-minded and interested in more experimental approaches, it may be worth mentioning this. The problem with the mouse thing is that when -Sartans were first discovered to basically 100% stop the rate of aortic dilatation in Marfan mice -  it did not prove to be true for humans and it was disappointing.\n\nToday -sartan medication (Losartan, Irbesartan and valsartan) are commonly prescribed in Marfan patients.\n\nWhen I asked my Cardiologist about the difference between the 3 he said:\n\n\"There is more clinical experience with Losartan. I tend to prescribe losartan and have not had any issues with that, and in my discussions with Prof Dietz, over the years, he did not indicate any efficacy difference between them. The goal that I aim for is to get on the highest tolerated dose and this titration is done slowly\"\n\nBeta-Blockers (such as atenolol) are also prescribed either instead of -sartan medication or at a low dose along with -sartan medication.\n\nEdit: I do hope that it turns out that Valsartan is more effective in humans than Losartan but I do not think there is any data for that\n\nEdit Edit: It should be easy enough to switch between the two though for a Doctor:\n\n(\n\nEdit Edit Edit:\n\nTrans-Resveratrol Mice study source: (\n\nNormally I would not link mice studies but since Trans-Resveratrol is known to have benefits in humans, it is probably worth considering with your doctor (as a supplement). Make sure it is Trans-Resveratrol though and that you take it with a source of fat (like olive oil or yogurt) Yes the cardiologist I spoke to said it is only shown to work in mice--not humans. This is very interesting, thanks. I am coming at the topic from the hEDS side of things with some aortic root dilation, so still learning. Based on the studies I have seen, I am a bit surprised by this.\n\nOn effectiveness of sartans/combination with beta-blockers, I did see this study: (\n\n&gt; This randomized, open-label, active controlled trial mostly based on a pediatric population demonstrated for the first time that losartan add-on BB therapy is safe and provides more effective protection to slow the progression of aortic root dilation than does BB treatment alone in patients with MFS.\n\nSo it would seem losartan does something at least, though perhaps only in combination?\n\nA meta analysis of ARBs (sartans) combined with BBs (lols)( finds something similar:\n\n&gt; Our analysis demonstrated a significantly smaller change in aortic root and ascending aorta dilation in the ARBs treated group when compared with placebo (mean difference 0.68; 95% confidence interval  -1.31 to -0.04; p = 0.04, I2 = 94%, and mean difference -0.13, 95% CI -0.17 to -0.09; p &lt; 0.00001, I2 = 0%, respectively). ARBs as an add-on therapy to beta-blockers resulted in a significantly smaller change in aortic root dilation when compared with the arm without ARBs (mean difference -2.06, 95% CI -2.54 to -1.58; p &lt; 0.00001, I2 = 91%)\n\nBut then, there is also \n\n&gt; In a small cohort study, the use of ARB therapy  in patients with Marfan's syndrome significantly slowed the rate of progressive aortic-root dilation. These findings require confirmation in a randomized trial.\n\nOf note, the confidence interval here with the SD range goes into the negative territory for the aortic root diameter with the intervention, suggesting not just slowing, but possible contraction of the root diameter:\n\n&gt; The mean (+/-SD) rate of change in aortic-root diameter decreased significantly from 3.54+/-2.87 mm per year during previous medical therapy to 0.46+/-0.62 mm per year during ARB therapy (P&lt;0.001).\n\nThen there is a child/young-adult study (ages 6 months to 25 years) that finds losartan/atenolol to lower the aortic root diameter by about the same, with a larger fall in the z scores among younger patients (so I suppose the earlier you can get started working on your dilation, the better your improvements):\n\n&gt; The baseline-adjusted rate of change in the mean (\u00b1SE) aortic-root z score did not differ significantly between the atenolol group and the losartan group (-0.139\u00b10.013 and -0.107\u00b10.013 standard-deviation units per year, respectively; P=0.08). Both slopes were significantly less than zero, indicating a decrease in the aortic-root diameter relative to body-surface area with either treatment.\n\nThen you have all these promising resveratrol studies in mice too (( ( and a pending (\n\nMore broadly, I was looking at this nice ( on Marfan aortic strategies, which includes this seemingly-spot-on bit:\n\n&gt; No doubt the genetic heterogeneity of samples and the short monitoring periods used in studies have not allowed differences to emerge regarding the comparative efficacy of the drugs tested. It is likely that the effect of the drugs depends on genetic and/or molecular factors that have yet to be established. Identifying such factors in the future should open the door to treatment that is tailored to each patient. Meanwhile, medical treatment of MFS should be based on the characteristics of each patient, including treatment tolerance, age, aorta size, family history of aortic dissection, genetic mutation, pregnancy, and other risk factors. All MFS patients exhibiting enlargement of the aortic root should receive treatment with suitable doses of BB or ARB II.\n\nThe patient heterogeneity would indeed offer some explanation for the variation in the results of these trials! So, I wonder if a sensible strategy is to combine BBs, ARBs, ACE inhibitors to the extent they are tolerable, and with interactions managed? One definitely has to be careful about interactions, especially with things like resveratrol, but still?

Human MFS studies on aortic dilatation rate have demonstrated conflicting results \\, however, losartan may have a beneficial effect in patients with an HI mutation.' Fascinating, thank you, bookmarked! If you could find those references, I will bookmark them as well. Got To assemble all the evidence and take it to my cardio, to see what could hypothetically work for a non-specific hEDS aortic dilation.\n\nCurious, which of the two categories do you fall into, have you tried either ARBs or BBs, and does your regular imaging show any regression in dilation from ARBs/BBs/resveratrol (or is it too early to tell)? I guess if the growth continues, it is hard er to tell if the meds are making any difference. Thanks, I edited it.  \n\n\nWell I found my mutation online recently actually and it seems like my Marfan mutation is the type that produces a mutated (but normal amount) of fibrillin-1 protein.  \n\n\nso - I am trying to either get switched to Beta-Blockers or have Beta-Blockers added on currently. (But Losartan cannot hurt but it might technically not really help in my case)", "Heartbeat in abdomen Has anyone here felt it?\nI took something i should not for 2 days, only to discover that is not advised to Marfan people. \nSince then, i have felt this... Cannot help if you do not tell us what you took. If you have been feeling unwell for 2 days go to the doctor.  Took cipro for Urinary Infection Yes, can feel heartbeat in my abdomen, sort of comes along with being thin. I can feel it in my fingertips too.\n\n~~I am definitely not a doctor/pharmacist but to my knowledge you can take most antibiotics including cipro, you typically need to worry about it affection your INR if you have got mechanical valves, but that is it, I think.~~ I am 98% sure I have been on Cipro before because of resistance to antibiotics with uti's. And if not for that, it would have been for whatever respiratory infection I would end up with.\n\nJust saw all the articles. Call and talk with a pharmacist or if you are able, the doctor who prescribed the meds. Or if in the US the rn hotline through the marfan foundation. Thanks for all the help! Will do! Just afraid of a Aortic Aneurysm You should talk to a doctor. They will help you figure out whether it is a rupture or hypochondria. Best thing to do is have a doctor have a listen. I always had this, a doctor heard a strange sound that made her suspect aneurysm but it ended up just being that my aorta is placed very shallowly in my abdomen. Cipro is not recommended for us. Give your doctor hell: (\n\nAt the same time, I have used it before without any negative affects. I also talked to the folks in person who did the study on the impacts of Cipro on the retina and it is not a huge chance there. are there any other drugs like this?", "swimming vs jogging? What do you think about jogging? I know people say swimming is a good choice. Seems like they both stress the heart the same? Just swimming is easier on your leg joints? \n\nBut if you are someone who is only trying to protect their heart and not worried about joints..is jogging just as safe as swimming? The advice I was given was to exercise to a level that it is difficult but not impossible for you to speak \n\nTherefore jogging should be safe so long as you slowly work on your fitness and do not push too hard. As your fitness increases you will be able to push harder and longer.\n\nInterval jogging (couch to 5k with jogging instead of running) should be safe Jogging is fine so long as you can hold a conversation while doing so, if not, you should back off and gather your breath.\n\nThe equally important thing is to make sure that you are protecting your joints. Invest in running shoes that provide adequate support, make sure to appropriately stretch to warm up and cool down. The reason swimming is oft suggested is because it takes the pressure off of our joints :) I have heard from doctor friends that running is bad for your body. The toll it takes on your joints should be something everybody watches out for, not just people with marfans. I used to run 3mi a day as a great stress reliever after work. I decided to stop after at doctor checkup I realized I was 10lbs lighter than I thought. Being a tall skinny marf, I did not have 10 lbs to lose. It scared me and I transitioned to a less cardio heavy method of exersizing. Now I do yoga, and some stair work, but def not 3mi a day. Swimming is much easier on your joints, with all the cardio benefits. Do you avoid anything during yoga? Like planks, downward dog, headstands? No, but honestly I am out of shape right now so sometimes my arms are just too tired to finish a downdog. I find yoga is very low pressure, no \"fit into this pose, or else!\"  It is a different shape and different experience for everybody. There is no real way to \"do yoga correctly,\" it is more about the feelings in the moment. I like that. Especially as someone who may have limitations- I am not put down for them, I am celebrated for being in tune with my body. Yeah I used to do yoga daily a few years ago. I did not know I had anything going on with my heart then. (Also lifted heavy weights for many years). Now I will not even do push ups so downward dog and planks seems dangerous to me i have been told to swim from a very early age and did it for around 13 years three times a week, it is an low impact exercise that can tone (slightly) most of your body and will keep in line back and problems to do with bone structure (like pectus carinatum/excavatum) which usually affect us. I have always been told to avoid running because it can be pretty hard on our knees, especially because of our hyperjoint mobility and to me especially because it would also affect my aorta negatively look, you have not died in the years you did picked up and put down heavy objects, that will not change. do what feels good to you and makes you feel good. I snowboard, mountainbike and Sail semi-competitive in Lasers these are all sports that \"we\" should avoid but they make me feel good so i practice them and stay within my range.   \n\n\nMy doctors (in the Netherlands) always warned me for the dangers but also encouraged me to live my life, you need to find some balance if you know what i mean?   \n\n\nIf you used to bench around 50kg, scale it down and do more reps so it strains your heart less..   \n\n\nPersonally my life is to be lived to the max not to get as old as i can but everyone is different, if you would like to chat just DM me. Why would jogging affect the aorta but not swimming unless competing people do not usually force themselves to swim as fast and take breaks more often (at least from my experience) so there is nothing about jogging that is harder on your aorta than swimming? just do not force yourself to exhaustion in either one  yeah basically", "I have some questions. Hi everybody.\nSorry for my English if there is an error, English is not my native language.\n\nAs I said in another post I suspect that I have marfan syndrome, in the systematic score I have at least 6 or 7 points, however I have some questions\n1) If I perform an examination of my aorta and my eyes and I do not present problems (apart from my myopia) I would not have marfan since I have no family history?\n2) does it mean that if I do not have marfan now i can have it later in life?\n3) would i be diagnosed as \"unknown connective tissue disorder\"? what would that mean? Can it be possible that i only have a marfanoid habitus without health problem? how can i confirm that?4) If i am not officially diagnosed as marfan and dont have a family history neither problems in the aorta (in this moment) should I stop exercising and not be able to do any weightlifting even if I perform tests of my aorta every year?\n\nMy family history is very healthy. In this moment my uncles are in their 50s and 60s and have no serious health problems, my cousins \u200b\u200bare also healthy, my maternal grandfather died when he was 83 years old and my paternal grandfather when he was 79 years old. Both of my grand mothers are still alive and they are 85 years old, my maternal grandmother had a heart attack and other health problems but she is ok .My great-grandfathers died in their 70s and 80s.

My brother is 21 yeards old he is healthy and have no manifestations of marfan syndrome.\n  There is no family history of aortic problems or anyone with marfanoid characteristics, probably my father is the most \"marfanoid\" but he is simply tall and thin without being underweight.\nso with all this said I can conclude that i would be an spontaneous case.\n\nMy main concern at the moment is if I should stop doing sports and end my plans to enter the gym (which would be very sad) despite having a healthy aorta and only have a high score in the systemic score and my other concern is if i will develope aortic problems in the future, i am feeling really sad and anxious about these two things. \nI must remind you that I am 17 years old.\n\nThank you very much for your time. The answer to pretty much all of your questions is to ask your doctor.  Everyones case is different, and you should not rely on internet advice for something that could potentially impact your health in a seriouse way.  \n\nThe only %100 way to know for sure if you have marfans is genetic testing.  This is because there are a lot of different connective tissue disorders that have similar symptoms, but the reality of all of them is regular check ups are important.  \n\nThis is because a lot of the risks associated with any connective tissue disorder  are in how your body is changing.  If you have a slightly enlarged aorta there may not be a concern.  If it is the same size year after year theres probably not a major concern,  if it changes, and is increasing in size over time that is a major concern.  But you only have that information if you are getting regular checkups.  \n\nPlease talk to your docter about all of your concerns.  Thanks, I will ask my doctor those questions. The problem is that my doctor is not very convinced that i have marfan but i will tell him that orden an echo for see if my aorta is ok. Also I will wait until I get the result of the echo for enter to the gym.", "is my life expectancy lowered due to having marfans?  ", " I have a question with regard to thumb sign: Do I have to force to make the thumb exceed? Hello guys,\n\nI will have see the doctor in 2 weeks but I just want to have your opinion about the thumb sign. It is very odd because I am struggling to find a proper video explaining the test.\n\nWhen I just fold the thumb, the test comes negative:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\n\nBut when I force, it comes positive:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\n\nWhen I close my fist, it appears negative in the first one and positive in the second one.\n\nI guess, I should count it as positive since the thumb aims to test joint flexibility rather than lenght of fingers?\n\nAnyway, I will go to the doc no matter what since I have other symps.\n\nThank you for your answer. Joint flexibility looks like a positive to me.\n\nHowever I do not see arachnodactyly (spider fingers). You may just be double jointed.\n\nBut yeah, if you have other symptoms absolutely still check with your doc Yes, you are right, it seems to indicate joint flexibility rather than arachnodactyly. I will see what the doc tells me. Spider fingers are usually the sign of long hands/fingers if I am not mistaken. \n\nIn my case, I do have actually small hands despite my average height. Small hands alongside small wrists too...\n\nWhat concerns me the most so far is joint flexibility + stretch marks + keratoconus\n\nAnyway, thanks for your reply. Hey!! I have almost the same as you, but I went to the doctor and she gave me a negative though ( she does not even suspect Marfans event though I showcased her this, my stretch marks at my lower back and very very very slender body and tall stature. Although my wingspan is about 2-3cm shorter than my height. I am 185 cm with a wingspan of 181cm.) I have hypermobile fingers and toes though. \n\nHere my first \"forced\" into a positive sign by pushing my fingers away with my other hand. That is the first picture at the top. Then you have my whole hand and lastly my \"thumb sign\" without me pushing any fingers away. \n\n 185 cm is 72.83 inches By the way what other symptoms do you have? Thank you for your answer.\n\nBased on the picture you provided, I see we have the same thing basically. If I force using my other hand to push my finger away, I definitely get the same thing than yours.\n\nI am not very tall, my height is average, about 180cm and my wingspan is also shorter.\n\nOne thing is for sure though, I am definitely hypermobile as I pass nearly every test (6/9).\n\nMay I ask your age?\n\nI am 27 y.o, I am kind of worried that I may have Marfan and fucked my aorta by working out. Hello, \n\nI have:\n\n\\- Hypermobility\n\n\\- Unsual stretch marks\n\n\\- Keratoconus Haha I am 26! Nah I dont think we have Marfans tbh. About 15-20% of the population has hypermobility (General hypermobility is more common than hypermobility in the small joints, which I have). I dont have general hypermobility. My height comes from my grandpa but no one in the family has a record of Marfan or heart relates problems in general (Family history is KEY for suspecting Marfans. More so than a general suspicion arising from mere hypermobility). My heart, pun intended, wont rest until I have gotteb my echocardio which I will have soon. The decision was purely mine and I told the doc to give me one just because of my health anxiety. My family has a history of diabetes and hypothyroidism though. My slender build is probably because of undereating in comparison to my height whereas my hypermobile fingers come from my very short mom lol. So yeah. I will defo keep update on how my heart looks. If everything is normal, my marfan journey is put to rest and I will instead begin talking with a dietician and a psychologist probably for my srupid health anxiety hehe. Yes, I am pretty much in the same situation than yours. I am 27 y.o and I am very enclined to health anxiety.\n\nI do not have any familyhistory as far as I know though my dad died when I was young so I am not very aware of what his medical situation was.\n\nI am not specifically tall neither, I am 180cm which is definitely average in Europe for people of my age.\n\nLikewise, the echocardio seems to be only way to put my mind at ease and I will definitely push for it when I see the doc. Yeah exactly, and alot of symptoms/criteria that are fulfilled may actually stem from coincidental genetics (Tallness from dad, hypermobility from mom, stretch marks from someone in the family that had a fast growth spurt etc.) and thus remind/make you suspect a certain disease when it definitely is not. We have ro remember that Marfan/Connective tissue disorder in general are rare. Hence their category as \"rare\" diseases. Where are you from btw in Europe? Im original from the middle east but I was born and have all my life lived in Europe too haha :) I am from France and you?\n\nYes, there is plenty of reasons besides marfan that can explain the symptoms...I hope it will turn to be good news for both of us! Okay, cool, Sweden over here haha. Yes, indeed!", "Marfan test in France Does anyone have an idea how to go about getting a gene test? I have been diagnosed as kid based on stuff like long fingers, mitral valve, stretch marks... but I never got an actual genetic test and I do not have the typical super tall super skinny marfan looks. I need to be sure however as the condition impacts the treatment of many other diseases and I feel like GPs do not take me seriously. Salut,\n\nJe me permets de r\u00e9pondre en fran\u00e7ais parce que je suis exactement dans le m\u00eame cas.

It is so bad now that if my scoliosis wasnt also so bad, my sternum would likely pinch off my circulation against my spine. Seeing my cardiac surgeon along with a plastic surgeon simultaneously this month. Anything I should expect? Anything to ask the Drs about? Cheers. So, first of all, the surgery will make you feel much better.  It will not get rid of the scoliosis but you will find it more comfortable to carry your body.\n\nIf you are insurance affords you a choice in facility and it is not urgent: SHOP. AROUND.\n\nDuring the meeting:\n\nRecord the conversations, take notes and try and have another set of ears there.  Write down your wuretions ahead of time. Ask if they have done this kind of procedure and what their experience with mfns is.  Ask specifically if there is a special approach they are taking given you may need aortic/valve work later in life (and why/why not).  Some of these answers may get a bit technical, but that is why you record; you bring doctor 1s answers to doctor 2 and ask their opinion.  This is not rude, and doctors know how to respectfully (and more importantly constructively) provide input: they are BOTH interested in your best outcome.\n\nFinally: surgeons tend to be very charming, confident and gregarious people.  A big part of their job is to make you confident.  Sometimes this works so well it keeps you from asking questions you have.  Do not feel bad if in asking questions you feel rude, blunt, or have to less than gracefully bring the conversation back.  This is not cocktail hour, bedside manner is part of their job, not yours.  They are not a car salesmen trying to confuse you, it is just a side effect of the job: they are just trying to make you comfortable.  They are there for you and will not take it personally if you do not display the usual conversational tact you might otherwise.\n\n\nAfter/before the meeting:\n\nHospitals are required to keep track and make available re-admitance numbers for hospital acquired infections.  I specifically walked away from a facility because I did not like their numbers.\n\nGet a feel for more than the surgeon.  You will deal with the hospital far more than the surgeon and for far longer.  We are they responsive?  Patient with you when you called?  Was it easy to get an appointment?  And I do not really mean the date, I mean we are they proactive about getting your records from various places, did they help with your insurance, and did they do all this without you needing to micromanage?  These things should massively inform your \"buying descision\" because they will be a huge part of your pre and post planning.\n\n\nGetting the home ready:\n\nAt your age, recovery will happen quickly, but these things make the first few weeks easier: get a hospital bed or at least put yours on risers.  Far, far easier to get in/out when you are hips are about at your standing height.  Hang relevant shower items so if you drop them you do not need to bend over.\n\n\nLast, coming off the painkillers, coupled with post surgical depression, can be rough.  Do not freak out about it, but know that the blues are normal.  Talk to those in your circle especially if they are not the touchy feely kind.  Just let them know even after you are physically doing better, you might not be yourself for a while.  It is totally normal and does taper off, but was something no one warned me about that caught me off guard.\n\nGood luck.  This stuff sucks but it is a bit like getting a new body; you will feel better.  PM me with any questions!

I was bitten by a human the other day and my arm swelled up crazy fast, creating an immediate wound the size of a golf ball. The police at the scene said they would never seen a wound blow up quite like that. The weird thing was it did not really hurt. I went to the hospital and got a tetanus shot and antibiotics. Since then the swelling has gone way down to nearly nonexistent. \n\nI am just wondering if anyone else has had this physical reaction to a wound,  and if it was because of my connective tissue being messed up the way it is. I was diagnosed with Marfan Syndrome at 5 years old. It is probably the biter having really really bad germs lol. Said biter has bitten several people, none of whom swelled up as much, so I was curious. Human mouths are extraordinarily nasty, and anyone with a genetic issue tends to have a weaker immune system.  I know I do personally. That is a good point. Had not considered the immune system angle. Thank you! I fell on my bike a few days ago. I landed on some soft grass, but my left leg hit the pedal. It was not that bad, but the swelling looked exactly like a golfball. The swelling calmed down after a few hours. Crazy that you had the same experience. Thank you!

I know this is not what is typically posted here, but I thought maybe some of you would have ideas or personal experience with things that helped you through your own post-op time! The internet with a Reddit account on an tablet. One of the things I appreciated the most when I was in the hospital after my dissection were elastic waistband pajama pants. I know it is not entertaining, but being able to wear pants that were comfortable meant a lot to me. Being in nothing but a hospital gown can be humiliating. I would say a good book, iPad or Nintendo Switch, a few sweets (if hes into chocolate or any particular candies ---run it by his dr/nurse if he can have them but usually after surgery this weird craving can kick in). Also, if hes into shows (Netflix) u guys can watch a show together with that new feature on Netflix where you stream a \"party\" of 2 laptops running the same show. May be nice so he has company while recovering and can give u both somthing to talk abt :) hop this helps, and his surgery goes well! Thank you so much! That is perfect, I had not thought of that!

Going To cut to the chase I cannot do anything in life because of marfans. Last year I found out I had it and now learning what I have about my body I cannot do things I wanted to do. I want to get job or do something with my life other than sit at home but if I do I would lose my medical insurance. I can tell afford doing that. The only person in my family that understands the severity of the situation is my mom. Everyone else in my family ridicules me. It is gotten to the point when I am at get togethers my family hardly acknowledges me. My family is constantly telling me how others are more successful. Hell my dad just 5 minutes ago was telling me how my cousin \"actually does things\". It hurts so fucking much. Idk what to do. Hang in there. You are capable of more than you realize honestly. It is about playing to your strengths. I promise you are good at things, and you just need to find those talents and play into them. I was diagnosed at 7 and am about to be 26. I have felt how you feel most of my life. But the more I have accepted what I cannot do, I have realized there is a hell of a lot I can do. Stay strong. Thanks so much. I want to do a lot. I just do not know how to get any further. if I lose my medical insurance I cannot get the meds I need. But I want to actually prove everyone wrong. Just feels like everyone is against me. It is not like I do not want to do anything. I was going to start college but my laptop broke so I cannot now u till it is fixed. Wait, so do you have a job now or do you get medical benefits through a state program? What prevents you from working...? You can get good insurance through a job. I am just curious, honest. I am sorry to hear about your situation and how you are treated. Sounds like they are all just a bunch of assholes who do not know what empathy is. Best of luck to you, keep your head up. You will figure this out. I do not have a job, basically from what I know. Is if I get a job my family would \"make to much money\" And I would not be able to get my medical insurance. I am not sure about everything. i just know what I have been told. Theybreally are. Hurts cause a lot of these people you looked up to as role models. Yeah I totally understand that and I am so terribly sorry you are left feeling that way and feeling so alone in your fight. Do not give up, something is got to give. You will find your path. I know it sounds cliche but do not listen to the negatives. Took me a while to learn that but once I stopped taking what people said to heart, it was easier to move past the hurt their words caused. Blood does not mean family my friend. Yea you are right. I want to prove them all wrong. And ik I will some day but right now it is harder for me. Idek if half them even care. I try telling them and they say oh it is not serious and it is probably just a heart murmur. Like the doctors word do not mean anything. Sucks growing up loving these people just for them to push you down. I do not get what they get from hurting me, instead they should help me but they do not. Ah fuck man that is rough. I hope it gets better. Did they mention surgery for you at all? What led them to diagnose the Marfans? My heart was beating irregularly, then they took a glance at my body and said I had the aterottpical body type of someone with it. I had to do the thumb thing where you touch your wrist. I forget what else I did though. They mentioned that surgery could be a thing I would need but it is not something I have to worry about right now. I had a similar experience. I thought myself programming at home and have had a brilliant career in that field. \n\nTake control of your destiny! Figure out your health insurance situation with facts. Figure out a way to go to school. Be the person you want to be despite your hardships. That is exactly what I am going to do, it sucks causey original goal and profession I wanted to get in was not game design but  not entirely mad about it either. I just wish I could be more physical without the possibility of hurting myself elsewhere  What country are you in? USA I am 19 turning 20 next month, yea we are trying to find time to go to a genetics facility. The nearest I believe is Chicago and that is 2-3 hours away.

I went here to get help cause this is the only place ik who can relate with me. I feel a lot better now For sure! I have read some great posts in here. Not certain why you would lose your insurance.

It is all very confusing. I did not do a ton of research I just know I would lose it for some reason. Yea you are right thank you I appreciate it a lot Medicaid is probably what he has. Limit of a few hundred a month or you risk losing it. Currently teaching myself programming and it is really difficult, I think it is the perfect career for someone with Marfan's. What field did you end up in and how did you start? I am teaching myself python and django currently hoping to get into Web Dev and boy is it difficult but rewarding. I have been in dev almost my whole career. In senior management now and health concerns have finally put the brakes on things.

My grandfather had an aortic aneurysm while in his early 50's I believe. \n\nThe thing I hear most from doctors is \"You do not look like you have Marfan's\". Genetics are a strange thing lol. My mother and I both have the condition but it is manifested itself into very different way between the two of us. I am tall but at 5'8\" I am really just above average for a female and 'short' for someone with Marfan's while my mother is just shy of 6'. I have the long arms, legs and fingers however I have never been underweight or appeared bony; much the opposite I am overweight with a very curvy, short torso. My mother was incredibly thin up until her mid twenties when hypothyroidism set in. \nMy heart seems to be stronger than my mother's, however I have asthma and her lungs are fine. We both had the lenses removed from our eyes when we were 15. In my case one of them was partially detached (there is a story about that if anyone is interested). I have a high, narrow palate that required surgical expansion when I had braces and deal with TMJ issues. \n\nWhile I was not allowed to play contact sports my parents encouraged me to be active in cheerleading and dance. I suffered quite a few injuries thanks to those loosey-goose ligaments but I am a tough cookie. I am grateful that my parents taught me that while I have restrictions there are still things that I can do. \n\nI have no idea if there is a connection but I also have fibromyalgia. So on top of the ligament and tendon problems I also have the added bonus of nerve/random pain.  Any aortic dilation? If so, at what age did it start? It seems that most patients, beyond the skeletal features, have either eye problems or blood vessel problems. I am trying to figure out if it is possible to have the skeletal features, but none of the other issues, and not have Marfan's. I do have the very beginning of dilation. I do not know the specific measurement but it is well under the need to do anything other than monitor. My mother's is further along than mine but also still not something they are looking to replace any time soon. I do not know how old I was when it began, it is just kind of always been there. I did have an enlarged heart when I was very young but grew into it and it has not been an issue. \n\nThe way it was explained to me was that the connective tissues of the eye tend to break down faster. The heart being the largest muscle function in the body is also another reason it is such a large feature. But it honestly is so different from person to person. \n\nIn my family I do believe the trait is common. Many of my family members have been genetically tested and nobody has come up with Marfan's but suffer from similar physical skeletal issues. One of my cousins has jaw problems very much in line with my own. However it is difficult to say whether there is a link or not. Genetics are a strange strange beast.  I was diagnosed a few months ago and I do not really look the part either. I am only 5\u20192\u201d which is actually below average height but I have the arms and legs of someone 5\u20198\u201d. My torso is very short I suppose. My doctor was so shocked. Genetics are weird.  That IS surprising! I have always found it funny that I am 5'8\" and pretty much everyone acts as if I am the Jolly Green Giant but then I see a doctor and explain I have Marfan's, they are just like wow you do not have the height for that. \nI have a short torso as well. Not sure what my limbs equate to but I am basically arms, legs with hips and boobs. No waist lol I feel like an hourglass giraffe sometimes. My father with Loyes Dietz has a 4,8 cm dilatation (stable for the last 5 years) and just a 165cm high. Lived at 4000mts altitude without any problem with it or doing sports. \n\nYes genetics are strange.  My PCP still doubted the other doctor\u2019s diagnosis until I had an echo and told him more of my family history. \n\nI am all limbs too. Haha. I got in trouble in high school for my shorts not being \u201cfingertip length\u201d while other girls wearing the same type of shorts did not. It is hard when my fingers are not too far from my knees.  Oh yeah I have had some asshole doctors try to tell me that I do not have until they take a look at my echo. I also have mitral valve prolapse and a murmur going on so my echos in general are interesting lol they changed their tune REAL fast. \n\nOmg school uniforms were the worst. I used to get yelled at so much about my skirt length. Like, they were made with the length matching to the waist measurements so if you had a smaller waist you ended with a shorter skirt and being thinner back then everything would end up short. It was so frustrating.  Oh wow! That is crazy. I was a cheerleader as a teenager but aside from that I stuck with dance for activity. I wanted to run track but that got shot down and then my asthma developed so physically I cannot do much more than speed walk. I just do what I can though. Once I told him that my grandfather died from a dissection and all of my mother\u2019s siblings had valve or other heart health issues, he ordered an echo right away. I could actually hear my valve regurgitating during the echo. It was bizarre. I can hear it with my stethoscope too. \n\nUgh uniforms! I had to wear them in grade school and was always stuck wearing the boy\u2019s long length slacks because I hated the skirts. My socks were always showing and the sleeves were always too short. Lol.

Do not feel down, we understand how tough this is for u. My advice would be to eat really healthy as that may directly aid in recovery from fatigue, also do some light exercises if ur feeling up to it (you kno what ur body can handle). Stay hydrated and overall take care of urself:) \n\nAbove is not a be all end all solution at all, but may help in the meantime. Once dr's are back n running I am sure they will give you the perfect advice based on your symptoms ect. Overall I am sure u will be fine, hang in there champ! Xox thank you I really appreciate I am still young I am 16 but I am worried what will happen to me while i age and it is stressing me out to much things are just happening in my mind im the only one in my family who has it and I ask my self everyday why was I unlucky what have I done it makes me unhappy and sad every day I try to bring my head up and hope everyday is going to fine but I just cannot I try to put a smile but it disappears right away I just wish there was treatment and yes I also do those eat healthy and exercise right I just wished ik and did something early I am in a similar position, (21 y/o) also being the only person in my family with marfans. What I have learned over the years it to remain grateful, remember that things could always be worse and that altho we may not see it, marfans is a blessing compared to some syndromes, you are amazing, blessed with many resources and a vast support system. If you ever need to talk or simply vent feel free to pm me:) Your not in this alone, there is so much more to life than being marfan or marfanless. \n\n*this isint to say that marfans is not severe or taking a toll on all of our lives, what I reiterate is that we are all more than our ailments. Life has so many beautiful things to offer, we just need to look past wishing and wanting for somthing we have no control over to be different or \"normal\". Im in your position and Im waiting for a doctor to check my heart. Last time I did it was 6 years ago because one doctor at that time told me that I nay have Marfans but after the hearth check he just said my hearth looked normal and then I never heard from him. He was there for my scolios. 1 month later I met a another doctor for my scolios and he said that my first doctor was stupid for thinking that I may have Marfans. I dont know who to trust so now 6 years later I have started to worry just like you and I have been putting on a lot of weight since due to gym. Im still going to the gym but Im worried that it may result in surgery later on in my life.\n\nRemember to be happy that everything could been worse! Im trying to but recently I got tested for Usher Syndrome and it was positive. So I am going blind but Im happy with the vision I have left. your a great person/human being I hope you know that we need more people like you thank you for telling me this I needed this are you serious about going blind lately my eye sight has been weary somewhat like that feeling when you wake up and your eyes just feel weird just like that and it is making me worried I am so sorry about what your dealing with but I am glad you are happy in your state right as for me I am glad with what I have but somewhat not looking forward to the next few years for my health and body Yes Im serious about going blind but Im so happy with the vision that I have left. Hopefully it is a slow process till I get fully blind. \n\nI really hope you will get to see a doctor soon! Right now Im just worrying about my heart and Im scared everytime I feel a slight pain somewhere near that area xD. In my opinion it will be a real relief when I finally get to see a doctor and just talk about this and hearing the doctors opinion and I think you feel the same. \n\nCould you describe the feeling you get in your eyes when waking up? About 6-7 years ago I had a Retinal detachment and no one knew why. Now 6 years later when I got diagnosed with Usher syndrome they said that the retinal detachment could be from it but then I googled about Marfan symptoms and it says retinal detachment and that is just another thing that adds to my Marfan list xD. I am really sorry to hear that here I thought I had the worst coming I should be happy what I have left and stop worrying like you are you are inspire me right now to do better when I wake up now these past 3 days my eyes have like been weary some what like they feel hot or a little dizzy I cannot describe it and I am scared just to hear what the doctors have to say cause I am 16 im convinced I had Marfan in a early age and I should have done more I am worried that doctors might say you have that or I have to do surgery or things like that I try to tell my family or my parents but they do not understand like I do I try to tell them but they say I am illuminating like I am their own son ik my body my body feels good for now but I am worried it might worsen you feel me Im sure everything will be just fine! If you are 100% sure you have Marfans then we can hope that you just have bad genes which I hope I do have. I have read that some people have been worried about having Marfans and have visual symptoms but when they did a genetic test it showed that they didnt have Marfans. Theres Marfanoid habitus and that is when you have all the signs of Marfans but you dont get heart issues etc. I downloaded reddit yesterday to have this helpful type conversation I did not know there were people like you who were so heart warming and nice out there and had a syndrome like me thanks I will follow your advice I hope you are in great shape and have a great life though out your years thank you very much I do not know how to thank you for wasting your time talking to me but I really appreciate it and one more thing do you think running or doing any sports will cause harm to my body No problem! This is what reddit is for in my opinion, Im.not an expert on sports with Marfans but I heard that when you are running you should be able to run and hold a conversation at the same time and it shouldnt do any harm Thank you your right and no what I mean is do you anything I should not do to cause my health and body harm", "Does anyone take adderall and have marfan's? Hey!  \nSo I was wondering if anyone here takes prescribed adderall? Has your cardiologist said anything about it? I ask because adderall is a stimulant and a common side effect is hypertension that is, high blood pressure. So I am not sure how this comes into play with Marfan's and if taking this medication is detrimental for us. Not necessarily because of the Marfans, but back off on or quit the adderall as soon as you can manage \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude04 I am currently in the process of getting diagnosed with ADHD and getting prescribed meds.

Nope, the tests were good, but I do get chest pains often I take Ritalin, they started me on the lowest possible dosage, lower than my psych had ever seen, then slowly increased while monitoring BP and heart rate. My psychiatrist refused to treat my adhd with adderall (or any equivalent) because of my marfan diagnoses. Instead I take a combination of ssri\u2019s and a non benzo anxiety medication. \n\nI find that one of the NDRI\u2019s, called Wellbutrin, has helped significantly with my adhd. It is used to treat depression but had a lot of other uses too, among them is treating adhd. The extended release form is perfect for all day concentration/motivation. And it avoids the crash that often happens with amphetamine drugs like adderall.\n\nOf course, your doctor will know what is best for you based on your health history and how bad the actual problem is. But it is good to know about alternatives and to discuss them with your doctor.\n\nEdited-for corrections Wellbutrin is an ( not an SSRI.  It targets norepinephrine and dopamine where SSRIs target serotonin. Because of this, it can be used off label for treating ADHD.", "Here is a list of supplements that I take. What do you take?

Got my brother to take me to the hospital and was admitted. Scary stuff. No issues since. Do not smoke, kids. I am still 15 and it happened just a couple of months ago. On both of my lungs in fact, one after the other. I am just very unlucky, I suppose. Had on both lungs, two years apart. One was on a normal day, was working on my computer when suddenly felt pain and could not breath, knew it was pneumothorax and went to the hospital (hoped it would not be so serious and stayed home for a couple of days before going, should have gone immediately I know).

I am really stressing about them wanting to do both surgeries at the same time. My original doctor ten years ago told me not to have them done at the same time I believe because once you get the metal rods in you it is harder to open you back up in case of an emergency? But I am really not sure. I turned the internet upside down and could not find any real insight. I have been working with the Marfan Foundation and they know I am having both and have not said anything otherwise. I found one study where six people had simultaneous repair and they were all ok. Also, it is the Cleveland Clinic and they are pretty cutting edge and would not jeopardize my safety? Does anybody have any thoughts or opinions. I am already freaking out as it is and this is the last thing I want to be second guessing before Thursday morning gets here. Please help. Not sure if this helps, but, there is a difference from making something difficult and making something impossible. Should you ever have to be reopened after both surgeries, it is doable, might just be a little tougher than usual. I am not a doctor but just how I would look at it. Best of luck to you, I will keep you in my prayers! Please give update when you are feeling better and up to it! \u2764\ufe0f You are going to be fine. I have heard of plenty of people doing both and they all recovered fine myself included. I have been through both of these procedures. I always feel it is an injustice to say it will not suck cause it will. It is surgery it is going to suck no matter what you are having done. But that is why you get to rest and medication in a hospital with round the clock care.\nGood luck. Hope it all goes well. Who is doing your surgery? My husband had a dissection and my s kids had elective aortic root replacements They did not have a pectus repair but we love Dr Roselli! He truly saved our family! If Cleveland clinic is doing it, then you are in good hands, regardless of the surgeon. Good luck! One Dr is Roselli and the other for the chest is Dr Raymond. That is really good to hear then thank you for the consideration and kind words. I am going through the admittance process right now. Thank you very much. I learned a lot of information last night from someone who had the same thing that I am about to go through. I will keep you posted. Well i am from belgium and i have made this surgery one month ago  ( july 18 ;) ) it was a \"Tirone David\" surgery ( like the bentall but without the valve remplacement ) and for the pectus they do not tell me the name of the technique but the procedur was removing the cartilage from the pectus raise the pectus at a \"normal\" place and then put a \"metal\" bar to keep the pectus on place ( i will kepp the bar 6 month/one year before removing it from an another surgery) at this time i am always on work stopping but i just beging to feel good enough to go to work, i am always limited in my mouvement (at the beginning my chest feel like a wood log) but now that is livable \n\nIf you have question do not hesitate ! i have nothing else to do so much i am bored at home xD Nine weeks ago I had an ascending aortic aneurysm and valve repair (david procedure) at Cleveland Clinic.  I spent a lot of time researching facilities and surgeons.  Dr Roselli is world class.  If the team at Cleveland Clinic tells you something, you can take it to the bank.  My recovery has been excellent. Was it the Ravitch procedure for the pectus repair? Are you happy you did both at the same time? And thank you so much for responding. I am at the hospital right now meeting with the doctors. They have only done the combo surgery together 6 times. :-/ Thank you that is so fantastic to hear it really is. I am waiting for him to walk into the room any second. How do you feel now? Is there anything you wish you knew before you had the surgery to help you be more prepared or recover faster? Well, when a look about the \"Ravitch procedure\" it seems to match with what the doctor says to me . so it is probably this procedure.\n\nIf i am happy to do both at the same time ? well yes but i think that the respons    \ndepends on how we handle the pain and how you are patient, at the post op, the two surgery will make you fell weak at different point, the chest surgery will make you feel like a wood log and you will probably lost a lot of physical strenght (the first week i was unable to lift a water bottle of 1L ( 1 little kilogram :'( ) we use the \"power of your chest\" everyday, and you will know that, when you will lost the \"power of your chest\" just open a  \"pickle jar\" and you will notice, the chest do (random number) 80% of the job, and about the heart surgery, they will make you feel tired, for example I am going from a heart rate of 60 BPM (beta-blocker + doing nothing) pre op to a rate of 120 BPM (beta-blocker + doing nothing) post op ! the doctors says that is normal and the rate will discrease with time, but for my body it was like i made a marathon constantly ! that is also result on a lost of endurance \n\nIf you think that you can handle all of this ( and other problem that will be specific to your body), then, go for it ! That will make you save money, time, and mental health :D be at the hospital is not \"fun\" personally i lost a lot of weight ( at every surgery ) this one make me lost 4 Kg (passed from 48 kg to 44 :'( )  \n\nAnd about the \"unexperience\" of your doctors well, ask them if they get complication ? how many ? when was the last one ? and what was the complication ? ..... you can also ask, how the other patient going ? If the doctors are confortable about the fact that they only make it 6 times ? if you can contact one of the 6 other patient ? ...\n\nIn my hospital they tell me that they do  \"Tirone David\"  and  \"Bentall\" once a month but that the combo of  the two surgery ( \"Tirone David\"+ pectus probably the \"Ravitch procedure\") have been never done here, the \"unexperience\" of my doctors did not scare me, you need to see that surgery like, two common surgery linked, not like one big surgery that have been made only 6 times.\n\nAlso be sure about the pectus surgery it is only aesthetic you will not get a better respiration or anything else, in my case i am a 18 transgirl who wich having a female breast (by hormones or surgery) and having fine breast with a pectus is imposible from my point of view but years ago (when i was 14)  i was \"attached\" to my pectus they make me feel different (and i also dont care about the staring of people) so when i was 14 it was impossible (in my mind) to do this surgery but time make you change !\n\nI am not supposed to say that but for now i am disapointed about the pectus surgery I hope that in 6 months 1 years it will be better looking at :/\n\nPs : sorry for the BOOK and the bad english :'( Thank you you so much for the I formation. Tirone David is actually a resident at the hospital I am at in Cleveland Ohio or was. I am not sure if he is still operating but my doctor says he does 3 of these a week and David does about one a month. And it is the guy who invented the surgery so it is nuts.

", "Aortic root replacement questions Not sure what or how it happens. Do you usually need the aortic valve replaced too? Can it just be the root? If you need the root replaced but get to keep the valve do you have to be on blood thinners? It depends on the state of your aortic valve, sometimes they can keep it, sometimes they need to replace it with a mechanical one. You only need blood thinners if you have got a mechanical valve. If they replace the root without touching the valve, you will not need any. My surgeon told me pre-op that he would decide on the valve once he got in there and saw it for himself.\n\nOriginally was just going in for the root replacement.  I had the valve defect where 2/3 of the flaps were fused (bifurcated, Maybe?) and they were pretty badly deteriorated from the strain, so he decided to replace it after doing the aortic root. I had the same thing. 1st root replacement when I was 18 months, and then when I was 10 going in for my 2nd replacement, they told me they would decide during surgery whether or not to replace the valve as well. Guess it was too messed up to leave untouched haha I guess I was lucky to only need 1 surgery.  The surgeon did not want to leave the failing valve just to open me up 10 years later for it anyways.", "Varicocele Any men here who have this issue? I actually do Did you fix it? This is extremely recent. I have not, You should get a cup (jockstrap) it helped a lot with me. I wonder if marfan is more likely to lead to varicocele and if it can cause post surgery complications. Medical knowledge is lagging... I actually do not know, I do not even know if it is caused by my marfan I thought it was just something that happened", "Safe to go to the gym with weak form of Marfans? Hi,  I have a very high number of the features of Marfans (sunken chest, wrist signs, flat feet, facial features, and many others), so I probably do have some mutation of the FBN1 gene, but I have had my heart/aorta looked at with an ultrasound recently and there are thankfully no abnormalities.\n\nDue to my heart/aorta being normal genetic testing is not an option for me under my current healthcare arrangements so I cannot really confirm a diagnosis.\n\nDo you guys think it would be safe to go to the gym and do intensive exercise, and maybe just have my aorta checked every year or two? The cardiologist did not give me advice regarding that, and my GP who referred me to him had not heard of Marfans before I brought it up so I am not expecting much advice from her when I follow it up. Hello! I have been diagnosed and do not have the heart issue, just the skeletal stuff and hyper mobility. I do yoga as often as I can. Which means nearly five times a week. I used to do a weighted body conditioning class once a week, but I have stopped because I cannot be bothered with lunges because my knees cannot take the reps in the class. I do Zumba three times a week and BPM is normally 150-190 in that class. I do not get chest pains or get lightheaded so I just take regular breaks. \n\nThe point is you have to know your body. Do not push it. I do not go above 10kg weights at all. Not even for kettlebell squats. Most of what I do is body weight. My dad thought the same thing - that he did not have any heart issues. Until he did and needed surgery. \n\nFor me I went from an okay aorta to having surgery in less then a year at step 20. \n\nIf I were you I would get annual echos on my aorta and take a low dose ARB/beta blocker. \n\nAlso remember there are other impacts to Marfan - e.g., your joints, retinal detachment, etc. Thanks for the caution, I will definitely try to get annual echos then. Thanks for sharing, I will try to take it easy then :) Hello! First I would like to say, if your GP has not done her research on Marfan's by the next time you see her look for a second opinion. There are a lot of possible complications for Marfan's and you should have a primary care physician who can answer your questions and help with the diagnosis/ prevention care.\n\nSecond I suggest talking to the cardiologist again, it sounds like you did not get much information from your visit. Talking about beta blockers, intensive exercise and aortic aneurysms and dissections is pretty important if you think you have the syndrome. Also check your aorta *at least* every year, these things can progress really fast.\n\nI would focus on bodyweight and moderate exercise, always keeping your heart rate under control until you can investigate a bit more, just to be safe.\n\nGood luck :) Hi,\nSo according to my cardiologist, I could do any type of exercises. Until last week when I went to the National Marfan Centre and they told me that I certainly cannot do any type of exercises. So basically even my cardiologist was not fully informed of marfan's syndrome.\nAbsolutely no weightlifting as it is very hard on the aorta. Nothing intense and nothing which could shock your body.\n\nThey recommend walking, yoga, riding your bike, light running (you have to be able to hold a conversation), swimming. Please be careful. Oh no, I just bought a gym membership :( Maybe I will get away with it for the duration the membership (5 months).\n\nThanks though, that is really helpful to know about your experience, and I will definitely make sure it is checked at least once a year, and I will try to take it easier in the gym.\n\nI think the cardiologist was not informed about Marfans much, but he did an ultrasound (looked at at different parts of the aorta and at my heart) and several other tests but all they found was that I have 80% of the average lung capacity (never smoked) for my height/weight and that I am pretty unfit. Thanks, I will look for a second opinion if my next appointment (next week) is unproductive. I recently moved abroad, but still have the option of seeing my old GP back home, so I will do that when I next visit.\n\nI do not think I will be able to speak to a cardiologist again without a referral from my GP, and anyway I did not get the feeling that he was very informed about Marfans (but he did at least check different parts of my aorta and my heart with the ultrasound). At the end of the appointment he basically just said \"well you just have to accept the hole in your chest\" (my inference from this was that he assumes because I currently have no heart/aorta problems I cannot have Marfans). Anyway I had accepted my chest, it was only chest pains in the gym (and then outside of the gym) that caused me to investigate and learn about Marfans. At that point I had only been going to the gym for 3 months, but now after having stopped for another 3 months (that is how long it took to get an ultrasound) and getting it checked it seems those pains must have been something else or nothing.\n\nI am already prescribed some beta blockers for anxiety (but do not take them because they make me sleepy), so maybe I will just start using them again. I will certainly take your advice and make sure I get my aorta checked at least once per year.\n\nYeah I will keep the weights at a lower level. Thanks for the luck, and all the advice :)", "Do my hands look normal? I have really bad health anxiety and this is the latest thing that I think I have, does this look like Marfan syndrome to you  Nah, my hand looks alien like. You have a normal hand.

Better safe then sorry..\n\nI have positive wrist and thumb sign and scoliosis..long arms legs.. thin .. \n\nToo bad I cannot look art my aorta myself I can do the wrist sign if I force it but I cannot do the thumb sign, and I have a &lt; 10 degrees spinal asymmetry, I do not think that is considered scoliosis tho Your probably fine but for your minds sake I would go to the Dr if I were you..\n\nMarfan's is very rare and even I could just be a skinny doodle . If I suspected myself to have a condition that might include an exploding aorta, I would perhaps consult a doctor before an internet forum. It looks worse than this but the angle makes it look normal, I would take another picture but I do not want to flood this sub with my posts The thing is that I am under 18 so I cannot just call a doctor and go in Ask your parents. You could also look at therapy to help with your anxiety around these things. Wrist/thumb sign should not be forced to be achieved. Same with any other aspect of the Beighton hypermobility test. These things should be natural. Easy. &gt;You could also look at therapy to help with your anxiety around these things.\n\nAs OP admits to health anxiety definitely yes. Even if they got a diagnosis or lack thereof, it would not ease their mind. The thumb sign is for hyper mobility testing, not finger length right? Right. Nah, your wrist looks too wide. The wrist is more thin in person, the angle of the picture makes the fingers look shorter and the wrist look wider, I put 2 more pictures on my profile Trust me, i can make my hand looks spooky from all angles. If you still are in doubt get your parents and book an appointment for cardio doctor, they will get you sorted on your doubts. I hope you are getting help for your anxiety! \n\nThis is really not the place for medical advice. I think all we can really share with you is our personal experiences. And if you read a bit about Marfan, it is on a spectrum and we all experience it a bit differently.", "Kind of a weird question, but for my fellas with marfans... Full disclosure, not formally diagnosed but have the build, hypermobility and enough screening symptoms. Do not have genetics in my insurance :))\n\nDo your balls hang like really low? So low it hurts? I have to physically cradle mine sometimes because they hang so low. I looked it up abd saggy balls are caused by degrading collagen so it kind of makes sense. Only solution is a scrotoplasty and i really hate that idea, so its just supportive undies for now... My balls are too small to hang low. I cannot imagine what kind of scrotal situation you will be rocking in 20 years, but I feel for you man. Good luck with them nuts. I could also just be being a baby about my situation ig I wonder about this same concept amongst us boob-havers as well! I have a lot of stretch marks but my Gs are fine hang wise. I do not know the answer to your question but I have heard there is a lab that will run a Marfan screen for around $250. Invatae labs. Cannot hurt to look into it. that is odd lol. I believe the height of your ball is a genetic thing and I have never heard it could be affected by marfs. \n\nmaybe you should get it checked wirh an urologist. One thing I know for sure is that it is not common for it to hurt. Hurting balls while in rest and \"feeling your balls heavy\" or being pulled down are often symptoms of testicular cancer. Do you feel any of these? It is not really that they are heavy/swollen/whatever, they just hang down lower than i think most people's do when they get hot and distend, as I often have to repeatedly rearrange to avoid them getting squished between my legs and the like. It is only uncomfortable when i am in a hot room, fresh out a hot shower, etc.\n\nThey are on the larger side overall and that is always been a little obtrusive, but I just put two and two together reading about ball sagging being related to collagen and wanted to check in with you all peeps. Mine do often wobble to and fro. When I shit I have to tie them in a knot or a bow. When I run or workout I often throw them over my shoulder like a continental soldier. My balls hang low. Do your balls hang low\nCan you swing them to and fro\nCan you tie them in a knot\nCan you tie them in a bow...", "I should probably see a doctor...  I am not 100% sure, but this might be our first legit meme post. Bravo. I Will make the second I made one a year or two ago lol oh right I remember that one. Ok I stand corrected.", "Some help please Ok, so I am NOT asking for medical advice but I am looking for reassurance that I am not mad. I am 32, and for all intents and purposes, I thought I was fine, just extremely unfit and lazy. Then someone took a photo of me and I looked so narrow and my arms looked so long, that I just googled \u2018long arms\u2019 and the first thing that popped up was Marfan syndrome. I had a lot of the symptoms: bad eyesight, stretch marks, small jaw, crowded teeth, flat feet, the ability to do those hand tests, a not straight back (cannot say what it is for sure, so will not label it). Then not even two weeks later, my chest hurts so bad it feels like it is going to explode, every time I got up I felt like I was going to faint and die, my throat felt like it so sore for some bizarre reason. I never went to the doctor because I was abroad in a country without good medical facilities. The pain eventually went away and I sort of forgot about it (I have some life stresses so I have other things on my mind). Now my chest pain is back and it is not as severe as the last time, but it is worrying and I keep hearing a burping/bubbling/whooping(?) sound in my chest. It is like if I had a bottle of cola, and I tipped it upside down, all the bubble that start to go up is what what my chest feels like. My ticket back to the uk is in a months time, but I am thinking of pushing it forward to go to the doctor, I would love to know for people who felt weird, what signs scared them enough to seek help. I really do not think I am being paranoid but I hear that my age is crucial point if you have not been diagnosed yet. Any info on any internal signs that others have had would be greatly appreciated. Thank you :) \n\nPs: I am 5\u20195 but people think I look taller, my weight has fluctuated my whole life, I have been rail thin and overweight. No matter my weight I have excess fat on my arms. I lack muscle tone but I lead a sedentary life", "Aortic size change by age? Hey  guys!  \n\n\n**Background**\n\nSo, I am currently in this \"Grey\" area where I have not been officially diagnosed, but I have several physical feature of marfan (very very skinny, tall (6'0), rather long arms and legs, tons of stretch marks, arachnodactyly, double jointed fingers and pigeon chested).   \n\n\nHowever, in 2014 (18 yr old), I had an echo for other non-marfan related reasons and my heart was normal.  \nFast forward to early january 2020 (22 yr old), I had another echo, and my aorta increased by 0.1 (went from 2.9 -&gt; 3.0) which, taking into consideration how much I grew, it is actually expected normal growth. During this time, I took no cardiac medications.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Purpose of this thread**  \nNow, here is the purpose of this thread, I wanted to ask about how your aorta changed according to your age. I cannot seem to find any information online regarding this. Normal aortic growth (according to a paper on NCBI) is supposed to be 0.1 per decade of life after the 20's,  which is basically when you stop growing.  \n\n\nI am very interested in knowing, especially those of you who developed aortic dilation later in life as opposed to in your teen years. I am really interested in going to the gym to improve my self image. My cardiologist says it is fine, but I am very skeptical, because of this \"grey area\" that I am at regarding Marfan's. Mine was normal at age 19 around July. By Dec enlarged. By Feb to 5cm. Surgery in May it was ~8cm. \n\nI was on beta blockers the whole time and the only exercise I was doing was lots of walking. But what is \"normal\" for you specifically?  \n\n\nI ask because aortic sizes can be within a whole range, meaning anything below 4.5 is actually still below the threshold for surgery, but having an aorta of \\~3.8, although considered \"normal\" it is on the higher side of the spectrum. 37mm at 17\n41mm at 20 \nLifted a ton of weights and gained 50 lbs \n45mm at 21 \n43mm at 25 \n46mm at 27 My aorta has grown since I was diagnosed at 12 now 15 I have been given a bigger dosage of medicine to keep it under control 37 mm at 13 (started rowing)\n42 mm at 18 (stopped rowing, started ARB+BB)\n46 mm at 22\n46 mm at 27 Hey!  \n\n\nWhoa, what routine did you follow through to gain 50lbs?  \nI wish I could gain at least 20lbs! My son's has grown since his diagnosis. He is at 3.7 at 16 years of age. Larger than normal and checked every 6 months since he is still growing. For kids that is why you have the z-score to normalize for your body size. \n\nI am not sure what my normal was as it was too long ago and I did not pay attention when things were good. It all depends. Mine has not grown much since I was 13 when I was first \u2018diagnosed\u2019. My mom also had Marfan\u2019s but never had major issues with her aorta. If you do things that can cause more pressure it will increase the risk of growth but just the same the purpose of the regular check ups is to monitor the change and catch it before it gets bad. For anyone on this thread with an \"unofficial\" diagnosis, I recommend seeing a geneticist and finding out if you actually have Loeys-Dietz Syndrome. The threshold for surgical intervention is lower (4.2) with LDS. I always assumed I had Marfan's and even my cardiologist thought so. Genetic testing may have saved my life by giving me a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. My aortic root was at 4.2. I had aortic root repair surgery about 3 years ago. This is very true.   \n\n\nHowever, I think even those of us who have \"unofficial\" diagnosis, the most important thing to do is actually just get biannual echocardiograms (if no change has not occurred) or annual (if changes occur and/or aorta is within threshold limit).", "Chest Pains/Sternum touching heart I spent yesterday in the ER yesterday due to chest pain. My aorta is enlarged so we wanted to make sure everything was okay. I ended up getting a CT and everything appeared to be normal(as far as normal can be with an enlarged aorta). However they noticed that my  sternum dips in so far that it actually touches part of my heart which may be causing part of my discomfort but it has been like that for a while so it should not have just started hurting.\nWhat I am wondering is if anyone else has had issues with there sternum touching there heart due to there chest dipping in so far?", "Having children.. There are many reasons for why I do not want to have children, but one of them is passing this on to someone else. What are your thoughts on this? Not helpful at all, but...\n\nSame. Thanks for the feedback though You know the pain you went through and are going through. It is up to you if you want to chance giving that to someone else. There are no wrong answers.\n\nI also chose to skip out on children, there is always adoption. This may sound arrogant but I look at it as an undeserved moral obligation to not pass it on Sounds fine to me. Thank you I agree it is like passing a curse onto the next generation. Since it is so hard to tell how Marfan's is going to affect one person to the next, i do not think it is fair to presume that having a child will damn them to a life of medical issues that are as bad or worse off than those of us that have it would. Plus with all the testing they can do with IVF and the like, plus the opportunity to use surrogacy for carrying the kid to term, it is relatively easy to ensure your kids would not have it. \n\nThat being said, I can barely take care of myself between my mental health and physical health, and that would not be fair to a child to have a parent that is not able to manage caring for them, let alone myself. Cannot speak to your disease. But as a new father:\n\nFor what it is worth, everyone of conscience these days worries about passing on everything about this existence to another tiny blameless soul for the world to chew up. \n\nIf you did not have this illness, you would still worry about all the other things you are passing on.\n\nFor you, the ultimate decision needs to be agreed upon with the doctor and with good science, but I am really happy I had my daughter even though I am so sorry for dragging another life into this world. \n\nI hope this does not come across as tone deaf, because I know there is a lot I do not know about the suffering you have to deal with, but from having contemplated similar but less extreme existential worries myself, your concerns are 100% natural, but certainly amplified. Thanks for the advice. You did not have to tip-toe, because I am open minded but you could not have known.\n\nAnyway, I hope things go really well for you, overall. Yeah, what you brought up is really worth considering. Well there is more to it, but yeah You too friend. I am very hopeful for the next generation of Marfan patients. There are new surgery options (such as PEARS) and many new discoveries (such as effectiveness of trans-Resveratrol or Doxycycline in mice), plus lots of on-going trials with Losartan and Beta Blockers. Marfan patients are tending to live longer and longer. I believe soon we will have many more effective treatment options.  \n\n\nAlso you could always try for a baby that does not have the mutation (artificial insemination etc). I got so many reasons too. With Marfans being one. But I am still kind of fence-sitting leaning towards childfree. Same I did IVF with preimplantation genetic testing so that my children will not have it. Let me know if you have any questions. That is currently the only way to confirm you will not pass it on and you have to have a known genetic mutation for it to work. Not sure if you would be contributing sperm or eggs to the process, but it is actually a long, very expensive, and difficult process with a lot of invasive testing and procedures, so I would not say it is easy. But it is definitely doable if it is important to you. Let me know if you have questions. We were the same. Nowadays you can use IVF with preimplantation genetic diagnosis to prevent the disease from being passed on. I do not really have questions, because not only do I not like kids, I also will not be having any for a very long time even if I will. So basically I will forget.\n\nBut thank you very much for the offer. I am curious about your experiences, particularly anything that did not come up in typical pre-procedure reading. Not sure exactly what you mean? Can you clarify your question? I was monitored for my Marfan before and during pregnancy. The embryo we implanted was genetically tested and did not have the Marfan mutation I have. I am a 23 year old female who was diagnosed with Marfan\u2019s at age 4. My father and brother have it. My dad I nearly lost to an aortic dissection, my brother had two surgeries and has a mechanical valve now, and I had my open heart surgery at 16, plus 15 other related surgeries. And my poor mother has so much anxiety and depression from stressing over us, plus the medical costs. \n\n I think I probably decided when I was 16 that I did not want kids for that exact reason. I love children. I was a nanny for 8 years. And I embrace my Marfans. But as someone who has gone through it first hand, I do not want to pass that down to my child. I have seen my poor mother, I do not want to give that stress to my spouse. I also do not want my kid to experience what I have. \n\nNot only that but the mental health issues that have stemmed from having Marfan\u2019s (and other variables), it would not be fair of me to try to take care of a child when I cannot even take care of myself. \n\nNow, I would be open to adopt in the far future but for now, no kids. (Straight up thought about having my tubes tied before lmao. ) Thanks for the feedback, also the name fits me as well lol I thought it was pretty fitting \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I think it is for most of us =} Those are some great points you brought up, I will take them into consideration I was thinking about doing this, but it is so expensive, I would have to wait years to afford it. Some states have mandatory insurance coverage, but unfortunately my current state it is all out of pocket. Lots of places have payment plans. I have always wanted kids, but the past few years have been seriously questioning it, solely on the fact that I have marfans. I had open heart surgery to fix the aorta hole and mitrovalve regurgitation and have felt really healthy, except for the occasional increase in HR when I do not sleep well. However, the struggle of recovering and now suffering from anxiety because of it is really making me question whether or not I want to have my future children experience the same.  My mother had it, which is where I inherited it from (no one else in my family, including my two other siblings have it) but she passed away from a stroke after heart surgery because her aorta basically burst. So idk it is just hard to make that decision. Adoption \ud83d\udc4d", "Toning/building muscle Hello all. Was diagnosed about 10years ago with marfans and joint hypermobility. \nMy mobility is not great and cannot stand for long periods of time.\nMy question is how difficult or easy is it for sufferers to gain/tone muscle.\nI have been told to avoid using free weights and am using a resistance kit.\nAny help would be appreciated and I apologise if this has been asked a 100 times before. I heard it was something to be avoided. Excess strain on the chest is bad for your heart. In terms of safety I would suggest you talk to a cardiologist or your GP and get their opinion. I can only speak for myself, but I have been working out and doing contact sports for a long time. I was diagnosed at 31, and before that I used to play football (soccer), and practiced Capoeira (a martial art). \n\nI still work out though, I used to go to the gym, and also rock climb when I can. Currently, I am focusing on body weight exercises, where I started really slow and simple and have been able to build up. For example, it was only until my mid thirties that I was able to do *one* push-up.\n\nNow, about the gains part. Do not expect much, I am wiry and that is the best I can hope for without taking ridiculous supplements or becoming an obsessed gym rat. Definitely check with a specialist before any kind of intense training.\n\nThat being said, getting in decent shape will add longevity and some well being to everyday life.  Been working out consistently for about 2 years.  Started pretty light, 2-3 days a week.  Up to a good 5 days a week, pretty intensive DB and barbell work!", "Want some opinions on my case of Marfans Hi!\n\nI want to hear your perspective on my case, and I am not seeking ANY medical advice. Just opinions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast year, I noticed my collar bone were popping in and out. I took contact with my doctor, that sent me to a specialist within connective tissue disorders like EDS, Marfans etc. She said my collar bones were popping out because of subluxation (joint hypermobility). She then took tests of me and this is what she found and wrote down about me:\n\n\\- 190 cm tall and 71 kg\n\n\\- My skin doesnt bleed easy and doesnt get bruises either\n\n\\- I have piezogenic papules on both feets\n\n\\- I have hyper ext. elbows\n\n\\- Beigtens score: 2/9\n\n\\- I have retrognathia\n\n\\- Doesnt feel more tired than anyone else\n\n\\- Nearsigthness with astigmatism. I am not very nearsighted, just -0,75 and -1,00\n\n\\- Never had dislocated lenses or any other eye issues\n\n\\- No one in my family have had connective tissue disorders or died before 50\n\n\\- Pectus excavatum\n\n\\- Wrist sign positive, thumb sign negative\n\n\\- I do not have flat feets\n\n\\- Not crowded teeths\n\n\\- Never had punctured lungs\n\n\\- I have not had any heart issues\n\n\\- Arm span ratio normal (0,99/189cm)\n\n\\- Mild scoliosis\n\n\\- Some hypermobility on the tip of my fingers\n\n\\- Stretch marks on lower back, stomach and inner thighs (I grew so fast in 9th grade, were not rly tall before.. so I think my stretch marks are rom the rapid growth and my stretch marks on the inner thighs are from weight liftings as I grew good muscles in my legs the last 3 years)\n\n\\- Been playing football and did weight lifting last years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe doctor then sendt me for a check to echo cardio, and he didnt find anything. My aorta and all my valves were normal. I then asked the doctor if I could get a genetic test but I couldnt. She said it was not any basis to make a genetic test, as she thinks I just have hypermobile joints in my collar bones, and that I dont need a check up for my heart every year. Conclusion: I do not have marfans or any other disorder.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat are your thoughts on my case? Personaly, I dont feel safe. (I am not seeking a diagnosis through reddit, I will talk more with my doctor. Just wants some perspectives/opinions)", "What were the signs that led you to believe you have Marfan Syndrome, or how were you diagnosed? I am just interested in what anybody else\u2019s experience was. I do not actually know if this is something I have but am feeling genuine concern over the amount of symptoms I have. I am sure you guys hear posts like this often, and I am not looking for anyone to diagnose me. I do not know what I am looking for, peace of mind I guess? Maybe I just need to get it off my chest. I cannot actually see a Dr. until my insurance kicks in.  \n\nHere are the reasons I am worrying if anyone cares to know: \n- I have large hands for a female, my husband is 6\u20190 and while I am only 5\u20198 my hands/fingers are longer than his. Long very thin legs and short torso. \n- I have every wrist/thumb sign. Skinny wrists, can cover pinky finger with thumb. Can bend thumb downwards to touch wrist. Thumb extends past palm when making a fist/covering with fingers. All fingers seem double jointed. My hand/finger bones are like rubber in most places. I never thought too much of this until researching MFS and realizing I have never actually met anyone else that can do these things. \n- I am underweight and cannot gain no matter how hard I try. I am usually around 85-95 lbs but I am 5\u20198. My parents are thin people but were never close to this thin or boney looking like me. My siblings are not either. \n- I have scoliosis (last checked 4 years ago was told it was mild) I have almost constant every day back pain, more so than would be normal for just mild scoliosis in my opinion. I cannot stand up for long periods of time without pain that occasionally shoots to my legs. My back is in tons of pain just from quick grocery shopping. I also always feel fatigued. \n- I have a high narrow palette and long thin face. I breathe through my mouth only because my tongue cannot sit comfortably on the roof of my mouth to keep my mouth closed and breathe through my nose. Had speech problems as a child. \n- I have bad vision, am nearsighted. \n- I have downslanting palpebral fissures. \n- I have what I believe might be PE, have never paid much attention to it because boobs, but there is definitely a small indentation on my chest can push my thumb into it. \n- I get winded very easily, since I was a child, had a hard time running or doing anything too strenuous. More so now (but I figure it is worse now that I have smoked since age 12 .. I am 25 now). \n- Hands and feet are always cold due to poor circulation (maybe also from smoking?)\n- I have stretch marks on my thighs and hips/butt and never gained weight rapidly to my knowledge. \n- I have never had my heart checked.  \n\nI am just extremely worried and frustrated that all my life I have felt like I had a handful of issues/ things most people did not have at my age or in general and never put any of it together like this. Sorry for such a lengthy post but it felt really good to write it all out instead of just going over it all again and again in my head. I would be curious to know anyone else\u2019s experience with Marfan Syndrome.  A school nurse spotted the signs in my twin and I and suggested we get checked for it. Do not be afraid of finding out if you have it. If it turns out that you do, then you will finally have some answers, and the knowledge is empowering. Good luck! Thanks so much for this positive response. I am not as afraid as I am impatient, lack of insurance is keeping me from seeing the Dr. until next month. I am trying not to drive myself crazy with worry but it is hard as I found out there is a 50% chance of passing it to your children and I had my child when I was 24. It runs in my family, so they were on the lookout from birth. Could not tell you what signs they saw first. I have always known I have had it, since I could comprehend. \n\nThe most obvious sign my family shows is the detached lenses.  My son was 12 when we went to an urgent care and the doctor we saw asked if he had it. Long story very short, 6 months later we found out the blood results confirmed he does.  Italians, my uncle is medic he went for an eco for his cervical, there were not other patients so the technician made him the favor and checked also his carotid  thus finding the marfan symptoms (after the diagnosis become LDS) .\nLuckly for us already in my grandpa family it is \"light\" and in mine is even lighter (as the country specialist told us, we are the second lightest family in the country :) ).\n\nThe first time i went to the national center so my father could get the genetic test and the geneticist could see all the brothers (uncles) together it was a trauma.\nWhy?\nBecause i am really \"happy\" that my uncle got his diagnosis immediately, as a lot of people on this forum. at the national center i got the trauma after seeing a young woman, she was pregnant, the marfan was so strong (was it caused by marfan?) that her capillars were breaking so she was loosing hair. \nDo marfans risk uterin rupture like in LDS during pregnancy?\nBut the worst part about her history was not the sympthoms it was that before getting a diagnosis she went to 8 specialists until meeting someone that could diagnose her Marfan. \n\n \n", "Struggling to get help with Marfan Syndrome. Hi there, I am 20 years old &amp; I have Marfan Syndrome. I do not know if I have \"officially\" been diagnosed but the doctor who did my pectus excavatum surgery several years ago said I had it and the doctor who fixed my collapsed lung a few years ago said I had it. I have severe chronic pain in my back and chest. I have tried several types of treatments but nothing works as well as opioids, the only problem is I no longer get prescribed them because \"I am too at-risk for addiction\" because the in house psychiatrist (maybe psychologist) concluded that I have social anxiety... So because I have anxiety and am at risk I cannot get treated for the pain I am in? Does not really make sense in my opinion. The doctor even said that if I was old he would not care about prescribing me opioids but since I am so young he does not want to see me get addicted. I asked what my next course of action should be to try to fix my pain? He told me that I should get another pectus excavatum surgery and so I asked what if that does not work? He did not really have an answer. (I had to have my bar taken out prematurely after my lung collapsed due to it bottle necking and crushing my rib cage due to growth.) At this point how do I get help? I do not enjoy being on opioids but they improve my quality of life a lot more than anything I have tried and I honestly do not know how to function when I am in so much pain. Where do I go from here?  Where do you live? e.g. country/area of the country. United States. Pacific Northwest area (WA/ID/OR/Northern CA) Hmm.. I have had very similar issues. \nI baked cookies or Danish ryebread with weed. If I needed it to be easy, I melted some chocolate and mixed it with hash, poured it in a chocolate silicone mold and ate a tiny piece, if I had severe pain. \nOpioids made the pain worse, because I would not exercise or strain it because of the numbness. \n\nI do not do it anymore(because suddenly I was always high), I started exercising and swimming. Tbh, it really helps to move and stay active. The pain is worse, if you do not.  I have tried marijuana but it does not help as much and it makes me less active and less productive compared to opioids. And I agree staying active helps if its the right king of active! Not sure how close you are to Seattle, but the cardiologists who took care of me, and the surgeon who did my aortic bypass works at University of Washington, and I highly recommend him, and the whole team.\n\nHowever your situation seems to be more about chronic pain, and they are right, you cannot get through life in an opioid haze, because it will kill your internal organs, before the Marfan's kills you.\n\nHave you tried other methods of dealing with the pain?\n\n\n\n I would expect Seattle to have something at least close to a cardiologist who knows a bit about Marfans. I have been going to Vancouver Children\u2019s in Canada for the past 18 years for mine and they have been really good.  Seattle is where I intend to check out first. And the opioids would not kill me before Marfan's because I will not allow myself to take more than is safe. I actually believe the doses I was taking are safer than if I were to take Tylenol instead due to the fact that the thing in them that kills you is the Acetaminophen! (At least in the ones I was taking.) I have tried everything my pain center has thrown at me to the point that now they are recommending another surgery, that they think COULD fix my pain which actually will not because its the same surgery I had before and I was in so much pain all the time when I did have a bar in. I feel like I have tried everything and that opioids are my only option if I want to live a productive life with less agonizing pain.  Well, it looks like you are all the right things by working with a pain center who can guide you. The only thing I can say is do not underestimate the power of opioids, there is a reason the US has an opioid crisis, and many people without substance abuse issues have become addicted to them. Agreed! If I can find a treatment that works with less side effects that would be awesome! I truly hate having to take laxatives every day because of opioids. The Marfan website recently had a webinar about chronic pain.  You should check it out! \n\nAlso, the right dr. can make all the difference! Hello from the Pacific NW! (Idaho here)\n\n  \n\n\nI am curious if you ever found anything to help relieve the pain.\n\nI am going for an echo and other tests this week expecting to confirm Marfan's... and while I will be excited to have that answer, I am still wondering what that means for this debilitating chronic pain.\n\nSo I am selfishly and empathetically curious what you figured out.", "Do I have marfans?

And we are going to give you a diagnosis over the internet based on the information above! Tell me, if someone came here and said \"Why yes you certainly have marfans!\". Would you believe them? Go see a doctor if you want to get checked.", "Dural Ectasia Does anyone here have it?\nI would like to hear of your experience with it. I do. I get back pain and head aches. But over all not that noticable compared to all my other aches and pains. I have it.  Same as the other commenter, though I get crippling headaches with mine.  My back pain is more due to scoliosis/kyphosis and a broken back from a car accident.  Currently trying to beg for rods in my back so I can breathe/eat again. Thanks for the feedback guy's.\nI am just trying to find the most info and personal  experience I can as experts on the matter are few and far between down here.\n\nI get the headaches, the back/leg pain and a host of neurological symptoms below the waist so I guess what I am trying to figure out is how much worse it is going to get. I got relatively lucky with the back stuff, I got off with just lordosis of the lumbar spine.\n\nGood luck getting your rods. How were you diagnosed? How were you diagnosed? I was diagnosed with Marfans when I was 2. I saw a specialist since I was a kid for my scoliosis, and had regular scans of my back through out my life. Dural ectasia was always there, did not get bad until I had to surgery last year. My aorta had an aneurysm in my abdomen that needed surgery. To make sure the lack of blood flow to my back did not cause paralysis they had to do a spinal tap and drain the fluid from around my spinal cord before surgery. Diagnosed at birth.  I was 24.3\" long, with already pronounced features and Dupuytren's contractures.  Confirmed by genetic test in my early thirties.  You need seven signs on the Ghent nosology to get diagnosed, I am in the thirties on symptoms/features. I have been formally diagnosed with the marfans, when  I was in my early twenties.\n\nI meant how were you diagnosed with the dural ectasia?, I am trying to figure out what kind of a specialist I need to push to see.\n\nThe doc that made the initial diagnosis of marfans was a general medical diagnostition but not a geneticist and he basically said well you have marfans syndrome heres a printout of info from the internet good luck with life, bye.\n\nSo that left me managing it symptom by symptom with my GP and she is a great doctor but her understanding of the condition is as limited as mine. Oh hell, that is bad.  You need an MRI to diagnose it, possibly with contrast.  It is a long MRI.  I get a little claustrophobic on one that long.  You need a neurologist, a spinal specialist orthopedist, or a neurosurgeon to diagnose it properly.  If you have it, you will need to be monitored every so often to check its progression.  I think there is surgery if it gets too bad.\n\nIf I can help you in any way, please let me know. Well that sounds like it sucked.\n\nI was not diagnosed until my early twenties and even then it was just a quick exam and some tests and a well you have marfan symdrome bye.\n\nI got lucky in so many ways for me it has mainly been things joint instability, dislocation and no organ complications.\nThe only structural issue I have had with my back is lordosis of the lumbar spine and a few fractures that requiered a vertabral profussion and since then I have been having more and more issues that do not fit with any of the current diagnosed issues.\n\nSo I am trying to figure out what to push for my GP to do  and what specialist I need to see to get it diagnosed and managed. Thankyou that is exactly the info I need.\n\nI may have more questions in the future about other marfans stuff do you mind if I message them to you? Anything I can help with, please let me know.  I will always tell you anything I can so you can get the help you need. You are so sweet you almost made me cry.\n\nThankyou. I have a massive DE that has caused a condition called chiari malformation as well. Same as the others, back pain and headaches, I get really bad nausea from the chiari blocking my CSF too.\n\nFrom my understanding most marfs have some level of DE but it is so miniscule it is not noticeable and does not cause symptoms. I have one the size of a grapefruit and a second \"Tarlov cyst\" about 4cm.", "Having a hard time. Im 35 years old, when i was a teenager my doctors said i had some Marfan like features but was never diagnosed, I had the nuss procedure done on my chest at 16, and had a 2nd bar put in at 17. When i turned 18 I was dropped from my parents insurance, and went through my 20s uninsured never going to see a doctor. I worked my ass off and put myself into a better situation, living the american dream. A house in the suburbs 2 cars and 3 kids. Fast forward to this summer, i go see a doctor for the first time in about 15 years, asked him about having the bars removed. He gives me a referral to a surgeon, who then refers me to another surgeon at a pediatric hospital that specializes in the nuss procedure. everything is going as planned im set to have the bars taken out early december. I get sent to a cardiologist to get a green light for surgery, and this is where its gone off course. I get a echocardiogram done and my Aorta is a little over 4cm and i have a prolapsed mitral valve. I get in right away to a geneticist they tell me i in fact have marfans. I spent half of today at a hospital getting a MRI done, and reading posts from other people talking about family members dying during surgery to repair their heart. and im really struggling with this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have since started pushing everyone away from me. I watched father suffer so much to cancer. and dont want to put my kids through that. i feel like they would be better off if i just disappeared. Hi. First of all, let me just tell you that it is perfectly natural to feel a ton of anxiety about all this. You have been hit with a lot of information, and it is going to take time to process. But you will. The reality is today is no different from yesterday. You have always had Marfan Syndrome. The only real change is that now you know about it. And that puts you in a position of power. So as hard as this is to believe, this is a good thing knowing you have it.\n\nAs for the mortality issue. Yes, there is no shortage of stories about people having complications and issues. But what you do not really hear about is all the times it goes smoothly. And it usually does. People have Marfan surgeries all the time, and they usually go without a hitch. You may need surgery soon. You may not. You may never need it. If you have made it this far without a diagnosis, it stands to reason you have a more mild case. But you are in a great place. You are young, you have loved ones who can support you. Hold them close. Do not push them away. I would imagine they might think that is not fair to them. Give them a chance to be there for you. Life is good. Marfan syndrome does not change that. Hang in there. This is a rough time for sure - but trust us that it will pass. You need to take care of yourself now - get on heart meds, get an annual scan. Maybe at some point you will need your aorta fixed. That is not a major deal any more. I had mine done 25 years ago and it is been fine since. You will need to adjust your lifestyle but people with Marfan nowadays have normal lifespans. \n\nAs for the mitral valve, a huge percentage of the population has mitral valve prolapse. Nothing may ever come of it. It has not for me. \n\nYou will next need to have your kids tested as each had a 50/50 chance of getting it. They may not be affected in the same way as you. It sure is rough to receive this news. From what you told us I agree that you sound like a mild case. Marfan's is not like cancer at all, we might have to have some procedures done and take better care of ourselves than most people but you are not battling a deadly disease. Keep your family close, talk to them and test your kids, go to the Marfan foundation site and read a lot, there is also a lot of material on this Reddit. Everything will be okay and you can definitely be happy and live a long, healthy and fulfilling life having Marfan's.\n\nI hope you are able to feel better soon and continue happily living the American dream you earned! I think I understand what you mean when you say it is almost like cancer. Psychologically yes, physically no. Truth is if you choose not to get on top of your diagnosis, you will live a perfectly normal life and drop dead when your aorta finally gives out. It does not manifest outwardly like cancer does, so even though it can be psychologically scary (once you know about it), it is not like watching a cancer patient slowly lose the fight.\n\nNow that you know about it tho, you can start to be vigilant both for yourself and your kids. All the more you should not be shutting them out, cos maybe they can learn a thing or two from your experience, should they be diagnosed with marfan down the line.\n\nI am about your age, and I had my aortic valve+root replaced 11 years ago when I was 25. My mum is 62, she just suffered a dissection and underwent aortic valve replacement this spring. Yea, cos we had assumed it came from my dad, she was none the wiser and was not diagnosed until she felt that tearing sensation in her chest that landed her in the ER. She was more than prepared tho, cos she was there every step of my pre/post/op/recovery. I showed her the way, that even though it can be scary and painful, it is not impossible. She is slowed down a bit since her op, but apart from that she is still my same old mum.\n\nWhen it comes to marfan, knowledge is power. Once you wrap your head around this news, you can start to ready yourself for what is to come. What is to come may be really scary, but it is not a death sentence. Pm me anytime if you need, I am here. Thank you. Thank you Thanks we already began getting them tested.", "(22/M) 6 year obsession with Marfan Syndrome. Can anyone help me?  A couple things you could do. There is a test you can Order online from Color Genetics that test for mutations in the marfans gene (as well as vEDS and the worst of Loyes dietz) without a doctor referral. If you are in the states I think you can go through invitae and have a chat with their affiliated doctors who can order. The Color one was roughly 400 dollars canadian. Might give you piece of mind. I see you also did not mention hypermobile joints. Usually in the vast majority (if not all?) you will have hypermobility in their joints. Google image beighton score for a quick reference. If you do not have hypermobility it is even more unlikely.  Good luck! Thanks for the advice. I am in the U.K\u2014probably should have mentioned that. I was offered a test a few years back through my G.P surgery but this was prior to me meeting with the genetics specialists.\n\nIn terms of the hypermobility, I am pretty flexible, but not massively. I think I get 2/3 points on the Beighton test. It is best to find a doctor who will allow you to get tested. Whether you actually have MFS or not is not necessarily an important thing to know (unless you are going to have kids). The big question is whether you have aortic aneurysm. I would suggest that you do an echo cardiogram, and if everything is normal then it would mean whether you have MFS or not you essentially have nothing to worry about. I cannot say one way or the other- but I would say you are probably fine man. The test can be ordered from the uk I believe so yeah, if it is piece of mind you are after it is not a bad option."]
