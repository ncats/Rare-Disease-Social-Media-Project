(I am asking because I have bladder problems, where my bladder seems to keep \u2018attacking\u2019 itself).", "FMD Has anyone here done a cycle of the Fasting Mimicking Diet (FMD)? It was created by Dr. Victor Longo and has a lot of solid research. It seems like it could even give the immune system a reset. Someone was saying that their daughter was cured of allergy to dogs after doing it. Btw you can DIY it since we are all sensitive to certain foods. Never done that specific diet but I am wary of plans that try to get you to buy specific products anyway. For what it is worth, I have done keto and IF and felt great with both. Did not cure me of anything, but keto specifically removed a lot of my trigger foods. A diet will not fix a serious health problem.  Diet can benefit certain GI conditions. Simple diets lower the risk of triggers.  A simple diet can make you feel your best.  The illness is likely to persist. Keto is a fast mimicking diet. You do not need to buy a specialized product to reap benefits from removing carbs and trigger foods, reducing inflammation, aiding autophagy, calming hormones, etc. \n\nI have done keto and fasting off and on for years, but I have just started a strict low histamine, gluten free keto diet with intermittent fasting. Basically, I fast every other day or so. It is already helping with many of my issues, but I think my health problems cannot be cured - only managed. I was obsessed with the FMD and did it a ton - mainly because I was looking for an excuse to not eat without looking like an anorexic since it was \"DR backed and had food\". I do think Dr. Longo's research is great, but they have not had long term trials and only researched the biomarkers that prove their hypothesis, leaving some information wanting. While I did not have symptoms on it and felt great right after physically, it was only temporary and not a long term viable solution in terms of MCD symptoms. \n\nI think that someone with MCD should be wary. MCD can affect bone density on its own, and any sort of fasting beyond IF can as well. I think if you want to reap the benefits of fasting for symptoms without harm then you should look into IF, Keto (I am not a keto fan though), or low histamine diet. Majority of AIP, low histamine diets are lengthy because it takes some time for the body to adjust back to baseline without triggers -- a 5 day FMD is not going to give your system enough time to \"detox\".\n\nBut hey, this is just my personal experience and opinion. You do you! I am a firm believer that everyone should try anything once if they truly think it can help. :-)", "Is pears a HI fruit? I am finding conflicting information on whether I can eat pears when on a HI diet. Anyone know? Ripe pears are considered to be very low chemical. When I did a full, not just histamine, elimination diet they were the only fruit allowed. Peel them to make them even lower chemical. Thank you! Can I ask if you figured out all your triggers? I am still trying to figure it out and it is very frustrating. I think I have figured out the big triggers but I completely understand having trouble working them out. It is taken me many years to get to this point!\n\nThe full elimination diet with very deliberate food/chemical challenging was very helpful for me. I used the  rpah elimination diet common here in Australia. (The elimination diet part worked well but their challenges are a bit wrong because their research focus is on salcylates rather than histamines.) I got to a baseline where I felt great and anything strange stood out clearly... That was handy for finding how I was reacting differently to things like gluten, dairy, histamines but also my sensitivity to synthetic antioxidants and benzoates because when I broke with the diet the effect stood out.\n\nFinding triggers is the hardest part. It is easy to get frightened and eat nothing or back to a bad place health wise where it is hard to tell what effect things have because you feel crap and nothing stands out any more. Keep trying and you will keep learning eventually you will figure it out.", "Advice for surviving no antihistamine testing period? Hello all, I was hoping to get some advice on how to make it through a week and a half with no antihistamines. My allergist seems fairly certain this is the issue since I have GI issues, POTs EOE, and a plethora of food and env allergies. My primary care had me on multiple day time antihistamines and benedryl at night to help, but since my allergist took me off of them for the skin test and now blood work I have been miserable. Made it through the week leading up to the skin test but since then my symptoms have been horrible. Three days of swollen itchy arms, ear throat and stomach issues, and severe fatigue/blood pressure drops. I do not know how to make it through another week with no antihistamines. My diet is as bland as can be, to the point of not enough calories. I have an antacid and anti nausea pill I can take. Does anyone else happen to have any suggestions? Allergist said to just push through since treatment will be worth it, but I am desperate to find some relief. Even if there is no advice, thank you for listening and having a supportive community You should not have to be off meds for blood work, and skin testing is not necessary for a mast cell disorder diagnosis. I was put through it by other allergists too, but it is really not recommended. Thank you much, ill call the office and see if I misunderstood something. Skin testing was not for mast cells but to see where my allergies were at, which allergist said probably is not accurate if mast cell tests come back positive Same here. My doctor said it was not a good idea to go off of antihistamines.   You mentioned ear issues- what do you mean? I am definitely going to call in and check, I am feeling a bit overwhelmed with all the instructions haha. My ear issues are just pressure + a deep itch, nothing major just uncomfortable They told me the same thing, although for some reason they allowed me to be on hydroxyzine for a few days longer than the others. Testing period was absolutely the worst hell for me, and I know this is a horrible answer but the only way I could get through it was my doctor giving me Valium. I am the most natural, earthy human ever and I never want to use strong meds if I do not have to and had never used such a strong medication before, but the Valium allowed me to sleep through the hell for some hours. I got off of it as soon as I got back onto my meds, do not become reliant on it or things will only get worse! The first allergist I saw had me stop antihistamines for testing, but I got worse from doing that and going  back on antihistamines did not get me back to baseline. I will not stop antihistamines for testing anymore, I cannot risk getting any worse.", "CIRS // Mold Illness - anyone know where to discuss (not facebook)? Hi all,  \n\nLike the title says.  \nWould like a place to gather with others who have experience in this area.  \n\nDoes not really belong in MCAS or other subreddits.  The Lyme community is pretty familiar with this diagnosis. Try r/Lyme, but not r/LymeDisease. Cheers, good idea. People discuss mold anonymously in the ( It is moderated by a health care professional and you can post your question to multiple Incite illness groups simultaneously. r/ToxicMoldExposure? How did I miss this?  \nI did search, I promise :) I suggest you consult with a functional medicine practitioner like myself that treats CIRS and biotoxin illness from mold and Lyme. I inexpensively test and treat remotely on zoom. I also offer a free 20 minute consultation. I have a functional medicine team, thanks.  \nWas wanting to discuss it with others who suffer. I think I may have this as well. Am in the process of seeing an immunologist. How were you diagnosed?", "Doctors in Boston, MA? Looking for anyone with info on a good doctor in Boston. I know Brigham and Women\u2019s has a big allergy team, but do they have MCD specialists? I used to see Maria C. Castells (about 7 years ago, I have moved away since) , who is one of the top experts is mast cell diseases. It was a wait list to get in, I had to already be diagnosed, and each visit often involved a 1-4 hour wait because she was behind. BUT she was very, very good. Maybe see if there is someone else in her practice to start with and get on a waiting list? That is good to know. I am already diagnosed but I am completely uncontrolled. My doctor is at a loss of what else to do and I am looking for another opinion. Dr. Lauren Handelman was my doctor. She is great. Hi, I know you posed this endorsement of Dr. Castells a year ago, but I am looking for someone in Massachusetts too. I was just wondering, do you know if she only addresses and treats Mastocytosis or if she also treats MCAS? \n\nShe sounds ideal, since female doctors are my strong preference, but if she does not diagnose and treat MCAS I will look elsewhere! If you do not know, that is completely fine, but I figured asking someone who has seen and recommended her would be a good first step. :) Thanks so much! Hi - when I was seeing her she had a longer waiting list for MCAS (as in they did not get priority), but she absolutely diagnosis and treats it. Good luck!", "Do you experience MCD symptoms after orgasm? \n\n( Yes, but not while on stabilizers.\n\nI am also curious to whether there is a divide between the sexes. There have been claims of inflammatory mediators that are released during male ejaculation. Sometimes before being put on antihistamines and stabilizers, only once ever after starting on them.\n\nMale here, if it is relevant. What symptoms were you getting after O? My symptoms ranged from medium severe flares at best, up to anaphylaxis at worst.  No idea why I would be fine most times, and then other times be hit with full on ana.   But symptoms were along the lines of feeling of impending doom, skin flushing, severe diarrhea, migraine, brain fog, vertigo, sweating, chills, nausea, vomiting, difficulty breathing, difficulty staying conscious, itching.  All pretty typical anaphylaxis symptoms. Female, anaphylaxis \n\nMy reactions are specifically to orgasm. They have gotten better now that I have been on xolair a while. I am a woman, every orgasm I have gives me mast cell symptoms even while on all my medications. My MCAS is pretty bad though like going outside for two seconds with a mask on will also give me symptoms. I also have POTS that flares alongside my MCAS flares. \n\nEdit: also I am still having orgasms as the symptoms while on all my stabilizers are worth it lol. I just wait to have sex until late at night so I can just sleep afterwards. And I do only have sex 1-2 times a week and keep it to 2-3 orgasms. What ate the main symptoms you experience after orgasm? On stabilizers I get intense brain fog for the rest of the night and sometimes part of the next day, along with low blood pressure, flushing, mild diarrhea, trouble eating, trouble sleeping sometimes. If we had some long and intense sex with 10 orgasms I will be sick all the next day same symptoms but pretty bad. Oh and a headache ironically. \n\nOff of stabilizers... I only tried it once and never again. Same symptoms as above but in addition I could barely move once I got home and the adrenaline wore off, and I passed out more than fell asleep. When I woke up the next day I was practically paralyzed with how hard it was to move and everything hurt. I had my roommate bring me small snacks and barely did anything that day. I just did not date for five years until I had it under control.\n\nEdit: also if we use lube I start having reactions of burning and tingling where we use the lube after the adrenaline wears off. Still use lube sometimes too lol.\n\nAlso if I do oral on my male partner I experience a reaction to semen lol argh. Do not have any trouble with my female partner. Female here - My MCAS is not well controlled. I am on a H1 and stabilizer.\n\nI have a lot of sexual dysfunction and pain - I lack the ability to climax. I have never had difficulty reaching orgasms before I started having daily symptoms with MCAS. Sometimes my body does not respond, I hate it.\n\nSeveral months ago while not on a stabilizer I was having excess orgasms - similar to what the previous person mentioned, I would feel as if my body would could have many O\u2019s (like 5+ easily), not really an issue though.\n\nMy mood changes drastically after O, sometimes get pins and needles, and I flush now which is new. The sexual dysfunction is terrible though. All I know is I get restless leg every night almost and orgasm is the one sure way to shut out off.\n\nI am assuming I have low dopamine or seratonen. Not sure.", "Getting Tryptase bloodwork done \u2014anything I need to know? I am trying to make sure I go in at the right time and take the right precautions etc. I know it is super difficult to diagnose any MCD so is there anything I need to know before I go in for the bloodwork?\n\nSomething about going in while having a trigger right? which tryptase test for which type of mcd?\n\nif it is just a baseline test then no, u do not go in after a trigger.\n\nif they know it is not a clonal mc disorder but are considering idiopathic mcas, then it depends which test.  first test is baseline.  second test is about an hour after anaphylaxis starts.\n\nmcds can be quite easy to diagnose.  depends which mcd and on the case. I think baseline? At least that is what was discussed in our meeting.\nMy doc sent me a follow up email that says she is checking for total IgE and tryptase level Make sure you stop taking antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers at least 5 days before the test. What would a mast cell stabilizer be? (Also tysm for this info) If you are unsure, ask your doctor if you are taking any mast cell stabilizers. Quercetin is an example. Ok thank you!", "Cromolyn sodium questions I have been taking cromolyn for a week, one vial 4x/day. If I take one of my doses at the beginning of the meal because I forgot to take 30 mins before (ADHD problem), will that affect my overall absorption of the drug? I know it takes a month to start working due to its abysmal bioavailability, so will taking it with the meal still help me get to the point after a month where it starts helping? \n\nMy doctor was not great at helping me understand. He almost made it seem like taking a vial is not necessary if I skip a meal but then how will I build up the drug in my body? Also does taking more than 4 vials per day help it start working sooner?\n\nI hope this makes sense.\n\nTldr: should I bother taking a cromolyn vial if I forget to take it ahead of time before the meal or I skip a meal? &gt;He almost made it seem like taking a vial is not necessary if I skip a meal but then how will I build up the drug in my body? \n\nCromolyn does not work by building up in your body, it works by coming into direct contact with the mast cells in your digestive system.\n\n&gt;Also does taking more than 4 vials per day help it start working sooner?\n\nPossibly. I take 8x a day and have noticably better results than 4x. Doubling the concentration will double the exposure, but that does not necessarily mean you will get double the effect, individual responses may vary.\n\nRegarding taking it with meals, it will be less effective than taking it on an empty stomach but more effective than not taking it at all. There is a lot of talk here and on other forums about it binding to \"anything and everything\" in the gut, thereby rendering it completely ineffective with food, but I have yet to see anything from the manufacturer stating as much. I ran the idea by a pharmacist friend of mine who suggested I just take it with food. cromolyn does not build up in yr body.  if it did, u would not have to take it so often.  it only works for a short period.  (  if yr swallowing it, it is working in the gut.  if u do not need it in the next few hours, skipping it is not going to hurt u in the long run.  \n\ntaking more will not make it work sooner.  it might make it work better or it might not. Most people will tell you to absolutely not take it with food. However. This is third hand information, but my naturopath has a patient who sees a mast cell specialist, and the specialist told her it is fine to take it with food (she was having a lot of side effects). Because cromolyn \"covers\"/sticks to the mast cells it comes into contact with, food can inhibit that and make it less effective, however, it is still helpful. I think many people do this when they are first titrating up simply in order to tolerate the drug. I can personally attest to that as I started trying with food and did not feel any less symptomatic improvement. So in short, it is probably better to aim to take it a good 15-20 minutes before the meal, but if you forget once in a while do not stress about it.", "I am debilitated and these are my symptoms. Are these consistent with MCAS? I have POTS, ehlers danlos. I was managing them fine with propranolol to control my heart rate.  \n\n\nThen, earlier this year, extreme heart burn became a symptom. It has metaphorically crushed me. My throat is often sore, so there seems to be a GERD component. There is often stomach pain in the center of my abdomen, and acid blockers do help, but not enough. Sometimes I feel sensitive to the cold and almost feverish, coinciding with stomach pain. I have to eat a plain gastritis diet. Before I was able to eat spicy foods, now I dare not touch them!  \n\n\nI was in a bad environment for my mental health earlier this year as well. I was trapped with my abusive mother, and she would let me a see a doctor during the pandemic if I lived with her. I actually thought my abusive mother may have poisoned me somehow. Or perhaps the prostatitis / doxycycline that I was on weeks before the symptoms started somehow triggered it. I do not know.  \n\n\nBesides the POTS, ED, and heartburn, I also have a couple of other things that make me think that I might have MCAS. I seem to be sensitive to pollen and air pollution. There are supplements that I took that caused my BP to sky-rocket and almost give me a heart attack, including mastic gum, and low-dose of marijuana. However, I have never really noticed any skin flushing or rashes.  \n\n\nI moved into my own apartment, and now I finally have the means to address my health. However, I am still trying to be careful of where I go and what I have done because of the covid surge. What tests should I have done and who should I talk to? I live central New Jersey. I was thinking about getting and endoscopy done, but then I realized that I had not even had any blood work or other less evasive tests done... For me, the heartburn was from eating allergens. Start a food diary. Theyre not necessarily MCAS symptoms since most symptoms are vague and can be anything.  But you might as well see an immunologist to rule it out or get a diagnosis. MCAS is often comorbid with pots and EDs so if you are concerned, definitely talk with a doctor. Well said. Seconding this. I do not have a great resource to offer or a way to do this, but maybe you could make a start by finding an MCAS literate doctor that you can have a remote/telehealth appointment with. Having a doctor diagnose you is best and in these covid times, telehealth is a point of entry without risk to anything other than your wallet.\n\nI hope you find some relief and support soon. I also have EDS, but for me, the constant sore throat is a symptom of Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) which is also common alongside EDS and also common alongside mast cell disorders.  Probably because (  But do you ever get food stuck when you are eating, or trouble swallowing in general?  It is diagnosed by biopsies taken during endoscopies.  But it can cause heart burn, stomach pain, esophageal spasms,  (esophageal spasms feel like a heart attack but arent.) and other gastrointestinal symptoms as well.  Like MCAS, symptoms vary considerably from one person to another.  However symptoms tend to slowly get worse over years. It is possible since MCAD is a common comorbid condition of EDS, but it is also possible it is something else. You should see your doctor and start with basics like blood work and allergy testing must be done before a diagnosis of mcad can be considered. \n\nDo you ever notice welts on your skin, especially after a hot shower? Mine stay skin coloured, they do not get red. After I found out I had mcad I really took note of the things I thought were normal or just lived with naturally for a long time. Like the inside of my ears beings itchy and itchy in general, especially the tip of my nose. Or diarrhea. Being treated for mcad helped these and I could say I do not have ibs now.....and many more symptoms but my point is if you are suspicious take note of the things you always thought were your \u2018normal\u2019 weird quirks. You mind find they are indicators of an underlying condition. And like it was said keep a food/symptom journal. I do not think I have trouble swallowing. My throat is consistently sore but I always thought it was related to the acid. Perhaps it is not. I noticed there are bumps on the back of my throat and two small bumps above my tonscils. The bumps look like inflamation. The bumps seem to have occurred this year with the rest of my stomach symptoms.   \n\n\nFood does not get stuck but sometimes a supplement like vitamin C will get stuck My feet and hands swell a little bit and become red after a shower. There are also brighter red spots around my ankles from where the sock spandex touched my skin, after a hot shower. Really high strength ginger tablets have worked better for my indigestion than anything prescription", "Histamine plasma test My histamine plasma test returned 2.5.

For me, taking a shower before midday makes me nauseous for the rest of the day. The earlier the shower, the worst the effects. Easy problem to avoid, once it is identified \ud83d\ude0c But I always get weird looks from people when I say \"it is the morning, I cannot shower!\" I cant sleep past 8:30am or I feel sick all day. I have recently started reacting to my husband's shaving cream. Have to find an unscented one. The end of my hair (where it is cut) touching my neck or face often gives me hives. Eating and stress. If I am stressed for work or anything ...welp, I am not going to have a good day. \n\nI can only eat at night when I am not doing anything or else I feel like crap. \n\nIt is loads improved since Xolair ...but I still do not want to chance it as reactions tend to happen with pretty much anything. I react to shaving cream ... does not matter which one. I have to use Aveeno or some type of gentle soap. Going kayaking for too long when it is too hot. From what I deduce it is a combo of pressure from sitting, moisture, heat, and other allergens being high. All sap based odors and incense: not-yet-amber, frankincense, nag-champa. It is slow motion anaphylaxis. With small joint swelling that lasts about a day post. Dryer lint.... Regardless of the dryer or what is put in it. It is! Though, I suspect with them releasing the Hydrating Cream to Foam facial cleanser, they will slowly phase out the Foaming facial cleanser as sales take off with that product. \n\nI like both but like the cleaner scent of the Foaming facial cleanser. is not the foaming facial cleanser unscented? Yes. Both are... But even for unscented products, I can still get an hint of a scent. It could be just me as I think I have a higher perception of scents?", "Sodium Cromoglycate? Side effects and reations if your dosage was 200mg 4x daily? First timer here, nervous. Yeah, I use Nalcrom. I titrated up to 200mg 4x/day. Start slow with a very small amount and titrate up. Sometimes it can cause reactions or other symptoms if you go too fast. Also, dump the capsules and mix it into water - it works better that way. I do intend to use the water mixture approach,  I cannot swallow pills. I was prescribed 200mg though, not to treat allergies; to use the mast cell inhibiter. \n\nWhat reactions do you know? I am not using Nalcrom, only a compound course. Well, my point still stands, titrate up gradually, it is less jarring that way. You will be less likely to have adverse side effects.  I take the ampules. Start slowly. My doctor directed me to take 1 ampule in 4-6oz of water once a day for a week, before I added a 2nd ampule. So by week 4, I was taking 4 ampules 4 times a day. By week 8 I was taking the full dosage. I had mild flushing the first day. No problems since, and it is been a game changed for me since. The only difference between mast cell reactions and allergic reactions are the mechanism by which the mast cells are triggered. All mast cell disorders cause reactions, even if your reaction symptoms are not exactly what your average person thinks of as an allergic reaction. Cromolyn is almost exclusively used for mast cell disorders. \n\nWhen I started, (on vials) I put 50 mg in a water bottle that I nursed throughout the first couple of days. I felt like I was hit like a ton of bricks - aching all over. I also had temporarily worsened GERD symptoms. Others have itching, nausea, etc. On the extreme end, I have heard of some that went into anaphylaxis from it.", "Cromolyn AND zyrtec AND famotidine? Yikes! I am someone who gets all the side effects from most things. My doctor wants me to try all at once, starting straight with the therapeutic dose of cromolyn too. (We will titrate down if I get sick from it). \n\nCan anyone reassure me? I have no systemic symptoms (except maybe headaches), just GI mast cells. I started Cromolyn and Ketotifen at the same time. I asked the doctor if we should not start one at a time but he wanted me to just get started with both right away (I was having daily GI anaphylactic reactions). I had to start with just a drop of Cromolyn because it made me feel flu-like, but I started at full dose of the Ketotifen. Do not drive when you are starting Ketotifen! I am lucky I did not get in a wreck and kill someone. I was such a zombie for a few days. Now I also take famotidine twice daily as well. Good luck! i do not understand the diagnosis.  everyone has gi mast cells.  yr supposed to have mast cells in yr gastro tract.  what did the biopsy show that makes them think the gastro mast cells are the cause of yr symptoms?\n\nh1, h2 blocker and crom is a pretty standard cocktail for someone with allergic symptoms.  but if yr unusually sensitive to medicines, it does not make a lotta sense to try all 3 at once.  then if u have side fx, u will not know which is causing the problems.  i think u should trial them individually to see if u tolerate before taking them all at once. Cromolyn is the only reason I am alive and well. Not sure how severe your case is,, but to me the side effects of meds were nothing compared to the symptoms of mast cell disease. There is no perfect solutions, so try everything you can and stick with what works. Yeah, you are supposed to have a few, I have five times that many. I take cromolyn, famatodine and 2-3 xyzal every day. Do you get any side effects? No. Cromolyn has been the most impactful, though.", "Mast cell disorder? Doctors at a loss. I am 21 years old and a male. To give some background, I have had something histamine related going on for years. I developed chronic allergies towards the end of 2017. I had dealt with annual sinus infections in September for four years before that, and my old GP said it was likely due to allergies. I do not drink alcohol anymore, but I would have sudden-onset sneezing fits, throat irritation, postnasal drip, and a runny nose when I would get drunk back in 2020. My TSH was first out of range in May of 2018, and I started levothyroxine a couple months ago with a TSH of 4.57 and a free T4 of 1.1.\n\n\nI started Zyrtec around autumn of 2018. To be honest, I do not know how much of a benefit I received from it. I stopped taking it three weeks ago to see if it was somehow causing this.\n\n\nI probably noticed that something was off around 2018/2019. It got the point in 2018 where I could only breathe out of one nostril 99% of the time. My nasal cycle was very obvious, so it would switch nostrils every couple of hours or so. Around the beginning of 2019 or end of '18, I began to notice that my submandibular lymph nodes were swollen most of the time, and they seemed to get worse as my other allergy symptoms (post nasal drip, sinus congestion/pressure, etc.) got worse. My uvula was always swollen and stuck to one of my tonsils. I also had increasing brain fog in 2019, and I started stuttering and noticed a sharp decrease in the fluidity of my speech. \n\n\nAt the beginning of 2020, like around January, I would be laying in bed and occasionally get stabbing pains in one of my big toes for a few seconds, and it also usually happened when my allergy symptoms were acting up. \n\n\nThings went to hell around April of 2020. To try to make things short, I had a week of gastrointestinal distress, and it basically consisted of me running to the bathroom to have diarrhea every morning for a week or two. I felt better for a few days, and I then started to feel ill again. My allergies were acting up, my joints were sore, I had postnasal drip, my throat felt swollen, and I had a tingling sensation in my feet and hands. My entire abdominal wall felt inflamed, like there was a pressure. I would have transient feelings of a piece of glass or a thorn being in my toe. I had terrible brain fog, and I felt very cognitively slow and mentally weird.\n\n\nThe symptoms were bad for two weeks, but they never fully went away. Ever since then, I constantly feel cold, sick, fatigued, and I have flare-ups where the tingling in my feet, intensified allergy symptoms, joint soreness, etc. comes back. Oddly enough, I had a day a few weeks ago where I felt pretty much normal the entire day. I also had an episode a month ago where I felt normal for a few hours before going to sleep. The contrast was insane, but I have no idea what caused it.\n\n\nTo complicate things further, I first felt a pressure in the upper right side of my abdomen in January of this year after drinking alcohol. I drank alcohol again in July, and I woke up the next day with a burning sensation in that same spot where there the pressure previously was. I was extremely constipated, and I ended up shitting out a strand of (what was apparently) mucus that looked like a worm. Parasite test came back negative. Microbiologist said it did not look like any known worm, let alone one that infects humans. Ever since then, I shit out mucus that looks like something you would blow out of your nose on a regular basis. I have pale stools, floating stools, sulfur-smelling stools, and I cannot find a pattern that could indicate what is causing it.\n\n\nHas anyone else dealt with something like this? Doctors do not have a clue what is going on. My new GP is a nice lady and seems open to trying to figure out what is wrong, but I could still tell she was skeptical. Naturally, I had a flare-up of the symptoms yesterday a couple hours after my telehealth appointment with her, and my throat, below and to the right of the Adam's apple area, started to feel extremely swollen when I swallowed/talked/breathed. I also started having the feet tingling/cold feeling/malaise/brain fog again, along with a sudden feeling of fullness and pressure in my right ear that lasted for twenty minutes or so. The allergen forecasts show that allergen levels are low in my area, yet I feel absolutely horrendous. My mom also complains of having allergy symptoms year round, but she definitely has not said anything about experiencing anything like this. So there is a lot of overlap between your experience and mine. It sounds like you started off with histamine intolerance and then later ended up developing some type of mast cell disorder, maybe MCAS. I have POTS, some kind of mast cell disorder (still having testing done), I do not have EDS but I was borderline so my connective tissue is not the best.\n\nWhen I was at my sickest I really could not eat anything and was having anaphylactic reactions to all kinds of things all the time. You do not have to have full blown anaphylactic reactions to have MCAS and you also do not have to have high tryptase levels. \n\nI had very similar GI symptoms to you at my worst. Getting on stabilizing medications - mast cell stabilizer, H1 and H2 antihistamines made a huge difference and a mast cell savvy GI doctor is who helped me with that. Also eliminating the foods that caused any kind of symptoms through an elimination diet and adding them back in gradually. \n\nMy calprotectin level at that time was 650 - not good. I developed kind of a temporary type of colitis which at the time we did not know would be temporary. It was a bad time all around. Luckily as soon as I was on stabilizing medications and able to eat more things got back to normal incredibly quickly within a few months my calprotectin was down to 40. I have a lot of these symptoms. I have toxic mold poisoning because of this I have become pretty informed and these symptoms scream mold to me. Is there any way your home could have some water damage or mold? It can hide between floors and walls and be in the nicest homes. Happy to point you towards resources to see if it may feel right for you if you would like. Good luck o truly hope you find your cause. Mold toxicity tends to stump doctors that dont specialize in it. Does weird things to the human body, I honestly do not know anything about toxic mold, but I would not be surprised if there is some mold somewhere in my house. My parents said something about needing to change a filter for the ventilation system in our house, so there is definitely a lot of dust. \n\n\nAs I said in the post, I am not the only one in my family who has mysterious year round \"allergies\", but I am the only one who has these awful symptoms, which seems odd to me. Thanks for the information! My new GP actually prescribed me an H2 antagonist when I had my appointment with her yesterday. \n\n\nI do not think I have ever had an anaphylactic reactions to anything before, but my throat has been very swollen for the past twenty four hours or so. It was the same situation as when this started back in April of 2020. I was feeling weird, irritable, cold, etc., and then I noticed my throat, right at the base of my neck, felt tight on the right side. It feels like I got hit by a truck today, and my throat still feels swollen. Very weird. There are a lot of misconceptions about what a severe allergic reaction looks like. (\n\nI had all those symptoms as well. When they tried to put me on medications I reacted poorly to all of them because they were added in too quickly. I hope that does not happen to you but just be aware it can and even if it does, you will be able to take the medication eventually.\n\nA couple of over the counter medications that also helped me a lot with the head symptoms are - Nasalcrom (cromolyn sodium) nose spray and Zaditor (ketotifen) eye drops. The Nasalcrom dripped down to my throat so it seemed to help the weird throat feeling too. \n\nCromolyn is the most common mast cell stabilizer - you can also take it orally by prescription. Ketotifen is an H1 antihistamine and mast cell stabilizer which can also be taken orally (I take it) but it is not great for long-term oral use (nose spray is fine) because it is anti-cholinergic like benadryl. \n\nThat is great that your doctor is at least helpful, a lot of them cannot be bothered.\n\nEdit to add: When you have a reaction to something like you described in your original post where you had been normal for ages and then got really sick, if you have a mast cell disorder it is important to take rescue medication (benadryl/famotidine if you tolerate them) to right the ship otherwise the mast cells can just stay angry. Hey you do not have a lot of time to reply here, just spouting on voice text! but I have Mast cell and my symptoms where all exactly like yours. The sinus issue is almost identical, sometimes not being able to breathe through one nostril, Sinus pain and pressure, daily headaches. GIs on track as well except for the crazy stool and mucus. But I have had diarrhea every day for the last two years lol, going to the bathroom at least six times a day or so. I also have a severe small intestinal bacteria overgrowth (SIBO) that we found about a year and a half ago. \n\nBut my question is this.. did you ever have surgery on your sinuses? I finally went and saw an ENT (ear, nose and throat) doctor after a referral from my mast cell doctor, ended up taking a CAT scan found some polyps had a biopsy that came back benign, but we found severe chronic infection in all of my sinuses. Most importantly we found a deviated septum that was completely blocking off any drainage from that cavity. So from there the infection is an able to train or the cure cure itself. \n\nI am currently set to have surgery to help fix the deviated septum and to clear out the infection etc. I have heard miracle stories of people that had similar symptoms as us and then after surgery they are 1 million times better. So I am just wondering how far you went and what treatment you had for your sinus infection? Also did you ever break your nose? I did and I am wondering if that was the starting point to this gradual onset of bullshit the past 7 years or so. \n\nI am so so sorry, I know exactly how you feel and how hard it is. I really hope you find out what is causing this and start feeling better! Remember you are still so young, and have the best years ahead of you once you figure all this out! I promise ;) This is the first time I have heard someone say they have liver area pressure like I do. I am not diagnosed yet but have all the classic MCAS symptoms and was exposed to mold. I did not know if the liver problems were separate from everything else since I have not seen them mentioned in this context before. I lived with daily, very uncomfortable pressure in that area for years along with weird variation in stool color/texture and a lot of severe urgency. Taking bifido-only probiotics seems to be helping. Yeah, I have not seen too many people with pain in the same area. I actually had my liver enzymes checked, and they came back fine. In my case, I do not think it is my liver. I chewed a piece of nicotine gum on an empty stomach back in May, which was before I started shitting out mucus constantly, and that same spot in my stomach immediately started burning in that exact spot, so I am pretty sure it is something to do with my small intestine. It hurts if I bend down/sit a certain way too, almost like a muscle tearing. No hernia, though. I had multiple doctors pressing all over my stomach and an abdominal CT. They did not find anything. Thanks for the kind words. \n\n\nI actually have not had surgery on my sinuses. I saw an ENT about the allergy symptoms back in 2018, and they did not really have much to say, just that I probably need my tonsils out, and I apparently have \"adenoid tissue growth\" that he wanted to biopsy. \n\n\nAs far as my sinus infections went, I think they gave me azithromycin the first couple of years when I was having them annually, but they stopped giving them to me since they began thinking it was allergy related since it was always at the same time of year.\n\n\nAside from the progressively worsening allergy issues and fatigue, I did not really have any health problems before 2020, tbh. Never broke a bone/my nose, had not been to the ER, no stomach issues, nothing. That is been me alot of my life, the one who had year round allergies. If there is mold in a home, then the dust would be filled with mold spores. I have lived in noticeably water damaged homes most of my life and thankfully made the connections out of desperation to save my life. Mold toxicity can get really bad. 25% of the population has something called the HLA-DR gene mutation. This means that these people have a genetic susceptibility to things like, MCS &amp; MCAS due to this gene preventing the proper detoxification of mold from the human body,  it means it begins to add up and grow within the body and causes the immune system to overreact to everything. Regular people's bodies can sense and detox mold and prevent serious health problems. Some people can truly live in mold and be fine which can make one feel kind of crazy when they sre the one having \"allergies\" This gene prevents that. If you ever feel like your being \"poisoned\" or feel drunk or high when your not or wake up feeling like your hungover I would highly consider doing a mold test on your body or home - can show you where to go just ask.\n       on Instagram have all been really helpful with helping me figure it all out. Right side pain, mucus poop (it is not mucus, it is fat that your body is not processing), and pale stools are all tell tale signs of gallbladder issues. I would get an ultrasound to see if you have gallstones - you might need to have it removed. There very well may be a gallbladder issue going on as well, but I have had to, uh, investigate the mucus that comes out since it often looks like a worm, and it is identical to snot. I have certainly had oily-looking stools, though, but nothing like the ones I have seen where it looks like someone poured oil into the toilet. I have never had oily stools really, but the worm-like/identical to snot is EXACTLY how mine was. I freaked out and went to the doctor and they said that, due to the gallbladder problems, my body was not digesting stuff correctly and it was actually fat that was not being digested. It is worth looking into, I would say. Other than that, I really hope you find answers soon! Thank you. :) Yeah of course! You know the only way they can figure out how bad the infection is, is to take a CT scan to view/ locate the infection in your sinuses. Idk if it works it to you (insurance?/$) but you should get a referral from the ENT for the scan. Then you can completely rule it out. Your symptoms are so so liar to mine that I would hate to neglect that idea or aspect and lose more time, and life really. \n\nGood luck friend! I have the exact same issues with sinus pressure, allergic reactions and recently upper abdomen pain that caused weird stools. I am not sure about mold, but I did have Covid last March which they say viruses can trigger MCAS. I have been feeling normal with the exeption of a few reactions here and there. This month is when I suddenly started to have more reactions, GI symptoms and sinus pressure (dry siniuses) did you find out anything? I am trying to get this treated so that it can be managed to not become permanent. I am going to get some NasalCrom, funny that you said that works because its what I ordered on Amazon yesterday. I hope you found something out and that I do soon!", "Need Help finding care ( Chicago) Can someone help? I had Covid, and was fine for 11 months but woke up a week ago to pressure heaches and now my pelvic area and right side/upper ribcage are suddenly painfully inflamed. I was feeling mostly normal the last 11 months with the exeption of burning rashes/flushing occasionally, occasional nausea, etc. This came on suddenly and I also have pain up my arm and bone pain. I am going to urgent care tomorrow but problem is I dont know where to srart or what to say since the medical community seems to be in the dark about MCAS. How do get myself out of this flare? After reading up on MCAS causing Covid I feel like this is definitely what I am experiencing, but Benedryl hasnt been any relief, does anyone have doctor referrals in Chicagoland?\n\n**1ReplyShareSaveEdit** I have read something about COVID being similar to Lyme disease in terms of the long term symptoms and effects, you could consider finding a functional medicine doctor or a naturopath for treatment Here are some frequently mentioned names from the Facebook mast cell groups:\n\nDr. Bilimoria, Allergist with Glen Allergy, Glenview \n\nVivian Chou, Allergy and Immunology, Advocate Health Care, Evanston/Chicago (some people said she was hard to get ahold of after initial consult).\n\nDr. Marla Barkoff, Integrative Endocrinology, Chicago (out-of-network for all insurers. I get the sense this route is expensive) Have also had luck with Dr. Vivian Chou, she is been great for me!  Unfortunately, the allergist I have seen for a while, Dr. Mary Tobin at Rush retired, or else I would have recommended her. She is the one who originally gave me my diagnosis. &amp;#x200B;\n\nMy apologies,  everyone, I was typing that last night with extreme BRAIN FOG. I meant to type COVID causing MCAS. I edited it above, but orginally I typed MCAS causing Covid, smh. \n\n ( I have heard Lyme and other chemicals, viruses and even breast implants can trigger it ).\n\nI unfortunately had Covid way before mask mandates and way before the government was being honest about what we were dealing with so I was still working my airport job around crowds and travelers. On the first night of the lockdowns I coughed and then thought...it cant be that. I say that to say if I knew more at the time, I would not have probably caught Covid, once I was more aware of what we were actually dealing with, I never left the house. I havent returned to work and I order groceries in, and am very strict about good quality masks, I also never have company.\n\nMy initial illness was mild, with the exception of a wicked cough. I recovered quickly with just Tylenol and a multivitamin ( there were no treatments then and no testing but I was diagnosed Covid by the doctor. I never had a fever or lost sense of taste or smell.\n\nI recovered within 2 weeks easily and thought I saw the last of Covid. My life returned to normal except for I noticed I would get chest rashes that burned here and there. Then I started having allergic type reactions on my hands, vasidolation, demogratophia, and occasional hives on my stomach. I noticed only coconut oil works for my hands, anything else they break out into hives, turn red and my veins swell. I thought if this was all I was dealing with Post- Covid, I was fine.\n\nSome of the other Long Haulers had it worse ( EXTREME body aches, fatigue, POTS, and multisystem inflammatory syndrome where their organs are inflammed) but mostly I just noticed rashes, flushing, hives and my heart/pulse beating after I ate also runny nose after I eat that does not bother me too much. This continued for a while, but as I said the Benedryl always quickly cleared up my rashes or flushing, I never noticed heart beating or nausea were related til later. I was drinking and eating just fine around Christmas until one day I cooked nightshades and began to cough and couldnt breathe well. I took nightshades out of my diet. Celebrated NYE like anyone else, but the champagne was giving me nausea, but suprisingly my hangover wasnt too bad and I was able to walk long distances, so no malaise.\n\nI did notice I get mildly lightheaded if I stand quickly but I do not think I have many POTS symptoms.\n\nFast forward to January 27th, month 11 post Covid...the whole day I started having terrible brain fog followed by pressure headaches with sinus type pressure. My nose became increasingly strong, I could smell everything. Everyday I woke up the headaches got worse, and the pressure was never ending. I started reading up on MCAS which I had heard of in the Long Hauler support groups and saw several parallels. If you check out the you tube page , RUN- DMC, you will see many videos that make a correlation between Covid and MCAS, they speak to MCAS specialists that are treating long covid patients. ( There is even a FB group dedicated to Covid and MCAS- ( (MCAS &amp; Covid-19)\n\nI noticed that my symptoms I have been having for several months COULD be MCAS, and then yesterday I woke up with right side upper abdomen pain, right arm pain, bone pain and swelling around my pelvis, I had the headache full blast. I started having a meltdown and thought I would ask here for answers.\n\nI have terrible insomnia post Covid and so I couldnt get to bed. I also get worse feeling at night and have adrenaline shocks that wake me out of sleep. Last night I got better after taking Benedryl ( it did end up helping, took a while to kick in) and using an ice pack on my swelling and head.\n\nToday, my body is still achey in the places from yesterday but I feel better and have not taken any antihistamines today ( I hope this flare up of whatever is over, is over since this is day 21). My Quercertin supplement just arrived and Nasal Crom should come tomorrow although my sinuses also feel better.\n\nI was looking for help because if MCAS IS what I have now I would like to get it treated right away and not be self treating ( although I may start Zyrtec and Pepcid H1/H2 in the meantime.) My GP doesnt seem to believe in Long Covid and is not familiar with MCAS and just told me my headaches were due to the weather change. I think hes somewhat right about weather change as it is bitterly cold in the midwest and that overall cant help body function but I dont think all of this is due to weather. I have never had allergies or flushing in my life until now but lately I have been eating low histamine and juicing and havent had any rashes in a few days.\n\nI probably need a specialist since my GP is not too helpful. I was asking here if anyone knows of a functional doctor or allergist familiar with the condition that I could follow up with ( I live in Chicago).\n\nBecause of Covid longhaulers coming into the picture, MCAS will probably start being researched more, and more research and funding hopefully means more treatments and understanding for everyone here. Thankyou for your help! Sorry for the long winded reply.\n\n\\- Roo Thankyou for your response, I will look into these doctors. I appreciate the response! Check out my reply above. Specialists in the field are finding correlations in MCAS and Long Covid.\n\n( \n\n( Yes long covid, MCAS, Lyme, all have correlations", "urticaria pigmentosa Anyone else go through periods where they feel like they have a fever/ fatigue but have a slightly lower temperature? Like 94-97 degrees Fahrenheit. Kind of like a reverse fever then goes away in a few days. Curious if this is due to my mass cell or something else. Thx! Varying temperatures measured in the ear can be a sign of wax buildup in the ear. I do temp in mouth. Yes!! I am always so confused when I feel crummier than usual to the point where I am prompted to take my temperature and it turns out being below average, typically in the mid 96-low 97 range. I have not officially been diagnosed with MCAS but it is suspected, not sure if it is that or the dysautonomia that causes it, but I have always been curious. Yep!! I call it a \u201creverse fever\u201d. Tylenol usually helps! Yes! For years I thought my thermometer did not work on me, but worked on th rest of the family. I kept replacing them until I realized it was just me. The only times I would take my temp, I was feeling awful, and hot, but I would get a hypothermia reading (I want to say I got several 95.3, but cannot quite remember). I do not even bother with taking my temp the last decade. The doctors only care about high temperatures, even though I am pretty sure those low temps are probably very important, especially going into hypothermia territory. \n\nNot to high jack the post, but has anyone's doctor responded to the low temperatures? Yes!  OMG, I have had this for some time.  I do not have an official mast cell disease diagnosis but am afraid that is what I have.\n\nI have had this 'reverse fever' multiple times, about every month or two.  I feel like I have a bad fever but it is always 97 when I take my temp (oral).  \n\nHas anyone mentioned it to a doctor and what did they say?  Google is useless.", "Intermittent triggers and dry skin causing hives? Hey you all, not dx'd but I am curious about my hives in the context of my other issues. Between my weird (and somewhat worsening) hive reactions to weather, even as my environmental allergies have gone down (not food thank God), and my bendiness/orthostatic intolerance/joint pain (pursuing a definitive evaluation for HSD/hEDS), I am wondering if weird hives could fit in with some sort of mast cell issue, or if these are just \"fuck if we know what causes it\" hives. \n\nRight now it is 75F in my apartment, with 27%RH. I got some hives on my pinky. Since it is blessedly warm, I do not think this is my usual cold weather hives (altho pls tell that to my feet lmao), and I was wondering if you all typically got hive reactions with dry skin? It is the only thing I can think of. For most other allergies the right side of my eye is the 'sentinel' for allergies - makeup (altho, could be expired tbh), cat dander, the position of the planets, etc. Over the weekend my RH eye area started getting really itchy and watery (idk abt hives) but putting shea butter (with fragrance!), some rosehip oil I use for dry skin and another lighter face oil made the allergy sensation go away. I definitely did not layer those oils right, but it really did help. So is it possible that dry skin makes my skin produce histamines? Also, anyone else able to hold a cold soda can for a minute straight with no hives, but being outside in 20F weather for like two minutes causes hives? Wtf. Same thing with pressure. I can wear a FitBit every day with no issue, but a single hair tie that is too tight creates hives. And i can go hiking in leggings without issue, but backpacking in the same leggings on a hot day (wearing a silk mesh shirt to try to vent heat! Which I did not, I also have wack-ass thermoregulation issues) gives me full-body hives for a week. None of that makes any sense!! Why are my triggers so inconsistent? Not diagnosed but I do have issues with heat, cold and dryness. I have gotten hives from all of them. Me too! I am wondering if it is worth making the argument to my allergist about mast cell stuff, or if this is just the weird cousin of eczema.", "Taking cromolyn WITH food I know that every single source out there says to take it 15-30 mins before food. \n\nHowever, I know someone who said their mast cell specialist says it does not matter if you take it with food. I personally tried switching to taking it with food and got less side effects, and generally felt like it was still working well. Taking it before food seems to give me body aches. That said, I am still fairly new to the med. I was at my target dose for a couple weeks and still experiencing side effects when I switched over. \n\nIf anyone has any sources on taking it with food, I would love to read some literature about it. Thus far I have not been able to find anything so I am wondering if this is the case of a doctor not really reading in depth about a drug...that said they are supposed to be a specialist. I was listening to the mast cell episode of The Smartest Doctor in the Room, and the doctor being interviewed said that the reason to take it before food was for (and only for) better absorption. Hmm, interesting. Thanks for sharing. But I suppose better absorption would mean (ideally) the medication working more effectively because there is more medication in the system...right?\n\nI suppose maybe if you are pretty sensitive to it, as I seem to be, perhaps it not being as well absorbed may reduce efficacy but also side effects because you are not taking as much.\n\nedit: just thinking about this more. It is interesting because they say CS in general has poor absorption, but since it mainly works in the GI tract, perhaps absorption is not the main goal anyway? if it functions to inhibit reactions within the GI tract then maybe that is what matters. I think your interpretation makes sense, based on what I have learned. But please do not trust a clueless internet stranger. BTW, that episode of the podcast was super engaging, if you want a listen! lol do not worry, I was just asking to see if other's had a similar experience and not because I would make my decision based off it. My ND suggested it based off a mast cell specialist and my integrative doc supported it, and it is been working. I will take a listen to the podcast, thanks for the recommendation! You do not 'absorb' cromolyn. It coats your gut lining to stop triggers aggravating your gut lining.  \n\nCromolyn lowers stomach acid by ~40%  \n\nMake sure your symptoms are not low stomach acid symptoms.  \nCromolyn can make things worse if it is crippling your digestion, causing undigested food to get into your intestines and wreaking havoc.", "Can compounding meds help ? Hi  I recently started to have severe reactions to all meds i took before . It started after i tried ketotifen for 2 days ( it gave me severe RLS). I cant take my sleeping pills, i react, i cant take benzos, i react, i cant take gabapentin, i react, i even react to melatonin.   \nMost of those have lactose in them, but melatonin - gelatin.   \nThe question is if i react to merely everything, how would compounding pharmacy help with that?  Surely they need some kind of medium with what mix those substances. Absolutely. My wife gets several of her medications compounded because of reactions she is had to regularly manufactured prescriptions.\n\nYou can request that certain mixers not be used. I *think* we get it to where there are no additives, but I could be wrong on that. I would contact your local compounding pharmacy and just ask them what they can do. 100000000000%. Only reason I am stable now. I intro things really gradually starting with skin contact and working up to a full dose - I have detailed this pretty thoroughly in a lot of my other comments if you want to know more about that. I would get rashes on skin contact with OTC meds when I was unstable. My doctor prescribed everything without fillers, even Benadryl, because I reacted to the dye free OTC of that as well. Was able to one by one introduce all the stabilizing and rescue medications without fillers and it made a huge difference. Hope you start feeling better soon! I have been pretty stable the last 6 months and can take some OTCs now that I used to react to. Yes. If you have corn, wheat, or lactose...it will help. it turns out i am started reacting to everything not just lactose :( I have been there. A year ago I was pretty much living in a bubble. Make sure you have a doc that really understands mast cell disorders. They can help you navigate this. yea, i am starting to lose hope that there is one in my country.  \nIs there i can test for whcih is not very expensive? So are you positing that the RLS was caused by the fillers in the ketotifen or the ketoifen itself, given it is antihistamine properties?", "How does everyone feel about this?  Maybe try getting the other vaccine since there is two different but similar versions? But honestly if you have never had issues with other vaccines, why would you with this? I am guessing it is not that weird for a small percentage of people to have allergic reactions, and the media is just publicizing it because they know people will read about it this time since it is a coronavirus vaccine. Might as well prepare and take extra meds before the vaccine though. Scarey. Having said that I have gotten other vaccines without problems. I usually make sure there are no preservatives in the shot and I am good.", "Reacting to probiotics I have taken probiotics for over 10 years without problems. They always have helped my allergies.I have been taking probiotics that do not promote histamine release. I ran out and was off of them for maybe 6 days and now when I take them they cause extreme anxiety. Has anyone else ever developed a sudden intolerance to probiotics? I personally cannot take them I have tired, but your body just might need to get used to them again. The anxiety was pretty intense. I think I am just going to have to give up on them for now. I used to take a lot of probiotics, but when I developed MCAS I had to stop. A doc gave me s. boulardii and that seems to be OK.  I do not take it all the time though. It may be worth a try. I have mcas too. Thanks for the info, I will look into that. Most probiotics are triggers for mast cell. There is only a small number of types that are ok. I havent wrotten them down but I am sure there is info online.

(image)  So for the last few months during flares I have also been getting these bloody red spots appear on my skin. Yes they appear that way not due to me disturbing them. I am attaching some of the most recent ones here. I have had bigger spots appear before too, that look almost like sores.\n\nEdit : What arse hole downvoted my post? I am getting those on my neck and shoulders, not sure what they are though. Let us hope we both figure it out! Do they go away? Yes but sometimes not completely Urticaria pigmentosa? They do not use this term anymore. maculopapular cutaneous lesions are the proper term now. \n\nBefore you say \"but they are not brown\" or \"they do not itch\" or \"they do not produce a dariers sign\" or they are not everywhere ...well yeah, early stages of urticaria pigmentosa do not do this and there are technically different manifestations of UP.\n\nI have several spots like this. They sometimes go away ...but not always. I have spots that have been there for a couple of years and was initially misdiagnosed because they are not sporadic enough to be mast cell related.\n\nA biopsy would tell you for sure though. \n\n...the likelihood of it being mast cells though is high if they are random spots that appear and if you have a mast cell disorder.

She has MCAS, &amp; has had to go through chemo/Rituxan treatments for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. She is been told she has thrombocytopenia too.

Have you ever had you IG levels checked?\nI wound suggest getting blood work on them. \nYou have to ask for this test, Dr will not doing them just normally. This can let you and your Dr know if there is anything under lying going on. Mine do often resemble petechia. Altho in this case low platelets would not be to blame as my full blood counts are usually normal. One of my theories is that possibly inflammation is leading capillaries to burst. No I have not had my IG levels checked. Can these spots signify poor immunity? I do not have this type of cream but I do have a cream with some steroid in it, perhaps I can ask my doc if it is safe to use on these They can indicate a couple different autoimmune diseases. They pics are blurry, do you get them all over your body? \nHave someone take a pic of your back. \n\nHave your ig leaves check can tell if your body is trying to fight something off? Thank you for the info. I only knew about these in relation to mastocytosis, whereas I have MCAS. Altho I do not see an exact resemblance between the link photos and my spots, it is definitely something looking into further. Which autoimmune are the associated with?\n\nThey can occur on much of my body but most strongly on my lower legs. The outbreak has worsened on my legs since I took that photo. I only have one red spot on my back right now. Petechiae is what you want to look up \nIf you all ready have mcas, you could something else going on also.\n\n This is what my leg looks like now\n\n\n\n\n\nMy camera is a bit basic.\n\nOk petitchae yes I have heard of them. I know they can sometimes happen with connective tissue disease (which I have also) but the fact that they occur alongside my MCAS flares makes me suspicious that it is immune related in some way. So IG testing could be a good place to start. Have you ruled out liver spots or fungus spots? \n\nI would say you need to get blood work to rule out anything internally. I have a few permanent brown liver spots but I do not think these are it. Because they are red rather than brown and they appear suddenly but mostly fade away a few days later. Also accompanied by other symptoms such as MCAS flares, and malaise symptoms, aching etc.\n\nRe fungus, have not ruled it out but I get fungal skin infections as well so I am pretty clued into what that looks like and the spots are just completely different.

So I get IBS/bad reactions to many fibers and starches as they hit my colon (3-4hr after eating).  \nThis can be brain fog, fatigue, even overstimulation.  \n\nBut the MCC is different. The symptoms are different - and they are actually the exact same cognitive symptoms as I get from things that are mast cell triggers for me!  \n\nThey feel a lot more toxic. I get a 'toxic' head, it kind of feels like my brain is scrambled and short circuiting physically - like a sensation on the top of my head.  \nI start to show signs of toxic load - for example I find my hand reaching for my face to scratch/pick at blemishes (when I get toxified this happens)  \nI find myself staring off into the distance, brain stuck.  \nMy eyes start to not bother focusing and I kind of go cross-eyed and have to focus on purpose.  \nI notice my jaw is clenching, and my mouth is sucking creating negative pressure in my mouth.  \nMy breathing goes shallow.  \n\nHow can this be?  \nClearly MCC itself is not a MCAS trigger for me, or I would get a reaction immediately on ingesting.  \nCould it be that whatever the gut bacteria is breaking the MCC down into is a mast cell trigger for me?  \n\nIs this a known thing, to have MCAS triggers to food once it reaches the colon?  \nOr MCAS triggers to fermentation metabolites as bacteria break down otherwise benign food?  \nAny experiences/thoughts much appreciated.  \n\nCheers! I hardly have immidiate reactions at all. Most of the triggers I am exposed to these days take at least 6 hours and at the most 4-5 days. My MCAS develloped from IBS (overactive mast cells in the GI tract) and since the Fodmap diet improved my symptoms it seems clear its connected to the microbiome processing of fibers. Fiber is normally considered healthy since your microbiome should process it into healthy short chain fatty acids that you can absorb through your colon. However, if you have a dysbiosis in your microbiome, they might instead produce toxins. I have not heard specifically of triggers to food on reaching the colon. I would argue the MCC or more likely the contents of whatever you are taking could still be an MCAS trigger for you, it is designed not to break down until it reaches the colon, so the contents of the capsule are not destroyed by stomach acid. There may be another filler/inactive ingredient in it which you are reacting to when it is released. You might find a spore based supplement is better as it does not need the MCC? I found this site helpful \n\n\nHope you work it out! Thanks for the reply and info.  \n\nI am not really here to prove that it is or is not the MCC that is doing it - you just have to trust that I am intelligent enough to have checked your theories first and ruled out any other options.  \n\nI react the same to *all* of my supplements and medications regardless of what they are if they have MCC in them.  \nThe ones without MCC I do not get the reaction.  \n\nThe capsule absolutely breaks down in stomach acid. They are not delayed release capsules.  \nThey are not even all capsules - some of them are tablets.  \nI have also been taking the supplements without the capsule and get the same result.  \n\nIt is the MCC.  \n\nI am unsure what you mean about taking a spore based supplement, but I have already ordered pure powder versions of most of my supplements.    \n(EDIT: Oh I see what happened - the title says *postbiotics* not probiotics. This means the resulting chemicals that are released by gut bacteria when they feed on the MCC)  \n\nHowever my prescription medications also have MCC in them, including my antidepressant which I cannot stop. Thanks that is useful info.  \n\nI do have dysbiosis but I do not get bad reactions from regular fiber or resistant starch - not MCAS ones anyway.  \n\nIt is only the MCC that is doing it - but there is likely a specific bacteria that feeds on it. Could even be fungal. I think it quite common to only react to certain fibers (or other fermentable carbohydrates). I react to oligo-fructose (fructans/inuline) but have no problem eating fibrous and starchy foods without this type. That Is why you can find all sorts of tables of FODMAPs and the foods that contain them. What do you mean by react though?  \nI mean, I totally get different fibers/starches causing different *gut* symptoms and even neurological ones - but if any of those were MCAS triggers I would expect them to trigger quite soon after ingestion.  \n\nIt is the triggering after they hit the colon that I am talking about - which makes me suspect it is a downstream metabolite not the substance itself.  \nIs that what you mean, except for different fibers? i have the same problem. triggers quickly and more toxic feeling. i read one of the dr.afrin\u2019s interview, he says mcc is a big trigger for some people. i dont know the mechanicsm behind it. i am usually interested in the reasons but i am so tired of this crap, i just do what works and dont do what does not work What do you mean triggers quickly?  \nLike, soon after ingestion? Hi I saw your post-biotics thread. I was wondering how long between finishing antibiotics and when you had the mast cell activation syndrome? I have heard antibiotics, mold, lyme or tick bites could be the trigger for some Hi,  \n\nMine did not start after antibiotics. Well, at least not that I know of.  \nI did have antibiotics in the past though.  \n\nIt is highly related to gut health and dysbiosis though for me.  \n\nWhat does postbiotics have to do with antibiotics?", "Can we talk about eating.... So my GP finally referred me to an Allergist and we could only have a telephone consultation (because Covid) and he agreed that my symptoms and medical history sound like MCAS but we cannot do any formal testing until mid July at the earliest.   Anyway he still prescribed me Ketotifen, Fexofenidine and Famotidine, I also purchased some Quercetin online which i have been taking daily before meals.  The good news is i am actually feeling much better and some of my most worrying symptoms like throat swelling seem to be fairly under control.  My main issue is i literally cannot eat anything other than Cabbage and Rice or Huel without getting a strong reaction!  For the past 5 weeks Ive been only having one meal per day with an apple as a snack and a (nasty) Huel shake.  Ive tried slowly adding foods but i just react to everything i try to add, even plain simple veg like Carrots or Green Beans, dry Cornflakes were not ok either.  I have got a list of recommended \u201clow histamine\u201d foods but i still react to stuff that is supposed to be low histamine.\n\nSeeing as i wont be able to have any tests of any kind for quite some time does anyone have any suggestions for things i might be able to eat? Im so miserable just eating cabbage every single day.  Is Cabbage and Huel my life now? Thank you! You could try chicken or turkey, just try to get it as fresh as possible meaning either from the farm or frozen soon after being butchered. I am currently only eating chicken and steamed cauliflower with rosemary and sage for taste avoid iodinized salt, i use Himalayan pink salt. Your experience sounds very, very similar to mine. Mind you, cabbage *is* a trigger for me and my symptoms are milder than yours.\n\nPersonally, I have found the following to be tolerable: salt, sugar, cheerios, onion, rice, chicken, crimini mushrooms, pasta, zucchini, squash, sweet potato, potatoes and fries (depending on the oil), corn, and peas.\n\nIn addition, the following do not tend to provoke strong reactions for me: almond milk, egg, and plain french bread.\n\nA few things to bear in mind:\n\n1. If you do not already have them, get two EpiPens to have on hand before doing new food challenges.\n2. Your sensitivities will definitely be different and it took me years to get my list down. pat. It still shifts over time.\n3. People often have issues with raw vegetables. If you are reacting to them raw, consider cooking them. I have absolutely *hated* cooking throughout my whole life and relied exclusively on restaurants. But then I discovered Instant Pots and how they can take raw ingredients in and basically make a meal on their own quite quickly.\n4. This may be wishful thinking on my part, but this diagnosis is quite new and the science seems to be evolving rapidly. I do expect diagnosis and treatments to get better over the coming years, so I am hopeful.\n\nHTH! I am curious...react how?  For comparison's sake...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I say I react I normally mean I will have to go to the bathroom and be embarrassed if I am not alone.  Maybe that will mean run to bathroom.  Honestly I think I am happiest when I lose all these \"bad\" foods quickly.  When I prevent that reaction (and elimination of an allergen) is when...\n\nOr it might mean the next day I have joint pain in my feet area, and generally hurt and am angry.  And that joint pain can hang around for a while (week plus).  I might have migraines, or other joints hurt.  Or my seasonal allergies get worse (sneeze, itchy nose/eyes, watery eyes, throat itches).\n\nI have also had my mouth get hot, and get a sudden sweat all over my body.  Sometimes with a headache (sharp or dull), and/or nausea.  Nausea is almost ever present, but there are times when things get more front and center so to speak.\n\nAnd I am probably ignoring simple stuff like \"guts gurgle like crazy after I eat this\". I get an itchy throat and nausea within about 10 mins of eating the wrong stuff and then its like oh gosh here we goooo Thanks so much! You have given me lots of food for thought (pun intended lol)\n\nI have been cooking everything but maybe i will get an instant pot because even just changing the way i cook the things i can eat might add some slight variety. Wonder if you can find a lab to draw the blood, then you could get the results now (and review them remotely through telemedicine still).  I know the little clinics send you out to get stuff like this done.\n\nI have not pushed on this stuff as much as I could, and should, have.  If it matters to you, and you can get the ball rolling...I would do it. Thanks for this.  I did once try to eat some chicken thighs i bought from a local butcher and it didnt go well, i think that is about as fresh as i could hope to get because no farms nearby.  I did some googling for freshly frozen meat delivery but came back blank. Sometimes chain stores like target will carry frozen chicken, I have found this to be fresher than the unfrozen chicken. But be careful they didnt inject it with cooked chicken broth or other potentially triggering ingredients. The stuff I get at target is just chicken water and kosher salt I will definitely have a look in to this.  I did have a look at home allergy testing kits but they cost a fortune and results are unreliable (based on reviews).  It might be hard to find any labs right now because we are all on lockdown here in the UK atm. Thanks again! I think ill buy some frozen chicken tomorrow and see how i get on I would just get the IgE blood test.  The standard anaphylaxis one.  I have IgG results, but everything I read says they are useless.  They just show what you have been eating for the last few months, which matched what I saw.\n\nMy IgE results came up with 3 hits only...with 2 in their ranges as clinically relevant. I hesitate to use the word, but psychosomatic.  Another way of saying it is \"learned association\" by your autonomic nervous system.\n\nBoth sound like stress responses sure, but I do not know if they are physiological or what.  And if this is truly about mast cells then you should have other allergy symptoms I would assume.\n\nI can only speak for myself, but my food issues have come later in life...though always had a \"sensitive stomach\" and am a picky eater.  I would just ignore whatever discomfort I could, and find symptom relief if anything was offered (lots recently). I just described the initial/immediate reaction, the following hours/days can be a veritable treasure trove of weird shitty stuff like itching joint pain, chills, rashes, blocked nose etc etc.  Im taking antihistamines 24/7 now and the reactions are not as pronounced but i still know 100% when ive eaten the wrong thing No problem.  Just hard to know on here...My assumptions are not yours.\n\nSorry life sucks so much for you right now.  I do hope you find more that you do not react to.  I guess I should relish in the 3 meals or so I manage to eat.  Though I should probably drop one as a high histamine source (BBQ). That Is cool, im used to scepticism.  My GP put me on 2 back to back courses of antibiotics when i first complained of swollen throat and sinus problems.  The antibiotics only made things worse of course.  It was when i took a benedryl for my long standing \u201chayfever\u201d and i felt miraculously better that we started to put 2+2 together. Back to your original question that I missed...\n\nHuel (black or gluten free white) would have been my suggestions. Yeah not super sweet but you can add stuff (fruit or flavoring mixes or stevia). I am fine with the flavored Huel mostly... Just boring and texture can suck. Like it is pre-chewed.  And I cannot eat a bunch... Like 800 calories is about my max (2 double scoop shakes). \n\nYou could investigate lectins and a low lectins diet. It is actually impossible to do, and not healthy (lectins are in everything). But it was a thing... And for some people it works. Avoiding nightshade plants... \n\nBut you are down to nothing... I would look at this like an elimination diet after the intro. You pick 1 ingredient to add for 3 days, slowly doing more. Stop if you have any reaction (flag after reaction... But reaction can trigger seconds to days later as you know). This assumes food is your only trigger. \n\nI do not think that is enough for some of us. Soaps, room temperature, air fresheners... If you are not looking for it you will not see the correlation. \n\nElemental diet is the last resort. Tastes horrible, and not cheap. Predigested so cannot react. I do really well with all animal derived foods. Rice is another one that many people seem to tolerate. I could only do brown rice so its worth trying both white and brown. I only react to high histamine foods, dairy, and wheat, although sometimes the temperature of the food (too hot) will make me flush. My allergy testing confirmed no actual food allergies. I think having all of these foods sensitivities would be really unusual. Hope you can get some testing soon! I think it is important to really stress that what foods are safe for someone with mast cell disease vary WILDLY from person to person.  I think we often have this idea that certain foods \"should\" be easy to tolerate, but not everyone follows the pattern of tolerating what you would think would be easy to tolerate.  I find that I cannot eat vegetables or fruits.  I just cannot.  So you could be like me, perhaps.  I am not sure what exactly it is I react to in plant foods; it may be the B vitamins (I have the MTHFR mutation that makes me unable to tolerate any methylated B vitamins).  Basically, there are factors besides histamine at play.  Remember, there are 220+ different mediators released by mast cells, so histamine is not the only one we need to think about.  \n\nCorn is also a VERY common trigger, so it is not surprising that you cannot tolerate it.\n\nFor me, foods that are high fat and high protein (so things like meat and fatty plants like avocado and coconut) are far easier.  I recommend treating EVERY food as a potential suspect when determining what you react to, and keep in mind what you react to can change over time with mast cell disease.\n\nThe good news is lockdown is the PERFECT time to do an elimination diet!  Make a chart for ever single food you ever eat, and record the conditions and reactions to it for, say, two weeks.  This is the fastest way to figure out what the triggers are.  You need to minimize other variables for this to be accurate info, so that is what I mean when I say lockdown is the perfect time.\n\nI recommend taking a multivitamin (if you can tolerate one) as micronutrients are really important for many tings. Also, you need to check for interactions with other drugs you are taking, but if it is safe for you to take cimetidine, I have had a WAY better experience with that than with famotidine.\n\nYou may also ask your doctor to try cromolyn sodium (unless you already have and it did not work for you of course)", "Anxiety help Hey does anyone have mcas but never anaphylaxis?? I have recently stumbled across mcas and am convinced I have it. Now spending every minute being terrified of anaphylaxis happening. Any help appreciated thanks Anaphylaxis does not necessarily mean anaphylactic shock. some symptoms of ana are not life threatening. Many symptoms of MCAS could be considered ana. I have had symptoms for decades, not once have I done into anaphylactic shock. You will be fine, talk to your doctor if you are concerned. Thank you hearing stuff like that makes me feel better. Have you been diagnosed? Yep! hEDS and mast cell activation syndrome. I was diagnosed just about a month ago based on symptoms and what treatment works. I am normal on all my tests but sodium cromolyn, H1 and H2 antihistamines, low dose naltrexone, and the occasional Benadryl carpet bombing clear up my symptoms significantly.", "MCAS? Hello. I stumbled upon this site today when I thought I would do another run at figuring out what is wrong with me. Three years ago I started having some physical discomfort in the way of burning sensations on my arms and hands. Since then, my symptoms have become much more diverse and worrisome, with the worst burning sensations now being in my mouth, my eyes having become sensitive to light and my ears sensitive to sound, amongst other. As strange it may sound, I was intrigued when I found this site, and I thought \"hey, maybe this is IT!\". As much as I know that MCAS is serious condition, I would still very much like to know rather than going through life with no clue whatsoever, so here I am, writing, hoping that some people on here may recognize some of their own symptoms in what I write, and maybe give me some help in regards to moving towards a diagnosis. \n\nI thougth I would write down some of my symptoms...:\n\n* Constant burning mouth, but intensity varies a lot.\n* Periodically burning sensation on my forearms.\n* Periodically sore skin, especially on knees, elbows and forearms. Sometimes I wonder if it is inflamed hair follicles, but it is not visible. \n* Skin easily bruises.\n* Light sensitivity (eyes).\n* Red eyes after showering.\n* Sound sensitivity.\n* Tinnitus.\n* Temperature sensitivity (cold flashes, chills, heavy sweating)\n* Periodically sore and dry skin around my eyes. I am not a doctor, but those symptoms certainly sound like MCAS. Hi! I am no doctor, so take what I say with a grain of salt ;)\n\nWhat you are describing does not look like my MCAS. But since MCAS is different for everybody, it does not mean much.\n\nHowever, your symptoms (and especially the tinnitus, easy bruising, sound and temperature sensitivity) are all symptoms that my mother and her sister both have. And they both struggled for years to get a diagnosis. My mother was diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, and her sister was diagnosed with a light form Marfan syndrome. Both are illnesses affecting connective tissue (skin, etc).\n\nAll these diseases share a lot of symptoms. It is part of why it is so hard to identify what is wrong.\n\nI recommend you read about RCCX theory, it might help you find an explanation.\n\nI wish you luck in your search! Also, a big part of MCAS is allergic reactions. If you have no allergies, nor any food intolerance, it is even more unlikely to be MCAS. Thank you for mentioning RCCX theory! This is the first I have heard of it, despite all the research I have done this year after coming to suspect I have EDS and MCAS. More info to continue to research while I wait for my 1st rheumy appt! Have you been tested for Lyme disease?", "Ability to Work and have a somewhat normal life? Are you all able to work and have a somewhat normal life with this condition? Like have a family, etc. All the info about it is quite overwhelming and quite scary to think about. I work, and I have a wife and daughter.  But I was already married for years before things got bad.   Upon treatment, things improved and I am much more stable than I was a few years ago.  I still have bad days, but I am functional, and I support my family.  But I still have significant impacts on my life, such as restricted diet, need to avoid places where certain smells are, and restrict outdoor time in the sun, especially on bad days.\n\nAside from MCAS, I also have (probable) EDS and EoE.  (Technically my mom is diagnosed with hEDS, and I am now trying to find a new geneticist to get on another waiting list after the last one left the U of U hospital after I was halfway through a 3 year waiting list to see\n\nThe only other mast cell disorder patient I know well is a woman with a cutaneous Mastocytosis diagnosis.  She gets various systemic symptoms, up to any including anaphylaxis.  But she is never had a bone marrow biopsy to determine if it is Systemic Mastocytosis, so he would diagnosis remains CM, not SM.  But she was diagnosed as an adult, not a child, where most cases are SM (as opposed to the opposite for children).  She is the primary bread winner in her family.  So she not only works, but she largely supports her husband and kids.\n\nYes there are people who are utterly debilitated by this stuff, or the related disorders.  My sister was such.  Then there are those of us who manage to live relatively normal lives. The job you have really matters in terms of workability and what your specific symptoms are. I really like being able to sit down but not all jobs let you. I also have headaches frequently so I avoid jobs where I know Ill be talking the whole time or doing computer stuff the whole time etc. \nI have started getting new symptoms though and that is probably the most frustrating part because it makes me afraid to eat before work since I know food is probably the #1 things that fucks with Histamine lvls in our bodies... then the fact I did not eat makes me feel bad anyway so.. boo.\n\nI have a partner and he has Rheumatoid Arthritis so he is very understanding and what helps me helps him in general. Having a low histamine diet pretty much seems to help with like.. everything.. including RA. I could see how if someone in the relationship just did not want to focus on health remotely then it could be tough. \n\nBut honestly you just need to be strict with yourself and take your health seriously. All parts. Stress ruins me, poor diet ruins me etc. Everything is for sure still possible. \n\noh yeah i am 21 btw I was already retired when the MCAS came on, thankfully. I would not be able to work now. My good days are about 70% of how I used to feel, and bad days are a complete loss. I am glad to hear that some people are able to work. Yup. \n\nYou need medication, you need to be vigilant about avoiding triggers. Stress can also be a big factor. \n\nBut with proper medication and lifestyle you should be able to function. You have to be vigilant and consistent with medications. You also have to do work outside that like figure out triggers and avoid them. Watch what you eat. Take care during a flare, do not over work yourself. Do not slip on any of it. \n\nI am able to maintain my job. Its stressful. Its mostly a desk job. Theres a lot to keep track of, though so migraines and brain fog really affect me. Yes I live a good life, work a lot- sometimes part time, sometimes overtime, and I have two very good 4-year long romantic partners (I am poly and not into marriage so this is serious as it gets, I will probably adopt a kid someday but I have more co-parents than usual so I am not too worried). I got sick before dating too so I did it the hard way. \n\nI had to take an entire year off after college just to experiment with removing environmental triggers, seeing doctors, getting side conditions diagnosed too, buying a non-dusty bed with inflatable pillows and thin blankets, trying out as many mast cell stabilizers as possible and keeping the three that worked best, finding the best compression tights for POTS... but after that I was able to work 10x more. \n\nI have got pretty intense symptoms when going outside, so we can never open windows and are careful to run AC when I am asleep and then  turn it off and filter all the air before I wake up. I cannot kiss anyone without them showering first with my hypoallergenic stuff/showering if they have been outside for even a second. I can only use a couple shampoos, eat a few things, keep trips outside short and wear an allergy mask, etc. This has not stopped me from finding interested partners who are willing to do those things and I have a roommate who is my best friend as well as one of my partners living with me. \n\nMy job is high adrenaline, residential treatment for suicidal teenagers, otherwise I would not be able to work as much as I do. I can pick up shifts on weeks I feel good. The adrenaline directly counters most MCAS symptoms and helps me focus as I also have ADHD but tolerate no medications thanks MCAS. Epipens are basically adrenaline. \n\nSo I live life within a strict set of parameters but I still satisfy everything except my need for free time. It is so hard having half as much energy as other people. Otherwise things are good. I think I will be able to have a family, and a somewhat social life, but for work I am looking for part-time and fully remote, so that I can be in my safe environment away from triggers such as air pollution, and avoid unnecessary fatigue from commuting and such. I am 27, and looking for a job (developer).\n\nMy SO is very understanding, so that helps too! To be frank, no. But my condition went untreated for a number of years while I was a \"workaholic\". In that time it became pretty severe. If I keep up with medication and base my life around avoiding triggers, I can handle most things thrown my way. After a couple years of treatment I went back to college; I expect I will get back to work one day. Do not rush the process and you might be pleasantly surprised with the results. What was it like for you when you were not actively treating it? How was it leading up to it being severe? It was a lot to manage, but i held a full time job since I was in high school. I frequently left jobs due to medical crisis but needed full time work for insurance. I was constantly sweating, rash, fever, diarrhea, getting dizzy and almost falling over. I was in the bathroom 20% of the time. Often vomiting at work. Because I was 22 and from a poor background, sadly people often assumed I was a drug addict and avoided me. I started all these fad diets, exercised all the time, ran a 5k and threw up during the race.  All that alternative health stuff is not right for Mastocytosis treatment and made me worse. I got diagnosed but continued working to afford my medication.\n\nEventually I had a boss with Crohn's disease, who recognized my issues as legitimate, intervention me and helped me file for disability. I thought I was \"tough\" if I ignored the pain- nope! I was just too proud to ask for help. Lesson learned. Do you have Mastocytosis or MCAS? Started out with MCAD, progressed to \"monoclonal mast cell syndrome\". Doctor suspected systemic mastocytosis due to symptom severity, but i responded so well to cromolyn sodium (800 mgs a day) he decided to forgo a bone narrow biopsy. I still have a check up every 6 months.  Medication and rest REALLY helps. I used to think there was no way I needed to take so many pills, but I got over the embarrassment. People still love to tell me \"you do not need meds! Just do yoga and eat spinach!\". Healthy lifestyle is important too, but medication made all the difference. As a warning it sometimes takes months to work. Still worth it :) I am married too and I am really worried about being a burden to them as time progresses. Is it possible to have a normal relationship? I am pretty independent but also I am pretty big on interdependence. Instead of everyone doing their own stuff, or one person doing everything for someone, finding ways to split things according to what people can do so we are doing what is easiest for us and it all still gets done. \n\nWhen I am having a bad day I know how to take care of myself but I also wrote instructions for if I am ever too out of it to take care of myself. I have a day each week where I resupply any of my supplements, pills, etc so I am never out and asking them to get stuff suddenly. \n\nI do sometimes ask them to pick up my pills when they are already out doing something else or I think they need a walk anyways for their health and this is not a hardship for them. I pick up fun stuff for them like yarn for crochet or pick up a few groceries, it evens out. I also order stuff to be delivered a lot and ask them to bring it up but that is two minutes of their time and sometimes I give them some of what I order if it is shareable. \n\nWe split the chores according to what we can do. I can do dishes, chore management, general tidying, so I do those things. My roommate vacuums since I cannot handle dust and we trade off cleaning the bathroom. My partner who lives with me does grocery shopping and laundry. If someone cannot do their chore the others can step up for one week no big deal and you can take one of theirs another week. I clean stuff I can reach and they clean stuff on the floor. \n\nI plan most of the dates so I am sure I can always handle them. I provide a lot of emotional support too so it is not just them taking care of me. \n\nFinancially I will always make less money than either of my partners but we have offset that by just deciding to have a roommate for now, to live in cheap areas, etc. \n\nI worry they will get sick of showering so they can touch me, and they do hate having to shower at a certain time, but they still do. Most of the other changes are just using a different type of shampoo which is not a hardship. \n\nI was getting worse until I found the right combo of mast cell stabilizers and other meds but now I am not getting worse anymore. So I am not worried about suddenly deteriorating- but also that is a risk for literally any person, suddenly getting sick. I work FT, have 4 kids, loving marriage. Like others said, I have to be obsessive with self-care, take my meds religiously and i need a lot of sleep. But I do ok :) I work full time at a semi-stressful job, which I really enjoy and pretty much have as somewhat normal life. Pre-diagnosis and treatment I still worked full time but I was really miserable and dragging because I was so sick. I am one of those people that has responded really well cromolyn though so I am mostly normal these days. I still have reactions and stuff, but I have gotten better about figuring out my triggers and avoiding them, so my reactions are not happening that often anymore. \n\nI do not try to over do things and make sure to take care of myself by sleeping enough, making sure my weight is at a good place, exercising (nothing crazy-it is a mix of walking, yoga, and lifting), and letting myself rest. Basically, I have got one body to work with and I try to control what I can to make sure I can keep the parts I can control are in good shape-I totally expect to have a normal life span, so I am going to make sure my body remains in good enough shape for me to enjoy life. Overall, considering what I have, I seem to be \"healthier\" than a lot of my coworkers. I have been able to travel and do some day hiking. I still socialize (well, pre-covid) but I obviously skip out on the drinking bits and plan ahead with either making sure I can eat something or bring my own stuff if I need to or eating before/after an event. To me that stuff is not a big deal as I enjoy the social part. I also obviously consider the risk of an activity and if it is something I can do. I was having repeated reactions that in retrospect were anaphylaxis.  The reactions would last 8-12 hours for the worst part, but it would take days to weeks to feel okish again.  The soul crushing feeling of impending doom was bad, but I would be stuck with a constant high level of anxiety between reactions still.  I would be constantly itching, never sleeping deeply or for long, barely able to function at all.  Sometimes I would flush, but mostly I would just itch and hive up and get odd rashes constantly.  And my eyes were always so red I looked like a stoner at the best of times.  And I constantly had stress acne.  Once I got on the antihistamines, and got the worst triggers out of my diet 70-80% of all this immediately cleared up. I decided not to have a family because I could not imagine passing this down to anyone. Relationships have been difficult to maintain since most people want kids but I am happy \n\nIf I stick to my low histamine diet and take my medication and supplements I can work from 8AM to 7pm without really any issues. If I eat something I should not all I want to do is go to sleep and scratch eczema while my brain fog takes over.\n\nOnce I found the right foods things settled down for me and I enjoy working. \n\nI am not really sure what my work out tolerance is but I make sure I do not over do. 2 miles max running etc How did you find out you had MCAS? It legit took me 15 years of hell, 30 doctor visits and a stranger in Reddit told me one day, shortly after everything was ok with treatment I was diagnosed back in 2016 with something called Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) after a referral to a gastroenterologist for endoscopy and biopsies of my esophagus.  This was due to certain foods were causing near instant severe swelling of my esophagus and getting food stuck causing severe food impactions. \n\nAfter, eventually in late 2016, reading up intensively on EoE, I discovered that it is overwhelmingly a secondary disorder, and as such almost never found by itself.  And I started googling it is more common comorbids.  Which are mostly allergies, asthma, other eosinophilic disorder, mast cell disorder, or connective tissue disorders.  When I came across mast cell disorders, as well as Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, about a million things finally made sense.  It took a while and a false start to track down a local specialist in my area who actually took my heath insurance, (most MCAS specialists in Utah are out of network for me), and got the 24 hour urine test and tryptase test.  From there on, I presume my experience matches everyone else's.  I had to redo the urine test a couple times to return a positive.  After my first tryptase test was normal I had to get another during a bad reaction.  Which was dicy as anything as most of my reactions have severe GI distress as a symptom.  And driving to the doctor myself in that brain fogged/vertigo state was not an option.", "TMEP diagnosis and treatment Hi everyone,\n\nI just stumbled onto this sub. The other sub would not let me post for some reason so I hope I am in the right sub for this. \n\nLast year I was diagnosed with Telangiectasia macularis eruptiva perstans (TMEP) after going to the dermatologist for tiny red spots on my arm, leg and shoulder. \n\nWhen I got my diagnosis, my dermatologist briefly explained to me over the phone that, all it would mean for me is that I would get diarrhea more often. She said that if I did not like the way the spots looked, I could get them removed.\n\nAt the time I did not think much of it, mainly because of how she explained it. But today I suddenly started thinking about it again, and after researching and reading some of the things on here and the other mastcelldisease sub I am kind of freaking out. Should I take this more seriously? Should she have sent me to a specialist?\n\nThe only symptoms I have experienced so far are the tiny red spots (they do not burn or itch, and they have not increased) and bowel issues that I thought were IBS.\n\nI am not looking for medical advice but I guess I am just looking for insight on this diagnosis that is apparently a lot more serious than I thought.\n\nIs there treatment for TMEP? \nHow are your symptoms presenting and have you sought treatment?\n\nApologies if this is not the right sub for it, I do not really know where else to ask this. No treatment for TMEP besides normal Mast Cell treatment to prevent degranulation. That Is antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers. There are actually a lot of things you can do. From anti-degranulation agents and histamine receptor blockers (especially H2, because they are quite \u2018popular\u2019 cutaneously and in the gastrointestinal tract.)\nYou would also have to fix your Microbiome and your methylation. Change your diet (low glutamate, low histamine, low tyrosine and other MAO-inhibitors, high B-vitamins (do not just do it blindly, plan it out accordingly, you only want certain ones) get rid of triggering household and hygiene items (Multiple chemical sensitivity) and have a good EMF and (day-)light hygiene.\n\nThere is a list ]( which collects other helpful info.\n\n\nPlease remember: It is not about some spots, it is not about Mast cell diseases, it is about the genetic expression, genotype -&gt; phenotype, which in turn leads to an altered metabolism and faulty/functional enzymes, peptides/amino acids, nutrient(deficiencie)s, cell waste etc. pp.\n\nIt is a long way, but if you want to improve your condition, you will have to tackle it relentlessly.\n\nHit me up if you have any questions :) Yeah, TMEP is a form of cutaneous mastocytosis (CM).  The \"IBS\" is likely a symptom of it.  But possibly unrelated.  It *is* possible for CM to have no  symptoms besides the skin symptoms, and IBS is pretty common.  That being said, your IBS is most likely still a symptom of the TMEP.  \n\nYou should talk to your PCP about it, and see if they will run a serum tryptase test.  If your tryptase is elevated, it is time for a bone marrow biopsy to check to see if evidence can be found that you have Systemic Mastocytosis, (SM, or ISM) and not just CM.  It is still possible to have SM with normal tryptase though, (15%).  If your tryptase is elevated, you will want a referral to a hematologist with Mastocytosis experience for the bone marrow biopsy, as it *needs* to be bilateral, not just one side.  A single side biopsy has a 1/6 chance of missing it still.\n\nTreatment usually involves H1 antihistamines + H2 antihistamines, + leukotrine inhibitors, + mast cell stabilizers.  Dosages vary depending on severity of symptoms.\n\nSymptoms often change over time, sometimes waxing and waning, sometimes just getting worse.  Typically it is a reactive disorder.  That means there are triggers.  More trigger exposure = worse symptoms.  Less trigger exposure usually = better stability and fewer symptoms.   Identifying triggers can be difficult for many.  Easy for some.  The more severe and immediate symptoms are, the more obvious triggers are.  The less severe or more delayed they are, the harder to uncover they get. TMEP is a form cutaneous mastocytosis (CM). It is not unusual to experience GI issues and other systemic mastocytosis symptoms. Treatment follows the usual SM treatment of antihistamines, mast cell stabilizers, and leukotrine inhibitors. I also recall my mast cell specialist also mentioning that it is very common for adult onset CM to develop into systemic mastocytosis, so your doctors should be tracking changes. You may want to get a referral to a specialist. While a hemotologist would make sense, many patients with mast cell issues are also seen someone in allergy &amp; immunology, so that might be a place to start as well. My PCP referred me to the research hospital for care as they are more knowledgeable with mast cell issues than the doctors in my smaller city. The ( has a lot of useful information and may be worth checking out. Thank you for the extensive reply!\n\nI will contact my doctor first thing tomorrow. Thanks for taking the time to type this out, it really helps.\n\nI am setting up an appointment with my pcp tomorrow to get a referral to a specialist, and I will definitely take a look at that website. I see I got some homework to do :b\n\nThanks for the thought out response!\n\nAs of yet, the only symptoms I seem to have are with my bowels, but I have had that for a while so I am setting up an appointment with my pcp asap. Good luck! I had a lot of skin issues but they did not itch they just looked bad and due to lack of health care access I put it off. Then I started getting really bad GI issues and flushing symptoms, and after a few years I got an MCAS diagnosis from an allergist who sent me to a mast cell specialist for a second opinion. My specialist that finally prescribed me cromolyn (a game changer for me) told me to get my spots biopsied, but they cleared up with cromolyn. Cromolyn really helped my GI issues. That was huge. Now my tests indicate suspicious results that may mean I have mastocytosis and not MCAS. So basically it is a process and symptoms can and probably will change over time. \n\nI will add, take the time to educate yourself. Not all doctors are up to speed and it is important your doctor knows what they are doing and are up on the latest research. My PCP told me he vaguely remembered learning about mastocytosis in school. They covered it one day. My dermatologist told me MCAS is no big deal and just causes flushing. My allergist would smack him if she heard say that. It is more than flushing and I now have anaphylaxis like reactions to a few things. So yeah... dermatologists can be a mixed bag with their mast cell knowledge. Jesus that is terrifying! My dermatologist reacted the same way. \n\nI will definitely get in touch with an allergist as well.", "I found this to be extremely informative and helpful ", "I have my symptoms under control, but I have absolutely no ability to focus and very little short-term memory. HELP! I am taking lots of h1s and only one type of h2 currently.  If I took fewer h1s and more h2s, do you think these side effects would be better?  I know there are many different types of histamine receptors so I am not entirely sure which ones do what.\n\nI work from home, and I cannot focus at all with all these antihistamines, so I cannot get any work done!  It is getting to be a real problem. Which meds are you taking right now? Zyrtec, Claritin, Vistaril, Benadryl, Cimetidine, quercetin, cromolyn, fish oil, reishi, palmitoylethanolamide, THC/CBD and terpenes The Vistaril and Benadryl are the ones that are probably causing the issue. Do you take them all the time, or only as rescue meds? I have found that when I am taking Benadryl several times a day for several days, it starts to affect my short term memory.  Sometimes I still have to take it if I am stuck in a flare, though.\n\nI take ashwagandha to help with brain fog. I tried taking choline to see if it would counteract the memory issues I had from Benadryl, but it did not do much. That is a good point, thanks.  I used to take them both multiple times a day but now that I have the cimetidine I do not need to quite so much.\n\nI find I react really poorly to most supplements that are cholinergic, so that is been frustrating.  Ashwagandha made me feel CRAZY amped all the time, I could never sleep!  Same with acetylcholine.  Sometimes I try using very tiny amounts of limonene to bring back the focus and memory but it usually just raises my histamine so much I start barfing haha Many people with MCAS take higher doses of zyrtec than usual. Maybe that would help you need the others less often, or you could try Allegra instead of the claritin and see if it does more. Some people get drowsy from the higher doses of zyrtec. I take 20 mg twice a day and do not get drowsy.\n\nThere is also xolair. I do not need Benadryl as often now that I am on xolair. I usually have one day when I am exhausted after the injection, but then I am better the rest of the month.  I can usually manage just taking hydroxyzine at bedtime, because I get pressure hives from my pillow and mattress. I know this is may sound weird but have you had your hands on ritalin? Tried it from a friend who has ADHD which led me to believe it is kind of a Dopamin Problem that my MCAS produces. I have not tried Ritalin but I have tried Adderall and for the safety of the rest of the world, I think it is best I never try anything like that ever again. \n\nHere is one thing you seem to be missing...histamine is what allows you to focus.  I have to take antihistamines to be able to eat, sleep, and breathe.  Everything that increases focus, increases histamine, because histamine = focus.\n\nI do not feel safe taking any drug that is intended to increase focus, because they all increase histamine. I used to be taking just a ton of Zyrtec (plus all the herbal/mast cell stabilizer stuff) and I found that it also kept me pretty amped.  I never get tired, ever, so I kind of HAVE to knock myself out with all these things all day long if I want to be able to sleep ever.  \n\nI have never tried Allegra, but it looks like, twice as expensive as Claritin...But I guess I could just ask my doc to write a rx for it, I have great insurance and all my meds are only $1 Claritin does not work for some people. I took it back when it was still prescription only and it did not do anything at all for me. My sister said it works for her.\n\nAllegra was my favorite as far as not causing dry eyes or being hard to stop (like zyrtec) but I became allergic to it after taking it a couple years. I had developed B12 and folate deficiencies that caused memory issues and difficulty with focusing. They are theorized to have been indirectly caused by MCAS. Man, I remember the first time I took Claritin...I was about 14, and I had absolutely no idea I had allergies.  I thought I had a cold, and we did not have any cold medicine in the house, so my mom gave me a Claritin.  It made me feel so much better than I genuinely thought I was high!  (I was a very...sheltered child, as I am sure many folks with lifelong MCAS also were haha)  Looking back, I am SO frustrated that I thought it was morally wrong to feel that good, when all I was feeling was...the lack of constant MCAS symptoms.\n\nSo Claritin definitely works on some level for me.  But Allegra might work better!", "Anyone used HBOT (Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy) or Mucinex much?  Mucinex?\n\nAnyway, I was thinking about doing that as well hyperbaric oxygen therapy\n\nBut I am going to take baby steps, and see if I notice anything whatsoever, I am going to get some at home oxygen that I can just blast into my lungs, and I am thinking of maybe getting a portable oxygen concentrator and wearing the little hose that goes over my nose when I sleep....\n\nI was actually getting ready to wear to post about it and ask if anybody has any advice. Expectorant.  Makes the mucus come out easier.", "Hi there - new to this subreddit and struggling with a (nearly confirmed) mast cell activation disorder brought on by an injection of an enzyme to dissolve lip filler 8 months ago. Was in a good patch until having acupunture recently. Wondering if anyone else has experienced serious trigger\u2026 Over the last few months since initially just dealing with the dissolving agent affecting and degrading my facial tissue (I am one of many this is happening too) I have tried numerous ways to regain my health but have had over 7 terrible reactions that further destroyed my body tissue and resulted in near constant burning, tingling, puritus, loose skin, gaunt aging face and inability to eat foods that were never problematic before. I recently had acupunture and the first few sessions were great, I then had a third and my entire body reacted, I cannot walk as the tissue on the bottom of my feet has dissipated along with the skin all over my body becoming stretchier and in constant pain, I had horrific itching and burning in a facial point (as though I would been injected with the enzyme again). It is thought in the support community for this enzyme damage that some of us cannot deactivate it. But I am wondering if anyone has had issues with acupuncture triggering their issues. I did some reading that suggested that acu engaged mast cells in the tissue, I have not been able to eat at all since the points she put in my stomach and prior I would had no Gi issues. I am very lost and all efforts to naturally restore health end in disaster. Do people have thresholds where things are working and then it turns bad / ticks over into a reaction? I have been tested for Eds and do not have it genetically but physically I now do. Any management suggestions are welcome \ud83e\udd7a I am so sorry, this sounds like a nightmare!! MCAS in general is a nightmare but yikes! I hope you do not mind me veering off topic a little bit, because one thing that strikes me is that you have a lot of symptoms that sound like a bartonella infection (but I could be misinterpreting your descriptions). The sudden hypermobility reminds me of this ( which reflects the anecdotal link between sudden onset hypermobility and bartonella, and pain in soles of feet is a classic symptom. So I would almost wonder if somehow the filler was also a trigger for the immune system to crash and then a dormant infection to rear its head? Lots of people see it as a lyme disease coinfection but it is common amongst vet techs and people who have had animals because it is more often transmitted by fleas, cats, dogs, and other vectors. At the same time, who knows whether what we view as bartonella symptoms are really just MCAS symptoms. I know when my MCAS came on, I suddenly had all the joints around my body clicking and feeling less stable (but I also have bartonella so that is not helpful haha). \n\nAnyway you probably do not need more theories, I just wanted to mention it just in case it rings a bell. To your question: I did have acupuncture a few times this past year and the first time, my entire body was vibrating after. It felt like what I know now is a trigger, however, each time I went it got better so not really the same as you. If you are on your way to a diagnosis, has anyone prescribed any meds like cromolyn for you? It has been a game changer for me, especially in my ability to tolerate foods. \n\nManagement wise...I am still learning, and figuring out meds. However, I do find yin yoga to be particularly helpful. When I got sick, ANY form of exercise, even sometimes walking, would trigger reactions. Yin is healing to the connective tissue and fascia, all about *not* pushing/trying too hard, and is almost meditative without being actual meditation - which is important to me as I often find sitting in meditation too painful unless I lie on my back. I found it to be really helpful for my nervous system and gave me something to focus on whilst feeling restorative to my body. Yoga with Kassandra on YouTube has some great free ones. I would say with any type of yoga though, and a predisposition to hypermobility, obviously be super careful and set your own limits within your comfort zone. A lot of those skin symptoms sound like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which often occurs with MCAS. idk if u have mcas but most of the shit yr describing would not be explained at all by mcas.  if yr having discrete and multisystemic anaphylactic reactions without any other causes, that could be explained by mcas.   but mcas is not going to give u loose skin or a gaunt aging face.  it does not cause the skin on yr feet to dissipate.  it does not make yr skin stretchier.  mcas causes discrete attacks and should not be high on the differential for someone suffering constant symptoms.\n\nu need a real workup. first, gastro to figure out why u cannot tolerate any food at all.  that is not normal for mcas by a long shot.\n\nthen i would go to derm and start getting biopsies of some these skin problems.  that might give some strong clues about the pathology. \n\nthen, if u still suspect mcas, it needs to be diagnosed by an experienced allergy immunologist.  bcuz dozens of other things cause almost identical symptoms to mcas.  and only an experienced allergy immunologist can rule out some of those other things.  \n\ni am real skeptical that mcas is yr answer.  but even if is, it does not explain almost any of yr problems.  u need a real workup by real doctors. Acupuncture is a known mast cell degranulator, sadly.  Immune response after Hyaluronidase would mean immune response attacking basically anything hyaluronic acid involved at all, so all the connective tissues in the body, basically mimicking ehlers danlos.Sounds horrible and I am sorry.Montelukast, ketotifen, some attempt at desensitization to hyaluaronic acid?? Wish I had anything to offer.  \n\n\nFwiw I have a similar trigger sequence thing, where phenibut started the mast cell misery and then a baclofen rx made it even worse. I do not know what quantum immune mechanism is specifically behind it, to pull something out of the air, maybe the acupuncture pushed the initially reacting hyaluronic acid skin collagen into other areas which multiplied the things your immune system decided were foreign bodies to destroy.  \n\n\nI have posted my desensitization regimen here in the past, I think my fundamental problem is once GABA crosses the BBB and reaches certain areas in quantity, I get immune response, there are many other things happening but that is my guess at the bottom line for myself.    \n\n\nAny time I have taken any gabageric medicine or supplement, it is gotten worse. (Discovered that by accident, and became allergic to the last of my clothing that did not give me rashes and severe cramps, as well as the humble almond).  I have worked on desensitizing to random items that I react to pretty successfully but am afraid to try GABA itself, even in microgram amounts. However it might be the only solution, in the same way desensitizing to hyaluronic acid (SOMEHOW) might be yours.   \n\n\nBut note, this is 100% speculation, I am basically talking from only my own severely specific and very constrained experience and have a very weak grasp on any of the underlying physical principles. When no one has any help for you or any suggestion at a cure (beyond montelukast and ketotifen, which are a godsend) you have to try things.   Do not let anything I said stop you from getting medical treatment, you will probably need to be referred through a chain of multiple MDs to find one who has even a slight feel for mast cell conditions, especially this sort of sui generis one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**To answer your initial question**: I absolutely have experienced a horrible trigger that made bad worse, like you did, and I think several others have.   If you have a doctor, I would talk to him/her about mast cell degranulation as montelukast and ketotifen could possibly  cut a bit of your suffering.  You could be lucky and have your immune system fix itself, or you could be on a long road of suffering, with massive effort needed to feel 1% better, but those %s are cumulative,  do not give up.  \n\n\nFinal ps: I really feel your point about natural stuff not helping. It would be great if a combo of supplements and herbs flipped things to the good, the best way to look at them is as part of a way to have as little inflammation as possible. Eat clean, get a lot of sun, stay away from blue light, exercise, etc, but that is just background stuff. If there is a way out, it is probably real medical stuff plus some antique mithradatism. Your experience is certainly more complicated than most mcas cases because of what you are reacting to. In addition to mcas treatments you will have to keep researching because there is clearly other pieces here too that most of us do not have to deal with. \n\nMost of us have different triggers- I see it as I always had this illness but until it tipped over the edge into overactive it was probably actually helpful. Like I was never sick growing up and had lots of energy. Then I got Lyme disease and stressed out from emotional/medical abuse from family from that and my body just could not deal, so MCAS got kicked into high gear. Oh goodness - this makes a whole lot of sense thank you for this link. Gosh I felt so validated / seen just from this one simple concise answer! Thank you and yes it is a living hell - sadly, there are thousands of us going through it. Docs try to say we have HEDs or that they just do not know and injectors continue to deny the permenant damage Hyaluronidase is doing, even if people do not develop systemic issues it is ripping through facial tissue and permanently destroying the Extra cellular matrix structure. Every day at least 5 new people join the support group Wassap chat which is hard to find so I can only imagine how many are suffering in silence. As you said the HA/ hyal balance and homeostasis in connective tissue is literally in everything - skin - eyes - joints. My life has been taken from me and myself and so many others are left with comorbidity\u2019s like MAcs and acquired hypermobility but zero support from medical industry. I appreciate reddit forums like this one for the clarity. My next step is an allergist I will ask about the medications you have mentioned. Thank you kindly. Thank you for the reply - you are absolutely right in that it is very complex and macs is not the only element at all. The loose skin and aging is From the hyaluronidase enzyme that they are using in the cosmetic field to dissolve fillers - I only had my upper lip dissolved but there are zero studies on it is efficacy and safety for this type of application. It was created back in the 50\u2019s to help anesthetic spread by basically liquifying the tissue / breaking down hyaluronic acid to make tissue more permeable and viable for things ro spread in. Insects have it in their sting for this reason (to spread venom etc). It is all horrific what is happening as they market it as being designed for filler removal - but it is used off label and they never say a word about this. So many of us who have been damaged by it now have a full set of systemic issues and seem to react to everything, we are looking into MACs as an additional issue from this reaction. Mast cells also release our bodies on Hyaluronidase/ are involved in that tissue process. It is all so complex and confusing. I have been to over 12 specialists / rheumatologist/ neuro/ derm/ gp/ allergist / geneticist\u2026 list goes on. What is also terrifying is that even the specialists do not want to talk about Hyaluronidase and its dangers (some plastic surgeons are talking about it as their operating on 25 years olds whose tissues are destroyed). I am rambling but yes you are absolutely right in that MACs alone is not the skin / tissue issue but the reactivity we have all developed to many things seems to fit. Thank you and you are absolutely right / the \u2018tipping over\u2019 effect is what many of us seem to be experiencing from Hyaluronidase damage, it is causing full systemic reactions. Exactly - Except I had zero signs and zero hyper-mobility until 6 months ago, a few months after the enzyme was injected. I have been tested for the genetic types and Heds has been ruled out as no signs in family / zero signs until sudden onset. But it truly looks like many of us now have Eds I suspect as the destruction of the enzyme effects the skin and tissue system in a similar way. No problem. I used to find it so helpful, but it is a no go for me now. It is normal to have flares that hopefully let you go back to baseline, but during those times more supplements / antihistamines may be needed until you can drop back to your customary dosing. Oh wow! I take back my comment about bartonella. I would never even heard of this chemical and connection to the connective tissues. This makes a lot more sense given the circumstances. That sucks so bad. Far out - you are a true legend - thank you, it is so isolating and I appreciate this earnest / raw and understanding edit to your answer - you are smart as hell (I would also consider myself a high functioning intelligent person) which almost makes it worse, you feel on the brink of fathoming it - read the science go to the knowledge yet that still cannot save you and the intricacies and studies / care from practitioners just is not there. For myself snd the others suffering from Hylase all we can do is hope it is banned in future so others do not end up like us. Thank you for the practical tips here / and the reminder that one percent is still something worth attempting to attain. I believe with the acu the needle was too deep / the treatment too strong in already compromised tissue resulting in my bodies own hyaluronidase / HA sequence kicking in but as there is also foreign hyaluronidase causing reactions the homeostasis of that system of wound repair / tissue response and making new fibroblasts etc is completely fucked. Also as someone mentioned acu degranulates mast cells snd releases histamine which I did not know. The more superficial needling I would had in the face had been wonderful, it is interesting to see the aggression and depth play a part in the reaction too. It is still burning and itching a month later and my whole body is still loosening day to day which is what happened with the initial hyaluronidase systemic reaction. Thanks again for your thoughts, I hope you are doing ok. I appreciated the thought!! But yes sadly it is that fucking enzyme that is kicked this one off - hardest part being it is not even a \u2018chemical\u2019 as it is something we also have in our bodies. But they are from ovine or bovine sources ( they now also make a human source one but it is still destroying people) so naturally when they have done NO study to see how it deactives in tissue and start throwing it in peoples faces to earn a buck there is going to be catastrophic outcomes. Hopefully soon it will have the media traction it deserves as they lie outright to the patient and on the patient consent form about it. Thank you for your care - it does suck so so bad x There is so much shit out there like that, it makes me so mad. Medicine is like, strangely regulated in some ways and not at all in others. Totally unrelated but an example is regular dentists doing invisalign, allowing people to mess with people's jaws without being an orthodontist. So many horror stories, and so much like you are saying just for profit and not truly thinking about patient health. I am so sorry you are experiencing this. Potentially one silver lining of the pandemic is that I do think there is a lot more research and funding for \"long covid\" which many suspect is mast cell activation syndrome. So hopefully there will be better relief for us in the foreseeable future...probably a long shot but something that gives me some hope. Thank you - I appreciate it. I have found more generosity and answers/ understanding in this sub than I have from 8 months of doctors. I am thinking to start my own subreddit about hyaluronidase/ filler dissolving as there are thousands in the support group which is hard to find so I can only imagine how many others are suffering too - also all injectors say it is \u2018totally safe\u2019 so a lot of people walk into it blindly. It is just so horrific. There is been four miscarriages in the wassap chat so far, amounts a myriad of PTSD issues from medical gaslighting. In the very beginning one ER doctor said \u2018we will we cannot suck it out of you and your still pretty so go home and relax\u2019. Eight months later I cannot walk unassisted and my elderly grandparents who raised me have had their lives shattered too. Some of the Russian members have been proactive about television appearances etc but the industry are doing a very good job of keeping a lid on it. Some top plastic surgeons are speaking out as they do not rely on the money from injectables and they are operating on 26 year olds whose entire faces have collapsed on a SMAS tissue level / fascia / structure is just melted. Hoping that these \u2018zebra\u2019 diseases and modern afflictions finally get the research they deserve and hope you are doing ok in your journey. I am with you on the hylase. I have tried to tell every possible community using phenibut as a smart drug/workout enhancer about this gruesome life ruining possible side effect, and no one cares.    \n\n\nIn a similar vein, my fiancee went through breast implant illness, and it is taken decades  for the possibilities of problems to raise to concern for good surgeons, the general public considering them do not learn about the possibility, and the few that do, for the most part, keep a 'well it will not happen to me' attitude.   \n\n\nA good friend of mine is an MD and interned with a renowned researcher at the Mayo clinic in Minnesota, and the stuff he told me about fudging data in studies  made my skin crawl.

I also have yet to find a doctor that know enough, if anything about MCAS.\n\nI am currently working with a compounding pharmacy in Canada, but am struggling to find fillers that I do not react to. i have not found any yet so I am not able to take any medication to help me. everyday I am getting worse and I do not know what to do because I cannot seem to find a doctor that will work with me in Canada.\n\nWondering if anyone from Canada, specifically Ontario has any advice on how to find a doctor who knows about MCAS or any advice in general? It is not an eating disorder.  I have similar reactions to foods, drugs, supplements, vitamins and the environment.  I am gluten, dairy, soy free as minimal histamine, salicylate, oxalate and nightshades.  I also react to scents and EMF.  I am not sure what is the cause but I think it may be glyphosate in the food supply even though I eat organic foods.  My entire GI system is inflamed, but I react to PEG/Miralex so they cannot run a lot of tests on me.  My stool gut biome indicated dysbiosis (nothing pathogenic), but I react to probiotics so I cannot take anything.  I have been to many physicians and naturopaths and no one seems to be able to help. I have heard that Dr. Jason Lee is an expert on MCAS in Toronto.\n\n hi, thanks for your comment! were you able to see somewhere that he knows about MCAS, I have been looking but cannot seem to find anything that suggests this yet? I found his name on a list on the website of The Mastocytosis Society Canada. They do not seem to have the list any more, but I believe they will send a doctor's name in your area by email. afrin is real controversial.  largely bcuz he thinks *everybody* reeks of mcas.  \n\nif u want a doctor who agrees with afrin, u should prob ask afrin himself for the referral.  otherwise, most a and i doctors i have met think he is half quack.  not total quack but quacky enough that they do not buy his diagnoses.", "24 Hours with no medication... So I have gone 24 hours without any antihistamine medication. I have eaten and did everything I normally do and have noticed practically no difference in how I feel on the histamine medicine versus off of the histamine medicine. I have been to an allergist and my PCP whom both said that any mcad is unlikely for me. I wanted to go off the medicine for a bit to see if I noticed any difference. In the past, I had gone off the medicine for over a week prior to seeing an allergist and I do not remember feeling much different. Is the lack of difference in how I feel on antihistamine versus off of antihistamines a good reason to trust in what my doctors have told me and pursue other potential causes of the things I have been feeling? I remember reading somewhere that response to antihistamines is one of the criteria for initial diagnosis. If they do not think you have it and you do not respond to medications, then you probably do not have it. Not a doctor, but that is my experience and what a lot of the research says. I had to stop antihistamines for testing and I had a migraine that lasted a week, needed my albuterol inhaler every 4 hours, got hives and flushing and itching and was just generally miserable, to the point that I have told my doctor I will never stop my antihistamines again. So if you do not notice a difference, especially after several days, it is possible your doctors are correct. I think you would feel some difference if you had MCAS. Agree with others. If antihistamines make no difference and your doctors do not think you have MCAS, then you do not. Move on and focus on other possible causes. Did all of these symptoms start shortly after stopping the medicine? I have mainly been dealing with some stomach problems, but really feel no different today than when I am on the medicines as I am experiencing the same problems really. I was just wondering if 24 hours is too short of a time and if others experience symptoms immediately after stopping antihistamines I guess That is what I am hoping. I just always doubt if I have told them everything or not and if they are not fully aware of what I am feeling. However, I do guess that they would know what to look for much better than I and maybe I do not need to tell them every little detail. I notice when I forget to take antihistamines (24 hrs+). Stomach aches, more GI issues, feel like im drowning in post nasal drip. If theres no difference, do not take them. Over a week you should not notice anything. The headache started about 36 hours after my last zyrtec dose, the breathing issues took a bit longer. I think the itching started when the headache did, but it was such an extreme headache that it was more bothersome than the itching.\n\nThe worst part is that I reacted to the saline control for the skin test and they said I was too reactive and sent me for blood tests instead, so my terrible week was all for nothing. I mean I am having a bit of stomach problems, but I had the same problems when on the medicines. It does not feel much different tbh If no symptom relief when on meds and no change while off, then your docs are probably right. Also, MCAS would impact more than one body system. It would not be occasional mild stomach discomfort unrelieved my typical MCAS meds. What else do they think it could be? They do not think its anything honestly. I spoke with my GI last week and when I brought up MCAS he told me that an allergist would be the one to go to and if the stomach problems are not causing chronic diarrhea, bleeding, and significant weight loss, then it is not something he would be worried about and he agrees with the allergist and thinks its quite unlikely that I have any MCAD. I believe I have a good team of doctors but the fact that none of them are specialists is what concerns me. My allergist/immunologist did a multi-year residency at Johns Hopkins, but he is an older doctor and not a mast cell specialist so I am slightly concerned about him not knowing much about MCAS. But you do not even have symptoms of MCAS. Why are you so convinced otherwise? Curious because I see this a lot. \n\nAlso, your GI is correct-diarrhea is a common sign of MCAS. It sounds like they know what they are talking about. Because I have been having skin issues paired with stomach pain issues. I have never really noticed the skin issues before so this is all fairly new to me. I have found this condition and seem to have latched on to it because of how vague it is. I have read that Dr. Akin and Dr. Valent wrote \"Most patients with MCAS suffer from recurrent episodes of severe hypotension (anaphylaxis). If this is not the case, MCAS may still be diagnosed but is a less likely diagnosis. In particular, there is no evidence to support the existence of a chronic form of systemic MCAS without severe episodic events.\" But there seems to be many people disputing this with their symptoms You will find many people who are self diagnosed disputing the facts. These are folks that do not meet criteria and have something medically going on that has not been explained. They latch on to MCAS as a diagnosis because some \u201cresearch\u201d gives a ridiculously broad description of symptoms. Broad enough that practically everyone could fall under the MCAS umbrella. This is not the same as actual evidence and being diagnosed by criteria. Dr Akins recommendations are what the medical community has decided would be the consensus. You can also look at The Mastocytosis Society website for additional symptoms. \nAll that aside, you are having some kind of issues not resolved by typical mast cell treatments. No harm in keeping MCAS in mind, if your symptoms become severe or you notice more symptoms, maybe the docs will test you. In the mean time, look for another cause. If your doctor is blowing you off, see someone else. The stomach discomfort has to be something. My experience says : do not make assumptions before month pass. My 30 years of diarrhea switched to constipation I am not sure what your point is here? MCAS is not just diarrhea, it is only first stage. Later when everything is off the order people get gastroparesis. Ok-but I think I said diarrhea is a symptom of MCAS. Not implying that it is the only symptom. Also-I have not heard of MCAS causing gastroparesis, but I will look into it. Thanks! I am adding to your information to make things clear Have you tried seeing how you react when on an elimination diet?  Few paragraphs down on this link.  Or just trying to eat safe/ histamine free foods.  \n\n\n\n\nI found this link to be pretty accurate, though I cannot do blackberries:\n\n Just a quick question about this, are you saying that I would be experiencing more than just abdominal pain? Would the other symptoms be quite obvious? I have monitored myself fairly closely today and I am not noticing any flushing, hives, etc. I have a bit of a headache but nothing major and its most likely due to me skipping coffee today. My stomach pain has been quite less today too. I am now over 40 hours without any antihistamine medicines. MCAS must effect 2 or more body systems. It would not \u201cjust\u201d be stomach pain. The symptoms are episodic in response to triggers. So with one symptom in one body system, you can certainly expect another? It would not just be a constant dull pain by itself with no clear trigger and no other major symptoms? No Okay thanks. Sorry for all the questions, I am sure you all get upset with people like me and the other board has banned it outright. Thank you for taking the time, I am just confused by the multiple symptoms and what type of abdominal pain its talking about. Its all so vague. I worry that people will focus on MCAS and delay diagnosis for something they actually have. Since many of the treatments are over the counter, this delay can be prolonged. There are some legit scary things that should be ruled out before accepting an MCAS diagnosis. Then, you have folks who have very little to zero evidence of MCAS, but insist on seeing a specialist. This backlogs specialists and makes it harder for people with the disorder to get in. \n\nIt is really only vague if you look at Lawrence Afrin\u2019s research. He has done a huge disservice, in my opinion. Most MD\u2019s do not take him seriously. Look at the mastocytosis society website and Dr Cem Akin\u2019s research for guidance. Then-it will become clear that your doctors are right.\n\nI hope you find a reason for your symptoms. If you ever end up with an EGD/Colonoscopy, have them stain for mast cells. Might as well and may provide you peace of mind.", "Anaphylaxis question Hey all,  I have had a couple anaphylactic reactions before all with multiple symptoms: nausea impending doom, hives,  diarrhea, tightness of throat and itching of mouth yada yada. \nOnly once have I had to give myself the epi.\nCurrently I just am having trouble breathing throat tightness and anxiety but that is it,  not enough to warrant epi. (I do not think)  Tried inhaler but that has not done anything.  Trying hot shower now to open up lungs. Any other recommendations?? Really do not want to do epi and hospital if can be prevented... benadryl??? That is what I was thinking next! thanks! Do not have a hot shower! Heat increase histamine. Oh \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f my bad kind of forgot about that... Benadryl always and anti histamines. Liquid Benadryl hits faster. Thank you! Liquid or chewable benadryl. Switch it around you mouth and throat best you can and let it do it is thing for 5 or 10 minutes. Works better and longer than epi. Epi will help for when you already really cannot breathe, but is very short acting and you still need benadryl or you will just keep having reactions until your system clears the offending substance. So a hot shower will increase blood flow and cause your mast cells go everywhere in your body, making your reactions worse.  This is why we hear about exercise induced Anaphylaxis.  \nIf you have taken Benadryl, asthma medications \nand still nothings working you need to use your EpiPen and go to the ER.", "A couple things I am assuming magnesium stearate found in pharmaceuticals vs supplements would be the same, but I reacted to both ketotifen and famotidine (pepcid) in a similar way. It slowly felt like my circulation got worse and worse, I was waking up with asleep arms and having increased muscle twitching, weird sharp pains (maybe nerve pain). Stopped the famotidine today and feel loads better, so I do not think it is a permanent thing like POTS (which I do not have many symptoms of either way normally). I figured, since I reacted in such a similar way, I wonder if I am reacting to the same ingredient. They both contain magnesium stearate, but that is pretty much the only thing in common. However, I take supplements that also contain this ingredient and have so far been okay with them, so I am curious if anyone knows if the amounts that would be found in pharmaceuticals vs supplements would be different, or the type of magnesium stearate (my supplements say vegetable grade but the pharmaceuticals do not...) like...just if anyone has any ideas!\n\nIt could also be that I just do not tolerate those active ingredients, and/or H2 blockers? Is this a thing for MCAS? Cromolyn was a bitch to titrate up on but has overall been life changing and worth it, no more symptoms from it anymore. But H2 blockers just have not been successful. i really doubt it is the mg stearate.   mg stearate is a flow agent and similar sized pills will have similar amts.  it is everywhere.  not just in loads of pharmaceuticals, but in loads of foods and cosmetics. Sometime reactions do not involve any ingredient listed on the bottle. I noticed some people in this forum say they reacted to it but I agree, like it is in my supplements and I am fine with those. I do not understand how people can say they react to specific fillers, when there are usually so many in each product. I just wondered if someone had an insight, like maybe it is like extra-strong food grade or something that would be different from the supplement version lol :'( yeah I think I maybe just do not do well with H2's. Maybe I will try another one to see if I get the same reaction. What did Cromolyn help you with ? like, almost everything. Overall less body pain is probably the biggest one- and I did not even know that was probably my number one barrier to leaving the house. I was not in constant pain but when I would go out (probably walking induced mast cell degranulation) I would inevitably start being really uncomfortable in my body after not very long. I can eat without feeling overly full and as distended, my muscle twitching is reduced, my food reactions overall reduced. I went from house bound to being able to forget I am sick for a few hours a day. Wild, it seems to be doing virtually nothing for me\n I will try 2 more weeks. Taking it for 1 week already 100mg 4x a day It is very interesting how meds work/do not work for folks. Ketotifen did nothing except make me worse. But I have heard multiple folks say you have to wait 3-6 months after you are on a full dose of cromolyn to notice all the benefits and I will say that feels true for me. My food reactions just seem to be getting better and better. I reached a full dose early October. \n\nThat said, my dose is 200mg 4x a day, and my doctor even gave me the option to go up to 300 but I stayed at 200. Not giving you advice, but you might not be noticing the effects because your dose is low? Did you notice any problems as you titrated up?", "Exercise and mast cells It seems after 6 months of a big flare where I have had crippling fatigue I seem to be coming out of the other side and getting my brain back. The major thing that is changed is I started to exercise really regularly alongside my drugs. This happened a few years ago as well and I actually did not have any symptoms at all for 12 months and did not take a single antihistamine.\n\nJust wondering what is going on? Does exercise help stabilise mast cells? Yes, in moderation- i.e. do not hit that exhaustion wall and do not get to the point you are throwing up (a la cross fit culture). \n\nIme I also need to exercise regularly or my baseline and reactions become worse. If I do not pay attention I can also trigger a reaction though. Since I used to be pretty athletic, and wish I still was, this was a bit of a learning curve. Thanks! It is all low level at the moment, I have POTS so lots of exercise intolerance so it is slow and steady wins the race. If I do cross fit I will pass out so no chance of trying that hard! I do get flushing with my rowing and Pilates but I have been building in more short walks so I get some form of movement in every day and I think that is been the key. For me, exercise is a trigger. I can go about 10 minutes before I breakout in painful hives and my airways start to swell. I think mast cell issues are a wide spectrum though so it probably varies per person. I think it is probably going to differ for everyone, but exercise is a trigger for my wife. Exercise seems to help me. I do not push to exhaustion, because, well, I am always exhausted already. But I would say it definitely helps me. :) That does not sound fun! I get some hives sometimes and flushing but nothing that severe! Is that even with something quite gentle? Exercise triggers me but adrenaline counters all my symptoms. Since you know, it is basically a low level epi pen. So if I am already feeling really bad exercise helps sometimes. But otherwise makes it worse. I can do walks with my dog or ride a bike slowly and that is fine but anything that is more high paced cardio is a trigger :/ I have other health issues now that make those symptoms feel like nothing though so I guess its all perspective.", "Is MCAS a \"rich people disease\"/is diagnosis disproportionate to rich or middle class communities? When I hear people discussing their methods for dealing with this disease, both here and other places (including the occasional news articles), I often hear things like \"I bought some new supplements to try\" or \"my significant other said that I should...\" and so on. Basically, indicators of a modestly comfortable middle class life, not that there is anything wrong with that.\n\nI am decidedly not in that demo, I tend to live a pretty poor life improvising things out of chewing gum and twine. I think of myself as smart and resourceful and so I have managed to stay alive despite many close calls. \n\nBut I am just curious, do you think that generally, people who get diagnosed with this have money, and that people in poverty are under-represented when it comes to mast cell diseases? Or is that just my misconception.\n\nIt seems to me like a ghetto doc (to put it bluntly) would be less likely to even try to pursue a MCAS(/etc) diagnosis even though it could help a patient get on the right meds, and it worries me, since it is so easy to start treating it and death is so likely without help. It worries me a lot. It is the same with a lot of other diseases, too. Also, it is so new, you have to have very forward thinking docs that are pushed by their patients to keep learning. \n\nTreating us is much harder when you are poor too. I have been broke intermittently and my health has gone backwards in those times. It sucks but it is true. I teeter on the poor lower-middle-class line, leaning heavily toward the poor side.  The doctor that diagnosed me also sees Medicaid low-income patients as my daughter is on Medicaid, and he diagnosed her as well. So I am not too sure. It might have to do with location as well as income?  But here in Arizona, it does not seem to be the case. Under represented for sure. It often takes years of searching for answers and going to specialists and getting tests done to get treated. Most low income folks are not going to be able to do that. I am low income, but no kids and live in a pretty cheap area in a lower COL city and I spend a lot of income on medical stuff. I would likely not be low income if I were \"healthy\". I have also lived in low cost of living areas. When I got diagnosed I made what is considered an average income, but with all my bills and student loans, I was hemorrhaging money. I actually had to quit my job and  find something completely out of my field so I could actually afford to live. I do not doubt that lower income areas have less access - this is due to the lack of awareness for this condition as well as a need for high density areas for major clinics to gain traction (e.g., New York, Boston) I would agree with your statement. I am on a marketplace plan (gov't subsidized healthcare in the USA) and exhausted every specialist available to me with no help or answers. It was not until a family member paid for me to go to a specialist who was cash only that I was able to get a diagnosis. I think a lot about the folks in the Mt. Sinai waiting room that were much more sick than I was, and how they are probably going to get left to die. If you are in America, the healthcare system is not for anyone who is not insanely rich. My husband is a security guard and I cannot work because of MCAS. We have got two teenagers, one of whom also has MCAS.  We have got good insurance through his job, which makes it easier to access specialists, but it is difficult to afford the copays for visits and meds sometimes. We spend a lot more on food than we did before my daughter and I got sick. I do use supplements, but I will usually get powders and fill my own capsules to save money. I actually used more supplements before my diagnosis. Probably since these communities should have more access to specialized doctors and there is more so the doctors have more time and energy to spend on difficult cases. In some senses I feel mcas and other dysautonomias are over represented in lower paying jobs (I cannot speak towards class). At least the people I have worked with. We seem to be the misfits who slip through the cracks, regardless of talent or smarts or wherever you started from. Especially given how long it takes to suspect and get diagnosed with DAs, for me at least I felt it was all I could ever do to keep working my menial job and not achieve anything. Like I never had consistent enough energy or reliability (lose interest/flares) to pursue anything where I could not bail if I needed to in a shift. \n\nWhen you do not know it is an illness, you get to thinking you are limited because of some inherent fault :/. \n\nPlus as others have said, the illness does impose certain limitations. Smart Workarounds or no. In a contest of who can grind the hardest for a promotion I would lose. I agree with your statement.\n\nWithout a family advocate, without resources to take time off work, see yet another doctor, pay another copay or worse\u2014out of pocket\u2014it is so hard to get a diagnosis and then proper treatment. In my state, many of the known MCAS specialists have private practices and do not accept insurance. \n\nYou also mentioned another financial hurdle, which is this: in order to manage the symptoms, for many people there is a fair amount of trial and error in terms of lifestyle, diet, supplements, etc. \n\nI will also mention how important it can be to take time off work to heal, work from home, etc. which is available primarily, or even exclusively, to salaried office workers.\n\nIt is a hellscape to navigate for anyone, and the lower the income the more difficult it will be. \n\nIt is all an outrage. Wy thought was always: i was lucky to have big savings that allowed me to live 8 years without a full time job. MCAS life is miserable and having no money is infinitely worse.\nI had no money to continue xolair, had to stop. I pay $250 for single dose out of pocket.\nAlso i live in Ukraine and moved to cheap city with good nature, that allowed md to mantain a good quality of life, to keep a good car. In Ukraine food/tech prices are higher comparably to USA, but everything else is cheap including free medicine(pretty useless for mcas). Two people comfortably live on $1000-1500\nLockdown become a time kf opportunity for me, ive got full time job for a descent salary and a good margin for cases where i can be sick for a week ar two. Simply saying i am expert working on minimum level job. Another point of view. I have rich friend in USA that heal his mast cell issue with the most expensive foods ))) actually it is ridiculous how much you can spend on wrong shit like supplements, spa, alt med, spiritual cleansing and travelling. So many ways to fuck it up I had the similar thought. Up to later 20s MCAS was mild and much less affected my professional growth. Now it is too hard to learn something complex. People who have shitty health from the school are doomed to be broke. One advantage of being broke with MCAS\n\nYou cannot buy supplements, harmful alt med treatments, massage, travelling. Because all this have huge chances to make MCAS worse by own hand. Now i not financially stable and i have to have simple mcas friendly food, cut off most of supplements.\n\nAs for your question i doubt MCAS have difference in prevalence in any category. Ten years ago nobody new about it. Now you can have diagnosis early and almost free if you are good using internet.\n\nMCAS is misdiagnosed for something like 20 years (in diagnosed population). You can spend years on wrong treatments. Problem is theat most of medical workers ars not interested in advances of medicine. What they learned in school is what they use the rest of their lives.\n\nInternet is one and only place that helped me to disgnose MCAS and find all information. And it actually did not cost anything. Thankz to google and sci-hub no matter how much money you have, only your reading skills matter It is hard as hell to get diagnosed right now since most doctors still do not think it exists. \n\nI had to go through one allergist, be told it does not exist, then email tmsforthecure to see if anyone in my state existed, and then drive 4 hours to get a maybe diagnosis. \n\nI am fucking privileged that I had family to drive me on an 8 hour round trip. \n\nSo that is why only rich people get diagnosed with it, you basically have to have resources to stick it out for a diagnosis right now. \n\nThis is why the other subreddit is stupid. They cannot see how privileged you have to be to even get a diagnosis.\n\nPeople without these resources do not get diagnosed (get banned from the other sub) and lose their jobs or worse from symptoms, making it even harder to be diagnosed.\n\nThe US is okay with poor people dying. How hard was it finding a doctor there to diagnose it? Sometimes it makes me wonder what the actual bad points to British-style healthcare would be. (It sounds like nobody knows for sure what would actually happen economically) Have you run into any cases when doctors do not really want to know what else the problem could be? I ran into some bad moments at St Jude's when I was younger where they just did not care if it was not relatively known. I think my worst time was when everyone thought it was depression because I was super-low energy. \"It is allergies!\" *'No, no, you are using allergies to mask that you are depressed from yourself.'*\n\nIt strikes me as weird that people have a belief problem, so often. I mean, a lot of the things that bother us would bother anybody if they were around too much of it. \n\nAnd yeah, the trial and error part stinks. It is one thing to find an advocate, for however long they might last, and tell them \"This **will** help me.\" It is another thing to say, \"uh, hey... maybe it might help, maybe it might not lololol\". People generally do not want to be hassled if they are already going out of their way, which is reality but it sucks.\n\nOn the other hand, at least a lot of the help from Google and Reddit are real people with the same real problems. If it was more common I imagine there would be a lot of shady fly-by-night companies selling weird supplements 'guaranteed' to work. I totally feel ya about the thinking it is your fault part. :/ It is really hard to cope when nothing in your entire set of life experiences gives any hint that it might *not* just be your own fault. I am glad if you are not in that space anymore!\n\nI do think it is absolutely rotten that other people with more obvious disabilities get exceptions for grinding for promotions, though. If it does not produce a neon sign over your head people will let any theory they have about you creep in. I had it pretty much all the time but for people who have late-onset I imagine it feels like a moving goalpost. You think you have your life planned out and then you get knocked over right in the prime of it. Sucks. :/ I actually forgot there was that other sub! To me there is only this one. I am sure they are good people, but to me, it creeps into identifying with a disease/needing it for validation, and requiring the proof so that you can be sure you are all special. Vomitbombs! Vomitbombs, I say!\n\nAnd I am sorry if I implied that it is any easier for people with money. As some other commenters have pointed out, money means you can make a lot more mistakes. Also, travel during a flare-up is no fun at all, yet it is the likeliest time to seek out more intensive medical help. I wonder if any people with these issues joined cults thinking they would help. Sometimes I feel thankful I am not too religious or I would have thought that it was a message from God that I needed to be a better person. Which I try to do, anyway! But I am glad I actually sought out help that... you know, actually helps! Wow, I am in your same boat as far as moving to a smaller city. The less people, civilization, etc, the better. I have actually lived in Ukraine and compared to Japan or United States (the other places I have mainly lived), even Kyiv is so beautiful and well taken-care of that I did fine. I have been to other Ukrainian cities and everything just feels to me like the Avatar movie, green and fresh and as if people want the healthy vibe to last for many generations.\n\nI am sure Ukraine has its own problems, and maybe if I spent there longer I would have gotten sick. But for a little while, the different environment itself was medicine. :)\n\nI joke with friends sometimes that if I met someone in government who could give me passport, I would move in an instant, haha.\n\nNever come to America! Just kidding. But the cities have so many ways that factories can make pollution and old piece of junk cars are still what most people use. I wish more people upvoted your comment! You are so right. If I was rich I would have a home gym with 15 exercise machines promising good health that I do not use, and a kitchen filled with supplements that made me feel strange. I am glad I did not get sucked down that rabbit hole. Wow, where in Arizona? I was under the impression that doctors who are aware of mast cell diseases and likely to diagnose them, are very rare. So I am quite curious. I wish someone would do something about the healthcare system. What was the doctor you saw like? When I was shopping for doctors, the ones who believed me were almost always small practices in little buildings, tucked away like Narnia. who knows if it works, but I just went to a doctor that uses \u201cbiofeedback\u201d to test your supplements on you before you do trial and error with yourself. First time I had a practitioner tell me \u201ctake one and see\u201d is a horrible approach. I really hope that clinics for low income populations would spread awareness, because I feel like people who have to live in less-than-perfect conditions are more likely to have serious complications. It is like the COVID vaccine. We need to give care to poor people first, they need it most.\n\nTo rich people who let this kind of atrocity happen, I say, what if you are killing off the next Beethoven or Picasso? Everyone deserves a chance to show the world what they can give.\n\n(Sorry, that just sort of came out. Not directed at you, at all. :) I just keep thinking how glad I am that your daughter has you as an advocate. I did not have supportive parents (my parents said it was a lack of \"nerve and gumption\" and made me do a lot of manual labor to try to grow it out of me) and I am so happy that someone else will have a chance to live in a world where their family was supportive.\n\nI am curious what powders you use and how much they help? Oh wow, nice. I should really look into that. Do you have any links about it?\n\nI have heard of biofeedback before but it sounds like your practitioner really gets detailed readings. I will let the original commenter answer if they come back around, but having several friends in Russia and surrounding countries, my guess is that either they found a doctor who prides themselves on knowing about rare disorders (it seems to be more common to find a doctor who actually enjoys medicine in Europe) or because a lot of prescription drugs can be bought over-the-counter in those countries, there is a bit more of a \"do it yourself\" culture, so it might be self-diagnosed. This is her website, and the part that talks about it. \n\nIt is my first experience with this technology, so I do not have any real results to report. I felt much better after the measuring process itself though, which she said was not unusual (their is an electrical signal being experienced by your body in the process.) Very interesting. Oh no, it was a good question. It makes me angry, but I am not angry at you. There usually are incentives to get people to work in lower income areas. It is just a matter of whether people take them. Yes, especially with my connective tissue issues. I had pain, dislocations, and excessive injuries for about 15 years that were all brushed off. My allergy and breathing symptoms were misdiagnosed and mistreated for years as well. It can be incredibly difficult to get your health issues taken seriously, especially when you are young and especially when you are female, and I have heard the same goes for people of color. I think the issue is less to do with the patients income as it does maybe their environment. I grew up a bit rough and my parents far rougher than I. My grandparents lived in slums some times abandoned buildings and waited in bread lines during the Great Depression. Each generation had a very different degree of exposure to things that maybe considered aristocratic like science, mathematics, art, law, economics. Being my family\u2019s first college graduate I had a very different vocabulary and knowledge base than my grandmother and I am not talking about secular generational stuff. \n\nI am also a nurse who has worked in some of the poorest cities in my country. Being poor does not make you stupid, I was poor for a long time. Being poor especially in the city seems to be insular - always preoccupied with the struggle it seems. My patients seem to feel that way as well. It is not that they are outwardly denied opportunity but cannot take the time to capitalize on them. \n\nLots of people cannot afford to be sick, they cannot afford to take time off, they work jobs without benefits or workers rights. But for under $100/yr you can effectively treat MCAS. It is lots of avoidance, dietary and lifestyle modifications but medication is often required. Take Xolair for instance - there is a high likelihood it will cost you zero dollars Thanks to Xolair access solutions. Xolair is like $2000 a month or more without it or insurance. For instance I found 180 generic Allegra tablets for $30 a bottle, you can find 200 tablets of generic Pepcid for under $20 easily - 6 months worth of medicine comes to $50. You can trap, and trade pelts for that easily. Squirrel tail fly fishing lures sell for like $5-10 depending on the quality and market. Daily bag limits are almost high enough that you can manage to make enough in a week for a years supply of medicine. \n\nThen there is the obscurity of MCAS and mast cell diseases. I cannot tell you how many people come here with a primary care doctor and one or more specialist in their care team yet none of them knew about MCAS. There is a general lack of abundantly available care for us. So if you lack transportation, relegated to a bus line and have no internet then how are you suppose to find a proper doctor? But is MCAS Ike gout was during the time of royalty and agrarian fiefdoms? No it is not a \u201crich man\u2019s disease\u201d. Proper diagnosis does take resources. \n\nRegarding experimentation which I view as a separate issue altogether. Those are just people looking to maximize their quality of life or are just being obstinate about taking antihistamines and conventional pharmaceuticals. That is their prerogative I guess but from my own personal experience it is just endangering themselves and drawing out the inevitable. Taking the medications is fundamental. Taking supplements is just a way to make things a bit more tolerable. Economically we would see massive layoffs in the insurance industry by going to a single payor system. But if you ask Canadians how their NHS is going the answer might be shocking. I have got a buddy waiting over 18mos for an abdominal MRI where I can walk into any hospital or imaging center same day. Do I pay sure but do does my Canadian friend and he is not even getting the services he is so highly taxed on. \n\nHospitals in America are fueled by insurance payments. An entire industry would be at the whims of the government. What if the government shuts down like it almost just did over the omnibus and covid relief packages? Does surgery stop? Do doctors and nurses not get paid? \n\nOur free market healthcare has helped create the best medical schools and hospitals. This puts pressure on undergraduate studies as well. Yes America\u2019s primary school system sucks but we have some of the best undergraduate and graduate programs on any field in the world. When Saudi royalty fly to the US for surgery you know you have done something right because money is no object to them they just want the best. \n\nDr Ben Carson makes the most compelling argument for nationalized healthcare in that Medicare is the most efficient form of healthcare. The amount of hours wasted on paperwork at CMS compared to one of the big three insurance agencies is a fraction - I think a third of time. But efficiency does not equal quality. I have watched people be denied by Medicare for services they required. I have seen what happens if you do not carry supplemental insurance like Humana after you retire. The Phoenix metro area.  It is not just one doctor and they have several locations. I would have to agree that they are/were rare.  I have had these symptoms starting at 13 and getting worse since, and I finally got diagnosed last year.  I am 45. I have taken different supplements depending on my symptoms at the time. I use Micro Ingredients brand from Amazon. I took boswellia for a while, it helps with shortness of breath. Quercetin and bacopa are mast cell stabilizers, but I did not tolerate quercetin and bacopa did not do much. I still take ashwagandha. It helps with brain fog and with anxiety during reactions. I am also taking choline and inositol, but I get that as capsules instead of filling my own.\n\nI think it is easy for me to advocate for my daughter because we have the same disease and see the same doctor. Her first diagnosis was cholinergic urticaria. If I did not also have MCAS, I probably would not have suspected she had more than CU. He was out in the suburbs of Chicago in an old strip mall. Kind Of weird tbh. Not to get political but I do not think healthcare is going to get better unless control is wrested from politicians who only answer to corporations :/ No", "Extended mask wearing - lung pain? (this is NOT about COVID conspiracy theories) Hi all,  \n\nI get unexplained lung soreness from time to time.  \nIt does not really match up with any of my other health issues, but sometimes they just get so sore to inflate. \n\nIt is not debilitating and I can breathe fine - but just the inhaling and exhaling is painful - and in particularly bad flareups even just my chest moving around as I change position hurts a bit.  \n\nI had the wondering, do you think this could in any way be related to extended mask wearing?  \n\nI wear a mask a lot of the time to help filter out triggers. But now with COVID I use it even more. The inside of the mask is often damp by the end of the day and I have to sit it on the heater to dry it off.  \n(I have reusable ones)  \n\nIt is so hard to find real information on this, as most things you find are focusing on the misinformation about masks affecting your O2 levels etc related to COVID - so it all drowns out any real info that might exist.  \n\nLet me say straight up that I am not talking about all the COVID conspiracist ideas about not being able to breathe properly in masks, or them causing pleuracy, etc etc.  \n\nAs far as I am concerned there is no health issue using a mask long term. But I did wonder how this relates to my lung pain episodes and if there may be some link. Cannot really answer you are specific question, but it probably is not a good idea to be breathing in moisture from your mask. Personally I would swap to fresh one halfway through the day to avoid this. Hi, if you are a smoker or vape user etc, could be the formation of blebs which can rupture in certain circumstances, can also lead to a lung collapse (spontaneous pneumathorax).Which sounds to me similar to what youre experiencing. not saying it is the case, but seriously, if youre having issues breathing, dont minimize, dont catastrophise either, just get it checked out, because it might be a pulled musle. But it may be signs of something more seriously amiss and i wouldnt muck round with your lungs. my 2 cents worth.. Thanks. \nNot a smoker or vaper. all good, my best guess is still that, or trapped gas, or pulled muscle. I would definitely try sitting up right and forcing a burp to see if it helps, took me a couple of hospital visits, and a diagnosis of pluresy untill i found that was my key issue (gas build puts pressure on lungs, exacerbated by certain postures.) Not precisely your question, but I am struck by your describing your masks as  damp. Here is some info about wearing wet/damp masks:\n\n\n\n (This almost contradicts the prior link re: moisture, but maybe there is a difference between wet and damp?  I do not quite know how to reconcile. Probably a good idea to discuss with your doctor\u2026in fact, I agree with another commenter that you should bring all of this up with your doc.) Try using disposable ones. They filter better anyway and they should stay dry. Is the new problem in your lungs constant or triggered?  If you drive to a different location, does the problem go away?  If so, does the problem return when you drive back? If the new symptom is triggered, it could be a change in the existing illness. \n\nI once used masks for a time, but eventually the mask was not able to prevent symptoms.  I had to move to a different location to get relief. I had this before I went in montelukast. I had thousands of Leukotrienes in my system and these are most commonly involved in respiratory responses. I describe it as a heaviness in my chest and effortful breathing. I have anaphylaxis as my primary MCAS problem, though so this may or may not be relevant to you. \n\n\n\nIf you have been experiencing this prior to COVID-19 and mask wearing, consider asking your doc about the symptoms and if there is a link between your primary symptoms and the chest soreness. I have used masks for the last 8 years of my life. I sometimes have lung pain but I am a girl so usually it is that I have a bra on so it is pressing on my ribcage/lung area which is tender/swollen slightly. Maybe mild costochondritis? Get checked for that possibly. Can confirm though that I also have (severe) MCAS and have no problems from mask wearing. Unless the mask is soaked- then it is too wet to use without a ton of effort. The other times I have had lung pain it is never been masks but it has been issues with breathing in gas of some kind, breathing in particles I react to, etc.\n\nAre you washing your masks? Maybe particles are building up if not. Are your masks filtering a lot of the particles you react to out? If not it could be that. Thanks I appreciate you sharing your experience.  \nI agree I do not think it would be the mask - but I thought it worth asking others.  \n\nI have a lot of inflammatory stuff going on in various places. I think maybe when I am having an inflammation flare (even if I do not notice it elsewhere), the inflammation affects my chest/lungs. I guess that would make it intermittent mild pleurisy.  \n\nI also get indigestion during flare ups sometimes, which I know can mask as lung pain - although that is distinctly different to the kind that feels like your lung walls are hurting as they expand/contract when you inhale/exhale.  \n\n(below here is not a reply specifically to you /u/Razirra - this is general)  \nIt is funny these people that say get it checked by a doc. Not stupid advice at all. But when you have a chronic condition (It is believed I have CIRS from mold infectioin) - of which MCAS is just one set of symptoms - you get so many things that you should get checked you would be at the doc every other day.  \n\nAnd TBH most GP's will not know what to make of it because they are ill-equipped to recognise chronic conditions. They are just good at recognising and treating acute conditions. Thanks for the reply.  \nI just have pain, no difficulty breathing.  \nIn fact I can blow 700 L/min on my peak flow meter. Hi,  \nNo it does not appear to be location based.  \n\nIn the past it has flared at the same time as I have had symptoms relating to lower GI dysbiosis (3+hr after eating a meal)  \n\nAt that time I think there is a lot of inflammation and mediators floating around my blood as my system reacts to food and bacterial interactions.  \n\nI am guessing it is general inflammation related - maybe pleurisy.  \nBut it was really bad yesterday - had it all day. It could be something called costochondritis. Try laying completelt flat on your back with a heating pad on your chest. It may not work but it should not hurt. You can google costochondritis. Also I would agree with talking to your doctor and maybe a box of the thinner disposable medical masks. I just get them on Amazon.\nEdited to add : For costochondritis you would need to lie down without a pillow and you have to wait a few minutes for the difficulty to subside. So your lungs are actually like your brain: there are no nerve endings, so the pain you are feeling is not in the lungs themselves.\n\nI wonder if it is muscle pain. You breathe harder for a long time, and you are out and about doing stuff...could it be intercostals or your diaphragm or another muscle that is working harder? Pleurisy sounds right. When there is inflammation going on the lung lining that is supposed to be viscous and allow expansion freely, starts to catch and rub - so you get that frictiony burny type of pain as you inhale/exhale.  \n\nThat is to say, the lungs may not have nerve endings but the lining apparently does.  \n\nThere is something called costochondritis that could contribute also.", "Returning to in-office work First post. Diagnosed with MCAS about 5 weeks ago. Been treated for Lyme the last 6 months. Been trying to figure out why I always feel unwell for years. Also have allergies to fruit and am vegetarian so I have been trying to figure out what food works for me.\n\nAnyway, I have been lucky enough to have been able to work full time remotely since  March 2020. Just got the notice today that all remote workers are due to return to working in the office full time next month. I am freaking out! Worried about driving 2 hours a day and losing my routines and access to eating fresh. My office does not even have a break room. Just a sad fridge that is gross and an even grosser microwave. What if people there are not vaccinated. My office location is very warm and I sweat all day.\n\nI need advice or somewhere to turn. Thanks! You may have to do whatever you need to do to make an income while looking for another way to work from home. I would ask to stay at home if possible. If not, I would usually cook a lot on Sunday fresh foods and freeze them in small containers for lunch and dinner the rest of the week. I feel you. I have MCAS and am being treated for mold tox. Also have lots of food sensitivity including fruit. I have been working from home thankfully not returning to site in the foreseeable future. But I understand the frustration of now having to figure out a way to prepare meals and such. It is truly a frustrating illness. I am sorry. I know I felt better when I was working from home. I got pulled back to In person work in October 2020 before vaccine was available. I know it is stressful regardless of when people go back. it is a shock. I did eat in my car to avoid unmasking/eating. Besides pre packing  meals as other poster suggested you may also want to look into car cooler/warmer 12 volt coolers some even have an electrical outlet. Do you have an area by your desk were you could put it? Or if you are able to use it in the car this may help keep your food warm/cold fresh based on need. Truckers often use these as well.\n\nGood luck", "what doctor would be most helpful for possible Dysautonomia? a neurologist?  I went to a neurologist who specializes in dysautonomia. Regular cardiologist ruled some stuff out and diagnosed based on what was left. It was the dysautonomia neurologist who helped me out with everything and even diagnosed me with MCAS. You want someone board certified in autonomic medicine. This is a very small pool of practitioners, with about 2/3rds considered to be neurologists and the remainder being cardiologists, electrophysiologists, or electrophysiological cardiologists.\n\nSome of the best resources for this are the physician lists and maps from the ( ( and ( Although these are primarily U.S. based organizationals, they all have some degree of international reach. My main treating doctor is a cardiologist, they are an electrophysiologist specifically, and they work in a neurocardiology team. thanks so much thank you so so much wow really. thanks for sharing", "Hi... new here.... Thinking I may have mast cell disease. How have you all been diagnosed??? 7 allergists, 3 different primary care doctors, 5 different orthopedic specialists, a rheumatologist, and a urologist. Almost a decade of journaled and logged anaphylactic episodes including about a dozen trips to the ER and a copy of Dr. Afrin\u2019s \u201cNever Bet Against Occam: Mast Cell Activation Disease and the Modern Epidemics of Chronic Illness and Medical Complexity\u201d.\n\nI called every allergy and immunology doctor in my state and asked if they dealt with diagnosing Mast Cell disorders. I finally found one who had heard of Mast Cell disorders and am now being treated for one while we try to get the tests to back it up. My doctors have not officially called it MCAS yet but my immunologist also got me into a rheumatologist to rule out autoimmune diseases (surprise, I have one!) and a urologist to make sure my chronic UTI pain with no infection is MCAS related and not something more sinister.\n\nUntil they can confirm it is MCAS and they identify what autoimmune issues are going on I am diagnosed with Chronic Idiopathic Uriticaria, Angioneurotic Edema, Intersistial Cystitis, Non-Specific Diffuse Autoimmune Syndrome, Anxiety, Depression, and anaphylactic allergies.\n\nI take two to six times the dose of over the counter second generation H1 antihistamines with an H2 antihistamine, anxiety medicine, Benadryl as needed, epinephrine as needed, and an albuterol inhaler as needed. Welcome to the club nobody wants to join!\n\nI saw a terrible allergist who told me my symptoms were all in my head. Then I refused to go to another doctor for a couple years, and got sicker and sicker. I joined a MCAS group on Facebook and used their doctor list to find a local doctor. She is been wonderful. I had a million blood tests and a bone marrow biopsy. I have monoclonal mast cell disease. I take Zyrtec twice a day, ranitidine twice a day, Allegra twice a day, cromolyn 4 times a day, Flonase &amp; azelastine twice a day, and albuterol if I need. Oh and of course epipens. Hmmm interesting, i have never had a bone marrow biopsy. Who does that? I had a blood draw and I had low alkaline phosphate, I think that has something to do with bone marrow.. Does the Facebook group use the same list as the main website? My state has nobody on there. No, it is a list that group members submitted. There are a bunch of MCAS groups on FB, the one with the list where I found my doctor is Mast Cell(Activation) Disorders Forum. I was feeling HORRIBLE and the o ly diagnosis I got was Hashimotos (well co trolled) and POTS (not controlled) so I went to a dysautonomia specialist. He asked me a ton of questions about symptom history and went, \"have you ever heard of mast cell disease?\" I didnt think I had it because I never had anaphylaxis and didnt get horrible hives. Did all the testing. All negative. He said 40% of tests are false negatives and wanted me to try a mast cell stabilizer. Bless that man. It changed my life. Also I am pretty sure uncontrolled MCAS causes my POTS. I would pretty sure you need a positive MCAS blood test to yet a bone marrow biopsy. For what my hematologist (who specializes in mast cell disorders) said to me, a bone marrow biopsy is necessary to make a true mastocytosis diagnosis, opposed to a simple Mast Cell Activation Syndrome.\n\nIf I understood correctly, in \"true\" mastocytosis, mast cells are overly abundant and aggregate in organs, make them dysfunctional. And the only way to make sure you have that is with a biopsy. Except for cutaneous mastocytosis, because then it is visible on your skin. I saw a functional medicine doctor who had all the tests done, but she did not feel she could do a diagnosis and told me to find a specialist. 2 allergists were useless. I found an internist who specializes in MCAS though a MCAS facebook group. He did the diagnosis but sent me back to a PCP for treatment. He did suggest treatment. I still feel like most of it is up to me. Meds have helped quite a lot. Thanks for the advice! Hey thanks for responding, I will check it out. I have been diagnosed with IBS, Intersticial Cystitis, Anxiety, Depression, PFD and possibly an Autoimmune disease and maybe Mast Cell Disease. That is next on my list to get checked out. I have been to the doctors countless times thinking I have a UTI and there is no bacteria found, do you suspect that yours is from Mast Cell Disease?? What doctor diagnosed you with yours?? Tryptase? Is that just from a regular total blood count test or I should say full blood panel? They told me I have macrocystosis, enlarged blood cells, could this be caused by Mast Cell Disease? What is Pots? Hey thanks for the advice! Hematologist/oncologist did the bone marrow biopsy and my Immunologist analyzed the results and diagnosed me My interstitial cystitis and UTI symptoms are 100% gone when I am on mast cell stabilizing medicines or even simple OTC antihistamines. There is ongoing studies trying to link interstitial cystitis to mast cell disorders. I have also been diagnosed in the past with IBS, depression, and anxiety as well. All of my symptoms seem connected to the unknown autoimmune factors and/ or mast cell issues. Since the mast cell issues are treated almost identically to Chronic Idiopathic Uriticaria, idiopathic anaphylaxis, and edema I am not all that concerned about where the diagnosis lands. My goal now is to reduce symptoms, stay as healthy as I can for as long as I can, and to continue trying to advocate for myself to medical specialists who have no idea what is going on in my body. Absolutely no idea. From what the Wikipedia says (  ), it is not listed as a direct cause. But inflammation of the digestive track is. **Macrocytosis**\n\nMacrocytosis is the enlargement of red blood cells with near-constant hemoglobin concentration, and is defined by a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of greater than 100 femtolitres (the precise criterion varies between laboratories). The enlarged erythrocytes are called macrocytes or megalocytes (both words have roots meaning \"big cell\"). As a symptom its cause may be relatively benign and need no treatment or it may indicate a serious underlying illness.\n\n***\n\n^(( | )( | )( | )( | )( ] Downvote to remove | v0.28) Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome Its definitely a separate test. Okay, good to know. Thanks so much! Hey that is great advice, thank you SO much for all of your help. What OTC antihistamines do you use?? Yeah, I do not drink alcohol so that is why I suspect it may be an underlying disease. Not sure why it is high!! Okay, I will look it up... never heard of it! Okay, I will look into that. Thanks so much!!! No problem!! My daily medicine routine when I am at baseline is Zyrtec and Pepcid in the am, Allegra and Pepcid at night, and Benadryl as needed throughout the day. My doses are variable based on how bad my symptoms are. I buy my antihistamines at Sam\u2019s or Costco in bulk.\n\nI also take an SSRI at night for the anxiety and depression and get a 300 mg Xolair injection once a month. I can afford the $2500 a month Xolair thanks to my allergist petitioning my insurance to let them know it is medically necessary. They made a formulary exception based on a decade of medical records. I have a $250 copay. With the manufacturers copay assistance program I pay none of the copay and they pay my doctors injection fee. I hope it helps.

She intentionally leads zombies to her parents and watches with satisfaction as the zombies attack and kill her parents right in front of her.\n\nOf course I would never kill my parents IRL, but this fantasy is very helpful to me at moments like this. Yeah, I would never want to see my mom die from zombies but I absolutely have gotten so frustrated that once or twice I told her I hope she dies in a fire.\n\nOf course that is under extreme circumstances usually after us getting in a big fight where she curses me three or four times, acts like I do not have an illness, the list of like probably 10 things that she does on a regular basis, and actually I find that sometimes when I post these, yeah it does help other people in some weird way understand that we all have parents who do this kind of stuff or other loved ones..

Odd question but I find a lot of people like her are actually narcissists. Any chance that that may be the case? I agree with OP. I do not think age is relevant here. Yes, I have heard from dozens of people at this point throughout my life that she most likely as a narcissist, I have not even told her that people say she has a narcissist and that just makes her more mad. I agree. Yeah. If she is a narc she probably would lash out at you for saying that to her. So do not tell her everyone thinks she is a narcissist! Even if you did, she would not listen.  Lol\n\nI would check out /r/raisedbynarcissists to see how you can cope with these types of people. \n\nFYI: I have a parent that was a narcissist. I was abused. In addition, my SO has a narcissistic parent and she was abused much of her life. \n\nI pretty much cut all contact as it is pretty stressful dealing with a narc. okay you are awesome, you know what my frequent recent worry is as that because my mom is a narcissist that apparently I am a narcissist and I actually probably in a bad way. Well one thing to keep in mind ... everyone has narcissistic tendencies. Some people more so than others. The problem with narcissistic tendencies is when they start becoming more malignant and envelope your entire personality. (\n\nIf you have NPD, then there is not so much you can do really other than CBT and self-awareness. A person with NPD will likely never admit that they have the disorder nor would they ever seek out help for it ... because simply people with NPD, will never acknowledge that there is a problem with themselves. \n\nTrump...our beloved orange idiot US president... totally has NPD.  I do not think anyone in the mental health field would ever disagree that he is entirely a textbook case. We have not had a president in some time where NPD is blatantly obvious... And most politicians - leaders - managers fit the spectrum of sociopathy and/or narcissistic.\n\nEdit: Additionally keep in mind that narcissistic tendencies ..and most NPD people have traits that are inherently learned through others. One of my grandparents was pretty narcissistic and I suspect that that is how my father became who he is (which is a self-loving, self-centered bastard ...lol).  The same case with my SO, who has a mother who has NPD, where it is blatantly obvious that her grandparents are both narcissists. ... however, some children of narcissistic parents do not ever become narcissists because they are essentially the victims of abuse... victims of NPD people usually suffer from other mental health problems such as (low self esteem, PTSD, OCD, borderline personality disorder, bipolar mania, depression). \n\nIf you are scared that you are a narcissist, the first part is ever so recognizing it for what it is. Most narcs will not even get that far. Thank you, love and healing to you too", "SLEEP SLEEP SLEEP!!!?? What can I take to relax myself to sleep without extra drowsyness?

I want to get healthy or healthier and alcohol is just keeping me in a rut.\n\nUnfortunately when I am I missing out on sleep and I have brain fog and fatigue it is the one thing that will catch me right back up.\n\nI would rather have a hangover and feel completely rested than brain fog and fatigue and feel unrested.\n\nBut there is got to be another way, it is at night time I just want to be able to sleep without my brain running a hundred miles an hour, and the next day when I wake up and I have brain fog and fatigue, I want to be able to just get through it with meditation and continue on with my day, but right now I am in a rut because I am trying to put alcohol and it is causing my insomnia to increase because now I am taking away my coping mechanism in my brain is not happy.\n\nI have been called kava, I have been told ashwagandha, I have been told l-theanine, all this kind of stuff.\n\nI cannot take something like an Ativan, number one yes that is going to be addictive if I take it all the time and number 2 it just gives me the most brutal crappy garbage feeling the next day.\n\nAll I want, all I really want, is something that I can take before bed that will help me chill out, calm down, have my nerves relaxed, and I will fall asleep on my own.\n\nDoes that even exist?\n\nif it is something that is going to make me tired I am going to freak out. when I start to feel unnaturally drowsy, because of my fatigue issues over the years, my brain goes into fight or flight mode. Not good.\n\nSo I just need something that is going to help my mind mostly, and my body secondly, to just relax and go ahhhhhhhhhh. And I will do the rest.\n\nDoes that exist? I would try clonidine, tenex or attarax I will look them up. I take low dose hydroxyzine. It helps knock me out and it is an antihistamine. Is not that like benedryl?  Have you tried CBD ? I have not found drugs that bring on sleep for me without the kind of side-effects that you are talking about. But a 10-minute guided sleep meditation can truly work wonders. I am sure there are free ones on YouTube and Spotify... But I really like the Headspace app, which is really a turnkey solution that does all the work for you.\n\nWith a subscription (or trial, or covid access package), you open the app, hit sleep, and if all goes well end up both sleeping and feeling great.\n\nBonus: Their daytime meditations are also extremely turnkey and are great for both dealing with stress and improving overall quality of life. Nothing that I have seen on the app lasts for longer than 10 minutes, and some of them are as short as 3min. Generally, yes. As sleep-aids, both Benadryl and Hydroxyzine are first-generation H1 antihistamines which work by passing into the brain and blocking the effect of histamine on the sleep-wake cycle.\n\nBenadryl has gotten a lot of attention for being an anticholinergic (a drug that blocks the effects of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine), with studies suggesting that long-term daily use can increase the risk of dementia. Hydroxyzine is also an anticholinergic, albeit a much weaker one than benadryl, and has also been implicated in those dementia studies.\n\nI have seen reports that suggest hydroxyzine might be better tolerated and have fewer side-effects, but it also lasts for longer so might have the potential to cause daytime drowsiness.\n\nAs mentioned elsewhere, between the two, I would recommend meditation. ;) Cannot. Ib have to most likely get regular drug tests and unless I am 100% certain they have zero thc I will drop dirty. I already left meditate lol. I am looking to get by with a little help from some friends. I take L-Theanine from Pure Encapsulations. It is great. Ah shoot. Sorry to hear and sorry that I missed that in the post. Also, your wording here is hilarious. I took some last night, with a little bit of ashwagandha oh, and I did not notice any effect but I seemed to sleep okay Haha. Yea. Actually I spend a lot of time meditating because every day when I get my brain fog oh, I will lay down and meditate to clear it out. It does not always work but it does work a lot. It is been a sanity saver for sure Panthotenic acid, because it helps with a functioning melatonin metabolism. (Sleep-wake-cycle.) I take 10mg hydroxyzine twice a day (it is the only H1 I can tolerate) and it does not have any effect in terms of making me sleepy. But I have night terrors almost every night due to mast-cell histamine dumps, and I was looking for something to help with that that was not MORE hydroxyzine or Benadryl or a benzo. So far, the L-Theanine has not caused any reactions for me, and it seems to be helping with the night terrors/histamine dumps. Well shit. I take Benadryl every night. Time to switch I guess Well hey let us be clear here: (1) I am not a doctor, (2) you are talking about a relative increase in risk, not any sort of certain outcome, and (3) all medicine has side-effects of various sorts. It is just a matter of whether the benefit outweighs the risks/costs, right? Oh I understand. I would just literally never heard that before. I am willing to try something else though if it does not have an increased risk of dimensia I work so my doctor has me taking claritin during the day and then has me taking zyrtec before bed since it causes drowsiness. I sleep like a baby. There is LOTS of pure CBDs these days. And if you are sober, you will metabolize any contamination from small amounts of THC in a day. Bless you. I used to get those after crashing related to smoking weed that would last for months. I never knew why. At least we know now.  I remember having to tell (imagine) myself stories to distract my mind so I could fall asleep.\n\n\n\nThis disease sucks. I will have to look that one up. Another sleep aide that has great (unadvertised) antihistamine activity is Trazadone. It is originally a tricyclic antidepressant, but it is been found to be sedating. I notice it just gives me an excellent and even sense of peace and a pleasant feeling of being ready for rest. I do not take it nightly, though. I had a stent where I took it for a full week, and I did not think there was any grogginess. Yeah, but if it is got any THC at all and they take it nightly but get tested the next day...\n\nI know some say they are 0.0000% no THC, but I would not believe it and risk losing my job. It is not a tricyclic\n\n&gt; Trazodone also may increase directly the action of serotonin. Trazodone is chemically unrelated to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) or the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO inhibitors). It is chemically related to nefazodone (Serzone) and shares its actions. The FDA approved trazodone in 1981. Take a low dose tricyclic antidepressant at bedtime. Doxepin would be ideal because it is also an antihistamine.\n\nYou could try melatonin. I take 3 mg. Then I put on some very soothing sleep music. Youtube has tons of the stuff. \n\nGet up at the same time everyday 7 days a week and get plenty of morning sun. Do not have caffeine after lunchtime. If your mind is racing write things down and tell yourself that you will have plenty of time to think about them in the morning. Under the BNF it is listed with the tricyclics and under most pharmaceutical texts. It is chemically different and should be in its own category. But for explanation purposes it is often explained to be a tricyclic.", "Does anyone photophobia? My doctor thinks my wife may have MCAS. She has many symptoms but her primary issue is that she is very sensitive to light. The photophobia causes migraines. Does anyone else have this issue? Mine comes and goes.  At least it gets worse and better.  I have had it where I just have to hide in a dark room for hours.\n\nFunnily I have been trying to figure out lately if I am normal or not in a related area...  When it is sunny out I cannot look at the horizon without either pain, closing one eye, or wearing sunglasses.  Think this has always been true for me, but it does not seem normal.\n\nHave not asked an eye doctor yet about it, but it would be neat to know what a normal threshold for pain from sunlight is.  I did mention it to the same PCP that brought up MCAS, but I do not think he understands this is not a new issue (said to see if it goes away). Is this sunlight or indoor light? I have a problem with fluorescent light I think, for example being at most offices or stores for long periods of time flares up my symptoms and give me migraines and dizziness. I have not figured out if that is related to mcas though This is a huge issue for me. I wear sunglasses all the time. I found theraspecs so I wear those inside instead. But I found that treating my MCAS with a mast cell stabilizer made this so much more tolerable. I still have issues with bright overhead lights like in grocery stores, but I find I am able to go days without needing to wear sunglasses or the theraspecs. Thank you so much for your feedback. My wife says it is nice to know she is not alone. She is going to ask her doctor about cromolyn. Photophobia sucks! Do you just use the nasal spray cromolyn or is there a pill form? It is an oral solution you mix with water. Little plastic vials of cromolyn sodium. I dont use the nasal spray. It is the worst! I hope it helps her! Yes I am very light sensitive and get migraines even with dark sunglasses and large brimmed hats, although I can last longer outside with them than without, it is very limiting Thank you for responding. It helps my wife wife to not feel so alone and also helps us believe the diagnosis of MCAS. \n\nI am so sorry to hear thar you suffer from photophobia. My wife also wear ridiculously large wide brimmed hats at all times. It really sucks. I hope you start to feel better soon! Tell her to put on a sundress and embrace the fancy hat look, if she believes it is a choice rather than a necessity then it does not feel as awkward and cumbersome... Edit, do not mean to sound pushy just offering ideas that helped me \u201cI love it. I do my best to get dolled if I go out in spite of having two pairs of dark glasses on. I try to just embrace it and enjoy myself in spite of how crazy I might look to others.\u201d  - my wife\n\nShe wears red tinted theraspecs over over her sunglasses outdoors and over her normal glasses indoors. They are enormous. ", "Taking antihistamines for over a month.. Hey all, so I have been to multiple doctors about some issues I am having. I have been to an immunologist, my very experienced PCP, and a gi doctor, both the immunologist and PCP assured me that it is very unlikely I have any mcad. I find myself questioning them though because they are not specialists on it. I have started taking vitamin d, c, magnesium, and both zyrtec and pepcid twice a day to see if that would help me feel any better. I have been taking all of these for over a month now and I do not feel any better. I have also limited my diet and changed things but none of the things I have done have really made a difference. I have read that diagnosis of a mcad requires a response to histamine receptor blockers and I seem to not be having much of a response at all. If anything, I feel worse after taking them. Is this something I should therefore trust my doctors on and stop trying to connect things to MCAD? I also am not really having recurrent, severe episodes in multiple symptoms at a time if that helps. A couple things, first what kind of vit c? Did you check ingredients of other supliments for potentially triggering ingredients? If there isnt a dr that suspects mast cell issues, then you could try stopping the zrytec or pecid and see if you get worse Before I went to the allergist/Immunologist I stopped taking all antihistamines for a week and did not notice much of a difference at all. You would likely notice a difference, have you had the urine tests? Not really. My immunologist did a tryptase test on me and seemed to not be concerned at all about mcad. My PCP also did some tests on me such as bloodwork, and physical examinations of my skin, lymph nodes, spleen, etc and he also said it was quite unlikely. Neither are experts on mast cells, but they were aware of them and the related conditions and did not seem like they were concerned at all. Part of me thinks I am just connecting dots that are not there to be honest You very well may be but the standard tests are 24 hr urine analysis and the tryptase blood test would likely only be very high during an anaphylatic type episode. You may want to ask your allergist about the 24 hr urine and if it is normal then you are probably better off looking for a different cause Can you have it without anaphylatic episodes? I do not really seem to be having those that I have really noticed Anaphylatic episodes arent always the typical throat itching and swelling, sometimes it is a drop in blood pressure and impending sense of doom for example. Occasional stomach discomfort does not equal MCAS. Episodes are recurrent. 70% have flushing/redness as part of the episodes. Two or more body systems must be involved. Fatigue and concentration are only considered IN ADDITION to other symptoms. Check The Mastocytosis Society website for additional symptom and trigger information. I do not have any of those either so I am not sure when I can time tests. So without severe episodes it is unlikely? My doctors seem to think it is quite unlikely for me, I am just worried because so many people say that most doctors are not aware of the disorder Maybe you have histamine intolerance, its like mild mast cell activation. Do you react to alot of foods? Histamines? Oxalates? Salicylates? It is unlikely because you do not have symptoms in two or more body systems and your symptoms did not improve with traditional, first line, gold standard treatment. Primary care doctors may not be familiar with MCAS, but allergy/immunology should know it well. It is presented at allergy/immunology conferences and medical journals. Mine knew it well and is not a \u201cspecialist.\u201d\n\nPlus: two doctors said you do not have it. \n\nI honestly do not know why people cannot accept that they do not have MCAS. In my case it is because I read stuff by Dr. Afrin and my God it is broad. Everything can be a symptom so I start connecting dots that may or may not be related. Not really. I have never really had these problems before and have never had weird reactions to stuff like medicines or chemicals What made you suspect mast cell? Oxalates, histamines salicylates are all in foods naturally, they are not added chemicals Dr Afrin\u2019s list of \u201csymptoms\u201d were not adopted into the consensus statement for exactly the reason you describe. Too broad, too generalized, and often contradictory. When I read the list, I literally laughed. The consensus decided on Dr Cem Akin\u2019s description and recommendation instead.

I apologize in advance for the long setup to this question...\nWe are currently seeking official diagnoses and treatment for my wife. As I mentioned in one of my more recent posts, my wife's new allergist does not believe she has a Mast Cell Disorder, but is open-minded about it. Over the weekend my wife had to go to the ER for low potassium and her labs were drawn. We had also had them drawn at home, but were still waiting on the results. Her visit was potassium related, but some other numbers were off as well. \nHer ALT was 163 (normal is between 13 and 61) and her AST was 60 (normal is between 10 and 37). Both of these relate to the liver. According to her PCP, the labs they drew at home were actually higher. I talked to her PCP this morning (who does not really know much about mas cell but is absolutely awesome, open-minded, and willing to learn). She said that the things that would also be out of whack if this was something to be worried about (ex. WBC) were normal and that she does not have a life style that makes her at risk for something like that. \nRecently, my wife had to stop taking her histamine blocker because they changed the formula and it did not sit well with her gut. She has been much more miserable ever since. Our PCP believes that these numbers are hinting at inflammation as a result of her no longer being on the histamine blocker (there were other numbers that were a little off that also hint at inflammation). \nMy question is: How indicative would this be of a mast cell disorder if the liver inflammation is due to her no longer taking her histamine blocker? \nI want to bring this up to her allergist, but I do not want to force the point if its one of those 'well, that could mean a whole bunch of different things and does not really mean 'mast cell disorder.' ' I have never heard of a relationship between antihistamines and liver enzymes. As far as I know, the only mast cell disorder that would cause a liver disorder would be systemic mastocytosis but if she had that-her tryptase would be very high. \n\nI have seen a couple of your posts and it seems to me like you are anchoring on an MCAS diagnosis, in spite of evidence to the contrary. What makes you think she has MCAS?\n\n**I also want to point out that your wife is lucky to have you as her advocate. I hope you find answers. It happens, but a lot of things can cause liver problems. Mast cell disorders can cause inflammation too. The only thing that will confirm is proper MCAS labs though (24 hour urine).\n\nSource for the relationship between MCAS and liver issues:  &gt;I have never heard of a relationship between antihistamines and liver enzymes\n\nI also posted this on a MCAD FB group and got several responses saying that they also had this issue. \n\nEdit: also, see asfd's post\n\nJust as a clarifier, her PCP does not think she has a liver disorder, she thinks my wife is having inflammation issues there (as well as other places).\n\n&gt;I have seen a couple of your posts and it seems to me like you are anchoring on an MCAS diagnosis, in spite of evidence to the contrary.\n\nThe only actual \"evidence to the contrary\" that we have are normal Tryptase levels (not uncommon), and lack of redness. I did not say this in my other post that we talked in, but she did used to get red (particularly in her ears) during an attack. However, she has not had a full blown attack in years. \n\nThere is no actual evidence apart from these things. Certain things are tricky because of the way her body has responded after a hospital stay she had.\n\nHer brand new allergist that did a zoom call with her once does not yet think so. Her POTS specialist who was much more familiar with my wife and her case (and who is very familiar with MCAD) does and agreed that it was likely what my wife had. \n\n\n&gt;What makes you think she has MCAS?\n\nMy wife could answer this better than I could. I unfortunately did not pay as much attention to things as I should have when she was learning about it.\n\nAll I can say with confidence of not screwing up my words is that when I read Mast Cell papers, listen to lectures, or talk to people with MCAD, it is the only thing that I have seen that fits.\n\n\nIs it possible my wife does not have MCAD (or something similar), yes. But so far, it is the only thing that is been suggested that makes sense.\n\n\nAs an honest aside question: after she stopped taking her histamine blocker she became much more miserable. She is significantly worse now than when she had the blocker. Are there other disorders that this would be true for?\n\n\nEdit: \n\n&gt;**I also want to point out that your wife is lucky to have you as her advocate. I hope you find answers.\n\nThank you for the kind words -In my experience, many people in the Mast Cell groups are self-diagnosed of suspected of MCAS, but not confirmed by laboratory evidence. Anecdotal evidence from groups like this one or others is not the same as fact.\n\n-Since 70% of more of MCAS patients experience redness/flushing and an elevated tryptase over baseline is diagnostic, it is unlikely your wife has this condition. In addition, the specialist said as much. There are some naturopaths who will make the diagnosis without meeting criteria, but what does that prove? \n\n-MCAS symptoms listed in some lectures are excessively broad and if you listen to enough of the talks by Afrin, he will admit that there is no clear evidence linking all of his list of \u201csymptoms\u201d to MCAS. The Mastocytosis Society has a great list of symptoms that cover MCAS which are consistent among most healthcare professionals. \n\n-MCAS symptoms in general are non-specific. The differential diagnosis list for each one and all combined would be many, many disorders.\n\n-What symptoms were the antihistamines controlling? Antihistamines are used for various symptom management. Being worse without it does not equal MCAS. Your thoughts are noted. MCAS gives syatemic inflammation, it affects all possible body parts. I have changes in pancreas and liver. Are you diagnosed by meeting criteria? Low histamine diet. If she is better on a low histamine diet and noticeably worse on a normal AIP diet, then I would say you have some type of histamine issue. The thing is, if she has not had a full blown attack in years - then maybe she is getting better? If she is been working towards minimizing her trigger and now she is showing less triggers... Maybe she is already on the road to recovery? I know I went years having attacks and then finally woke up to what my body was telling me. Once I found out I was allergic to a bunch of foods, and removed those foods. I stopped having full blown mast attacks and have not had them since.   \n\n\nI know others are not as lucky as me. I definitely have issues still, but nothing with red hot ears. Unfortunately, I do get migraines every once and awhile. I just do not eat for a few days and then it gets better. \n\nI keyed in on your ALT/AST - I have had the same issue. Then they do tests on my liver and everythings fine. Same with my tryptase. I have had hives, go and get my tryptase done with the hives and nope, no elevated tryptase. I know that a low histamine diet works for me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck, I hope you figure it out.", "Anyone take benadryl daily? and a H1? My doctor has me on 200 mg a day. 50 mg every 4 hours.

Yeah... 200mg is pretty excessive IMO. \n\nProbably should read up on (   The problem is you have no emergency medication now.  I had a doctor switch me to hydroxyzine because I took that much daily.  It does have anticholergenic properties, but the max dose daily is 300 mg. \nI take 4 Zyrtec, daily 2 am and pm, 40 mg of Pepcid and singular, 2 100 ml of  cromolyn sodium, and Xolair once a month. Same here except I had to stop cromolyn.\n\nI take hydroxyzine twice a day and Benadryl for reactions. I only use cromolyn during times I will flare. I am rare, I am so allergic to spring and fall it causes systemic reactions just walking outside. So I start in February taking it and work up to 2 vials 3 times a day. And I get to stop it around may. Start it again in august till October. I was just about to postLisa\u2019s blog as well.  \ud83d\udc9c I read that before, I understand but I think they put me on it because they were ready to do CDI and they wanted to do oral first. I also take IM Benadryl if I am having a bad reaction. But I was completely on formula I ate 0 food. I became allergic to everything I was even having a hard time with formula, but Benadryl was able to calm my body enough that I was able to even eat a couple of foods again all thou I am still primarily formula fed.\n\nDo want add I do not have a feeding tube. I drink formula straight up. I love Hydroxyzine, I was worried about taking an old school antihistamine because they are so anticholinergic but I found out Hydroxyzine is different because it is not as potent in that regard. It gets metabolized into two different things: one is ceterizine and the other one is mildly anticholinergic and is what contributes to drowsiness. But it is not as bad as Benadryl. Just thought that info might be helpful to someone. Do you take it with normal antihistamines? And do you find as effective as Benadryl I did. I was on 4 a day.  After several years my got used to it but I think I can go back on it now if needed.\nAlso there Ketotifen.   It is not sold in America, but a compound pharmacy can make it.  My insurance would not cover it. You got used to Benadryl or hydroxine The hydroxyzine.  I was on it for 6-7 years.  I think it is time to have it as a back up again. I am talking to the dr to see if I can have a prescription for it. Also it might be worth mentioning that many people with  mcas also have POTS. if that is you I would not always take benadryl because it is an anticholinergic which will make the POTS worse.  Sorry for the slow reply! Yes you can take it with other antihistamines, and I do think it works better than Benadryl, especially long term. I was on 2 zyrtec a day and benadryl as needed for about 5 years. I always used the children's liquid benadryl because it is easier to take smaller doses. I took the equivalent to 12.5mg of benadryl and tried not to take it more than twice a day. As far as the rebound effect goes, taking any antihistamine on a daily basis can potentially cause problems. Constantly blocking the histamine pathway makes the immune system think there is a problem and it can end up releasing even more histamine.", "I have had very stressful month and now it is 2am and I am stuck on the toilet with a UTI kill me please That is it.

Unfortunately, they just changed their formula (minor change, but a change nonetheless) and it did not sit well with her at all...\n\nSo now she is off the antihistamine until we find a new one or she can tolerate this one :( Note this is not a typical \"anti-histamine\", which I assume you know.  Those block a receptor so it cannot trigger, where this actually removes histamine.  DAO is one of the two typical enzymes that break down histamine.  This one is for our digestive tract (cannot pass the blood brain barrier), the other is mostly for the brain (HNMT).\n\nGlad to hear it was working, but sucks it seems to be causing issues with the new formula.  I would done a recent search online and only saw 3-4 options.  I have not tried them so cannot offer my opinion beyond one was a little cheaper, where you bought 2 months worth for around $100 instead of $60-80 for a month's supply (each pill being 10k units, and 60 pills per month).\n\nI have one on order from a chiropractor that carries a lot of vitamins and supplements.  I will try to remember to come back here to let you know what I think of it.  Like she has the Nordic Naturals fish oil that is especially concentrated down to DHA/EPA (less other fat than most pills I find).\n\nHistamineX was semi-useful for me a while back.  If you are already doing quercetin it might not have much more you would need (though it does have a number of ingredients like stinging nettles).  It does not have DAO, but if you get desperate...you can give it a try.\n\nOr ketotifen is a mast stabilizer available by prescription.  I have some on order from a compounder (in US, it is the only way to get an oral form). SeekingHealth has a DAO supplement called Histamine Block which I have found helpful at times. It contains DAO and a tiny bit of Vitamin C. It is not currently sold on Amazon (used to be), but you can order it from SeekingHealth directly. The other ingreds are: Microcrystalline cellulose (plant fiber), vegetable capsule (hypromellose and water), sucrose, rice starch, shellac, hydroxypropylcellulose, crospovidone, hydrated magnesium silicate, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and glycerol.\nDo not know if that is what you are looking for tho.", "Alpha-glycosyl isoquercitrin Has anyone tried this?

Could not find a single place that had it in stock. Anyone know where you could get some?", "Can anyone help me identify this symptom? (images) ", "Does Ketotifen work acutely? Or does it need time to build up in your system? I am looking for a mast cell stabilizer that works right away and does not need to be taken daily. Sodium Cromolyn does not seem to help me in this regard. Anything else I should consider? It needs to build up in your system. What about quercetin? The issue is that if you are trying to take it for an acute reaction, your mast cells have already degranulated. Mast cell stabilizers may help prevent further degranulation, but that is typically in conjunction with antihistamines to help with acute reactions. No I am trying to take before known exposure to stop mast cell degranulation. Quercetin definitely helps. Probably a combination of quercetin and some kind of antihistamine would help. Antihistamines seem to have some kind of mast cell stabilizing property. Mast cells have histamine receptors, so antihistamines can help prevent degranulation in a bit of a roundabout way. Pretty sure that could be impossible, depending on your symptoms.  In my reading, yes ketotifen is an anti-histamine and I see no reason it would take a long time to take effect (say like steroids do, like Flonase).  I noticed helpful effects on the first pill, and noticed when I tried to shift the time (messed my sleep up).\n\nIf you are getting exposed to triggers daily, then you might need to block it daily.  I think how much medication you need is an indicator of the level of reaction.  Which is based on what you are allergic to, and how much you are exposed to it.  If you want to take less medicine, then figure out how to be exposed to less allergen triggers.\n\nAlso try more water.  Histamine tells our body to hang on to water, so if you are dehydrated it will create histamine.  I have heard 1/2 oz per lb you weigh daily.  There was a fudge factor depending on tissue type (cannot remember if was muscle or fat weight based).\n\nSome foods have more histamine.  I have not noticed a huge difference, but some do in doing a low histamine diet.  No smoke, cured, aged, fermented, left over, ... you probably get the picture.  Also less protein.  Lots of people in western societies think we get way more than we need, and they do not feel bad with added carbs.  Or there is keto, but that is pretty hard on the body too (messes with electrolytes, etc).\n\nFor me, quercetin while helpful does not have as large a reaction in my body.  Both good and bad.  So maybe quercetin is the safer daily thing you just take instead?  Hard to know why you are aiming this way.  I take it 20-40 minutes before a meal.  My guts feel a little weird while it absorbs, but other than that...all roses.\n\nI have never used cromolyn, but heard it is like steroids where you must take it all the time to be effective.\n\nThink some of the other things like quercetin could work too if you really must avoid ketotifen, but again it will be a daily thing.  Fisetin is one.  I would run into a number off ( a while back.  He has some info on low histamine diets, methylation disorders, supplements, etc. No I am only getting exposed to the trigger about once a week. Meaning you know what it is? Or you mean you have a bad reaction about weekly?\n\nI would not cut back on mast stabilizers until you have zero or close to symptoms. I am not aware of any long term issues with them. Again not sure your reasoning behind the goal. I know what it is, orgasm. LOL, OH!  I have heard of it.\n\nAnd just because others have brought up this question...when you say anaphylaxis you mean turn red, trouble breathing, feel flushed, etc right?  Not \"I react\".\n\nAnd not that this sounds like a fun option, but there are many men who feel they are happier without that.  Or at least they work to find a way to make a less draining version work, through body training.  Still sounds a little unreal to me, and do not want to get too graphic here :D.\n\nGood luck! If there is a chance food is the trigger, might DAO enzymes help?", "Reaction to Dramamine (Vomex) Hey,\n\nI am currently in the hospital for gastro/mast cell diagnosis and was given dramamine IV (10ml) for nausea even though I was not even feeling that bad but I think they wanted to try if I was feeling better on it.\n\nSo about 10 minutes after the whole 10ml bottle was administered I began to feel extreme dizziness and nausea. It was so extreme that I could barely move my body and my vision was blurry but weirdly sharp at the same time (sounds stupid I know) but when I closed my eyes I kind of hat visual patterns building like they gave me some kind of hallucinogen lol.\n\nIt is now 3 hours later and I am feeling alot better but still got a bit more nasea and headache than usual. \n\nDid anyone else have a reaction to dramamine or benadryl like this?\n\nEdit: 10ml is also a pretty low dose which makes this even more weird IV meds are dependent on their concentration- like how many mg per ml. Can you find out how many mg were in that 10ml you were given? should be 62mg. it was diluted in a small NaCl glass bottle and written on the outside with a marker was Vomex 10ml Yes, I went to the ER because I hadnt eaten in days and I only wanted IV fluids since I was dehydrated. They gave me dramamine and it felt like my throat was tightening, I had to do a lot of deep breaths and I left without discharging because they treated me like I was nuts when I said I could barely breathe.\n \nIm lucky it went away, that was scary. I do not have reactions to benadryl other than rebound reavtions. I cannot take any form on dramamine whatsoever due to crazy reactions. The normal dramamine pills one would take for sea sickness knock me out as if I had taken 2 full bottles of benadryl. Those pills also give me syncope symptoms, super fast heart racing and tachycardia, as well as panic attack symptoms. The less drowsy version is even worse for me, causes extreme paranoia and hallucinations. I have never heard of this being an MCAS response to dramamine, but its entirely possible that this is a trend amongst us!\n\nEdit: spelling and grammar", "Does anyone have any insight as to why i am cold in 80\u00b0F? i am desperate to figure this out and so sick. My body temp stays in 97\u2019s but i am freezing. if you experience this - is it from mcas/unknown/or from something else? I apologize again as i am not able to respond to comments right now. i am really struggling with so much health stuff and have a ton other stuff i am dealing with in my life/things going wrong. i will try to respond in the next few weeks. thanks in advance i really appreciate your responses so much Being cold in warmer temps only happens to me when I am low on carbs. I am not sure if it has anything to do with my mcas/hi so I cannot help you there, but maybe try eating some complex carbs you can tolerate just to rule that possibility out? I am guessing low iron? I have low b12 and low iron a lot and I am always cold. Have your thyroid checked if you have not already. T3, T4, Free T3 etc.   is a good place to start to understand thyroid issues before you go to the doctor. In my experience (USA) you will need a doctor's attention to get properly tested, and I would do my best to make sure the doctor I went to understands bioidentical hormones if at all possible. In my experience having unbalanced thyroid will drive the MCAS even harder, and on occasion the MCAS has driven the thyroid out of whack (from hypo to temporarily hyper). It is worth it to make sure that is fixed first. Ruling things out adds clarity if nothing else. The things that the other posters mentioned so far (low iron, low B12, and metabolism) seem like sensible things to look at as well. I hope you find what you are looking for and feel better. Edited to add: This is the thyroid page I originally meant, although I will leave the other because it has a number of links at the bottom you will find useful.  Could be your thyroid. Have it checked for sure. I had this. I was freezing cold until I found a doc who actually tested my thyroid properly. The others had only checked TSH and kept me hypothyroid for 10 years. Not to mention, no-one thought to tell me about Hashimoto's until my thyroid was almost gone. Do you have POTS/ dysautonomia? Temperature regulation is terrible for a lot. I am sitting here with a portable fan so I can go out tomorrow. I have a neck ice pack chilling in the freezer. In the winter I sweat like crazy and overheat. MCAS does not seem to help this.\nOh yes and iron! Yes! And make sure they check thyroid antibodies, in addition to the thyroid panel. I was sooooo cold, but my TSH was normal, so doc said it was not thyroid. Another doc finally ran my thyroid antibodies and discovered I had Hashimoto\u2019s. A prescription of Armour thyroid later, and it is easily controlled (and because we caught it early, I have maintained thyroid function). \n\nI believe thyroid issues are more common among people with ehlers danlos. Omg I am always cold when it is hot \nAnd hot when it is cold D:\nThey said my thyroid is fine tho but I now know my GP is full of it so idk.. but you are not alone!", "What happens when you block some of your histamine receptors? So, histamines seem pretty complicated, given how many different kinds of receptors we have and the huge array of symptoms they can produce.  My question is, what happens with histamines when you block h1 and h2 receptors?  Does that same histamine attach to other receptors?  What percentage of our h1 and h2 receptors are we really blocking?  Obviously some antihistamines work in certain parts of the body (some can cross the BBB, others cannot).  Are there parts of our body that are not being affected by antihistamines? Yes there are other parts of the body that antihistamines will not readily cross besides the blood-brain barrier. There is a blood-placental barrier, a blood-testis barrier, a blood-retina barrier, and a blood-thymus barrier.  \n\nAs for histamine, once it is released, most of it is not in the blood stream, but localized in the tissues around where it was released.  It readily binds to receptors so it does not easily travel far except when it enters the bloodstream directly.  Histamine receptors are often localized to specific tissue types.  So while you have a lot of H1 receptors in your skin, you do not have many H2 receptors present in your skin. (Besides the H2 receptors on the mast cells themselves).\n\nYes, blockading H1 and H2 receptors does result in an increase of histamine binding to H3 and H4 receptors, but it is not as much as you would expect.  The Histamine molecule metabolises too readily, and/or is broken down in most cases (assuming a patient not lacking in any of the multiple various enzymes that breakdown histamine.)\n\nA bigger issue with long term blockading of H1 histamine receptors is your body will start to express more H1 receptors.  Leading to increased sensitivity.  This results in a significant increase in itching if the antihistamines are discontinued after a sustained period of time.  The increased itching lasts for usually 2-3 weeks before returning to baseline.  This also happens with H2 blockading. Really helpful, thanks! There is a really helpful pharmacology video on YouTube that goes over H1 and H2s. I learned a lot. Might be worth looking into. Histamine is also not the only mediator our overactive mast cells release. Do you always assume that people are oblivious to every single thing that is not included in the things they say?\n\nAre you also going to lecture me about how grass grows, or different types of stars, or when Rome fell?  After all, you cannot tell from my post that I understand those things.  Best to assume I do not understand them and be a know-it-all, right?\n\nMast cell stabilizers work differently than antihistamines.  I know how mast cell stabilizers work.  I was not 100% sure about antihistamines.  Thanks for assuming that I, someone who has been dealing with MCAS every single day for 32 years (literally since birth), did not realize that mast cells release 219 other mediators, something you could easily have seen I already knew based on the fact that I have made that exact comment on other posts in here ;)\n\nThis is why I hate chronically ill spaces, they are all full of people who will assume you are dumber than them automatically, for no reason. I have tried, but those videos are all made for pharmacy students, which I am not.\n\nAnd actually, while they all contain a lot of information that can sometimes go over my head, they do not ever actually answer my questions. I am not either, but I have been doing some background research so I can understand them better. Was not sure if that was a resource you had looked into. They are definitely not for everyone. I never assume they are full of dumb people, but I have found them on reddit to be full of rude people.  I do not usually have the energy to read back through someone is posts to see what they may or may not know before commenting. I wish I did. I am taking care of my kids who also have MCAS, we have to home school, I have to make everything from scratch , even their shampoo and laundry detergent. I get on reddit to relax but it is not like I have much time for it.\n\nEveryone seems so focused on histamine and eating a low histamine diet for MCAS and that does not do anything for me. The only way I can eat is to take cromolyn but when I take cromolyn, I bleed so much I have had to have blood transfusions, which I also react to. So I am trying to balance the two problems and everyone is going on about eating low histamine and how that will change everything for me. I have tried that, it does not help me. So lately when I see that someone is really focused on histamine, I have been pointing out that is not the only mediator we have to worry about.", "Eardrops? (Have therapeutic diagnosis from immu; treating for MCAS, assumed hereditary alpha tryptasemia)\n\nI have eye drops and nose spray and lung spray and all that fancy jazz but does anyone take anything specifically for mast cell related ear hole silliness? (swelling, itching, fullness)\n\nnever mind the ringing eeeeeeeeeeeeeefffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffftssssssssssssssssssseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee \n\nCan anyone please recommend something for the ears? I have tried a couple drops of oral cromolyn sodium in the ears.  Did not do anything for ringing, but I think my ear ringing is caused by the H2 meds.\n\nI also use a couple drops of peroxide in the ear sometimes, just let it bubble for a while. My daughter's doctor said that was not a good idea but she could not explain why, and it is helped my itchy or sore ears for many years. Oooo, can ringing be caused by antihistamines? I had never heard that. I use hydrocortisone for ear itchiness almost daily and Benadryl oral capsules as a last resort. The itchy ears can drive me crazy! I have Primary Immunodeficiency, MCAS, hEDS, etc... Interested to find out if someone else has found anything else to help... Do NOT use drops for the ringing, there is no medication (oral or topical) that is FDA approved to treat tinnitus. Sound therapy (e.g. using ambient sounds - try downloading the free ReSound Tinnitus Relief smartphone application) can help with ringing, also get your hearing tested. \n\nMoisturizing ear drops can help, do not use hydrogen peroxide as that will dry them out. You can also see an audiologist or otolaryngologist to make sure you do not have something more serious going on in your ear canals. Peroxide is a good idea if you potentially have otitis externa (swimmers ear - think caused by bacteria from swimming in contaminated water). It is a bad idea for itchy ear canals because all you are doing is drying the skin out further, causing more fakes, and potentially irritating further. The first H2 blocker I was on was ranitidine, and it made my ears ring so loudly I had trouble hearing people speaking to me. It continued for a month after I stopped the med, and I was worried I had permanently damaged my ears. I switched to famotidine and it causes a little ringing, but I can live with it. My ear itching is usually part of my mast cell reactions and I will get hives in my ears that break open and bleed. The peroxide makes that feel better somehow. I have been using it for 20 years, but when my daughter had ear pain and I used peroxide in her ear, her doctor was horrified and gave me a lecture about it. So now if I mention it, even to another MCAS patient, I feel like I should mention that the doctor said it was a bad idea. Peroxide is also not good for hives breaking open and bleeding either. I would talk to your allergist again - the skin inside your ear canal is very different than your skin elsewhere. It may make you feel better temporarily but you may be extending the healing process and causing other side effects. My allergist is ok with the peroxide.", "dental work/ Cavities and MCAS I am recently diagnosed with MCAS and am in the process of working with a compounding pharmacy to try and find a filler in pills that I do not react to so I can start H1 and H2 blockers. Since I am having reactions to most fillers, I am not currently able to take any medication to try and help my MCAS symptoms/reactions (throat swelling, shortness of breath, and tongue swelling are my major symptoms). I have a few cavities in my teeth and have moderate pain from them, but I am very hesitant to go in and get anything done because I am worried ill react to the numbing that they give you when having to fill cavities.\n\nRight now, I am at a very critical point with my MCAS, I react to basically every food, all liquids (except water), any scents/chemicals, and the outside (environmental). my reactions to all of these are always significant throat swelling/closing.\n\nI struggle to eat and drink enough water every day and I just do not know if ill react and wanted to share my situation on here to get some advice and hear how its gone for other people.\n\nWondering if anyone has had to be numbed with a needle for cavity fillings and how it went. I am trying to decide between waiting till I am able to find a filler that I do not react to and get on medication or if I should just try and get my teeth done without being on any H1 OR H2 blockers and risk having a reaction (throat swelling/ anaphylactic reaction) and potentially lowering my baseline.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read my situation, again please feel free to share any advice! I am really sorry you have got so much to deal with. Even at my worst I have not yet reacted to numbing medication without epi. I also have pots so no regular numbing agents. I know a lot of people premeditate with Benadryl and such and hopefully you are able to find the clear Benadryl with the fewest ingredients. I hope you are able to get the cavities resolved. There is been a lot of talk that cavities can increase your responses negatively. And I have read stories either here or on the support groups on fb that getting them fixed has reduced their symptoms. Good luck! Get your teeth fixed before you need a root canal or get an abscess. \n\nSo to deal with the dentist:\n\n- Make a written list of your drug allergies for the dentist.\n- Tell the dentist you want a sulfite-free anesthetic. They now make epi containing anesthetic without sulfites and I have had it several times. Again sulfITE free. \n- Ask the dentist if they are willing to give you nitrous oxide. I tolerate it well. And it wears off quickly. I get both the needle and the gas.\n- Take an antihistamine, or two, before your appointment. Benadryl, hydroxyzine, maybe take a new generation H1 as well. \n- If necessary take a friend and hold their hand during the worst of it. I take a stress ball with me.", "Ketamine? Did someone try ketamine against fibromyalgia, MCAS, chronic pain and chronic fatigue syndrome? Or other autoimmune or immune issues?\nWhat did you experience?\nWhat about side effects?\nDid it influence other health conditions? \nAnd what is your general opinion on it?\n\nReference:  There is a sub, I believe r/therapeuticketamine that has a lot of info from patients. Most are being treated for depression but some for pain or anxiety. Thank you! Did not improve anything other than neuropathy and depression. Would not take it for MCAS tho Thanks!", "Low heart rate after taking Ketotifen Has anyone experienced a low heart rate after taking ketotifen? I was started on half a milligram and it made my heart rate drop down to 47. It really freaked me out. My doctor thinks I was experiencing a form of shock. He wants me to try an even lower dose because he is had luck having people start low and work their way up to 1mg. Everyone says ketotifen is a game changer and that would be awesome but I have never had my heart rate go that low and it was a little scary. Did you have any other symptoms? A heart rate of 47 is not inherently problematic (depending on how fast it dropped and it is previous level). I had a period of time where my resting heart rate was 32-37 bpm, which is admittedly quite low, but in the context of a high amount of endurance training it is not _that_ uncanny.\nHowever, if you are not extremely active and your heart rate was _much_ higher before...\n\nI looked for a similar case on google scholar but did not find anything that would fit. \n\nDid you ever try other H1 antihistamines? If you try a new one, please be careful. :)", "Should I risk covid to get the lab tests done or just take the medicine and hope for the best? I have had debilitating gastritis all this year. It is basically stomach and throat pain that becomes worse when I eat certain foods. I also get chills, fatigue, and diarheria.\n\nI finally connected it to mcas and saw an allergist virtually. She said my stomach pain might be secondary to or caused by MCAS, but she does not know for sure. She prescribed some tests that I can only have done in the hospital, plus cromolyn and zyrtec. I am already on famotidine.  \n\n\nDo I need to have the tests done first or can I go straight to cromolyn? I am afraid of having the tests done because the pandemic is surging. I do not have a car and thus would have to take a ride share service like uber to get the hospital to have the tests done. Additionally, are we in greater risk of having severe complications from covid because of MCAS? Is it worth the risk right now?  \n\n\nAlso, if the vaccine comes out, would you guys take it? I would not go to the hospital for tests right now, if it could be avoided.\n\nFrom what I have read, people with well controlled MCAS are not at greater risk from covid.\n\nI am going to get the vaccine as long as my doctor thinks I should, and as long as I can get it at her office. I have had some unpleasant reactions to vaccines, but I trust her to treat a reaction if I have one. But I need to start the medicine to see if it can help me. Must I do the tests before I use the medicine? \n\n  \nDefine well controlled? I have chills, fatigue, and bad stomach pain / soreness. It already feels like I have the flu sometimes. I cannot imagine what covid would do on top of this. Take the cromolyn. Where I am located I can only get it as a liquid and it is a pain in the butt to deal with. But my specialist prescribes ketotifen which has to be compounded but is stable, and easy to take as a capsule. She said it works very similarly, and is very safe ( they use this on babies).\n\nIs there a way to get your test done at an outpatient center or a testing facility? Somewhere you could get an appointment and avoid as many people as possible? If not, take the drugs, see if they help, update your provider as it goes. Take the tests when it is safe to do so. If the doctor already prescribed the medication you should be okay. I would send or leave a message and ask if I was really worried about it. You can also ask how they suggest starting the meds and what the possible side affects are.\n\nI would also start each pill separately so if you react or have bad symptoms you know what the change was. I have made this mistakes with supplements, cannot tell what is helping if you start more than one thing at a time.\n\nI took zyrtec everyday then twice a day for more than a decade. I had some drowsiness at first and dry mouth. It was worth the decrease in symptoms. I take xyxal now instead. I have not tried cromolyn. Id go straight for thr cromolyn. My tests were negative. Cromolyn was given to me because of my symptoms and has helped greatly. Not worth going into a hospital, imo. My immunologist did not even want me getting blood drawn from her office.\n\nId get the vaccine. I have other health issues and do not want to die from covid. Id rather feel crummy for a day or two than get covid. Seconded. If you have the option, go for the cromolyn. IMHO, the testing protocol is mostly useless right now. If you try the drugs and they help, you can pursue testing when its more convenient (and hopefully better refined). But if you test negative first, depending on your doctor, maybe you do not even get the chance to try the drugs and then you lose out on something that could help immensely. I am FAR more concerned about the vaccine than covid!!!\n\nThe vaccine is experimental mRNA modification\u2014it is been advised by experts that it can TRIGGER autoimmune diseases in already healthy people\u2014imagine what it could do to us?? Most vaccines are trialed for years before being approved, and it has not even been a single year for this one. Please, anyone with MCAS, reconsider getting the vaccine if you are planning to. Id love to read about that. Do you have a link to that info? \n\nYou can find a lot of research and statements on your own too, this is the tip of the iceberg. Positive response to treatment is grounds for a diagnosis. If your doctor is willing to start there then do it. This is not new or novel to mrna vaccines. If you are pre disposed to auto immune disorder, and were going to be triggered by a vaccine, you likely already would have been triggered by one of the many vaccines you have already received growling up. Viruses are one of the most common  triggers for many auto immune diseases, so you are putting yourself at risk of both complications from infection as well as triggering an auto immune disease by NOT getting vaccinated. Most vaccines get at least 6 or 7 years of testing...this has had less than one. \n\nMost vaccines get rejected...only about 15% are approved. Because they cause injury and have side effects. \n\nThe fact is, you are signing up to be a guinea pig if you take this vaccine...and given the number of common adjuvants in vaccines that can trigger autoimmune issues, not to mention this technology has never been used in a vaccine before, I would say you are much more likely to be injured by the vaccine than covid. Most vaccines take longer to test for several reasons, less funding means the sample sizes are smaller, less support from the government means the regulatory clearance takes longer, less prevalence of the disease in the community means each individual study as well as study phases take longer.\n\nYou are not a Guinea pig when the vaccine your taking has already been tested on over 30,000 subjects.\n\nYou might say that the vaccine is more dangerous than the disease, but you are just making  that up and have no evidence to support your claim. You are spreading dangerous misinformation. You ARE a guinea pig when there has not been enough time for long term studies to take place, as many side effects take longer than a few months to manifest. The former VP of Pfizer has even said it is unsafe. The official documentation says the effect on sterility is unclear. It is not misinformation, it is my opinion, and we are both entitled to ours. Go ahead and be a guinea pig for a trillion dollar corporation, no skin off my nose. I am going to warn as many people as I can, MCAS or not. What source did you get that info from? Never make a decision based on fear.  I had covid and I have MCAS and I survived. I know others that have too. They are in my FB MCAS group. The vaccine trials themselves are never long term. Long term affects are always reported voluntarily AFTER a vaccine has been approved. Vaccine side effects normally happen within 48 hours of receiving the vaccine. Now YOU ARE spreading misinformation. Please educate yourself.\n\n\n Like I said, and your link supports, adverse effects normally happen within 48 hours.", "Good strong natural alternatives to H2 Antihistamines? Looking for a good natural antihistamine-type supplement I can take in place of an H2 like Pepcid AC. I think the pepcid is working well but side effects are enough to make me want to quit it regularly. What side effects are you experiencing? Have you tried quercetin? Yeah I am currently on a 2x 500mg a day dose of a solaray supplement of it. I have tried a dose of it at night and I think it keeps me alert and awake more than anything. I am on Quercetin 2000mg a day and it has not helped me. I have not tried Pepcid AC but thinking I want to since the Quercetin is not working. Or is there another natural supplement folks have taken that is worked for them? I used skull cap when I was pretty sure I had MCAS and needed something in addition to the quercetin before I got into the immunologist for an actual diagnosis and treatment plan. I do not use it very much anymore, but when I am having a flare, I will take a few drops. the best thing for me has been a combo of H1 and H2 antihistamines and supplements. I take xyzal and pepcid twice a day as well as 4000 mg of quercitin and 1000 mg of vitamin. I notice when I reduce or take out one. I was taking as much as 6000 mg of quercitin a day when flared. at my integrative doctor's suggestion. I use quercetin, bromelain, stinging nettle and NAC (N-Acetyl Cysteine). Oh, and sodium chromodynamics too. It is all working well for me. Good luck. I take slippery elm for stomach pain, but not instead of pepcid, I still take pepcid. Quercetin did not work for me, it just gave me diarrhea. Have you been diagnosed now? What is your treatment plan now that works? Allegra, Pepcid, quercetin, and NAC. It is mostly under control. But I get a flare once a month or so - but much milder than it had been before treatment. Nice! Are you on any specific diet? Not particularly. I have never been a huge meat eater, so tend toward vegetarian. But I do think my case is mild compared to some people here.", "Low histamine diet tips? Diagnosed MCAS in December. I do not know my triggers so I spoke with a dietician and started a low histamine diet a few days ago. I was hoping for relief, but my stomach still hurts after I eat. Do any of you experience this? Do you think it will improve after a longer period of time? Personally I do not follow a strict low histamine diet as I did not find any that were consistent and it did not do much for me, as there are plenty of foods that are considered high histamine I can eat fine, and others that are not on the list that will cause reactions. I also react to plenty of non-food items, like stress, weather, medications, insect bites, so the low histamine would not do much for that. So basically, I used to help pinpoint some problem foods (citrus, raw strawberries, leftover meat) but I do not follow it as a strict diet. \n\nTaking H2 antihistamines helped, but honestly for me the biggest help was taking cromolyn sodium, which really helped calm GI issues. Thanks for the reply. I cannot tolerate cromolyn :( i have adverse reactions to even low doses. I am going to try to talk to a GI specialist and see what I can do. \n\nI think I will try to manage for the two weeks I am \u201cscheduled\u201d for and then I will go back to eating how I was. It seems like it is a lot of obscure foods I have never eaten (I.e., celery root?!) in order to avoid things I have not had an issue with while medicated. I hurt after eating most things, but I do not get nauseous like I do with this diet. I only have a few consistent triggers food wise so I only avoid those and do antihistamines and antacids personally. Good luck! Only diet things that have helped me so far are avoiding my IgE allergies and other stuff I am figuring out I react to. Wheat (so gluten), peanut, and corn came up from a blood test. Cow milk I just know (not lactose reaction). Elimination diet was the only way. Get really simple and then you know what you did to cause the reaction (or not).\n\nGot To get to not reacting before you can know what is safe. And it can take hours to a day plus for the reaction (mine often does).\n\nMedications are my biggest relief though. My reactions are erratic. I was down to five foods and then reacted to them. I have anaphylaxis at least three times a week without medication. I am hoping to get abdominal pain go up away with a diet changes but we will see. Thanks for the reply. I might try elimination again. Ouch! Meaning you have to use a rescue pen? I have thankfully only needed those when doing allergy shots (so the hospital had them and was monitoring me).\n\nI have not been completely medication-less in decades if not since the 2nd generation antihistamines got on the market. I have a low activity HMNT gene and that is what breaks down histamine in your brain. So I get super itchy eyes where I want to claw them out. And sneezing and runny nose like no tomorrow. Along with more but I am usually focusing on all that.\n\nFood has only recently become an issue. I am down to 2-3 meals from restaurants, and Huel (black or gluten free white edition). I guess I have some vegan protein powders that are OK, but not pleasant. I eat to live currently.\n\nStill reacting off and on too. So I might have to change things again.  Lots of irons in my fire, especially for no job or family to care for, and feeling like I cannot get a job during this quarantine anyway. Oh and I assume you have put together that we react to what we eat over time until we can settle down the mast cells enough, and probably heal out gut lining and digestion.\n\nI have tried tons of gut healing stuff with little to show for it. If you go that way be careful of probiotics. Many common ones make more histamine! There are special formulations that avoid those. Yeah - sometimes i could manage with Benadryl and sleep, but majority I was using an auto-injector. \n\nWith my current medication list I have the ability to live life mostly normally with exception for no weekly or monthly anaphylaxis and daily skin issues/gastro discomfort. \n\nFind small ways to care for yourself during this time! I am not on any mast cell stabilizers so that might be why I am still struggling. I am apparently not either. I thought ketotifen was one, but nope just a broad histamine blocker (H1, H2, and even a little H3 receptors).  Works amazingly well for me.  Wish it was OTC. \n\nMy insurance will not cover cromolyn, and since I am not working, spending a thousand on a new medication seems like a bad idea. Hoping my next insurance will cover it and I can give it a try.\n\nOh I am doing quercetin before meals, which I guess is supposed to be a mast stabilizer. Lots seem to think it helps.  Take it 20-40 minutes ahead of time. \n\nYou might investigate stress and coffee as triggers. I find 1 cup a day helps, more hurts. And magnesium supplements help as I am terrible about leafy green eating. It balances calcium which I believe can trigger mast cells release. I would definitely give it a try and keep a food diary. One thing to figure out is how quick your reactions are. Some people react immediately (I do), but others may have a delayed reaction, making a little harder to identify the trigger. My reactions were always immediate and for the most part were not life-threatening until this year (I have developed reactions to what appears to be a food dye and my reaction to soy is now escalating), which made it much easier to figure out, but it still takes a lot of work. My SO has a FODMAPs sensitivity, so we basically make most of our meals at home, so that is made eating and identifying triggers easier since I know the ingredients. I tried cromolyn and I could not tolerate it (vomiting in the middle of the night, headaches). I will have to ask my new internist in a few weeks what I should try next. \n\nI take a multivitamin which seems to help (rainbow brand) no issues with it so far. Stress was my trigger for onset (my mom died and I started a new job at 80hrs+ per week within a few months of each other) so I know stress hurts. Temperature changes are also unpleasant. Everything is just very inconsistent. Who told you ketotifen is not a mast cell stabilizer? It is listed as such everywhere Appears it is both?!?!  I assumed it was either one or the other.  The receptor activity was from a study from the 80's, so terminology might have changed too.  I can dig it up again if anyone is curious...\n\nI did not remember seeing both values together, and a number of sources kept separating them into one category or another.  When it is like a lot of life...a blend of lots of stuff.", "How do you deal with no one believing you? My family, my friends, every boss and coworker I have ever had, they all tell me I am making this up.\n\nI cannot even bring myself to meet new people, because when I start talking to them on Tinder, they make it really clear that they view what I am saying about my health condition as \"an interesting theory.\"\n\nI have so much deep, deep anger and hatred for everyone around me my entire childhood who laughed at me for having problems when I had a serious illness that affected every single moment of every single day of my life, making it impossible for me to sleep at all for weeks on end every single winter.  \n\nI have one doctor who believes me, and she is about to retire.  And I have one therapist who believes me, but that is not enough to change the fact that the entire world would prefer to gaslight me rather than to believe that this is real.\n\nI never want to meet another human being ever again. It sucks! I have a lot of people that know I am sick. But there are some of them that think that is it is depression, like they have.  Some people tell me to get outside and exercise. Outside usually mAkes me very sick, pollen, pollution, everyone is laundry, exhaust. I have really bad MCS and I have had people tell me they do not smell at all or cannot possibly be making me sick when they are. Thankfully I have good close friends and my mom and dad that believe me. Most people do not get it though until they have been sick.  It took even my doctor seeing me get hives for a month straight to start to take me seriously. I also showed any friends and then they took me seriously too. I guess physical proof is what proves it to people who do not fully believe you. Hard to ignore that. It is sad. It is also hard bc I do not have an official diagnosis so I cannot tell people I for sure have this, they are like oh allergies? Ya I have allergies. It is hard for sure! Join some fb groups if you have not. We all support each other there. I used to be in a lot of MCAS facebook groups, and I learned a lot about the condition and meds and supplements, but...it is a bunch of whiney white women whose husbands work and they just stay at home and manage their illness, and that is all they have to do.  So it is really not relatable, because I have to work all day every day in order to get by in addition to having to manage this illness, and with no one ever to help me.\n\nOn top of that, the women in these groups all make posts saying LADIES ONLY!!!! NO BOYS ALLOWED! FEEEEMAAAAALEEEEES OOOOONNNNLLLLLYYYYY and then asking about menstruation.  Since I am a trans man, I remind them that not everyone who menstruates is a woman, and then they all have a hissy fit and tell me that they have no obligation to waste one half of a second to change one word in their post in order to not alienate people.\n\nI just do not understand why your friends and family believe you but mine do not.  It is so depressing.  I have met so many new people in the past few years, and none of them believe me, and none of them are willing to make even tiny changes to their behavior to save me a trip to the ER.  It is more important to people to be able to use artificial fragrance than it is for the people around them to be able to breathe. Best thing I can think of is to show them with a reaction. Otherwise people are not going to believe you either way. \n\nI literally can induce anaphylaxis literally by emotion, specific foods, temperature intolerance. In addition having access to real medications like epipens and antihistamines \n\nI think my family has finally taken the hint ...it took awhile but I think they finally understand. It does not work it they do not care. People will not even read the links. Live like it does not exist.\nYou can have support here or from close friends if you are lucky ))\nOnce my best friend started asking me details of my Hashimotos, i was alone and happy taht it happened! Oops, his wife was diagnosed. People who do not want to understand - are not going to understand. That is true. It takes a bit of empathy to understand and with healthcare, it is all individualistic from what I have seen. \n\n(Case in point, the American healthcare system and why they have been talking about universal healthcare for decades but no one wants to pay healthcare for others via taxes.) It is not unique to USA, everywhere people have the same issues ) Of course. Though many Americans love the bootstrap philosophy, so you tend to see it a little more in healthcare and the lack of empathy it comes with that across the board. Speak about it as facts. I dont have anyone question me... I dont share my health issues with anyone unless its necessary. Sorry this is a completely off topic question, but are you medically transitioning? I always felt that was off the table for me with this illness based on how terribly I react to even hormonal BC, even my own period is so incredibly triggering. \n\nOk back to on topic, if you can and havent already, try to get your doctor to prescribe cromolyn sodium. I was able to and had insurance cover it even without a diagnosis. A supplement and antihistamine protocol is such a helpful start, and I always found doctors more than willing to prescribe this stuff. Just because you cant get a diagnosis, it shouldnt stop you from still finding ways to improve your QoL.\n\nI also really recommend a vogmask, however with the whole corona virus panic they are sold out indefinitely. Very upsetting. I am sure people around me thought I was hysterical, I almost believed them.  My GP is amazing though,  and she believed me about my symptoms and I think she saved my life.\n\nBut having narcolepsy and POTS I am used to not being believed anyway so it really did not change much. That sounds really hard to cope with :(\n\nI spent a lot of years of mental anguish on wishing my parents would be unconditionally loving and emotionally available. \n\nThe only thing that helped with the bitterness was to join a Zen Buddhist center, where I did meditation with others and discovered the nonjudgmental acceptance and connection I had been needing.\n\nI wish you well. I hope you can find a community that accepts you as you are. It is a human need as far as I am concerned. I feel ya!!!!! I am sorry you are struggling with this. It is very hard. 13 years of hearing from doctors....well the tests show nothing, you have not lost weight and you look healthy so I do not know what else we can do for you.  And with basically everyone else not seeing how you feel inside too. \n\nTo make it through I just kept telling myself I know me best and I know what I feel and am not crazy (even tho sometimes would question it) I held onto the comments and empathy the 3 people throughout 13 years showed me. 2 are doctors, lucky one is my family doctor and the other was a doctor I saw in emerg a few times. I saw probably 30 doctors over the years, one even rolled her eyes at me for being in emerg while severely nauseous but I had not thrown up yet. \n\nI held onto the thought that one day they will figure it out and one day I will feel better again. Positive affirmations go a long way. You also cannot ignore the disappointment and utter crushing feeling no one understands. I embrace that a little, feeling sorry for myself sometimes then I push myself and say; Ok you are only holdi Nd yourself back by feeling this way, you have had your pity party (which I feel is deserved also since it is a rare difficult illness) now move on and fight like you have been doing for so long, you are stronger than most people realize. \n\nI hope it gets better for you soon!", "Medication Withdrawal \u201cI know MCAS patients tend to have medication sensitivities but I wonder if anyone has noticed being extremely sensitive to medication withdrawal? \n\nI have been through hell trying to get off quite a few medications. Doctors do not believe that it could be as bad as I say because I am in such low doses and I have been on some for very short periods of time.\u201d\n\nMy wife who cannot look at computer screens do to her photophobia. I have had to withdrawal from certain medications because I could not take them during certain tests. I do not know if I withdraw worse then a normal person but withdraws are nasty. Certain meds are worse then others Interesting. Some more information would probably be helpful: Are you talking about mast cell/histaminergic medications, stereotypical withdrawal-producing drugs (painkillers, stimulants, etc), or medications more generally?\n\nAlso, what kind of issues does the cessation cause? Allergy-like, a severe rebound in the issue that the drug was treating, withdrawal-like (anxiety, fatigue, mental, gastrointestinal, etc), or something else?   I mean it makes sense. MCAS makes your body more sensitive to basically all change. Stopping a med and causing withdrawal is big change. Yes! Never really thought it was related. But I have always had horrible symptoms with med changes.. Honestly, if I did not have to take meds to function, I would not take them at all. Yep. I have to do cold turkey to get it out of my system but side effects are aways bad. For example, cymbalta was the devil and I was told by my psychiatrist to open it up, count the balls, and taper off that way. No thanks. I already started the withdrawals so I went with it. Did not want to be on it any longer. Lexapro was bad, too. Put me straight into a horrible flare with hyperadenergic POTS. Took months to come down from that one.\n\n\nI dont think I have ever gotten to a therapeutic dose on any meds. Its always half of thr lowest dose of anything. \u201cThanks for sharing. I too cannot can rarely tolerate therapeutic doses of meds. Some doctors how found it hard to believe I could have side effect at such low doses. I had a hellish time trying to get off several meds and I am now afraid if I start new ones I will be stuck on them forever.\u201d \u201cI am the same way. I think medication discontinuation has triggered a lot symptoms. I love hate relationship with medications. Wish I would have never started some I am stuck on now.\u201d \u201cI am not yet being treated for mcas so far I have only had a neurologist suggest it. I have been on antihistamines for my allergies and migraine pain for years and they help. I do not think he knows much about it because he ruled it out based on a normal tryptase test. However, I have been reading about it and it seems to explain everything I am experiencing. I have been stalling tracking down an expert for a second opinion due to covid. \n\nI have tried tapering off a low dose of Paxil multiple times and experienced weird neuro symptoms during withdrawal (these were not symptoms I had before Paxil). I had to give up the taper. It also seemed to trigger the start of all my allergies. \n\nI tried discontinuing Zyrtec for seasonal allergies at one point but I broke out in hives. \n\nI developed a visual tremor and other neurological symptoms after an illness and found a very low dose of benzodiazepines managed that. I was only this for a month and tapered off due to fear of dependence and went through very severe withdrawal including all worst benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms. The worst being photophobia and migraines which continues even after years to a much milder degree. \n\nDoctors just seem dismissive. One actually told me I was imagining it. I have had friends take these same drugs at higher doses for longer periods with no withdrawal at discontinuation. So I was wondering if this could be one more weird thing about me that might be explained by MCAS.\u201d I definitely have doctors not believe that. It was very refreshing to have my psychiatrist believe me and start me very very low. I just cant tolerate SSRIs or SNRIs. I tell other doctors I need the lowest dose. Im just firm on it because I refuse to go through hell because some jerk does not believe me. \n\nI am very hesitant of new meds. It took me two months to try a mast cell stabilizer because I had just come off lexapro and was coming out of the worst flare I have had. But I went for it (eventually) with the teeniest dose- like 3 drops. Haha I ended up going to 1/5 of 1 ampule. I slowly worked up from there.", "MCAS / Dystonia / Dehydration Let us say I do not have a histamine issue because frankly, I never sneeze, I never have a runny nose. I DO get a stuffy nose sometimes, DO get hives sometimes.\n\nAside from that my chief complaint is muscles all around the base of my skull and neck that tense up as hard as a rock. I get migraines to where it feels like I have channels all through my head that just hurt. I am not sure if these are blood vessels or sinus passages. I have an issue with the right side of my jaw line tightening up. \n\nMy stomach is always tight and I feel like I have to tense up to keep my stomach from uncomfortably pulling on my chest and ribs. (I am not a huge guy, 172lbs 5'8\") \n\nI continue to go into the hospital for \"severe dehydration\" which almost feels like it would be my root cause. Because I feel like all my muscles are dry, my eyes are dry. \n\nI cannot touch caffeine because it feels like I never process it out of my system, but at the same time I feel like I need it because I do not wake up completely until 4PM. I go to stand up and I get dizzy and light headed a lot. \n\nI never sweat. My resting heart rate is 62\n\nI have been diagnosed with Cervical dystonia. A vitamin B deficiency, Omega 3 deficiency. Other Parkinson's type symptoms, Doctors also think I may have EDS. They say I have a non-functioning diaphram and my ribs are protruding. \n\nI get botox injections for the dystonia, which I replaced with Medical Marijuana, except now I cannot do that anymore because it sends me into episodes of panic and extreme dehydration and kidney failure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have found that a low histamine diet prevents my dizziness, brain fog, dystonia, migraines. \n\nThe worst thing I think is the cramping and dehydration. I tried electrolyte powders and such, but I react badly to them. I get really bad anxiety and makes the cramping worse. My allergist keeps running these tryptase tests and they keep coming up at 4.something - Kind of frustrated with the whole thing. Does anyone have any tips on hydration? I have been okay with coconut water until recently I started reacting to that too. Did anyone test you for POTS?\n\nYou do not have to drink electrolyte drinks. You can just increase salt, potassium and magnesium through your diet. We cannot give medical advice. What does your doctor suggest? Also-kind if curious why you are posting this on a MCAS site. Does your doctor think you have MCAS? Yeah. That is why I have taken all the tryptase tests I have not been tested for pots. I have tried to do the test myself. Those dizzy symptoms are very inconsistent. Real bad when getting out of a hot bath or shower. Lots of pressure in my head when I bend over. How does your doctor explain the normal tryptase? Assuming you had it drawn during a flare, without the rise to meet criteria, do they still think you have it? Are they testing other mediators? Treating you for MCAS? I am confused because your symptoms do not sound like MCAS and your testing would indicate that you do not have it. My doctor believes I have it, but like many people on this forum... My tryptase is not elevated. I have athsma, I get hives, am allergic to just about anything that is not organic. The other week I went in to get a mold of my teeth and I called the dentist to ask if there was an anesthetic in the puddy because my whole mouth and throat went completely numb for hours. Pretty sure I cannot have anything with Red Dye either. \n\nAll the allergic symptoms aside from inability to breath from asthma and my throat closing up is pretty managable. Even in an asthma attack (mostly in the winter) I would go outside and just calmly breath the cold air and it would be okay. But what really sucks the most is the anxiety, dehydration, migraines, and brain fog. Especially the brain fog because I need my mental clarity to work in the field I am in. \n\nAll I know is that I can go on a low histamine diet and my anxiety is better, my dystonia is better, brain fog, migraines are gone. \n\nI will try increasing electrolytes via diet as suggested.  You are correct-there are many undiagnosed, self diagnosed, and otherwise not MCAS confirmed people on this site giving medical advice. Good luck! Not just pots... sounds like other dysautonomia issues. Just thinking out loud- maybe your muscles are super tense in the neck because if craniocervical instability. It is common in EDS or JHS , which is common in mast cell issues.", "Can bloating/distention be a reaction even when you have not eaten anything? Also, help me solve my mystery flare :) \\~\\*The magical mystery flare\\*\\~ \n\nSo I am trying to figure out if I have just had a delayed reaction to something I ate, or if I am suddenly distended because I am reacting to something environmental. To start, I have not really been getting delayed reactions in my gut. If it does not like something, I will bloat pretty immediately. I am fairly certain this reaction is an MCAS thing (although I do have sibo) because I also have some throat irritation and itchiness. **If you read this whole thing please do not judge me for being flagrantly irresponsible with the amount of possible triggers :(** I have been feeling good recently because of cromolyn and I got lazy, I admit it! I know no one can tell me what the cause is, obviously, but I wanted to share everything I have done in case someone has a tidbit of insight that might be helpful :) \n\nMy GI stuff has actually been decently controlled now that my cromolyn is up to a higher dose. Not quite to target but almost (goal of 200-300mg 4x/day \\ up to 700mg). I have **not** increased in the last couple days. \n\nI present my evidence:  \n1) I bought some Tulsi tea, hearing of its benefit for MCAS. Tried that yesterday, and overall felt good. However, it is an adaptogen and those can be hit or miss for me (ashwagandha is terrible). Tulsi should probably be brought in for questioning.\n\n2) I also bought quail eggs, because I read that they have mast cell stabilizing and antihistaminic properties. So with the Tulsi going well yesterday, I thought I would try the quail eggs today (I ***know*** I should have given more time in between but I am so bored of my diet). I tried four quail eggs (they are teeny tiny so altogether they maybe equal 1-1.5 standard egg). I had those around 1:30pm for lunch. Again, I do not think I had any reaction, nothing very noticeable but I was working and distracted. I realize now I did also have some decaf coffee with cream maybe around 2:30pm, which could be the culprit. I had cream a couple days last week and I got a stomach ache but then I realized it was past due date (though it did not curdle or taste weird) but I chalked it up to that....but overall I will say lactose has not been great to me lately and I have mostly cut it out. Suspicious. Possibly prime suspect. \n\n3)  I had a piano delivered at around 12:00pm. The pianos are supported by our municipality, painted beautifully by local artists, left out in the summer for folks to play, and then stored at volunteer houses overwinter. I played this for a bit in the afternoon. Then today around 5:30 after playing it I started getting pretty intense bloating and distention. New prime suspect? \n\nI mean, it almost feels like I have had a reaction to this piano because of the timing. Which is absurd but maybe it is moldy?  It only stays out in the summer, so it is not getting rained on much, but it is outside. Or maybe it is the paint? It is long since dried but maybe it is releasing a chemical? Sigh. \n\nI am hoping it is just a delayed reaction to the stupid quail eggs or coffee cream. This was unfortunate timing on my part to start all this shit at the same time so I will obviously back off from it all but....just curious if anyone has noticed distention/bloating from an environmental trigger and not ingested?? Which would make my prime suspect the piano. But at this point I am loathe to believe that and want to think it is just a delayed reaction to one of my many silly food choices. \n\nIf I knew proper legal jargon this would probably be funnier, but there you go, my attempt at bringing some humour to this disease. Next step is to take out a restraining order against my mast cells. If it was me, the obvious bloating trigger would be the water the coffee was made with. For real. I am allergic to nickel and other metals and get terrible bloating if my water is not sufficiently filtered (distilled or reverse osmosis, usually). \n\nBut it could totally be the cream. That makes my (totally healthy) husband bloat. A lot of people have trouble with lactose. \n\nI have never had a gastrointestinal reaction to an environmental trigger. You said it yourself.  The timing is too close together.  Solving GI triggers can take months or years of keeping journals and studying the data.  Honestly, sometimes triggers are common and randomly in food.  In those cases, the only solution is a simple diet that reduces the chances of randomly ingesting the trigger.\n\nSometimes triggers are water soluble, will aerosolize, and dissolve in to liquids. If the problem persists no matter what diet you go back to, the piano might actually be something to consider. Thanks for the reply. I mean I have lived with this for a number of years and I know it takes months and years of figuring it out. I just shared in the hopes that someone might have some info that could help me narrow it down. And to be honest writing that out was mildly cathartic.\n\nFor example, someone on another group posted their issue and said they were taking nettle supplements (among a number of others) and I mentioned how nettle, whilst it can be anti-histaminic, also has a mechanism by which it can be a trigger (I do not think a lot of folks know that). I was thinking maybe I am missing something, maybe quail eggs or tulsi actually flare a lot of people despite the fact that they are listed as helpful by many mast cell or histamine intolerance sites. Of course, knowing mcas we can react to anything even if it is supposed to be helpful. But I am always curious about other's experiences. The lists like SIGHI are all in contradiction with one another, and then there is of course no research on how foods actually work within the patient population so you have to go by anecdotal evidence. I had not heard too many people talk about either of these things so I am curious.\n\nAgreed, will keep an eye on the piano in the absence of improvement. Which would be really unfortunate as it is stuck with us until May....but I am processing everything and really suspecting the cream. I tried the tulsi again because I am apparently a sucker for punishment and it felt like it helped calm things down. Oh shit wow, I had heard of folks reacting to water but I kind of forgot/put it out of my mind. I am sorry you experience that! That said, I drink tons of water just from the tap and do not usually react to it. That is something to consider though. \n\nI agree about the cream, been thinking more about it and more convinced. I have been cutting down on my dairy, stopped drinking my decaf tea with milk in the mornings and stick to lactose free fresh cheese (I have a very hard time giving up dairy so it is a slow process of reduction), but in a moment of weakness I bought a small thing of it. My throat has been less sore overall so considering I got a sore throat from this incident....suspicious.\n\nThanks for answering about a gastro reaction to environment. I do not think I have either. I mean, not that there are many rules for how things can manifest but for me it typically seems to have a pattern of inhaled trigger sticking mainly to lungs/respiratory/throat, plus skin/neurological; however the other way around, something I eat impacting my respiratory tract certainly happens. I have GI reactions to environment. It is that feeling where you walk into a store and suddenly you are sweating and cramping and have a few seconds to get to the bathroom. It does not happen to me as much now that I have been on xolair a couple years. I definitely get bloating/gastrointestinal symptoms from environmental triggers--both to standard allergens like mold and to VOCs I react to. The symptoms are tied to me being near the trigger, though, so if it were me, if the piano were causing my symptoms, I would start burping or feeling different as soon as I went somewhere that did not share air with it. \n\nIt is usually not so hard to figure out when I am reacting to an object because I can try alternately sealing things off/removing them from my presence somehow and bringing them back until I find something that causes a dramatic difference. Food triggers are much harder to figure out because the reactions are long-lasting and sometimes delayed. Hmmm you bring up a good point. My bloating lasted well into the evening and I was far away from the piano, upstairs in another room. So I wonder if it would have kept going if it were that. \n\nThanks for answering, I had not experienced bloat from an environmental trigger but good to know that others do, it is possible. I will have to keep investigating. I started eating quail eggs for a while as I has no other protein I could eat. I gradually started to notice that my bloating was getting more frequent but not at obvious times. The quail eggs were the last thing I took back out that I was not 100% sure about and they were definitely causing me issues. If I were you I would stop having the quail eggs and leave it a few days, see what happens. Thanks, yeah I did take them out. It is so weird how some antihistaminic foods cause opposite reactions in people! I get this also with nettles. I might try them again just to be sure but my reactivity has gone down. So annoying. I know, it really f****** sucks. I had to cut down to just 10 things I could eat (including salt etc) because everything made me bloat. Even then I could only wear baggy jumpsuits and dungarees because anything around my waist made me bloat. I hit the low point of no bra/bralette after that (not easy with an F cup). Then just a few days ago I managed to start wearing them and building up my tolerance of wearing loose joggers again. I am now up 2 whole new things I can eat too, trying to hit 15 \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude2d\ud83e\udd1e I would suspect the bloating is either something you ate or an imbalance in your gut microbiome.\n\nI just start looking into the specific carbohydrate diet. To sum it up, do not eat any di- or polysaccharides. Monosaccharides are okay. Sounds simple but it gets complicated. \n\nI know I do better when I cut way back on my carbs. I know wheat bothers me. \n\nAnd now I am working on my microbiome as well. Turned out it was probably the quail eggs, but also just a multiplicity of things going on. There is definitely an imbalance in my microbiome, hence the sibo. I also found out I have some fungal stuff going on. Plus with the MCAS not being fully under control, that causes inflammation and a feedback loop of destroying the gut lining. \n\nGenerally I feel slightly better when I eat less carbs too, but I have eaten gluten free and not very carb heavy for years and am already on a restrictive diet with histamine intolerance and have had eating disorder patterns in the past so to me the important thing has been eating a diversity of foods and not overly restricting. Plus specific carbohydrate diet is not that compatible with HI. It is worked well so far and I am doing a lot better now that I have been on cromolyn longer, cut out the quail eggs, and started treating sibo again paired with a prokinetic - I am only day two on a prokinetic and I already feel a million times better. Got To get the gut moving! Everyone is so different in their needs but I appreciate you sharing, got to just keep trying until something works.", "please help me... hi guys, my name is Keara and I am a 17 year old girl who has been struggling with GI related issues since I was a baby. I have seen gastroenterologist and naturopathic doctors, but no treatments or extremely restrictive diets have really helped me.\n\nI also have panic disorder and I am on anxiety medication, which seems to help a little but does not stop the intense panic attacks.\n\nthese often coincide with IBS attacks where I have diarrhea and severe cramping, with sweating, dizziness, and anxious thoughts.\n\nI am not sure if MCAS is what I have, but I am wondering if these symptoms seem like they may fit.\n\nI have been diagnosed with h pylori and sibo by a naturopathic doctor, but nothing by the gastrointestinal professionals. I am really tired of running the same track and getting no results.\n\nplease respond if this seems to fit with MCAS, and if anyone has any tips for what I should do. While I am not a doctor and not diagnosing you, that sounds very much like what I go through. Generally you need two systems or more with issues for it to be MCAS, though. I get the GI issues and with that, anxiety.  But I also have rashes and hives and migraines to name a few. what are the other systems? I used to get migraines quite often but they have slowed down with physical therapy. I also get dizzy and hot flashes a lot of that is a different system Head/neurological, (anxiety, depression, dizziness) migraine, skin, (rash, itching, hives) GI tract, respiratory, heart, bladder/urinary, ears (tinnitus). That is all I can think of right now. I have had all of these except respiratory. You might want to look up Dr. Afrin and Dr. Dempsey for information.  My migraines have multiple triggers. Physical therapy did not affect mine. The other symptoms I get are brain fog, fatigue, photosensitivity, dizziness, facial flushing (sometimes painful), rashes with and without itching, skin mottling, diarrhea, bloating, water retention, stomach aches, gas, asthma, allergies and regular symptoms like runny nose, sore throat, ear aches, sinus congestion, severely dry mouth, severely dry eyes, post nasal drip, hives, rashes, blepharitis, chemical sensitivity, nerve issues like warm sensations and buzzing, I get POTS secondary to MCAS so that involves tachycardia, syncope, adrenaline rushes, blood pooling.... \n\nThat is what I can remember off the top of my head. It sounds like it could be. We cannot diagnose. But certainly I have similar symptoms at times.\n\nBtw I would not put much stock in naturopaths, personally. You are better to stick with actual doctors (functional medicine doctors can also be helpful).\n\nIf it is MCAS, then it is a very complex illness. You would need actual medical help. Some supplements can be very helpful for MCAS though. My doctor approves of the supplements I take. Have you been tested/biopsied for celiac disease?

Do you feel generally healthier on the Xolair?\n\nI have chronic urticaria and have tried everything for it which is why my doctor asked me to consider Xolair. She said it would help with the hives, which are pretty torturous to me. But I am also bothered that I am a 21 y/o female and I feel like an old lady. I have so many GI issues, my body aches, I am tired and weak, I cannot exercise without getting dizzy or sick, I just over all feel extremely unhealthy constantly despite being one of the healthiest people I know (in terms of diet, trying to be active, and being chemical free). Plus taking so many harsh medicines constantly I feel really anxious about what it is probably doing to my body considering I am so young. I am scared if I add another medication I might feel even more sluggish and weak. I was wondering if Xolair would only help the hives, or if I would also become healthier in other ways like being able to exercise and feel strong. Any comments about xolair would be greatly appreciated, I am losing a bit of hope after dealing with this for so long. The only thing I regret about xolair is not starting it sooner. It is by FAR the most effective medication for absolutely every single symptom you mentioned. What vitamins help you the most. I am having trouble finding a b6 and others. Right now I found a good vitamin d and e B12 and D3 Yes.

I appear to have some type of mast cell dysfunction in my bladder, mostly the bladder trigone/neck area.  I also tend to get a lot of UTIs... LOTS of antibiotics....", "SUNITINIB - experiences?? ", "Interstitial Cystitis caused by MCAS My MCAS doctor and source advised me that symptoms I have been experiencing could very well be due to interstitial cystitis: Frequent urination, nocturia, feeling need to go often.  The doc advised it can be treated with pentosan / Elmiron if a UTI is ruled out. I had a urine test done by my primary care and they said no to infection. \n\nAre there any good supplements for treating interstitial cystitis or anyone have experience with treating those symptoms or taking those medications? I have IC symptoms (mostly pressure, pain, burning and sometimes frequency) due to mast cell and taking mast cell stabilizers and H1/H2 antihistamines help me. (Treating mast cell) \nI do have other issues that probably caused the ic symptoms like an auto immune disorder but the antihistamines still help.\n\nAlso Benadryl helps me with frequency/nocturia. If I have a flare up, I will take one and sleep all night without having to get up and wake up feeling better.\n\nFinding a good urologist that has experience in IC is a good place to go. There are a lot of treatments for IC and depending on your symptoms and everyone responds differently...your doctor will recommend what is best. \n\nHope you feel better soon! xx Thanks for the response. I was taking Ketotifen and even Benadryl nightly for several years for sleep aid and to help with symptoms of mast cell and I think my body got to a point of not responding as well to it over time.  How did you find your urologist that was experienced in IC? Cromolyn sodium helps me to not get them as often. I also take D-mannose to prevent UTIs as I do also get those frequently. When thr IC flares benedryl almost always helps lessen the pressure/pain. Ah, yeah that is possible. I try to keep it as a rescue and use Melatonin to sleep. I take Zyzal up to four times a day for mast cell (doctor wants to see if that helps before adding ketotifen) and it keeps me pretty drowsy lol \n\nI just did a quick google search for my city and IC specialists. Have you spoken with your MCAS specialist about your urinary symptoms? They will usually have doctors they can recommend that they have worked with. Here is a link that may help also. :) \n\n\n\nI also found that keeping inflammation down really helped. When I have a flare-up with pain, frequency and difficulty urinating, I find ibuprofen helps a lot. I do not know if you can tolerate it. I am going to try turmeric soon, since I cannot take ibuprofen too much. I have had great success with pyrroloquinoline quinone. I get it from Amazon and it is abbreviated PQQ. If you search PQQ you should find it.\n\nI read that it is supposed to help mucus membranes so I figured it was worth a try for bladder lining.\n\nI had like a kidney infection and one or two UTIs in 2018 and then learned of this supplement and started it.

Do you take a lot of Benadryl? I have noticed if I do not take potassium while taking Benadryl frequently, I get cramps in my feet and around my ribs. magnesium?  I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia many years ago and I always thought it was from that. Along comes MCAS and now I get it more. Dr. Afrin mentions it as one of the symptoms of MCAS.

Were you diagnosed by a doctor?  Do mast cell stabilizers like Montelukast help?  Do anti-histamines help? They were not diagnosed. This is like their third name they have posted under because they keep getting banned. Yes.  I have come across other accounts of theirs.  There are more than three of them.  It could be a troll.

It could also be a person with illness who is frustrated with their situation.  We never know.  So we must respond  with honesty and kindness and hope for the best.", "Does this sound like MCAS? I was recently diagnosed with POTS along with many food allergies that I was never allergic to in the past after having a few very bad allergic reactions- fainting, short of breath, severe cramps, dizziness, limbs tingling, numb mouth, etc. The first doctor thought it was the POTS episodes but after allergy testing, the doctor now thinks they were allergic reactions. I have completely eliminated all of those foods that I now know I am allergic to out of my diet and seem to be doing decent. I have been sticking to very plain foods that I know are \u201csafe\u201d. \n\nSince I have POTS, I am always chugging a lot of Gatorade or Pedialyte throughout the day and never had a reaction to these. Today, after both times I had each drink, my tongue got swollen with red bumps around the outside of it and also felt very raw. Then it became hard to swallow. It felt like I had food stuck in my throat. I would start to gag after trying to cough to \u201cclear\u201d my throat. My body also started feeling itchy but no rash. Luckily Benadryl helped. \n\nI had suspected MCAS for months due to these severe reactions to foods that I would eat almost every day and be completely fine until out of the blue. And now I am symptomatic to drinks that I have been drinking every day. I had a blood tryptase test done and it was in normal range, so negative for MCAS. \n\nDoes this sound like MCAS? Or could it be something else? Yes, it does.  POTS and MCAS are two different types of doctors' perspective on the same disorder.  You have the blood pooling issues with POTS because MCAS is causing chronic inflammation.  You only have so much blood in your body, and your body moves the blood around to different places depending on what kind of task the body needs to be doing.  Mast cells not only are responsible for these form of allergies, but they are also responsible to moving the blood around your body by opening and closing blood vessels.\n\nMCAS does tend to get worse over time until it is treated.  There are many recent posts asking what are some good OTC options for controlling MCAS :)  There are TONS of options that can really help for most people, without having to convince a doctor of anything (which can be quite difficult sometimes) I know some people believe this, but I do not actually agree that POTS and MCAS are the same thing. I think they interact, but I have POTS symptoms when I am not reacting to anything too. When I am reacting, I am usually just tachycardic (regardless of positioning), but my POTS sometimes does get worse during reactions.\n\nPOTS can be caused by many things including venous insufficiency, which can be caused by connective tissue disorders. Basically, the three are very interrelated, but that does not mean they are all the same thing. You did not get much response on this but yes, this sounds like potentially MCAS. \n\nI noticed you said you had a normal tryptase \"so negative for MCAS\" which is incorrect. Most people with MCAS have normal tryptase and even 15% of those with mastocytosis have normal tryptase. That is far from sufficient to rule out MCAS. \n\nHere is the diagnostic criteria:  A negative tryptase does not mean you dont have MCAS. The tests arent very reliable so symptom history and medication trials can be used to diagnose. This sounds like me, too, as far as out of the blue severe reactions. :( I am on month 2 and cannot have any soy or anything derived from it.", "Need a mast cell specialist - Maryland, USA I have been waiting for a MCAS appointment with Dr. Arnold Kirshenbaum at Allergy and Asthma Healthcare since February and *maybe* will get an appointment this year.

Do you think it rather helped with or contributed to MCAS? Hi ! I am vegetarian, and I have had less digestive issues since stopping meat. I still eat lots of eggs, and some cheese from pasteurized milk.\n\nI do not know if it made things better or worse, but I know I was often nauseous when I ate meat. Hi vegetarian, and I have had less digestive issues since stopping meat, I am Dad\ud83d\udc68 My Dad prefers BBQ I saw a webinar with Dr. Tania Dempsey and she recommended the Ketogenic diet or Carnivore for MCAS. I have been doing Keto for a couple of months now and I feel about 20% better. My blood sugar is stable all the time. I was for decades. The problem with it is I became sensitized to some of my regular foods, like wheat. So I have switched to low carb. Never had a problem with eggs or beef. Cheese and yogurt are okay, cannot tolerate milk tho. Beans can be hard to digest. And now that I have GERD tomato sauce is a no go.\n\nProbably the best thing is stay away from your sensitivities and eat your safe foods, whatever they are. And vary your foods so you do not get sensitized to them. I became sensitized to meat! So I am going back to being a vegetarian like when I was younger. Incredible how this works I am flexitarian but always prefer vegetarian/vegan meals. Meat makes me feel ill sometimes. I could never ever do keto. I have seen a lot of individual variation, but for me a vegetarian diet has lead to less nausea, better digestion and more energy. I also stay at a healthy weight without exerting any extra effort. \n\nWith mast cell, I cannot enjoy an active lifestyle anyways so there is no need for body-builder amounts of protein. Low carb diets might be great for weight loss, but they are not necccesarily right for someone with a serious autoimmune disease. Paleo, veganism and gluten free diets ended up making me sicker. Trendy diets are not usually sustainable, so do what is right for you. Food bloggers =/= medical doctors trained in mast cell dysfunction.  Just my two cents after years of dealing with this confusing disease. I was never able to go fully vegetarian so I dunno how helpful this is. Personally I found out that meat is one of my safest foods, plus I am fairly anemic when I do not eat meat regularly. But eliminating dairy and eggs helped me a lot. But I also became allergic to mushrooms, most beans, soy, quinoa and most vegetables... so no veganism for me :/\n\nI think it is all about how your food intolerances and food allergies line up. I do not think veganism or vegetarianism is the answer for everyone. I have been ovo-lacto vegetarian since I was a kid. After developing MCAS, I have not been able to tolerate eggs or dairy, except an occasional small amount of ghee.\n\nLike others here, I read that a keto diet may be beneficial for people with MCAS. Since I was so ill I decided I would try anything, including incorporating meat back into my diet. I have tried to eat chicken multiple times but had a reaction to it. I have not been able to add in eggs again either. \n\nI might try meat again when I feel better. For now, it is basically vegan plus occasional ghee.", "Feeling sick on montelukast I started taking montelukast, and it is really been a revelation.  Cromolyn definitely helped my symptoms, as did ketotifen (did not notice anything from other H1 antagonists, though).  But montelukast is really fixing the issues that I have - most notably, my gastroparesis symptoms have mostly disappeared, and I have been so sick in the past as to have to drink most of my calories.  It also seems to be addressing cognitive issues which are probably due to allergic rhinitis or just mast-cell-induced general brain inflammation.\n\nHowever, since I started taking it a week ago, I have felt incredibly sick - muscle aches, flu-like symptoms, and a general feeling of \"heaviness\" which is much like being sick.  Also, mania and insomnia, but I have also sleeping 14 hours every day.   The weird thing is, my sense of smell has returned (not gone away), and I am extremely hungry (due to aforementioned GI symptoms abating).  \n\nI am wondering if the reason I feel sick is because I am actually getting better, or if these are weird side effects of montelukast which are so bad I need to stop taking it.  Is it normal to feel sick when you begin to take montelukast, if you have serious mast cell issues? It is very common to experience your type of symptoms on montelukast ... solely via it is mechanism of action with LTD4. \n\nIf you have trouble with it ...there is always zariflukast ...though rarely prescribed in the US. \n\nOR if you are in the US, Zileuton can be an alternative to montelukast. \n\nMCD patients likely would benefit more from Zileuton if there are significant reactions since it is a 5-LOX inhibitor ... It simply blocks the synthesis of all leukotrienes ...not just select leukotrienes like Montelukast / Zariflukast does. So essentially ...less inflammation overall. I personally also got sick from it, but after about 2 weeks it went away and I could just feel the benefit from it. Yea, I seem to be getting a little better.  Thanks for chiming in. You are welcome. I will ask about Zileuton at my next appointment. Thanks", "Anxiety and MCAS? I am not sure what to make of an experience I had yesterday:\n\nStarted having a mild MCAS flare (flushing, headache) right when I was scheduled for an MRI (unrelated condition). \n\nIn the scanner, my heart started pounding (another MCAS symptom I get during flare), flushing and headache got worse, but then PANIC! \n\nI have had MRI\u2019s before-no problem. Newly diagnosed with MCAS and wonder if others have anxiety during flares? Absolutely, all the time. Definitely Anxiety is one of my worst symptoms. My psychiatrist couldnt treat my anxiety because it was caused by mcas. Once I starting treating my mcas, the anxiety dissipated. A sense of impending doom is actually a textbook symptom of an allergic reaction.\n\nMany people with anxiety have undiagnosed MCAS. Same.  Used to have completely debilitating anxiety - could not leave my house or talk to people.  It genuinely *all* disappeared just from antihistamines.  No psych meds, ever.  Just like 5 different kinds of antihistamines! Is not that crazy?! My psychiatrist could not figure it out, we tried a bunch of meds and only valium helped (mast cell stabilizer). He told me to look into POTS treatment and that is how I was diagnosed with MCAS. haha\n\nI still cannot drive, I have developed some issues/anxiett around feeling like crap from mcas.

Any illicit emotions (extreme happiness/sadness/fear/etc) will typically cause this as well. Furthermore, I have found that hepatomegaly / splenomegaly is usually associated with it in my case. \n\nI am not wholly sure if this is similar to what is going on here? This only happens to me during anaphylaxis. Hey just to be sure, but do you have nail gloss or anything on some of your nails in these pictures?

However, I do react to inactive ingredients in some of my meds and vitamins.  I happen to have learned that bread yeast neutralizes something that causes my reactions.  So, I grind up the meds and mix them with a few flakes of yeast and some water.  After giving the yeast time to work, I add the mix to hot water to kill the yeast.  Then I take the meds with no reaction.\n\nThis will only work for people who know a way to neutralize their triggers.  It is frustrating that I had to figure this out myself after many years and that doctors do not have a list of things that neutralize triggers to offer to patients.\n\nIt is also frustrating that I cannot ask anyone if yeast or heat could change my meds in someway.  I just have to try and see what happens to symptoms the meds are treating. I have.  \nMany have coconut derived ingredients which I cannot tolerate.  \n\nAlso be aware though that DAO will break down stomach histamine as well as food-bourne histamine.  \n\nIf you are low in stomach acid already, or if you take too much DAO, you will not break your food down enough and it will enter the small intestine undigested, where it can cause inflammation and reactions.  \n\nIf you have leaky gut then the food can also get into your blood stream and cause heightened reactivity. shoot!!! i have been taking so much of it, like out hand amount daily. thanks, i got to cut way back. also it is too much $$$ at the rate i have been taking wow that is crazy. good for you for figuring it out though, but i can only imagine the frustration. i can relate, my body is doing very wack things I used to react to naturdao since it is made from a mix of extracts from green peas and lentils.

I recently switched insurance and finally got approved for the shot last week, and I am going in for it tomorrow. After years of struggles with allergy medications that had limited effectiveness I am pretty excited by the prospect of this new approach, but I also have no idea what to expect. The doctor recommended the shot specifically as a way of managing my dermographia, but also suggested that it could help with some of my other symptoms. I was wondering if anyone else with MCAS has taken Xolair and what their experiences with it were like. Okay I just saw a couple posts about Xolair that I somehow missed before writing up this post, so that is a whoopsie I am around to answer questions, but it is the single most effective medication for my MCAS and my pressure urticaria I have ever used. My only regret is not starting it sooner. I have been on it since 2015.

Unfortunately it quit working so I discontinued treatment. Long shot, but does anyone take this with another biologic?

What do you define as a \"safe\" food? If you are only counting histamine, then you could be sensitive to other aspects of foods, such as salicylates. Also important to keep in mind that allergies often change within MCAS so what was once a \"safe\" food may not be safe anymore. Well Tuna, seemed to be ok.

Like, are the symptoms so overwhelming that you clearly have a serious issue? Or can you feel mostly fine for most of the time and then periodically have mild issues that occur in isolation and not all at once? I think it varies from person to person. I have been in a highly reactive state for a couple years now after exposure to toxic mold and can go into anaphylaxis just from contact with cold water in addition to food triggers so it deeply affects my life. I might go a month or two feeling relatively \"normal\" but as soon as I am triggered I am pretty miserable for weeks on end. It can vary all over the map, but usually not rapidly. It can get really bad and stay that way for months or years, or it can go into remission, again for months or years, or you bumble along somewhere in the middle. At my worst I have been in comas, at my best I have not reacted to anything at all for years at a time.\n\nI have had it for 65 years, so my experience is very different.

It seems the more times you have a reaction to something the more easy it is to have a reaction to something else, so it snowballs. So live as \"clean\" as possible. Many of us have chemical sensitivities as well so not only a more \"natural\" lifestyle but limit your exposures there as well, so that you are also living a minimal lifestyle. I think it is different for everyone, but definitely noticeable. I was almost non-functional until I got on the right mix of meds. I had mild symptoms since childhood. Flushing, joint pain, fatigue, mild asthma. It usually followed a pattern of 18 months of symptoms, then 3 years without symptoms. It went away during my pregnancies, and also when I broke my leg. It was mild enough that I did not know what it was. I suspected something autoimmune because that runs in my family, but nothing showed up in the blood tests I had, so I just did not worry about it.\n\nThen about five years ago, in my late 30's, I went through some very stressful things and my symptoms suddenly became severe and stayed that way.  I lost a bunch of foods, could not go into most stores without an asthma attack, the brain fog was so bad I thought I was getting dementia, and then I started having anaphylactic reactions. The first allergist I saw thought it was all in my head, then someone in an allergy group mentioned MCAS and I found a local allergist who treated MCAS and went to see her. I have been doing a lot better on meds, and my ongoing stressful situation has partly resolved itself, so I have less stress, which is a big trigger for me. I am getting foods back, and the ones that are still a problem are causing mild symptoms like sore throat rather than anaphylaxis. It varies. Ive had symptoms my whole life but they were tolerable. But in thr last 3 years, although still an invisible illness, it almost pushed me to disability. Depends on the type of mast cell disorder and highly depends on the person. \n\nI kissed my SO tonight and I started to react. Turned beet red on my face, hands, ears. So there is that....", "Mast cells vs COVID vs something entirely different With so many symptoms it can often be tricky to differentiate between MCAS symptoms and an \u201eexternal\u201c issue. \n\nOn top of the normal MCAS symptoms I have got _intense_ throat/ear/sinus pain + strong chills + feeling feverish and much weaker than normal + swollen lumps/lymph nodes, one on each side of my breasts, that feel sore + appetite is completely gone.\n\nI am not sure if that\u2018s just MCAS (I know the ear/throat pain from a previous flare, but it was not as severe.) or sth different. One one hand I do not want to spread sth to my loved ones, on the other hand I am much to weak to leave the house and walk to the doctors office. I just want to sleep. \n\nDid you experience something similar? Yeah, I have gotten those symptoms two years ago, when there was a nasty flu going around. I was out of commission for like a month and had to restart a prednisone cycle \ud83d\ude2c.\n\nThe only thing I would say is to get tested asap. Unfortunately you *do* need to know if you are dealing with covid. Do you have a fever? I take my temp whenever I am feeling off. Hi feeling off, I am Dad\ud83d\udc68 I do not know but I fell really feverish Really does not mean anything. I get hot sweats when I have an upset stomach, but no fever. Indeed", "Anyone have tattoos? I have MCAS and am looking into getting a tattoo as a memorial for my late mother. Anyone have tattoos? Any issues yes healing? Interesting blog about it\n I have a few tattoos. No issues except a coverup I had done that included a lot of red ink, really saturated because of the color it was covering. That one still randomly swells up and itches like hell. The longer I have it the less it happens, so hopefully one day it stops. You should be fine, but make sure you have an epi close by if you get one done! I talked to my immunologist and he was like \u201cit could go either way.\u201d I did not think it was helpful but i think I am going to do it anyway. Do it! I think my irritation is not really related to my mastocytosis but I cannot rule it out either. I did recently have another done and a small patch of red in it and it is healing fine no itching at all. Good luck :))) Thank you!! I am allergic to the main component of many tattoo inks and hair dyes. I was advised to get a test patch before getting any type of ink. \n\nAllergy test patches I have had involved a pad with the substance being tested taped to your upper back for 3 days. I did not even know that is a thing. That is great advice! I will have to ask my allergist about it.", "I cannot keep doing this every day!!!!!!! Help. I keep trying to drink it away. I wake up on good days. Days I did not even drink the day before... And there is the brain fog the house gets worse and worse.. \n\nYeah, first thing I do when I open my eyes as I have all sorts of ideas about all the things I can do during the day, how I can go do this and that and the other thing because I feel like maybe I can live a normal life for once \n\nAnd then, as the next hour or two or three goes on, the brain fog gets worse and worse and worse.  My options are to suffer or to last down and it is fucking 3PM. 3PM and I have accomplished absolutely nothing, other than being awake for a short while and having brain fog start to build.\n\nSnd how I already have to lay down and I cannot f*** do anything, and I have to lay down until maybe the brain fog clears up enough for me to feel like possibly I will feel okay, if I am lucky, and that means I do not have any other weird f****** side effects like feeling like I have the flu or my eyes feel like there is weird s*** in them and I cannot even see straight and just want to close my eyes again.\n\nAnd then, by the time I get through that, the day is almost over.\n\nAnd guess what, if I am lucky I will be able to have a normal night's sleep but, there is a very good chance that I am going to have to suffer through weird insomnia, restless leg, we are ditches in my body that keep moving around at that keep me awake for hours...\n\nAnd I give up on certain days and decide screw this I am just going to go drink a bunch of beer and booze and try and forget about it.\n\nAnd that just makes me feel like crap as well the next day once the alcohol clears out, but maybe makes me feel happy for at least 2 hours during the process, but ends up being a big waste of f****** time because I have to recover from it and then I go right back into the goddamn match cell b******* again.\n\nI have no idea how any of you cope with this. I cannot f****** do another day of this I cannot do it it is not stopping it is never ending it just keeps going on and on and on and it is going to be there tomorrow it is going to be there the next day it is going to be there in a f****** next day what the f*** do you guys do to f****** cope with this? I want to f****** give up I am f****** tired I do not want to f****** do it another day! I am sorry you are going through such a tough time. I remember when I felt hopeless and terrible every day. What is your treatment protocol as of now? Frustration should be the most common symptom of this illness. I do not know where you are in figuring out what works for you but here is some things I did. \n\nI focused on prioritizing figuring out triggers and researching meds/supplements/side conditions over everything else except one thing- school/work. If you have got two hours a day you got to use it to make progress, even if that means other parts of your life goes down the tube for a while... because later you can rebuild connections after you are feeling better and have a doctor and meds and options and 6 hours of energy. I moved back in with parents so I could just do this for a while. \n\nEven now I still got to really limit triggers and prioritize ruthlessly- work then people then anything else. I did not play video games or write for 3 years while I was stabilizing. Did not have hobbies except for what I did with other people to fill social needs. Treated my life like I was a sim that needed to be kept happy enough to do well at work. \n\nI hybridized all tasks- everything I did accomplished two things at once. I did the dishes while my roommate was eating so we could talk. I ate while lying down watching Netflix so I could rest and experience food reactions when it did not matter as much. I made food I could eat with my partner for a date. \n\nSome of the more common triggers I think are food, shower stuff, laundry detergent, cleaning supplies, mold, dust in beds pillows or couches, not enough sleep. Alcohol, obviously, which might make it hard to figure out other triggers while you are reacting to that. \n\nThere is many kinds of mast cell stabilizers and I have found it really works to have a bunch of them instead of just one since they all work on different pathways. \n\nAshwagandha or other GABAa herbs can help mimic some of the relaxation of alcohol without the horrible reaction, plus it is a moderately good mast cell stabilizer. But be careful if taking with alcohol as they can increase each other\u2019s effects I think. The one I am only following half assed because I do not have the patience and the fortitude to go through the suffering until it starts sticking? I got a shot of xolair every month, I take xyzal everyday, and I am supposed to be taking three to four doses of cromolyn every day, but I suck at doing that, and the days that I drink to try and forget about all this, I definitely do not follow through with the protocol and I am sure I make myself worse. So I have to magically figure out how to have the patience, and be able to White knuckle through the days where I just feel like crap and I just have to lay there all day and maybe get a couple hours out where I am someone possibly functional and hope that somewhere down the line the medication will start to stick.\n\nUnfortunately I suffered through this for years and I mean decades, multiple before someone even figured out what the hell is going on and at this point my morale is shot. Especially going through torture from my own terrible experience is combined with an inadequate inapt, incompetent medical community that almost killed me several times in the process of going from garbage doctor the garbage doctor before I finally got blasted lucky enough to find one who actually seems to know what she is doing. Maybe I will check into ashwaganda.\n\nI have spent so much of my life laying in bed but I cannot f****** imagine doing it anymore and yet... I do not have a choice. I fucking hate this. I mean yeah it sucks. \n\nSome other mast cell stabilizer supplements/meds that helped me: palmitoylethanolamide which also help with nerve pain, ketotifen, once or twice weekly Ativan. I take these and cromolyn sodium and sometimes quercetin (short lived though) or ashwagandha. So I take 4-6 mast cell stabilizers to get this under control for me, but now I can work 12 hour work days instead of having 0-2 hours of energy, so worth it. \n\nI am also reactive to all the triggers I listed and going outside. So I avoid a ton of stuff so I have energy. \n\nNAC helps with brain fog. \n\nAspirin, doxepin, and Zyrtec for blockers of histamine and prostaglandins. \n\n\n\nMeds are the only way out of the frustration of simply not enough time I am afraid. Trying them is with the time and money. Ashwagandha helps me so much with brain fog and also with feelings of panic during reactions. Wal-Mart has some for $8. I take it twice a day. It sucks really bad. I spent a couple years wanting to die because I could not find a doctor who would believe me, I could not breathe when I left the house, I kept losing foods. And then my kid started having symptoms and I felt like I had to get my shit together and act like it was a manageable condition, so she would have hope.\n\nI do not know what would have ever motivated me otherwise, but I think it is reasonable to feel depressed and hopeless when you have such a difficult chronic illness. I think a good therapist would probably be able to help, if you are open to stuff like that. Will get some today! I hope it helps Lol. I have the whole team. I will talk to my therapist this week but I feel like a broken record. \n\nTrust me. I know all about doctors thinking it was all in my head. Terrible doctors all over the place The only thing on that list but I know I do not like is doxepin. Because right now for instance I am so tired I am freaking out and crying. And if I take something that makes me more tired without relaxing me, I can get screwed. but I am already screwed to be honest, I think I am going to have to take a milligram of Ativan to calm down and hopefully go back to sleep. \n\nI should not have drank yesterday. I really really really hope this ashwagandha stuff helps and I will try some of the other stuff as well. You can drink alcohol? Wow Honestly I probably should not.\n\nIt really really messes me up the next day.\n\nI am a mess right now.\n\nBut for years no one knew what the hell was going on, and I would get really bad brain fog and not be able to function and I figured out if I drank through it, at a certain point the brain fog would be overtaken by the alcohol buzz and I would be able to function.\n\nBut it certainly is not healing me and that is what I need right now is it f****** healing a big change in my lifestyle that is going to help me heal and become functional like a normal person. I am so sorry. I am right there with you, not that that helps. Smoking weed helps me and does not cause a reaction. That is my current method for coping. Do not give up, it does help me knowing I am not the only one. So thanks. I cannot do weed. I go off the deep end for weeks if I even smoke it once. I tried it a few years ago just to be sure. Biggest mistake. \n\nThanks for checking in. I guess we are not alone. Did you try it out? I know exactly how you feel. It is exhausting it is depressing and I get overwhelmed with hopelessness anxiety and depression when yet another treatment option just does not help. Going from working out 5 times a week, going out with friends, eating, traveling, drinking, working to being house bound just is depressing. On top of that having to endure all this pain, brain fog, dizziness and what not.\nBut for every problem there is a solution. I do not know my solution yet but there physically has to be something that can be done so I am better and the same applies to you. We just got to keep trying and trying and trying and researching and enduring all that until we find a medication or anything that helps us. If most doctors would think outside of the box more id probably be there already but you cannot really rely on them. Got To do you own research and one day you will find something. Speaking of drinking, I started going to AA, I do not drink a lot, but I do have a tendency to drink when I feel really bad because it helps me fall back asleep or numbs the shity feeling. \n\nBut also I know it is dirty and definitely not helping me heal at all. On the flip side AA is a great support group and unfortunately there is no Mast Cell activation support groups that have daily meetings that I know of.\n\nI am trying to figure out how to just start a zoom meeting. Stay tuned you or anyone else who is interested. \n\nI might just wing it. Maybe even incorporate the 12 steps as a model. Who knows. I got some lol forgot to take it today.. I will put it on my nightstand where I keep my meds Okay keep us updated please. and? I will report if I see send changes. I promise Sounds like you not only have MCAS but also sounds you have POIS... do you experience brainfog after orgasm ? temperature is a trigger Take Kava kava if its legal around there I do not think so... Maybe fatigue. What is POIS?\n\nIronically I have to use orgasm to shut down my restless leg many nights. It is the only thing that works. Does not that make you tired? I have a phobia at this point, like PTSD of being unnaturally or overly tired with my fatigue. It can really make me manic fast. I will not even take sleeping pills. I can tell you straight away you need mood stabilizers or GABA-agonists. There is a hint of mania in the way you write this is probably due to mast cell activation and all the catecholamnines /serotonin.\n\nSome sleeping pills ( GABA-agonists / benzodiazapines)  can counteract some mast cell degranulation symptoms in some. Kava kava is natural and effective.. maybe combine kava kava with CBD.  Ashgawanda is more of a sedative you can combine this with taurine ( taurine higher dosages ). IT will at least reduce alcohol cravings... alcohol is the worst thing you can take.\n\nIts better to spend a little money on these instead of taking risks with benzodiazapines or alcohol... unfortunately everything that benefits me is illegal here not only certain medications but also supplements like kava or ephedra. Its post orgasmic illness syndrom where people experience mast cell degranulation during or after an orgasm.. symptoms may last up to 1 to 4 weeks. all symptoms are identical to MCAS symptoms. (\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthere is also a POIS reddit where you will find symptoms which are 100 % identical to MCAS/MCAD.\n\nPeople with mastocytosis usually have orgasm as a major trigger. I was thinking about getting a Charlotte's Web pen. I already have the Ashwagandha.\n\nYea. I want to not take the alcohol but it is better than feeling like shit where I have energy but brain fog is so bad I cannot function so I just flounder around doing nothing.\n\nIf I could just get rid of the brain fog the rest would be crap but tolerable. Shit. Well I guess I am fucked. Literally and figuratively. I cannot sleep without orgasm to kill off the restless leg and if I was healthy again one of the other things I could not live without is sex.", "Does anyone have any experience with Dr. Joseph Butterfield at the Mayo Clinic?

I wish throwing up from it was my only issue,I developed neuropathy from it \ud83d\ude1e I have neuropathy also, I am not diabetic. And developed secondary Reynards disease in my hands and feet. Oh really? Was it from the contrast dye or from mast cell? I have to get MRIs with contrast every year for my MS. I have to take a mega dose of prednisone before hand so I do not react.

I (f20!) was just recently diagnosed with MCAS by my internist, maybe three months ago. He is absolutely lovely and even though he does not know much about it, decided we would deal with it together and put me on Singulair. It has helped some things (acid reflex, nausea) but has done little to relieve my biggest symptom, which is facial flushing and burning/hives. My biggest triggers are heat and emotional responses, and I have already ruled out things like my diet/smells/etc as triggers. \n\nI saw ( a while back on the types of meds people take, but - and if this is frowned upon here, please let me know, - it is still all a little confusing to me and I would love some help, I guess. I am thinking about contacting my doctor tonight and telling him the Singulair works fine, but that I would like to see about taking a stabilizer in addition, and then working on my own to maybe add in antihistamines (H1? H2?). Anyway, does this seem like the right route? To tackle a flushing issue, which stabilizer is most common or the best? Is there something I should be doing differently in terms of the order I add in meds? Would meds targeted towards mast cells/histamines be the direction to head in or would something like a benzodiazepine or similar work better to just to regulate my brain? \n\nI have EDS and POTS and a handful of other things, and my internist is great and I would prefer to not find an allergist or mast cell specialist because he is willing to work with and listen to me. I just feel like I am flying a bit blind and would love to hear from people who have nailed down how to manage their symptoms and/or know more than I do about the maze of medication options. Thank you in advance for any advice you can give me and sorry for being a bit all over the place! One is my favorite write ups on my favorite blog about the progression of treatment:\n\n\n Thank you so much, I will check it out! Have you considered you might have rosacea? It causes facial flushing. I have it on top of everything else.\n\nRosacea can be difficult to diagnose, even by a derm. A mild case may only present as flushing.", "Has anyone diagnosed with MCAS tried psilocybin? First off, this is all anecdotal and I have not been able to find a single piece of research on this topic. So a couple months ago or so I started trying mushrooms to help with depression and such. It did help some and still helps, but it is not a magic bullet on its own. However, I began noticing my mast cell issues were not as active. I could actually do things without my mast cells dumping, and it was ok if I took a dose of meds late. Before it was like clockwork, ~4pm and I start feeling bad and needing to take my meds. \n\nSome may think it is psychosomatic and the mushrooms helped treat depression, which helped the mast cell disorder. However, I am still depressed as shit and have extra stress lately. My mast cells should be freaking out more, but they are not. \n\nAgain, this is all anecdotal and I am not pedaling a cure/treatment. I am just wondering if anyone else has tried mushrooms after their diagnosis. My searching so far has turned up zero information on both clinical research and anecdotal experiences. &gt; Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT)2A receptor agonists have recently emerged as promising new treatment options for a variety of disorders. The recent success of these agonists, also known as psychedelics, like psilocybin for the treatment of anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and addiction, has ushered in a renaissance in the way these compounds are perceived in the medical community and populace at large. One emerging therapeutic area that holds significant promise is their use as anti-inflammatory agents. Activation of 5-HT2A receptors produces potent anti-inflammatory effects in animal models of human inflammatory disorders at sub-behavioural levels.\n&gt; ...\n\n(\nFlanagan TW, Nichols CD.\nInt Rev Psychiatry. 2018\ndoi:10.1080/09540261.2018.1481827 Oh yeah I remember seeing that paper but I have not read it fully yet besides the abstract. That is probably part of it, but it does not fully explain the longer lasting effects. It is almost like it helps to reset the behavior of the mast cells. Hopefully they do more research into this as laws let up. What kind of timeframe do you mean when referring to \"longer lasting effects\"? Like a couple of weeks, maybe more. It is hard to say right now exactly since I have not recorded anything as I did not really expect it to help with that. I have been dosing about every 2 weeks, about 4 times over two months or so. Interesting. I am totally speculating here, but stress can cause an inflammatory response, and psychedelics are often reported as having medium-to-long-term anxiety-reducing effects. I tried several times, had depression improvements for a long term. Did not know about anti inflammatory effects I was just about to try micro-dosing, myself, based on the idea that it could help to restore proper gut-brain axis communication. I did not micro-dose, I was taking larger doses, starting at around 1g-4g so far. It was kind of a Hail Mary since I have not been getting anywhere lately with doctors. So far I am cautiously optimistic. It is not a cure, but I am not flaring up all the time now. Well, I have been in a similar place for a while with respect to doctors, and psilocybin has actually been at the front of my mind in terms of potential miracle drugs. \n\nThere is a lot of anecdotal and experimental evidence that mushrooms can literally re-wire your neurons, and since the HPA gut-brain axis is what is responsible for so many of the things we associate with MCAS, there could be serious benefit beyond just the anti-inflammatory effects. There is so much unknown still it is crazy. I know in Oregon we have it coming up for vote to allow it for medical use. Can I ask where you got it from? Since it is not legal yet you have just got to get it where ever you can. Pick wild, know a guy, or figure out how to grow you own, which also is not legal. It is a shitty situation right now. Thank you! I will google to see if I can find a source I had experimented with shrooms many different times in my life for different purposes. Micro dosing for depression for a while helped. And off and on took shrooms just for fun. Recently tried shrooms again and ended up in the hospital for anaphylaxis. Had never had a reaction before but probably will not take the chances of trying again. Pretty bummed about it because I have always had positive experiences with psilocybin but this one of the worst allergy attacks I have ever had. Onset was about and hour after dosing.  Going To be paying off the ambulance ride for a hot minute \ud83e\udd75 That sucks. Did you eat the mushroom itself or as a tea? Did you also try LSD or MDMA? Curious for depression but also mast cell disorder. Nope, have not. Does this still seem to be effective for you? There is definitely still lasting benefits. I feel like it may have lessened some, but right now it is hard to say because I am in the process of moving and whatnot. Plus there was all the wildfire smoke not too long ago. So maintaining a baseline lately has been a little difficult. But I am still not as reactive and my memory is not super bad like it was before. Hey, really appreciate your feedback.\n\nDo you just still do macro doses or did you incorporate micro? I have not taken micro doses so far. Last one was 2.5g. I need to do it again soon and will probably take around the same amount. Though I do need to try a 5g dose at some point and see what that does. Would greatly appreciate if you updated here too if you are down for that.  \n\nI am coming across some major healing from people across different forums from microdosing.  I think one of the biggest things someone told me was all of their MS symptoms vanished.  It is cool to hear what people have been experiencing, so if you ever do end up microdosing, would love to hear about it too!  \n\nTake care Yeah, once I have more supply I will try microdosing. I am in Oregon so they should be more abundant in the future, plus the wild native mushrooms we have.", "GI issues with MCAS Hey all,  hate to be overly descriptive,  but anyone else deal with diarrhea with their MCAS? \nUsually I cannot eat leftovers if it is not the next day for lunch, or I get sick. But I ate a meal from last night for lunch today and got sick. Anyone else deal with this?  Do you just not eat left overs? What foods are the worst for you all? Most people freeze left overs right away because the histamine levels will build up pretty quickly in the fridge. And yes, I will sometimes get diarrhea during a flare up. There are tons of mast cells in your gi tract. Wait, if it goes straight in the freezer- leftovers can be okay!? This is so exciting! \n\nThanks for commenting and thanks to OP for asking the real questions \ud83d\ude02 My wife has pretty severe GI issues. We prepare her food ahead of time and freeze it. Right now, she can only eat rice, quinoa, and chicken. The rice and quinoa do not seem to be an issue if they are left out for a while before freezing, but we have to put the chicken in the freezer about 10 minutes after its done. Dang that is crazy! I never thought about freezing it after making it. \nChicken is my worst one too I have started just staying away from it! That makes sense. Chicken is pretty high in histamine. I only do one meal a day now because of this. I used to not be able to snack or eat anything before I finished for the day due to reacting so bad with food and having the GI issues so much. \n\nThough ever since I started loads of antihistamines and antiacids and Omalizumab, it is greatly improved. That all said, I usually take a Hydroxyzine or Cyproheptadine / or some other drowsy H1 antihistamine after eating to curb some of the effects. \n\n...also, the type of food did not matter to me really. \n\nThat said, it does sound like a gut motility issue. ( That sounds awful,  mine used to be that bad but ever since I went gluten free seems to have made it better.  Not sure if MCAS and gfree have abetting to do with eachother or not!? It is just on ocassion now and trying to find other triggers than wheat and left overs! Lol\nI take xolair as well and tends to help quite a bit! \nGood luck with your journey I hope it gets easier for you! My main symptoms are GI-related and I have been gf my whole life. Just found out that my \"IBS\" was actually MCAS a couple of years ago. \n\nBut every one of us has different triggers. If gf works for you, great! Best of luck! GI issues are really common with MCAS. We all have very different trigger foods although anything high histamine should be avoided while you are really unstable. If something gives you an upset stomach, avoid it. The H2 antihistamines should help with this. I used to get that prior to being put on cromolyn sodium. Cromolyn sodium pretty much resolved my constant diarrhea issues, though I still get GI symptoms during a flare. Any leftovers with meat get frozen now as they would cause a GI reaction. I can tolerate vegetarian leftover dishes from the fridge, though I generally freeze most cooked leftovers out of habit. I do! I also sometimes throw up \ud83d\ude22", "Changing your diet - lots of questions!! So I have just seen a specialist and she thinks it is very possible I could have MCAS, or what she said she likes to call \u201cmast cell reactivity.\u201d For now she just has me testing different antihistamines, getting labwork, and following up in like 5 weeks or so. The problem is that I have been practically bedbound for the past two months already and I feel like I am absolutely dying. So while I hope the antihistamines will help, I am not sure if they will help *enough* so I wanted to try to start working on slowly modifying my diet. I just have no clue how to go about doing this and would love some tips!! \n\n- (this might be stupid lol) Why do you need to eliminate \u201chigh histamine foods\u201d like tomato and vinegar? Is not histamine release dependent on if *your* body has a reaction?? \n- Was anyone a very picky eater and then had to switch to a low histamine diet? Did you find that over time your tastes changed? \n- Does anyone know of any good sources for low histamine recipes for kids? (thinking this miiiight be more friendly for picky eating?) \n- How do you keep track of what is causing a reaction? \n- Did you 100% cut out all high histamine foods? Or just did the best you could?\n\nI know that many will probably say that once I start feeling so much better I will WANT to eat these foods instead of the usual processed junk that I eat, I just feel like it is really hard to get over the hump. I already have problems with my appetite and so if the food is not appealing I am worried I will just not eat, which also makes me feel like shit. It is helpful to keep a journal of everything you eat and when, and any other possible trigger you may come into contact with. Also write down your reactions. A pattern may appear and you can figure out what you need to avoid. Everyone is different, \n\nEliminating high histamine foods can be part of figuring out what triggers your body. If they are not a problem you can add them back in. A low histamine diet is something you follow for several weeks and then you start adding things back in and see what bothers you. Stop thinking of food as entertainment/comfort and start thinking of it as medicine.\n\nPersonally, I react to a lot of low histamine foods and do not react to a lot of high histamine foods. But I think it is also dependent on how many high histamine foods you expose yourself to at one time.\n\nI have been dealing with this for 65 years, way back when the best treatment was avoid all your triggers and take H1 antihistamines. Things sure have changed. For me avoiding trigger foods was easy, I knew I would get anaphylaxis and possibly wind up in the ER. Very strong motivation that. \n\nThe Internet is full of low histamine recipes. I was doing a search last night. Tbh at this point I feel so sick I do not usually think of food as entertainment or comfort, literally just something to keep me alive. I am just a picky eater and have appetite issues as well so 97% of the low histamine recipes I have found so far make me want to gag. But thank you!! Like I said once I start to feel better I know I will not *want* to eat the things that are making me feel like shit, but rn I have no clue what those are and half the time I am too sick to even stand, so I just am like \u201ceating something is better than eating nothing\u201d Well, sometimes you have to make your meals very, very basic. Like, what is a safe protein I can eat? What is a safe starch I can eat? And what is a safe vegetable or two I can eat? And you will not have a lot of options for condiments. Salt is fairly safe.\n\nSo dinner might look like fresh broiled chicken breast (or beef patty), some rice, and some broccoli. Butter seems like a safe condiment, or maybe some olive oil. Yes it is boring, but safe.\n\nBreakfast might be some gluten free oatmeal and a couple of cooked eggs. You can put maple syrup on oatmeal, or sugar or whatever you tolerate. Oatmeal is very easy to make. Eggs are easy to boil. If you cannot tolerate oatmeal then there is rice, quinoa, millet, grits, etc... I used to eat a lot of puffed millet with maple syrup.\n\nI used to have giant salads for lunch, no dressing. Veggies and I tend to get along very well, it is fruit that hurts me. \n\nUnfortunately you cannot meal prep because the longer it sits the more histamine it forms, which is why you should either freeze leftovers or avoid them altogether.\n\nIf you search for low histamine recipes you will find lots of ideas, often grouped by breakfast, lunch or dinner. Try to come up with a few standards for each meal to make life easy for yourself. It is boring to eat the same thing over and over, but you save mental energy and you get more efficient at preparing it.\n\nAt one point there were only about 10 things I could eat. Eventually that list expanded, but you have to stop triggering yourself so your immune system can calm down. So I think I only ate those 10 things for about 6 months. Not fun, went to bed hungry, dreamed about food, got up hungry, hungry all day. I hope you are not that severe. But I noticed the more reactions I had the more likely I was to have more reactions. You get into a negative spiral.\n\nOne thing that helped me, and it is silly but it worked, is express gratitude towards your food. I think feeling calm and grateful while eating help cut down on the reactivity.\n\nOnce they find some medications that work you should feel better. The drug that worked best for me is doxepin, but back then there were not a lot of options. Nowadays I take montelukast and have a steroid nasal spray and ketotifen eye drops. I think when I run out of the steroid spray I will switch to Nasalcrom. I have Zyrtec and hydroxyzine on hand in case the montelukast is not enough. I also have famotidine on hand for when my gastric issues flare. Foods can be high histamine, adding even more histamine to one's body that already has too much histamine or foods can trigger histamine release, again, adding too much histamine. When mast cell degranulate, they release hundreds of different mediators. Its not just histamine. \n\nYou keep a food journal to track what you eat and your reactions. \n\nSome advice for an adult who is a picky eater. Get over it? If you want to get better you have to eat better. Try foods constantly even if you think you dont like it. It takes time to start liking foods but can happen. Dont like veggies? Try them roasted, it brings out natural sugars. \n\nNot eating makes you feel like shit? Have you had your insulin resistance checked? I have been repeatedly told that a low histamine diet is not necessarily helpful. I am currently following a gluten-free, dairy-free, low-sugar, and primarily plant-based diet. I still eat meat, though I am encouraged to eat plant-based proteins more often. The thought behind this is that gluten and dairy act like \u201cskeleton keys\u201d that can partially activate mast cells, so when something else comes along they can be fully activated. Also, I journaled everything to see if I had specific foods I react to and I do not, so low histamine does not make sense for me because there is no pattern to my anaphylaxis. This is regards to my body and what my doctor told me would be best for me. If I were you I would try to talk to a dietician as well as your doctor and collaborate on ideas that might help you out. It is better to have a team! Low histamine did not help me. Eating simple meals with only a few ingredients helped me figure out what foods I was reacting to. Histamine friendly kitchen has some recipes. Taste buds do change you got this I think it depends on where you get your low histamine recipes and diet info from. Like If you do not eat a lot of animal products you are going to have a lower histamine diet than someone who does. I used one book primarily and compared it with a few lists. \n\nI agree with others, you need a good journal so you can see what you ate today and yesterday when you are trying to identify a trigger.\n\nSo much is going to be specific to you and your situation, especially with all of the stress from life in general right now with the pandemic. Everyone is so different, but I can tell you what worked for me! I have had MCAS less than a year and have been following a low histamine diet. I hope to add more foods someday! I am currently tweaking medication, so it is helpful to keep my diet consistent and simple so I can really figure out what is working for me in that realm. Once I sort out my medication/supplement regimen, then I will work on adding more foods. I am trying to change only one variable at a time. I was completely bed-bound at first and I can say that adopting a low histamine diet led to the biggest and quickest improvement for me so far.\n\nI use mySymptoms food diary tracker app to religiously track food, exercise, medication, etc. It is a little annoying to use, but once you input your usual food, medicine, symptoms, etc., it becomes faster. This also shows me that while I have good days and bad days, I can see I am reaching some sort of improved baseline.\n\nIn terms of recipes, I personally have to eat everything so plain that a recipe would not be useful! Here is a typical day for me (not thrilling! lol): I typically have plain oatmeal or rice for breakfast. For lunch and dinner, I have rice (I can eat many kinds of rice so like to mix it up) with red lentils and a lot of steamed or boiled vegetables (either broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, or asparagus). Everything fresh and organic. No additives. No oil. For seasoning I add sea salt, and occasionally I can eat ghee or butter. As a treat I can eat a small amount of homemade applesauce. (I have been a vegetarian my whole life so this is why there is no meat listed above. Thankfully lentils and rice are a complete protein.) I cook in batches and freeze everything immediately afterwards. After 6 months I have it down to a science...mostly. As someone said above, you may want to consider food as medicine/nourishment first and foremost. While my diet is extremely plain and I never could have eaten like this during another period of life, the fact that it makes me feel better really does make it easier to stick to.\n\nThe other diet change that helped me a lot was to eat very consistently at the same times each day. You could start with an elimination diet (like r/zerocarb) and then slowly add foods back in to see which ones you tolerate best. Keep in mind reactions can take up to a few days to show up after ingestion.", "Could this be a mast cell disease? My story of what developed in stages following allergic reaction I am a 20 year old guy who has history of severe food allergies (all dairy products, wheat, and eggs) and asthma. Also struggle with bad anxiety. My food allergic reactions have been rather painful (throat and mouth itching followed by bad stomach pain and diarrhea) but never life threatening or causing any long term effect.\n\nAround 6 months ago (September), I accidentally ingested some bread. Had the typical reaction which went away after a few hours. However after that point I began having GI issues (frequent bloating, alternating constipation/diarrhea, tenesmus, intermittent stomach pain, loose stool) which seemed to worsen over time. Went to a doctor in December where they gave me a general label diagnosis of IBS. Nothing changed after this point but my anxiety levels went up as I did research into my symptoms and discovered possibility of IBD/Chrons/UC.\n\nAt this point, even though I was having uncomfortable stomach issues, they did not seem to be aggravated/helped by any specific food, and I could still generally eat whatever I wanted (outside of existing allergies). \n\nIn mid-January I tried drinking for the first time (incredibly bad idea considering I already had an upset stomach and related issues). Had some cheap off-brand vodka (it did not even have an ingredients label, but I figured even if it was wheat based it would not set off my allergy since it is only an issue with the protein, and I am usually fine with soy sauce, which is also made from wheat but fermented similarly to alcohol), only had half a shot and stopped because of the awful taste. Did not get a reaction instantly, but a few hours later when I was trying to sleep I woke up with bad stomach pain, a \"bubbling\" feeling in the gut and acid reflux (which I thought was vomiting/nausea at the time). My guess is that this was just the stomach issue being aggravated and not a delayed allergic reaction to the wheat vodka, since all my IgE reactions have been instant and not just in the stomach. \n\nAfter that point is when my GI symptoms because out of control and other symptoms in the body appeared as well. I began getting bad acid reflux and suddenly \"reacting\" to most foods (symptoms such as mouth sores/swelling, tingly feeling in tongue/mouth, popping in ears, sudden itch or burning feeling on skin, tooth/jaw pain, or flushing/random pulsating in body). These reaction symptoms are not very painful and usually go away within half an hour at maximum, but they mimic what I have had in the past with a true allergic reaction (for example I never get swollen gums/mouth unless I have ingested something I am allergic to). Worth noting that these psuedo-allergic reactions are usually delayed by an hour or two after eating, and seem to only start when the food hits the stomach (which confirms my guess that it could be mastocytic entrocolitis?) In addition to that my skin also became very sensitive; if I get a random scratch or burn the affected area will hurt for longer than usual and also leave a mark for a few days (Pretty sure this is dermatographia). Whenever I take a hot shower the part of the skin where water hit will turn red, although it is not itchy and goes away within minutes. I was in the hospital a few days ago for an endoscopy, and the spot where they put the IV is still swollen (this has never happened in the past when I had blood drawn or anything else with needles), in addition there were what looked like hives in the same place where they wrapped a adhesive following the procedure (could this be a mast cell reaction?). The acid reflux is persistent and there have been a few episodes where I woke up at night with stomach pain and bad acid reflux, very similar to what initially happened the night I had vodka. Strange thing is that it does not have the sour taste of acid and tastes more like the particles from whatever food I ate last.\n\nAll these symptoms have been pretty persistent and cyclic over the last two months, so far I have not been able to pinpoint what food or activity triggers what. It seems kind of idiopathic, for example I can eat one food and might get a reaction and then eat the exact same thing another time and not get it or have a less/more severe reaction. I do not seem to react to extreme temperatures, exercise, motion and vibrations, etc. like it seems many people with mast cell disorders do. Sometimes the reactions may also happen randomly when I am not eating.\n\nWent to the doctor again but could not narrow down the issue. Was given a week dose of Prednisone steriods which did nothing. So I began doing some research and at first was convinced that I had Eosinophilic Esophagitis, given the persistent acid reflux and history of food allergy (I also had trouble swallowing as part of the acid reflux, but never severe enough where I thought I was choking). I recently had an endoscopy done to test for that and still awaiting results. However I realized that since all these issues started in the gut, that is where the root cause is and the acid reflux issues are just a by-product of that.\n\nDid some more research and discovered the topic of this sub, and quite honestly when I first read about mast cell diseases it freaked me out. However I determined that I could likely have histamine tolerance since most of my reactions were food based. Tried a low histamine diet for a few weeks but it did not really alleviate the symptoms; in addition I do not seem to react any more to obvious high-histamine foods. So it is likely I could have just developed a bunch of random non-IgE food sensitivities as seems to be the case with gut issues like mine. Dug deeper and discovered leaky gut syndrome which explains why I seem to have random food sensitivities, and thought if I focus on healing leaky gut I might be able to reset my body back to normal. I read up on L-Glutamine and recently began taking it, however I have not noticed any change yet and also seem to get one of the psuedo-allergic reactions to the glutamine as well. So maybe it is not leaky gut...\n\nI tried taking Claritin 10mg daily which seems to lessen the symptoms, which is more proof that it could be mast cell issue. Then today I came across mastocytic entrocolitis or build up of mast cells in the gut which seems to best explain my issues. I do not know if they will test the biopsies from the EGD procedure for mast cells, but I plan to bring this up with the doctor when I go there next to discuss the results of the endoscopy. The past few months have been filled with worrying and anxiety but I think I have been able to narrow down a little what is going on with my body, which brings me to this sub for input from people who may have dealt with the same issues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy questions:\n\n1. Is it possible for mastocytosis to develop this quickly and be aggravated by allergic reactions/stomach upset (from what I have read, it takes years for people to realize they have mast cell disease and the average time to diagnosis is 10 years? Also do not triggers, e.g. alcohol or allergenic food in my case, just cause a flareup rather than developing/permanently intensifying the disease)\n2. Do mast cell diseases progressively get worse over time? Could my scenario evolve into worse reactions, more triggers, etc.\n3. I have read that mast cell disorders have a genetic component (nobody else in my family has allergies, asthma or any other diseases for that matter. Absolutely zero history of these things) and/or usually found together with POTS or EDS. I have none of those things, so is it possible I could suddenly develop a mast cell issue still? I do not think you likely have mastocytosis given that you have had all these food allergies for a long time.  I think MCAS sounds much more likely based on what you are saying.  IBS, Crohn's and UC all involve mast cell misbehavior - it is just that most doctors are not that knowledgeable when it comes to mast cells.  \n\n\"Mastocytosis most commonly abruptly presents in middle or older age. Whereas in MCAS, patients can commonly trace symptoms reflective of mast cell activation back to at least adolescence, not uncommonly even back to childhood and occasionally even infancy.\" (\n\nMast cell diseases typically progress over time, but if you are able to identify triggers and find safe medicines, you can control your symptoms.  I would say my symptoms used to be 7/10 all the time, and now that I know what my triggers are and take tons of antihistamines, it is usually a 3/10 for me.  I used to only have about 5 safe foods, and now I can eat almost anything as long as I do not eat \"bad\" things too often.\n\nStress is a HUGE factor is worsening mast cell disease.  Your mast cells literally *are* your emotions.  When you feel emotions in your body, it is because mast cells did a thing.  (Oversimplification obviously, but you know what I mean - often stress *directly* and *significantly* worsens mast cell disease)  \n\nIt is not entirely certain whether or not MCAS is genetic.  There is an almost identical disorder, HATS, that absolutely is genetic, but there is also not a lot of awareness surrounding it, so the people with HATS often get a MCAS diagnosis.  My personal opinion is that mast cell activation syndrome (but not mastocytosis) is an evolutionary adaptation that enables us to survive in stressful situations.  It is a state that any body can enter into.  To my knowledge, there are NOT any known genes associated with MCAS, and another thing to keep in mind is that you can have the genes for something but not have those genes \"activated.\"  Histamine actually can turn genes on or off, and histamine is absolutely a stress hormone, so that is why, I believe, MCAS symptoms can start during a period of intense stress.  \n\nThe good news is that this also means that histamine can turn *off* genes for stuff like this.  I think when you see miraculous healings, it has a lot to do with mast cells.\n\nWhile the literature *says* that MCAS is often found with EDS and POTS (and while it is true that those definitely crop up together often), there is still so little awareness about MCAS that I think the association with EDS and POTS just comes from the fact that so few people know about mast cell disease.  It is like how they used to say that autism was more common in boys, but it was only because they only knew how to recognize it in boys.  Lawrence Afrin, one of the few mast cell experts, believes MCAS is \"likely quite prevalent,\" but these symptoms are often being read as something else.  I think undiagnosed MCAS is the most common cause of mental illness (outside of obvious trauma, of course).  And there are tons of people who have multiple different allergy-related diagnose, when all of those things fall under the umbrella of mast cell disease.\n\nI have been studying mast cell disease for 15 years and I had never even heard of mastocytic entrocolitis before, so I do not think that is very likely either, just given how rare it is, and since all of your symptoms do fall in line with MCAS.\n\nre this bit: \"for example I can eat one food and might get a reaction and then eat the exact same thing another time and not get it or have a less/more severe reaction,\" what is likely going on there is that you are only mildly allergic to an enormous number of things, and so every time you are exposed to something that you have even a mild reaction to, your \"histamine bucket\" so to speak begins to fill up.  If you have only been exposed to 3 bad things today and you eat something that you probably should not, you will have a less severe reaction than if you have been exposed to 10 bad things today.  This is one of the most confusing aspects of MCAS - you can have different severities of reaction to the same thing for what can seem like no reason at all.\n\nMost of us are taking way more than 10mg of antihistamines.  For example, I take 2-3 doses of zyrtec, 2-3 of claritin, 2-4 of benadryl, 2-3 of vistaril, and 4-5 of cimedtidine per day.  On top of that, I also take about 6 different mast cell stabilizers.  It is important to take mast cell stabilizers in addition to antihistamines because histamine is only *one* of the 220+ mediators that mast cells release.  There is no such thing as an \"antitryptase\" or \"antiprostaglandin\" (to my knowledge), so that is why you need mast cell stabilizers.\n\nThere have been a few recent posts in here asking about OTC mast cell stabilizers if you want to check it out.\n\nAlso, most people, when trying to identify triggers, keep very, very detailed charts of the things they are exposed to in a day.  This information is invaluable.\n\nMore than anything, I want you to have hope.  You can get your quality of life back.  It just takes some time and effort. Also just for some more context, because this is something people usually have a hard time understanding...\n\nGoing back to different levels of severity of reactions and just general confusion about what your triggers are, it is important to understand that *everyone is* mast cells are degranulating multiple times throughout the day in response to a great number of things.  They are called the \"unicellular gland\" because they play such an important role in your body.  So you have discussed food triggers, but there are all KINDS of environmental triggers as well.  Usually with MCAS, the problem is not that the mast cells degranulate in response to more things than in people without MCAS; it is that they have a *bigger* reaction to all these things than in someone without MCAS.  \n\nMast cells are like Pokemon Go stops; you spin them, they drop goodies, and there is supposed to be a cooldown period before you can spin them again for more goodies, right?  With MCAS, it is like that cooldown is shortened, or like when you spin for the seventh day in a row and it gives you way more goodies.  \n\nAnother metaphor I like to use is this: Imagine this guy breaks into your house and he just starts making you pizzas, over and over again, just one pizza after another.  Pizza is good, right?  We like pizza.  We want pizza in the abstract.  But we do not want pizza after pizza forever!  And just taking antihistamines is like getting the guy to make the same number of pizzas, except he leaves the tomato sauce off.  I do not want a tomato sauceless pizza; I just want a normal amount of pizzas instead of pizza after pizza forever.  Mast cell stabilizers make the guy stop making pizzas.", "New, MCAS/MCAD \"normal labs\" Hey all. I am sure you all get a lot of these posts, but I have not found any yet.   \n\n\nI am 37, dx'd with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (hypermobile) two years ago. No other EDS tests were done because I lined right up with hypermobile. I am seeing more and more of the \"normal\" things being pointed out as comorbidities, including possible POTS and MCAS/MCAD. My new doc, a young rheumatologist, has made me his passion project (which is awesome) and is, in my 37 years, the first doctor to look at my constantly elevated, up and down white count and say, \"Hmm. That is not normal.\"  \n\n\nHe is sending me to a private practice oncologist/hematologist. I get a lot of symptoms like rashes (no reason/rhyme), burning in the sun after 10 minutes (no joke, walking to the car the other day after labs), hives (no known cause), allergies to most antibiotics and that elevated white count. I also have to be on a constant influx of Vitamin D due to a severe deficiency (which I have heard is prominent with EDS).   \n\n\nThe problem we are having now is that the pain and symptoms for MCAS are present, but the bloodwork (big shock here) is \"normal\" excepting that white count, which has been elevated consistently since 2007 (started 6 months before my mother unexpectedly died). I know so many of us are familiar with the \"your labs are normal, you are fine\" talk. This is not any different except that this doc seems to be genuinely perplexed and taking notice of the issue.   \n\n\nHe has tested me for so many things at this point and is not sure how to proceed outside of sending me to that private practice. So, my question is this:  \n\n\nIs it normal to have \"normal\" labs excluding a permanently elevated white count and still have MCAS/MCAD or would other things show up?  \n\n\nAny help would be appreciated. I am honestly quite scared. Lots of EDS/POTS patients start low level MCAS treatment options like zrytec or Pepcid to see if their symptoms get better. Testing for MCAS is so finicky. \n\nSee if you can get a POTS test too. I have been on fluticasone, montelukast and zyrtec (that one as needed) for years. None of my blood tests show allergies and even the medication reactions do not show up in blood tests. They are talking about a possible bone marrow biopsy. The POTS testing is seemingly elusive. Been trying to get that one for years but they keep putting it off (not sure why?) Your rheum can just do an orthostatic challenge or poor man tilt in their office. It is just a blood pressure cuff needed. Also diagnosed with hEDS, just a couple years younger than you now. Yes, I have had weird white blood cell counts too for years. My Tryptase was 11.3 and the standard range is less than or equal to 10.3. She used that to diagnose me, apparently that elevated but not \u201comg\u201d elevated tryptase level is used to indicate MCAS. \n\nOther things that indicated MCAS were the hEDS diagnosis and the fact that treatment helped, albeit marginally. Honestly your symptoms sound mild enough to have a hard time to be detected on tests. You might have to wait until the disease advances to get a diagnosis. I was stuck in that limbo for a few years and thankfully had a doctor willing to treat on symptoms.  I dont say this to invalidate what you are experiencing, testing is just difficult. The urine tests typically do not get refrigerated as soon as they need. One dr told me if it was left out on the counter for one minute you should just throw it away. Stability in transport then becomes the issue. I never showed up on the urine tests but did on a lot of the blood tests. If you have only done urine tests definitely get blood tests. I only had the urine one when I tested negative early in my diagnosis. I wish I knew that back then. 1st question: what tests did they actually run? Did you do 24-hour urine tests? The mastocytosis society provides a list of the important tests. \n\nAlso from that page: TMS does recognize, however, that capturing a mediator rise is not always easy, and depends on many factors, internal and environmental. We have seen 24-hour urine samples test negative simply because the lab technician did not refrigerate the sample in a timely manner (when the test was repeated and handled properly, the result was positive). Therefore, we support the use of a clinical diagnosis and advise that the patient continues to be treated when the following criteria have been met:\n\n- An exhaustive work-up has ruled out other medical conditions with similar symptoms and presentations\n- The patient has exhibited consistent symptoms of mast cell activation in 2 or more organ systems during the same period of time, such as skin, gastrointestinal tract, central nervous system, etc.\n- The patient responds to antimediator therapy\n- The patient is monitored on a regular basis, with testing for mediator rises performed periodically, by a mast cell or other specialist and/or in conjunction with an established local allergist or other physician\n- The patient is evaluated for other disease processes on an ongoing basis in order to be inclusive of any new changes in the patient\u2019s condition I have normal labs. My symptom history and reaction to a mast cell stabilizer got me my diagnosis. I am scared to think of where I would be if it was not for my dysautonomia neurologist who diagnosed me. See, that is the weird thing. I do not have abnormal tryptase levels. Literally everything but my white count was normal. I checked my other symptoms with it and the results are not good any way it is split. Throw in the random histamine reactions (to we do not know what) and I do not know what else to call it. The initials were a full CBC and complete metabolic panel with two urines. The urines were done within a day and came back normal. The bloodwork was done in two days and came back with a white count of 12.8 H and a neutrophil count of 10074 H. That does not really go into detail regarding why I would be having the reactions to random things. We have juuuust now got me scheduled with a hematologist. So, there is other things to consider from the list you provided. \n\nWe have got the hEDS diagnosis for sure, the list of several allergies to very well-known/used medications (mostly antibiotics), a high white count (since 2007, as stated) and have a history of gastro issues.\n\nNo one has elevated it because no one has thought to for whatever reason. They suspect POTS, but the wait for testing is insane so no guarantee there. I am also waiting to hear back from an allergist to set up that appointment and have heard nothing yet. By day's end, I have to call my rheum. back to let them know if I have not heard. Diagnosing MCAS is hard, it is really circumstantial and it does not seem like there is really a professional consensus about it among doctors. Some doctors do not even look at tryptase. My GP knew about my tryptase and white blood counts, but did not really catch all the moving parts like the doctor who diagnosed me. I am glad she accepts the diagnosis, because some doctors do not believe in it. Frustrating, huh? This might be a good topic for r/ehlersdanlos because we are kind of used to sorting through four-dimensional conditions. What urine tests were done? Sorry for the delay in response. It is been a ride lately.\n\nSo, a complete urinalysis was done along with a check for protein total w/creat and randome urine. Everything came back normal. That does not sound like it included a 24-hour urine test for methylhistamine or prostaglandins. Did it? No. I think (not sure) that I mentioned in my initial post that these tests were ordered by my rheumatologist. I have got an appointment with an allergist later this month and I have already had an appointment with a hematologist. We needed to run the initial basic tests to repeat verify the white count. So, normal regular labs are quite normal for mast cell patients. Typically the only abnormal results are the ones I listed above plus tryptase (baseline and reaction) to measure the difference. \n\nEven then, it can be hard to capture the values necessary for diagnosis due to potential lab error (not keeping the specimen cold the whole time).", "Has anyone tried neural retraining? There are a lot of testimonials for these neural retraining programs (Gupta Program, DNRS, ANS Rewire).

Anyone have experience? \n\nIf the Cell Danger Response theory by Naviaux is accurate, it is not totally ridiculous that something like this could be a good treatment\n\n\nI just hate the idea that this condition is totally incurable and I refuse to believe that. I do not think I can accept living this way forever I asked my doctor about it and she said that other patients have had great success with it. It is a large commitment I have not made the time for.

I am just saying that technically speaking it is not necessarily permanent. Plenty of people experience remission Regression in medicine is a characteristic of diseases to decrease in severity and/or size. Clinically, regression generally refers to lighter symptoms without completely disappearing. At a later point, symptoms may return. These symptoms are then called recidive\n\nYou may do anything harmless or nothing at all and you will get regression. All malpractice built on this ) if you have recidive - you are guilty, if you have regression - x worked. That is why we have long term double blind experiments. My wife does DNRS.\n\nIt is been about a year and a half and to be upfront, it It has not helped in the way that we hoped. She is still getting worse. *With that said* we are very thankful for it and we may not have made it this far without it. I think that it *does* work for many (maybe even most) who try it, but for whatever reason (possibly her limitations as far as incremental training goes?) it did not work for us. My wife still does it though and it still helps her in many ways, such as lessening triggers and even sometimes making a trigger stop. I think it would be more effective if she were in a little better of a place health-wise than she was when starting it. I am sorry to hear about your wife. That is tough. Not to sound like a shill, but if you can afford it, maybe consider doing a remote coaching session.

Title; I just get these waves of feeling like being conscious is too much effort. Due to medication or separate symptoms? I have had something like this before my diagnosis but now it feels like it is all the time. Yes! I want to do so much but I just cannot. It definitely gets better when all my diseases are treated properly. I was sick last spring and since then, my fatigue has been much worse. Sometimes it feels like in a video game when your character is running out of juice and things start to go gray around the edges. Yeah.

So I think it is probably dangerous to take in high doses for those with anaphylaxis etc.\n\nSome breakfast cereals are fortified with lower doses of Thiamine. That is probably the easiest way to see if it can help for you (I found out by trying Weetabix). Unfortunately, they are usually also those with gluten.

So I do have minor anaphylaxic response to Thiamine. Anaphylaxis occurs if at least three bodily systems are involved. I have frequent anaphylaxis so I might need to avoid that. I really do appreciate the insight and suggestion, though. I sometimes think my \u201ccure\u201d exacerbates my fatigue since I am on so many medications that have drowsiness as an AE/SE Yes. That Is the worst. I try to change those out if it is too bad, but it is tough when fatigue is the only side effect and it works great otherwise. With one med, that can be doable. But with many meds with that side effect, it can feel overwhelming. Sleepiness is the worst symptom for me, and it takes a lot of trial and error to find out what works. It can and will get better if you keep searching and experimenting but it takes a very long time. Everyone is different so there are no easy answers. For example, I accidentally forgot to take my H2 blocker for a few days and experienced heavy sleepiness.  I was surprised it made such a big impact so now I am increasing my dose for a while to see if that helps.", "Cleaning/removing trigger smells Hi all,\n\nFor months I have been swearing I have been having a low-level MCAS/HIT reaction in my room at night.  \nI have been having the constant loop in my head of doubting my own symptoms, thinking it must be something else in my routine with delayed symptoms, and other times being sure there is something in my room that is a trigger and having major anxiety of having no idea what it is, short of starting to remove literally everything one at a time.\n\nWell, I got sick of it, broke down, and did it, and I found out its my tea-trolley that I keep my supplements in.  \nSOMETHING in there gives off particles that trigger me just enough to make me feel spaced out/crossed eyed/staring into space - but not enough to register as a full blown flare up.\n\nI have removed all the supplements. 90% of them are sealed, and they are ones I take regularly - so go figure - but in any event. Took the entire trolley outside, removed all the supplements, and have been trying to get rid of the smell that is impregnated into the trolley.\n\nI have tried washing it down with vinegar, then letting it sit with baking soda inside, then washing it down again with vinegar and baking soda together.\n\nI am not convinced this has worked.  \nDoes anyone have any suggestions from experience of removing trigger smell that has impregnated into something?\n\nCheers\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\n\n I have found Epsom salt to be more effective than baking soda, although I used to swear by baking soda \ud83e\udd37. I use it the same way; lay it down loose in a thick layer. Sweep or vacuum up after 24 hours. Hope it helps.\n\nHow long did you leave the baking soda? It takes time to work on smells. Also, if that is the amount you let sit I would say it is not enough.\n\nEdited to add- never doubt yourself. It can be hard to remember sometimes, but if something is niggling at you it is always real. I must have done this same exact cycle you just did a hundred times in the last three years. I would try to keep it out of your room for a few weeks to see how you feel. If you noticeably improve, just give it away. \n\nIf you do not improve and this is just a general nighttime peak of histamine dumping then you will know either way. No I usually just give up honestly. When I went to buy a used leather couch I sniffed every one and moved on if it caused a reaction. In my experience there is nothing to be done if it is causing symptoms besides shutting it away in a different room or covering it up with thick plastic Thanks! Hi, \n\nAlready said in my original post that I found out it is the cabinet.  \nI improved the day I took it out. And have remained so two weeks it is been out of my room. Ah okay the timeline was not clear. \n\nI would keep it out of your bedroom and frankly out of your home. It is just not worth it. If it is not clean now and did not off gas after months inside, I think just find it a new home. Well I think it was one of the supplements that was inside it.\nI have removed them all and they are in a chilli bin, and I will have to work through them one by one to figure out what the culprit is.\nBut that is why it was persistent in my room - the supplements were still inside.\n\nBut yeah I fear you are right. Even if it is clean, I will always wonder if it is causing a reaction. You are going to have to leave it outside for a while, with the drawers and doors open.  Sun helps.\n\nYou can buy stuff to absorb odors, but be wary of what else is in it, like scents.\n\n\nYou can make your own odor remover from aquarium charcoal.", "When do symptoms appear? Is it true that mcas symptoms do not appear until someone is in their 30s? Mine started when I was a kid. It was really mild and tolerable up until I moved to a place where my environmental allergies pushed me over the edge. It just happened to line up with turning 30. But Ive gotten sumptoms my whole life practically. I had symptoms off and on all my life but they came together as a consolidated shit show in my 30s. No Mine started when I was a kid too. rashes can start in infancy This This Man, most of my life I have had some weird issues. whether it was depression, malaise and tiredness in school, just random itchiness sometimes, one year or one summer or something just started getting these freaking red spots that would show up all over me out of the blue. I was a mess most of my life in one way or another, and then in my early twenties I think is when the digestive issues started, and the sleep issue started in my mid-twenties as well oh, maybe even in the late twenties where it started to get really bad.\n\nAnd then every springtime I would freak out and no one knew why including myself. My sleep would fall apart I get massive insomnia, just craziness every spring time like clockwork as soon as winter thawed.\n\nI busted my ass in my 30s with all sorts of self-help and trying to heal my inner self with all this positive thinking, yadda yadda yadda. and I put up a good fight, and managed to live a pretty decent life despite the fact that I had sleep issues half of the week and massive fatigue a lot of the time.\n\nThen in my early forties, I started growing scabs on my scalp. And then not too long after that I had a major crash but that was with help with the medical community who kept misdiagnosing me, trying to tell me it was all in my head, giving me terrible medication that sent me off the deep end, including a CPAP machine which yes, I do have sleep apnea, however, the machine was always filthy no matter how much you clean and it just exacerbated my symptoms so that I would basically be walking around in a constant state of manic episodes. I am pretty sure the PAP machine was setting off mast cell craziness daily and it certainly did not help with the fatigue.\n\nI still had brain fog EVEN WHEN I had amazing readings from the machine.\n\nWhat a trip through hell that was. I am surprised I am still here. Wow I am so sorry you have been through all of that. I hope you are healing now that you know what you have.\n\nAll of my issues started after protracted antidepressant withdrawal it is seriously been hell for 4 years. well if you are in the hell part, know that at some point and I cannot say when it will get a little better, not amazing, maybe amazing let us hope so. But you know I am just saying keep going keep on living. eventually some people pull out of this completely with the right medication others learn to manage reasonably 24", "Idk if my neuropathy,chemical sensitivities and dysautonomia symptoms are from b6 toxicity or from some form of mast cell All my symptoms started the day after I had contrast dye and have only progressed over time,eye face and all over skin burning whenever I eat,am around chemicals or scents of any kind cannot even go for a car ride as the exhaust fumes make my face tingle and burn. I had elavated levels around the same time as the scan,would you guys think it was b6 and the dye triggered it all? Mast cell and dye is bad combination. It is toxic. It may have triggered something. Yes that is what I have read :( It was probably the contrast dye. :( Have you tried zyrtec and pepcid ac to see if it helps your symptoms? Benadryl? Do you have ehlers danlos syndrome? People with EDS are prone to getting mcas,dysautonomia (pots) and hashimotos. I have EDS and I developed all of these after exposure to burn pits in Iraq. I would look into EDS as well. People can have mild to severe forms of it and can go undiagnosed very easily. I do not believe I have eds,I do take one Claritin and pepsid every day,do you have neuropathy as well? Yes, I have neuropathy but I believe it is from my b12/folate deficiency. Have you tried zyrtec? My immunologist prefers zrytec over Claritin for treating mcas. Most mcas patients take h1/h2 blockers twice a day. I was instructed to take zyrtec and max strength pepcid twice a day.\n\n\nHave you ever done 23 and me or ancestry dna? If so, you can download your raw dna data and go to a site like livewello.com and purchase their genetic variance report service for $19.95. Using that you can check to see if you have certain genes, like ehlers danlos, mcas,chemical sensitivity, mthfr,many things like that. It might help you figure out what is going on. Well I sent in my samples for mthfr as a friend who practices functional medicine says I probably have on of those weird genes that is effecting me. I guess I could try the zertec,is your neuropathy worse around certain things? Or just random? My neuropathy started over the summer and it was random. I found out in October that I had low B12 and low folate. B12 has been helping so that is why I believe it is from the deficiency, although several of my other conditions can cause neuropathy  as well. If the contrast dye triggered mcas, you most likely have other issues. People with mast cell disease usually have several comorbidities.", "Face wash and body wash besides neutrogena bar soap MCAS safe I have been using Neutrogena bar soap for my face wash, body wash and shampoo for 2 years. It is getting harder to find and wanted to know some suggestions so I am aiming closer to products that are safer MCAS washes. I know reactions vary but am trying to have more than one option and suggestions are welcome if you feel like sharing what works for you. Thanks! I have had great success with all of Vanicream's products. No fragrance and they try to be minimalist with respect to ingredients Thank you! Cerave face wash and moisturizing cream on my body have been going well for me lately. I also have success with acure facial lotions for the most part if they do not have spf in them. I am using Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser and Dove sensitive skin foaming body wash. My daughter can only use Kiss My Face olive oil bar soap and it is hard to find, but lately I have been able to order it on Amazon. We grate it and dissolve it in distilled water so she can use it for shampoo too. I do well with Simple Micellar gel face wash. For body, I use Dove sensitive skin bar soap. I use the simple micellar water and love it! I have never tried the gel! I will be looking it up for sure! Thank you! I appreciate it, I am saving all of these to try/switch up when I start reacting to my safe product cuz you know...mast cell stuff. My biggest knock on their face wash is it is too drying. Good for summer tho. I like cetaphil but I had to stop using the facial cleanser, irritating to the eyes. Switched back to the gentle skin cleanser.\n\nI always liked kiss my face. I cannot use the Cetaphil facial cleanser either. You can try cetaphil bar cleanser. Or lowila. \n\nI used to be a big fan of Clinique. \n\nIt is very hard to find truly neutral stuff. Especially natural stuff usually has lots and lots of ingredients. I used it for years and now it bothers me. What is left is being repurposed as hand wash. I am very simple, but I use liquid black soap for hair, fade, and body and find it works very well for me. I like the Alaffia brand, but there are several others. That is so much smarter than my rubbing the bar of soap on my head. I have been eyeing up the Dove baby wash but am nervous lol. It is obnoxiously both terrifying and funny. I will give them a try! Thanks got the good info, I appreciate it! I use Dr Bronners I like QV liquid soap I hear ya! I have had some luck the ordinary but I have only gotten 2 things cuz I do not want to press my luck. I will give the bar a try, dong think I knew they had a bar! Not familiar with Iowila so I will have something new to look forward to! Thanks for your help! I do not know why my mind wants liquid soap for my hair even though I know that the bar is still cleaning my hair. I have used black soap before but I have tried that brand! Thanks for the info and black soap just looks cool too lol. Got To enjoy the small stuff. I understand. I also use the liquid. They make bar soap as well, but I also do not enjoy the texture. I can use the bar soap on my face and body, but I get the liquid one so I can use it for everything. Check out the brand--they have several types bottled black soap, and though they have essential oils, it is mild enough not to bother me, even on my face. Do you use the bar or liquid? I have used the bar and have reacted to it. The liquid is on my list to try so if I remember and try it I will give you some feedback! Thanks for the info! I will put it that on my list! I feel so lucky getting so many suggestions! It is great cuz I am starting to react to the Neutrogena and want to switch so I still have Neutrogena as a backup if possible(probably wishful thinking). :) Good to know! Phisoderm works for me for soap better than dove. Both unscented of course For face, I am able to use Neutrogena fragrance free facial wipes. These are available at almost any pharmacy, plus Target and grocery stores in the US. For body, I use Dr. Bronner\u2019s Castile Bar Soap (Baby Unscented). I can also use the Dr. Bronner\u2019s on my face but it is a bit more soap-y than I prefer for that purpose. Dr. Bronner\u2019s is available at most natural food stores and many pharmacies as well. I use the liquid My MCAS escalated dramatically this past year due to the lockdown affecting my healthcare access and I lost all but one of my \u2018safe\u2019 personal hygiene items. But it did result in me discovering a bunch of new safe products...much to the dismay of my bank account haha. I looooove cerave face wash and face/body creams (caveat being I reacted to the face cream w sunscreen in it), dr bronzers liquid baby castille soap, nature clean pure-sensitive line products, and attitude sensitive skin product line (personal hygiene, household cleaners &amp; laundry). Still have not had any luck with sunscreen, toothpaste or makeup but I will take my wins where I can lol \ud83d\ude05 Same. I cannot use their specialty facial moisturizer (small tube) because it has a bunch of crazy stuff in it, but all their regular stuff so far is fine. Thank you!!! I have been using Desert Essence's Thoroughly Clean Face Wash for oily skin for about 1.5 yrs. It is been great so far! It is Vegan, Gluten free, and advertises no parabens, artificial fragrances, or other icky chemicals/preservatives. The tea tree oil has helped with acne flare-ups, too! It is liquid, but the pump delivers a perfect amount of soap IMO. Hope you find something you like! I am late to this but Dr Bronners is Castile soap I think, I just buy plain Castile soap liquid from Amazon, water it down and put it in a foaming soap dispenser. There is nothing added and fragrance free so nothing to react to. My husband happily uses it as well. We have both actually been able to stop using deodorant as well as this seems to be much gentler on the skin all round. I have a special talent of reacting to things lol I react to old scars. Thank you for the recommendation! Not using deodorant would be awesome! I have one deodorant that works and is safe so I am sure you get it I just use water. Always have for 60 years. Great skim. There is a whole line of products that begin with an n. On amazon. Dr recommend however I do not use any kind of products\n Supposed to help with itching. I have a jar of pfizoderm from the '70s when it was a prescription. You cannot even buy that in the United States anymore where do you live that you can purchase it Huh. Apparently it used to contain a chemical that was banned. It does not anymore so it is been reinstated. Dial soap used to have the same chemical hexachoorophene and was also reinstated. And phisohex was sold as prescription with the chemical over the legal limit slightly. Yea my body like to react to water too lol it is annoying. Thanks for the response. I am one step away from water at this point. This is why we cannot have nice things lol", "Tryptase level very high My Mom got her tryptase levels tested and the results came in today - it seems that her level of tryptase is 18 times higher than it should be (179 ug/l to be exact) meanwhile the norm is 0-11,40. Is it even possible? and if it is, what should we do next? Please give us some advice, thanks a lot Bone marrow biopsy next to check for Systemic Mastocytosis. Thank you, is this situation something we should be deeply afraid of? While the bone marrow biopsy sucks, it is just there to check if the mast cells are capable of mutating. Usually they do not and it is just to double check. I have consistently high typtase numbers and my mast cells do not mutate - have not had to have a second biopsy done yet and most likely will not have to. It is high enough that if that is a baseline, Smoldering Mastocytosis is not off the table.  (Where it might someday turn into Aggressive Mastocytosis) but Smoldering Mastocytosis is more often called when tryptase is above 200.  If that was taken during or right after a bad reaction it could elevate tryptase some, and actual baseline might be lower.   \n\nIt is not high enough to think it is Aggressive Mastocytosis or Mast Cell Leukemia based simply off a single tryptase test result.   But she is most *definitely* going to need a hematologist on this.  Preferably one with Mastocytosis experience.  Results that high are in the \"monitor closely, but do not freak out and \"borrow trouble\" range.   But high enough to get in to a hematologist sooner rather than later.   It is definitely a make an appointment today kind of result.  It is not a \"be deeply afraid\" yet result.  Not without biopsy results and blood work beyond just tryptase.  \n\nEdit to add:. Most likely it is still just indolent systemic Mastocytosis.  Which is not one of the scarier forms of Mastocytosis. Thank you very much, we really appreciate it", "Psychosomatic aspect of MCAS / food intolerances Besides from the fact that stress influences gut permeability and inflammatory response and that pain and inflammation make you psychologically \u201euncomfortable\u201c - what do you think about the psychosomatic aspects regarding MCAS (especially food intolerances)?\n\nI have got a lot of issues with my health and depression since I am around 5, but from some people I keep on hearing it is psychosomatic, so I would be interested in your thoughts and experiences. I think there is definitely a psychosomatic component to MCAS. But we also have to remember that, just because something is psychosomatic, does not mean it is not real.\n\nExample : during my childhood and teenage years, I had a recurring problem. Whenever I did not say \"no\" to something I wished to refuse (going to a friend's house, etc.), a few hours later I always had a very strong, very uncomfortable pain in my left leg. It was so strange I could not walk.\n\nThe pain was very much real. The cause absolutely was psychosomatic.\n\nAlso, I became allergic to seafoods after learning they were boiled alive (mussels, lobsters ...). I was 7. One week later, I had a strong reaction to 1 drop of crab juice landing of my skin (my mom is a messy eater). Before that, I loved mussels. Now the smell makes me queasy. I get depression, random sadness crying spells, anxiety, depersonalization/derealization, intrusive thoughts. Just a mix of different things Oh, one more. My highschool best friend introduced me to Andalouse Sauce. Everytime I ate some, I thought of her. Then, she \"betrayed me\" (highschool drama) and I never spoke to her again. For the next 5 years, I was allergic to Andalouse Sauce. Absolutely!\n\nThis makes sense, if you cannot walk there you do not have to be there/do that. How smart our bodies are. The brain and the mind have direct and indirect impacts on most elements of health.\n\nIf you sprain your ankle, your mindset about it is going to determine both how well you nurse it as well as how much subjective suffering it causes you, and those will impact the actual and perceived severity of the injury, respectively. An immune system disorder is going to have a similar mechanic at play.\n\nBut as to whether the disease is entirely the product of the mind? No. That is idiotic and ignores the clear and obvious patterns of physical symptoms, genetics, clustering with structural disorders (e.g. with EDS) and clear responsiveness to very specific classes of medication.\n\nIt is easy to dismiss what we do not understand and cannot see. We all do it sometime or other, and you happen to be talking to people who are poorly informed on the subject so they are doing it to you. Sorry that you are going through that. I am so glad you posted this! 100% emphatically yes. I started a new supplement, it was derived from pineapple, but I thought I would give it a try anyways. 3 days in I became a different person. Suicidal, aggressive, severely depressed, almost admitted myself to a mental hospital. Stoped the supplements, back to normal in two days. In that moment I realized MCAS is most likely the reason I have had intermittent issues my whole life with my mental state. I do not believe MCAS is psychosomatic, but I think it can be triggered by extreme stress. &gt; Allergic reactions to food are overwhelmingly common in this population. Furthermore, food reactions due to mast cell activation exhibit atypical features that complicate diagnosis and management. It is not unusual for mast cell patients to react to foods or medications they typically tolerate when mast cell activation is increased. Regaining tolerance for these substances can be complicated and time consuming. Regaining tolerance is not always possible.\n\n&gt;Mast cell food reactions are influenced by the level of histamine circulating in the body at the time of consumption. Histamine levels fluctuate throughout the day in everyone as mast cell activation is necessary to perform many appropriate actions such as digestion and regulation of sleep. Other healthy activities, such as exercise or use of certain medications, also raise the level of circulating histamine. For these reasons, the severity of mast cell food reactions can fluctuate throughout the day.\n\n&gt;Histamine level is also impacted by acute health state. For example, due to the importance of mast cell activation in immune defense, patients may find that their mast cell food reactions are more severe while fighting an infection, recovering from surgery, or healing a wound.\n\n\n\nYou could look into TMS. ", "Should we get flu shots? I am waiting on diagnosis with a slew of symptoms and a PCP that does not know much about MCAD (pending appointment with an immunologist). I just came off a rough anaphylactoid period after reacting to high histamine food and have had previous anaphylaxis from exposure to cold water. \n\nI am sure I am not the only one worried about a massive inflammatory response to Covid, and I have been working hard to avoid exposure - my doctor recommended getting a flu shot but I am kind of worried about having a reaction to it. Do you think this is unlikely? Are you getting one? Short answer: It depends.\nLong answer: have you bad one before and reacted to it? Or have you gotten the flu right after having a flu shot in the past? If yes, then it is best to avoid. If you have never reacted before, and dont have any reactions to needles (dermatographism, etc), then you are probably fine to at least try it. If you are going to get one, make sure you get the egg-free flu shot, as this is will reduce the histamine level for the shot itself (if you didnt know, most flu shots in the US are incubated in chicken eggs). Another thing to consider is your medication. Are you on any immunosuppressants such as Tacrolimus? If so, then most definitely do NOT get the flu shot (as it is a live vaccine, and you will not be able to fight off the virus) and avoid being close to anyone who has gotten the flu shot within the last few days. Thanks. I have never had a flu shot in my life so I do not know. It is been a long time since I have had a vaccine of any kind and my MCAD symptoms developed over the last 3 years. Not on any immunosuppressants, just histamine blockers. I am not by any means a doctor, but it would (probably) be fine if you got one! If you want, you could take a benadryl before the shot to \"pregame\" for any reactions, and bring an epi pen with you to the appointment. I have indolent systemic mastocytosis and have gotten a flu shot every year. I am followed by an allergist for my mastocytosis, so if you have one of those it would not hurt to reach out to check. \n\nThere are advice nurses on  that are a great resource to email your questions to! No I have had a flu shot yearly for the last 4 years and never had a reaction. A little tenderness at the site for maybe a day but that is not unusual. \n\n\nI think some flu shots have egg proteins so if you are sensitive to eggs I would do a bit of research! YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES  \n\n1. It is perfectly safe for 99.99% of people to get the flu shot. The exceptions are rare, much much more rare than even masto. (Which is not a reason  to not get one.)\n\n2. If you think the flu shot it bad, wait til you get the flu. \n\n3. If you thought the flu was not that bad. Wait til you get the flu AND COVID. \n\n4. Ask YOUR doctor about what flu shot is right for you THIS year. If your doctor THIS YEAR ((not like 10 years ago may have mentioned it, like ask them THIS YEAR).\n\n5. If you actually fall into the rarest of exemptions- you need to make sure every single human you live with, sit near, breathe near, gets one. Like make it your personal project to do so. \n\n6. \u201cMast cell patients are recommended to receive all vaccines per CDC (or relevant governmental body) guidelines. Premedicating with antihistamines is practiced by many mast cell patients prior to receiving vaccines. (Please note that steroids can interfere with vaccine action, and as such should be avoided if possible.) Simply having mast cell disease is not a contraindication to vaccination.\u201d \n\n( \n\nThe answer is yes. You can go get it RIGHT NOW. Agree. My mast cell doctor gave me a letter that I should not get any vaccines because of the *so-called* inactive ingredients that can trigger anaphylactic reactions. Uh, thanks. I am not anti-vaccine at all whatsoever. Just new at MCAD and trying to get info. Appreciate the info but dude. Please do not take my tone to be directed at you, but rather the anti-vaccine posters below and to come.\n\nI already got downvoted. This is never not a thing. I show up defensive because I have to be. \n\nIf I just said \u201cyep, go get one\u201d people pile on. This is not my first rodeo. \n\nI hope you found the Lisa stuff helpful. I get them. Ask for a preservative free shot. \n\nThere is a theory that a flu shot may provide some cross immunity to COVID-19. \n\nYou definitely do not want to catch flu, and do not want to catch Covid at the same time either. \n\nI caught flu last year before I could get the shot and was extremely ill and took months to recover. I still went and got a shot in February when I felt up to it finally because there was more than one strain going around last winter. \n\nI plan to get the shot next week or the week after.\n\nI got a shingles shot a year ago \nAnd had a bad reaction for 4 days. They advised taking Benadryl or hydroxyzine to counteract the side effects. I thought only the nasal spray was live?\n Not entirely sure. It says on the paper you receive with your prescription of Tacrolimus to avoid getting the flu vaccine as it is a live vaccine. I just checked the cdc website and only the nasal spray is live. The recombinant does not even contain flu. \n\nI am too old for the live anyway. Also this is kind of dangerous. Not sure if I am understanding you correctly, but as someone who is severely allergic to eggs and has almost died from the flu shot (while being perfectly okay with the egg free one), I definitely DO NOT recommend getting just any flu vaccination if you are allergic to eggs. Not to mention, MCAS allergies are different than \"typical\" allergies, so you cannot take the advice for those with typical allergies as fact if you have MCAS. I mean I guess it is entirely possible for the manufacturer of Tacrolimus, my pharmacy, and my doctor to be incorrect.  That is the cdc's advice, not mine. That is why it is quoted. \n\nI would advise getting a shot at the doc's just in case and get one of the egg free shots they mention. I also get the preservative free shot. I have been getting them for over 10 years now without a problem. \n\nI got the last one at the pharmacy and the pharmacist pulled out the product insert for me to check that there were no preservatives in the shot. I have gotten very good at reading those over the decades, I can actually find what I am looking for faster that the medical people. Yes there are heavy metals in vaccines which can trigger MCAS in the first place, not sure why I got downvoted so much You are correct! I have an egg allergy and get Flubok which is an egg free vaccine that is oddly enough grown in the cell of a dog kidney (or at least it was last year when I asked how it was made) Oh weird! I guess I have heard of odder. There is companies working on pharmaceutical stuff based on or using stuff from llamas too! Hey! Just want to let you know not all flu vaccines are live attenuated. The nasal ones almost always are but not the shots themselves, if that is a concern you can ask for whichever you prefer they just may have you wait to order it because they usually only carry one type in stock. Also, in regards to medication, I have been cleared by my Drs to receive the flu shots while on prednisone, granted I was on lower doses. It really depends on dosage and duration when we consider immunosuppressants. A live attenuated vaccine while on immunosuppressants is likely not safe, though. Nonetheless, flu shots are really important protective agents and although I cannot tell you whether you should or should not I think you should make that choice with your healthcare provider who knows your history! Best of luck\n\nEdit: also, to answer your question yes I get one every year! I have an egg allergy and although the CDC says it is safe for those with egg allergies to get the normal one I always get the egg free one because my allergy is very severe, likely due to the MCAS I do not know, I mean personally if your system is really reactive right now, it might be better to wait at least a little bit until it calms down a bit and then get the flu shot if you want it. I mean, it might be safe for most Mast Cell patients, but your anaphylaxis to cold water is really rare and very worrisome.\n\nI would also ask, how much exposure do you have to other people? If you stay inside a lot, live alone and wear a mask, wash your hands and do not touch your face when outside then I do not think you need to worry that much. But if you say, live with little kids then they are basically contagious disease magnets.\n\nPersonally I have been thinking that the risk of getting vaccines would make a lot more sense for the covid vaccine, whenever it comes out. *I* work from home and am very careful, however my partner helps care for my MIL who has early dementia and we do not know how careful she is being, so I could potentially be exposed that way. Right now I am feeling very itchy and reactive so yeah I think I have to wait a minimum of two weeks. The last time I had a flu shot, I had a severe reaction. That was five years ago and I think I am going to try again this year, latex free, preservative free, all that good stuff. I have been on xolair for a year and my reactions have calmed down. I also know how to recognize and treat a reaction, which is more than I knew five years ago. No, vaccines have preservatives, adjutuvants, and other ingredients that can trigger mast cell deregulation among other consequences, for someone with MCAS. \n\nI would not get one, and they are only a shot in the dark at what flu strain will be active anyway, so it cannot do you that much good. Because vaccines are a religious issue, not a scientific issue for most people. They think questioning vaccines makes you \u201cone of the dumb people\u201d and having non-mainstream beliefs is TERRIFYING for them. Also, doctors these days are much less likely to admit a vaccine or any other medication can cause anaphylactic reactions. I long for the days before US pharmaceutical companies merged with US health insurance companies. Glad I was diagnosed before that. Do you have to go somewhere special to get a preservative free flu shot? I am allergic to preservatives as well! Most pharmacies have them. Just call and ask. And the CDC has a nice list of all the flu shots. I got Flucelvax yesterday. \n\nAnd there are egg free shots as well if eggs bother you.", "Anyone in Vienna, Austria or Germany? Hey! I thought that maybe some of you live in Austria/ Germany. \nI have a hard time finding a doctor who takes my symptoms seriously. They make me do tryptase test,s which always come back negative and then dismiss MCA. I have spent so much money on doctors and tests already that I had to take on an extra job\u2026\nSo, if anyone from Austria/ Germany wants to talk and share their experiences let me know :) Have you looked here: ", "Going to immunologist to discuss MCAS - any particular questions you think I should ask? I have got an appointment in 5 days to go back to immunology to discuss MCAS. I previously saw them when I suddenly developed allergic rhinitis and was diagnosed with dust mite allergies but only got relief after they added Montelukast to my regime. drs at the time acknowledged my extreme fatigue and symptoms did not align with my diagnosis but sent me on my way. After 6 months on Montelukast things cleared up entirely for 2 years (did not take a single tablet) but urticaria and rhinitis is back now. I have also picked up a diagnosis of POTS along the way which is what lead me to learn about MCAS and it fits 100x more than allergies.\n\nAnd advice about seeing the Dr? Any particular questions I should ask? I am feeling ok that I can hopefully focus on what I did last time and come out of this flare but I want to get it diagnosed so if/when it happens again I am not waiting 6 months again. I have started back on Montelukast, fexofenadine and have added 500mg Quercetin into my diet while I have been waiting for my appointment since this is what was previously prescribed. \n\nI am going to ask about getting blood tests done for mould allergies as it is clearly a trigger for me so it would be good to rule it in or out as an actual allergy. If they think you are a candidate for mast cell treatment, I would strongly consider asking about cromolyn sodium (a mast cell stabilizer), which is a godsend for many people. If you do find that quercetin is helpful, that may further bolster the case for cromolyn, since quercetin is also believed to be a mast cell stabilizer.\n\nWhether you bring it up with the immunologist at this appointment or not, consider an H2 antihistamine. Some are available OTC. They are traditionally used for acid reflux, but some (many?) MCAS patients find that they can help with overall symptoms (pain, psych, etc).\n\nGood luck! Definitely get a current allergy scratch  test. I was diagnosed with MCAS and got out of a flare once I avoided the foods that were positive in my allergy panel. I also had covid in March and I believe this is what may have caused the MCAS to be activated. Do they tend to repeat them? I had one previously that only showed up dust mites. They told me stop my antihistamines which I presume is in case of other skin prick tests so I am having lots of fun with sneezing and urticaria after 24hrs with nothing My immunologist said they can do them once a year. I had 3 done in a two year time span with 3 different docs. One said I was allergic to over 20 things.  The other said I was allergic to nothing and the last o\nMost recent said I was allergic to several things that I had been eating alot of. Once I started avoiding those foods my symptoms were less and flare went away. Our bodies change so often especially as we age so I would definitely get it done once a year That is really helpful, thanks! How did it go? Not great, she is did not dismiss it but basically said it is a diagnosis of exclusion and anyway the treatment would be the same as I am already on with the fexofenadine and montelukast. She is going to do an in depth review of all the testing I have had done lately and discuss it with the clinical group and come to a consensus. I am in the UK and the NHS for immunology is really set up as a symptom treatment speciality so I think I am pretty much going to be on my own with this. I need to do some searching to see if there are any specialists who might be able to help rather than my local hospital. Yes they have to exclude everything else. The two doctors that would be the best suited other than a specialist is an immunologist and a rheumatologist.  Finding out your triggers Which would be food or outside factors like pollens is the next best thing to do. You can also react to certain meds. My doc put me on low dose aspirin, Allegra twice a day, and pepcid twice a day, you need H1 &amp; H2 blockers and a mast cell stablizer which are included with all of these. What works for me may not work for you but im also eating clean meaning no processed foods, (im avoiding foods im allergic to which change all the time btw) Im only eating fresh foods I prepare then freeze. In case you were not aware many MCAS patients have high histamine levels and inflammation levels.if that is the case with you its important to find out and eat,non dairy (inflammation) low histamine, low inflammatory diet. Alot of healthy foods have high histamine like spinach, and are high inflammatory like tomatoes and sugar. Also foods that are left over or processed have high histamines so theory is that you dont want to add to your already high inflammation or histamine markers. Have you been tested for these? Also, I would reccomend my Facebook group, youll get alot of advice and support there. Its called mast cell activation disorders forum Yes I am hoping she at least offers to do some extra testing (immunology have not do not anything except IgE) and if nothing else I am presenting with allergic symptoms so it is reasonable for me to keep going back and look at different options, it is not a \"there is nothing wrong with you\" ending. \n\nThis was the immunologist but they are not a specialist in MCAS at this hospital as far as I know, and who knows if they are aware of POTS and the studies showing links so it may be something I end up going via the POTS specialist to find an expert.\n\n So many unknowns! I already eat low carb and make everything myself. I previously had what I think was a flare which settled down with lots of lifestyle changes and H1 blocker and montelukast so I am hoping it will work again. I am still trying to figure out if the UK still routinely prescribes H2 blockers, they were pulled from OTC because of cancer fears, she basically said what I am on now is what they would try but I will ask about ketotifen as a stabiliser as it does not seem expensive so hopefully it is something I can add on. I have started Quercetin a few months ago, 500mg a day but I think I will up that, I think it is having an effect, I suddenly started dreaming which I have never remembered my dreams and always slept badly.  \n\nThanks for the advice, really appreciate it!", "Over the Counter or Natural Remedies in Emergencies? I only learned about MCAS last year (after two decades of chronic illness an and endless number of doctor appointments and tests that could find nothing wrong with me), and am now awaiting an appointment with a specialist in the UK (there are none in my own country).  In the meantime however, is there anything easily obtainable that I could have on hand for emergencies when I have a really bad reaction?\n\nFor instance, before I knew to avoid histamine, I would sometimes end up curled up on the ground feeling like I was having a simultaneous asthma-attack, heart-attack, and stroke.  The people I was with called and ambulance during one of these times, but the paramedic thought I was having a panic attack and gave me morphine, sending me into anaphylactic shock. \n\nI take quercetin and vitamin D daily, and try to avoid histamines as much as I can, but I am not always successful in doing so, or even aware of what random things could cause me to react.  So, is there some sort of safe fast-acting remedy that I can take during instances that are so bad that I feel like I am dying? Benadryl How much can I take in those situations? 50 mg seems to be about as much as I would want to take at once. You will sleep. Would it worsen sleep apnea? Depends on if it is UARS or not. palmitoylethanolamide, reishi mushroom, fish oil, l-theanine, vitamin c (especially ( luteolin, resveratrol, and khella (the active ingredient in which was the basis for the development of cromolyn), and lots of terpenes.  Ocimene has helped me the most.  You can buy ocimete distillate and diffuse it, add it to essential oil blends, put it in your skincare products, etc.  THC is a powerful mast cell stabilizer too, which is why so many of us love our devil's lettuce.  Also, there are a few helpful alkaloids...caffeine is a mast cell stabilizer, nicotine can be helpful for some people but not for others, and then there is kratom, which is a source of *countless* alkaloids with mast cell stabilizing and anti-inflammatory properties (though of course kratom is not legal everywhere).  Also, heck, put some baking soda in a glass of water, that is an antihistamine.\n\nAlso, anything that helps improve vagal nerve tone and function will improve MCAS\n\nWhen the United States collapses and I am no longer able to get my prescription medications, I feel great knowing how many OTC options there are. I will check out you suggestions, thank you, though caffeine is a major no-go for me, the one cup of coffee I drank in my adult life put me in the emergency room.  Even coffee flavoured things make me feel like I am going to have a heart attack or stroke.  Black tea and chocolate also cause me to react (though not nearly as bad as coffee). I am also confused by the caffeine- stimulants tend to cause increased degranulation while anything that calms like Gaba stuff decreases reactions. From what I have read. Not OP, but thank you for the tips. One word of warning tho. Mushrooms can be very bad news for some of us, so be cautious with them. If your mast cell disease send you into anaphylaxis I cannot see how you will survive without antihistamines. Synthetic medications are not inherently bad, frankly neither is death but it poses strange questions when they are both a choice. \n\nIf you had a migraine and chest pain during the episode then I would bring up the need for a Kounis syndrome workup which accompanies mast cell disease. \n\nI have posted my regiment on the various sub just search my account. \n\nPrimatene mist or an epi inhaler is the most underutilized tool available. It is actually cannabidiol being the better stabilizer but because of the entourage effect 1-3% THC is enough to be continually efficacious. ( \n\n(\n\nTHC and delta 9 bind at a higher rate which is why you do not need as much. It would seem then focusing on CBG and CBD would be wise as they work great for pain and nausea. \n\nI suggest vaporizing to reduce inflammation and maximize plant matter. \n\n\nKnown as MIRICA online of amazon is also effective at reducing pain. It is chemical name is ( it is found in some fats like egg yolk and possible olive oil IIRC. It may up regulate the effectiveness of exogenous cannabinoids the way it does endogenous. I am not apposed to taking synthetic medications provided that I know that they are safe for me.  It is just, since I have a long history of bad reactions to medications, medications contributing to the development of additional medical problems, and every member of my family having nearly died at least once due to prescribed medications, I have done my best to try to avoid taking anything at all for the past decade.   As my GP has never even heard of MCAS (and is an extremely sceptical person by nature) I am continuing to avoid anything I am at all unsure about until I have my appointment with the specialist, who can advise me (and my GP) on what I can an cannot take.  That is why I am asking for advise here in the meantime, as my appointment is still a ways off. I went to the chemist the other day, and, apparently, Benadryl does not exist in Ireland and the UK...  Do you know if there is a UK equivalent that would be safe? Paragraphs help. I wish you luck. This sucks, not knowing or having a diagnosis.", "Black seed oil (black cumin oil) It is said to be antiinflammatory and hinders mast cells from releasing histamine.\nDid anyone try it? I tried over one hundred herbs, plant , seeds and extracts. Cloves also supposed to be a potent mast cell inhibitor but after taking a large amount ( of edible essential oil extract)  i actually had a reaction to it. The inhibition on mast cells is supposedly potent in all these studies but rarely do anything unless you megadose them to the point of toxicity.\n\nOnly think that seem to work ( herbs ) is high amounts of turmeric ( like 20 or 30 grams }) taken with black pepper. Works really well against any type of itching. Kratom is also a good one and maybe kava kava extract.\n\nIn general all these herbs are a waste of money unless you do it for other health benefits be careful because too high amounts of turmeric can hurt your kidney. Also I used turmeric for a little too but it turns out I am allergic :( I do think it helped though for sure I think it both helped and hurt. The spice of it caused a reaction and it felt like the antihistamine part of it helped though? \n\nPolyethanolide optipea helped me if you are looking for supplements though. Yes those phenols usually trigger mast cells. Especially phenols in grapes , chocolate and so forth also phenols in cannabis. It is different for each person some can tolerate chocolate. \n\nTurmeric is high on the list but i am able to tolerate it if i take medications. It is very potent targeting TNF-A and NF-kB. It helps alot better than NSAIDs.\n\nTurmeric along with Maca is pretty high on goitrogen index.", "What is The Longest Time Some One has taken Xolair Hey everyone I wanted to know the longest someone was ever on the Xolair injections. I wanted to know for my aunt. Thank you!! People have been on them continuously since they were approved in the EU- decade+ at least?", "Anyone have some incontinence (may be due to MCAS? Hello,\nI have a MCAS dx and have many daily symptoms, some of which are neurological.\n\nIn 2020 I began suffering moderate urinary incontinence. It began quite suddenly but progressed quickly from being reasonably mild to more moderate. \n\nI am working with my doctor to find some underlying cause and solution. However she is not a MCAS specialist and it has occurred to me that perhaps this might be a MCAS related symptom. I am wondering if that angle is worth pursuing.\n\nBut I have never seen it mentioned in MCAS communities that I can remember. So either people are not bringing it up or it is not related.\n\n If you do have some urinary incontinence related to your MCAS can you please help me by commenting. Then I will have some insight about whether I may be onto something or not.\n\nAlso, long shot but if you have this problem and it was MCAS related or at least neurological, then what treatment options did your doctor recommend or did you find something else that helped?\n\nThanks in advance MCAS can be a cause of interstitial cystitis (bladder inflammation). Inflammation means pain and irritation and I am sure that could lead to incontinence issues. I have struggled with this from time to time and I am convinced it is related to my overctive mast cells.\n\nI have been on the carnivore diet for three years to mange the mast cell symptoms. The first year I occationally ate porc until I realized I react to that also. Quite specifically, it makes me suddenly and urgently need to pee, even if the bladder is not full. Thank you for sharing your experience. I do think we are experiencing different things. Altho I do sometimes get the sudden painful urge to pee with certain food triggers. However my main problem is that I am 'leaking' small amounts throughout the day and have to wear pads. It does not come and go, so fairly consistent however for some reason some days it is much worse than others. That is also why I thought it might be to do with mast cell activity because that fluctuates as well. I definitely have all the interstitial symptoms such as sharp bladder pain, burning when peeing etc (and infection has been ruled out). I have definitely found that flares of those symptoms are connected to my mast cell flares. However I was not aware that interstitial cystitis could sometimes cause incontinence. So I will look into that thank you.\n\n Btw I do not have urge incontinence, more like just leaking small amounts throughout the day (so have to wear pads). Do you know whether the interstitial cystitis is associated with urge incontinence or is it associated with the kind that I have instead? My mother has MCAS and suffered for years before being diagnosed. (She is almost 60). She also has intercistial cystitis. She gets flares down there, has blood, in urine. Always tested neg for UTis. They did a scope &amp; biopsy in her bladder and diagnosed her w IC. If she eats something that does not agree she gets flares.\nI have been having many of the same symptoms (flushing, GI issues from foods, nausea, heartburn, allergy symptoms, fatigue, joint pain, urinary issues, frequent need to go, feeling like I never get it all out, leaking, feeling like a UTI is starting but does not, pain in urethra. I am sure all of these are completely connected. I am in process of going to specialists to help get some answers to help manage my symptoms that have gotten significantly worse over the last year. No incontinence but I have extremely frequent urination It can be both! My MCAS is linked to my IC and i get both the urge and tge incontinence. How frequent is your leaking from the IC? I do not mean to be intrusive so only answer that question if you are happy to. I leak every day and so have to wear pads. I really never realised that IC may be a cause of that.\n\nThis post has made me realise I need to get my IC type symptoms diagnosed  anyway, even if it turns out the incontinence is not related.\n\n The symptoms get worse with mast cell flares but at this point they are disruptive enough to need their own diagnosis. If anything, it might stop doctors  wanting to test me for a badder infections repeatedly! The flares mimic bladder infection exactly. Oh I am an open book! Before I managed to get it under control it was a daily occurence as well. I even ended up getting some underwear made for incontinence. They have some nice ones for sale. \n\nWhen I originally got diagnosed with it, I didnt know I had MCAS. It took years and the IC diet did not work, the standard medication as well (elmiron, installations, etc). I figured out that the food which triggered my MCAS triggered my IC. Antihistamines helped for the pain and myrbetriq for the the urge and incontinence. \n\nUntill you can get some help, I highly recommend a hot pad if it burns/hurt and prelief/cystoplast depending where you are. Thank you for sharing. My doctor told me two meds are an option and is letting me try desmpressin first. I know it is primarily for the night time symptoms but even that would help if it works. In the meantime we have to keep trying to get to the bottom of things.", "Meal replacement Has anyone of you tried using meal replacement?\n\nThere is only one food I can eat and it\u2018ll be out of season uncannily soon...\nSo I wondered if MR could help with not getting too low in essential nutrients. I do not care that much about macros/calories, I am more worried about micronutrients. (I am not really underweight but rather on the lower side of a normal weight.)\n\nI do not want a MR which is made out of legumes (pea protein, soy etc.) or which contains high levels of lectins, salycilates etc. I also have issues with biogenic amines in general (not only histamine but tyramine etc. as well).\n\nEvery opinion appreciated (as well from the people that are not so fond of MR)\n\n\n\nMay your DAO be functional and your inflammation levels low.\n\n:) \n\nI also have gastroparesis and meal replacements are sometimes required for a few days at a time. I have used the simple suggestions in this article because like you I try to avoid the nasty ingredients they stuff into most of these things.\n\n\n\n\nThis is a protein I have used. Thanks :) This is an intact protein, not split up into several amino acids, right? (I think I would be rather looking for the latter because of allergies...)\n\nI always wondered about the histamine content of those MRs... \n\nThis version is all amino acids. I used it when I was at my worst. I am sure you can find similar quality elsewhere but I am more familiar with these. Good luck though!!! My dr prescribed Neocate Jr for me and I used it for a number of months when I was not absorbing nutrients.  It is expensive but def worth it if you are in need.  I started w the unflavored as I did not want to include any potential allergy inducing things like adding a vanilla flavoring.  Eventually I went to vanilla and now I use it as coffee creamer! Something to keep in mind is that the more broken down a formula gets, the worse it is going to taste (and the more it is going to cost.) You definitely want to check with your doctor/dietician to see what they recommend and see if you can get insurance coverage with an Rx. \n\nHave you already tried any meal replacements? Pretty hard to find a MR, but protein shakes are easy. You can get pure rice protein shakes. Rice is often safe. ( Big knock on rice tho is, how much arsenic is in it? Where do they get their rice? If it is California rice then it is safer than southern rice.\n\nIf you are after micros then I would take a multi vitamin. The trick is finding one you do not react to. I do fine with Centrum, but I have no idea what is in it. You could try searching for \"hypoallergenic vitamins\" and see what comes up. \n\nI find that I react to low histamine things, so low histamine is no guarantee of anything for me. And there are high histamine things that have no effect on me. I use absorb plus when I am having trouble taking in calories. Its the only formula I tolerate. I have used neocate jr. and physicians elemental diet. Thank you. Looked up the first one, which sounds much better than some others I have saw. But I am worried about: Corn Syrup Solids (42%), Rice Starch (19%), Refined Vegetable Oil (18%) (Non-Hydrogenated Coconut (6%), High Oleic Sunflower (6%), Canola (3%), Sunflower (3%)), Sugar (9%)...\nMainly because I react to rice starch, corn and vegetable oils. Oilseed sunflower production is the most commonly farmed sunflower. These seeds hulls\u2019 are encased by solid black shells. Black oilseeds are a common type of bird feed because they have thin shells and a high fat content. These are typically produced for oil extraction purposes; therefore, it is unlikely you will find black oilseeds packaged for human consumption. Thanks, I hate sunflower products. Maybe try physicians elemental diet.\n Actually that one sounds much better that the other ones. I think those ingredients are definitely less terrible... \u201cdextrose, tapioca maltodextrin, medium chain triglycerides, natural flavor...\u201d\nThank you, guess I will give it a try... :) Meal replacements (over the counter ) usually contain alot of histamine. cheaper ones usually contain alot of gluctose fructose syrup.\n\nThose high quality and expensive whey protein bars usually are good when they are recently produced. When its longer on the shelf the histamine/histadine increases That absorb plus looked interesting being low ingredients, at least their unflavored vanilla.  I might try.  The others here seem to have lots of ingredients that look like a big no no.  \n\nHave you tried following this diet list:\n\n\n\n\n\nIt does have some amines foods to also avoid as well as high histamine and liberators.  I would try and try to figure more real food if possible to eat.  Keeping a detailed food diary.  Though you knowing that amines and salicylates, you probably have tried many foods.  That diet list seems pretty good though and thought I would share.  There has to be some foods.  \n\nApples?  Eggs?  Eggs are ok for me as long as they are well cooked.  Like hard boiled eggs.  \n\nHave you tried ancestral supplements kidney pills?  High in DAO, taking them 15 before eating something with a little histamine(avoiding liberators).  I love them.  And they are nutrient dense, which it sounds like you need.  \n\nJust came upon this thread and thought I would share some thoughts.", "Can you have MCAS without anaphylaxis? Hey all, today I went to the allergologist, to the only one close to me that has diagnosed MCAS cases, so she did a skin prick test for foods and airborne allergens, and the result was positive for mites and negative for everything else except for control. I have reported various symptoms but not anaphylaxis, which she basically said it is the basis for MCAS diagnosis (so she ruled out MCAS). She also said histamine intolerance does not exist. She prescribed a triptase blood test to further rule out MCAS. She said I probably have sinusitis and to get a visit from a otolaryngologist.\n\nMy symptoms come mostly after eating: I get issues from eating gluten, dairy, alcohol, oranges, vinegar, but almost every food gives issues of some kind (stuffed or runny nose, catarrh, feeling of skin flushing, burn feeling at the hands, orthostatic intolerance, some itchings around the body, headache and persistent brain fog and fatigue). Also I get very itchy if I walk into grass plants, and get red eyes if I use regular bath soaps. No anaphylaxis though.\n\nTo be honest, due to stuff I read around (even on research papers) I have some doubts about this doctor's opinion.\nI am interested to know your thoughts though; should I look for a second opinion or is she correct? Get a 2nd opinion. If histamine intolerance did not exist, why did they prescribe you an anti-histamine? Check out the table here. Anaphylaxis is not the same as anaphylactic shock. ( I have MCAS without anaphylaxis. I also have not had a positive tryptase, yet. But medication treatment has done wonders for me. I have all the GI problems and a bunch of neurological symptoms. Diarrhea, stomach cramps, bloating, fast emptying, severe anxiety, migraines, photophobia, brain fog, severe fatigue...and POTS is secondary to MCAS, so I have dysautonomia issues too. \n\nId be on disability with no idea of what to do if I did not get the diagnosis from my dysautonomia neurologist. Definitely find another doctor. My daughter has MCAS without anaphylaxis. Thank you! I think I will try with a neurologist too, besides the otolaryngologist. The doc that visited me today was opposite than your doctor, she would not try any treatment without any clear MCAS diagnosis (through tryptase test + some bone marrow biopsy...). Very informative, thank you Was the diagnosis based on symptoms or did they perform some tests? Thank you They tested tryptase, but only to rule out mastocytosis. I have MCAS, so I took her to my doctor when she started showing symptoms. Her symptoms have always been milder than mine. Did tryptase levels came out to be always normal, or was it required that they increased in some circumstances to be able to diagnose MCAS? If it was elevated, she would have needed a bone marrow biopsy. The doctor we see does clinical diagnosis for MCAS. Wftf? Tryptase is only high in MCAS \\*after\\* a big trigger, and returns to normal after an hour or so (dixit my hematologist who specializes in mast cell diseases). Get a second opinion. I am diagnosed with MCAS with no anaphylaxis. I had two tryptase tests done, one to determine my baseline (below 1) and a second during a reaction (around 10). I also did the urine test for N-Methylhistamine.  I also responded well to treatment. I also had two systems activate during reactions (GI and skin). I currently have no IgE mediated allergies. I had a bad flushing episode at my allergist so they got to witness how bad and weird it was (bad enough I was previously checked for carcinoid). An immunologist is what youre likely looking for. Neurologists ignored all my symptoms until I found 1 of 2 doctors in my entire state who specializes in Dysautonomia. He was well versed in POTS and comorbid diseases. I now see an immunologist for my MCAS treatment. If I may ask, how did you trigger the reaction? Also did you perform the skin prick test, and if so, did it test positive for all the things that cause(d) you symptoms? Thank you For the second test my doctor ordered a tryptase test so it was available and I was to go to the lab when I experienced a reaction. It took a few months. \n\nI used to have an IgE allergy to soy 10 years ago.  But when I did the skin and blood test for IgE mediated allergies they all came back negative including the soy. So my reactions are mast cell triggered. They used to be primarily skin and GI symptoms but they have escalated and include shortness of breath now. Benadryl generally reduces the symptoms. Have not yet had to use my EpiPen but I have it handy especially with the breathing symptoms. Seconding that I had a similar experience with an allergist who quickly and prematurely dismissed MCAS and then went to a second one who diagnosed me with MCAS after a high histamine 24 hour urine test.\n\nThe sad truth is about 90% of doctors are incompetent and should be fired if not jailed. What are you on if you do not mind me asking? I had a ton of neuro issues which no one could figure out and now I am wondering if it was MCAS the whole time. Cromolyn sodium, xyxal, flonase, prilosec.", "Diagnosis of mast cell activation syndrome: a global \u201cconsensus-2\u201d  good news i hope )", "Do you guys get neurological symptoms when around certain chemicals and smells? Can you be more sensitive to scents and chemicals than food with mast cell? I mean even our real Christmas tree gave me burning nerve pains all over this year,I feel like the vitamins gave me mcs but why would a Christmas tree cause me pain all over? Being around certain smells like smoke make the insides of my ears twitch and feel full and I get nerve pain on my eyelids I mean do any of you deal with this? What is going on in my body \ud83d\ude1e  Vitamins gave you MCAS? Can you elaborate? Do you have any food issues? I have this happen to me a lot! Nerve pain is one of the first signs that I am having an attack. I am not sure why it happens exactly but it is super strangely go through. Some things make my nerves go nuts like the smell after you put out a candle or body odor. My theory is our nerves are very sensitive or overactive. Do you get like pains all over ? Like face and stuff? Depends on the trigger, smells and sounds cause facial pain while touching something too cold causes more body pain.  I have reacted to Christmas trees before and have deduced to be one of two things, given how ie tastes and what I have read online.\nPesticides which they spray on all trees after they are cut to preserve life span and to kill bugs. Another theory is mold spores as mold spores are naturally outside and then the tree is brought indoors into warm air and the mold grows... does not need to be visible.\nI have had reactions to both things separately in trees before. My fake tree kicked the bucket this year and I have had it since before I got MCAS. honestly not sure what I will do next year. And I do get bad neurological symptoms whenever I am exposed to mold or chemicals. Alot of people with MCAS do as far as I have read and heard. I have 2 little pet lizards, and they are fragile and very sensitive when it comes to volatile chemicals, scents, etc. Since I finally found out what is wrong with me, there is a running joke in my home that I am a lizard too. \n\nBefore I got them as pets, I would used a lot of things I had to give up, like wax melts and incense, for their sake.\n\nI never understood what these things were doing to me before, maybe due to some delayed reaction? But once I started \"lizard proofing\" my home and being much more careful about what kinds of cleaners I was using, a lot of weird symptoms like tingling in my fingers, never shocks in my leg and constant migraines improved.\n\nPerhaps this is not definitive proof. But since I did this for my animals before learning what was wrong with me, I had not made all the other changes yet that could account for it (diet, regular antihistamines, supplements, etc). I thought I was crazy at first. After all, who gets nerve shocks from being too close to a scented candle?!\n\nMast cell issues are just weird. I would not doubt what you are saying at all, but I will be damned if I understand why our bodies are so over reactive. I know its frustrating.\n\nAlso not really \"related\" but interesting maybe: the species of lizard I have cannot be around pine/spruce trees or products made from them at all. Pine releases volatile oils that can make them sick or even kill them! Maybe that is what you are reacting to. \n\nThinking about this and the issues with pesticides and mold already mentioned here... I do not think I will ever have a live Christmas tree again. It just seems unreasonably dangerous. o.o That is so interesting I have never even thought about it that way! I have never had issues with them before in fact always loved the smell of them but do not think I will\nBe able to have one anymore now :( never thought about the crap they spray on them though I have read things like drug and vitamin toxicity can trigger mast cell and I had elevated b6 but also these issues started after I had some dye for a scan so maybe that set everything off Oh I see Interesting. I have not read that and none of my doctors have mentioned that. In fact I am on B vitamin supplements because it tends to help people with mast cell and histamine processing dysfunction. I was not taking any medications or supplements prior to becoming ill. It is important to note that there are a number of different mast cell disorders though. Sometimes it can be set off by overexposure to an allergen or other times from a co-morbid condition - having any kind of connective tissue fragility whether it is considered a full-blown disorder or not puts you at incredible risk of developing a mast cell disorder. Then, of course, sometimes it is genetic.\n\nYou might want to speak to an allergist about the reactions to smells. I know people who rather than having typical allergy symptoms have neurological symptoms - even to things like pollen. For one of them allergy shots really helped. Someone at my work also was incredibly allergic to fragrances and actually died of anaphylactic shock after being exposed. Could be something like multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS). Maybe you had a delayed reaction to the contrast dye and your immune system just stayed angry. Could be anything really - definitely best to speak to a doctor if you have not already. \n\nGood luck!", "Zileuton vs. Montelukast Hi, \n\nI was wondering if anyone had the opposite problem, where it was the zyflo that caused a slew of problems and then they felt find on the montelukast?  I was on the montelukast and felt fine emotionally and physically but it was not bringing down my leukotryines enough.  My doctor switched me to Zyflo after months of fighting with my insurance company.  While I feel good in some ways, and my leaukotryines are down - the past few weeks I have had insane nausea and fatigues, upset stomach and I think I am having emotional issues too.  I feel incredibly depressed and moody, which is very unlike how I normally feel.\n\nDid anyone else have similar experiences? So there are like three generics for Zileuton (yes, only three generics, because this medication is not widely used due to the mechanisms of action / how expensive it is). There is a specific generic made by some manufacturer (I will have to check later) that has some fillers that make me have weird side effects with Zileuton.\n\nMy insurance will not supply brand name Zileuton just do to the costs alone, so I cannot attest to Zyflo. \n\nThat said, grain of salt here, the sensitivities you are likely experiencing could be related to what the drug is synthesized with / drug itself vs the actual side effects of the mechanisms of action. \n\n5-LOX inhibitors like Zileuton technically should not share the same side effects as Montelukast (at least from a neuropsychiatric perspective) because it works on a highway pathway compared to Montelukast where it just targets CysLT1 (which is found to be in neuropathways). When Montelukast came out on the market in the US, Pranlukast (already released to the market in Japan) had trials of adverse neuropsychiatric issues with selective CysLT1 inhibition. ...it really was until Montelukast and similar drugs were well onto the market that studies were done finding that by blocking CysLT1 by its specific antagonists can cause neuropsychiatric adverse reactions. \n\nZileuton technically though does have incidence of hepatotoxicity and indigestion. Thank you for your response! I guess I was just trying to gauge if anyone else felt really horrible on Zileuton/Zyflo and if those side effects lasted long.  \n\nYou are saying that it might be what is mixed in with the pill and perhaps not the actual drug itself? Yeah. To be fair and perfectly honest, you likely will not get much of a response on here due to how extremely limited Zileuton is prescribed. Only in the US can you get Zileuton. In addition,  the reason why it is so expensive ...even for the generics, they are pretty ridiculous...  is solely because Zileuton is the only 5-LOX inhibitor on the market. So relatively it is either between Montelukast, or Zileuton if you are in the US.  Even less likely is insurances dishing out money for Zariflukast due to Montelukast being the dominant LT inhibitor here (it is prescribed more overseas than in the US). So relatively most people in the US are likely going to be stuck with Montelukast. \n\n{Tinfoil hat theory .... is that there is probably is collusion going on between the pharmaceutical manufacturers.}\n\nSo to answer your question directly... Both my fiance and I are on Zileuton. We both do not have the side effects that we got with Montelukast vs Zileuton. In fact, outside of two months where I received a different manufacturer of Zileuton (where I suspect my effects were due to the fillers synthesized in the generic) I have not ...both of us ...have not have not had any side effects taking this drug. \n\nThen again ...it is all subjective because we are all different in how we metabolize drugs ...which was the purpose of my first reply in detailing that Montelukast's side effects are most caused by the mechanism of action. Thank you so much.  I wonder if I just do not metabolize this one as well as I had hoped.  I really thought it was going to be such a good fit, the first few weeks I felt wonderful.  Then just the very intense nausea all the time and stomach ache and now with the feeling rather depressed.\n\nI suppose perhaps the feeling depressed could be due to just having to deal with a disease that is so all encompassing.  I do appreciate the time you spent to respond, I just recently got on reddit and was surprised by how much less alone I felt just reading that other people are going through similar things.\n\nI also could not believe how expensive the Zyflo was, with my insurance refusing to pay for it I had to go though a foundation who luckily is paying the price of it for me.  It was a ton of loopholes which is why I am sad that it seems to come with some side effects that are not great.", "COVID-19 Vaccine Anyone with MCAS get either Moderna or Pfizer vaccine yet? Willing to share your experience and reasoning between one or the other? (I am of course waiting to hear back from my immunologist regarding her recommendation, but thought it would be good to hear others experiences!)

I made a post about my reaction to the Pfizer vaccine.", "Best sources of Omega 3s I have tried serveral different sources of Omega 3 fatty acids and reacted to them: \nSalmon, Chia Seeds, Cod Liver Oil, Olive Oil, Flax Seed Oil. \n\nDoes anyone know of a good Omega 3 source that is not high histamine and well tolerated? I have not tried it, but hemp oil is low histamine according to my Intolerances app. A lot of oils are supposedly low histamine in fact. I think most of my problems with oil came from cross contamination, supply chain issues, and shelf life. I am good with coconut oil being opened way longer than I am with grapeseed oil. I cannot handle olive oil, and that is probably because there is no guarantee it is actually unadulterated olive oil. I should retry bulk olive oil from my local co-op. Have you ever tried Macadamia oil? I have heard its good and I think low histamine too. Bear in mind though that liquid oil will spoil quicker than solid oil. Have not tried macadamia myself but good luck! I take vegan omega 3 from sports research Late reply, but maybe this info can help as it is helped me.  \n\nFor Omega 3 I use Jarrow Formulas krill oil.  It is a clean krill oil as other brands I react to with additives.  A very good anti-inflammatory.  \n\nFor olive oil, yes a lot of stuff from Italy is not pure olive oil.  California has a group of olive oil\u2019s from different companies that are tested and certified as true olive oil.  But the only brand I find locally is California Olive Ranch, but it is pretty popular and available by me.  There is other brands if you can find the list of the group that certifies all of them.   California Olive Ranch has been a godsend for me for a few years.  I usually buy their 100% California olive oil, but did a couple times unwittingly buy their blend from a few different countries and had no reactions with it.  \n\nAlso look into ghee butter.  I have used a couple different brands and had no reaction.  Sorry, do not have names in front of me.  But it is supposed to be pretty safe for MCAS folks.  And it is suppose to have good omega 3\u2019s in it and anti inflammatory.  Though do not know the ratio of it to omega 6.  \n\nGranted, I do not think olive oil has omega 3\u2019s.  From what I understand they have other properties that make it anti inflammatory.  At least that is what I understand.  \n\nThat krill oil is more anti inflammatory than olive oil and ghee though.\n\nBlueberries are supposed to be anti-inflammatory.  As well as sweet potatoes which I love and been a huge part of my diet for past few years.   Also of course veggies are probably the most anti inflammatory food, depending on which ones.", "Tips for dispensing cromolyn sodium? I hate these stupid f\\*\\*\\*ing ampules so much.  Of course I am glad cromolyn sodium is liquid because it hits really fast, but every time I try to squirt them into a glass over water, they splash everywhere, and I end up licking cromolyn off my desk and my laptop and my hand.  No matter what I do, they splash everywhere!  I need that inside my body!\n\nI asked on FB how people dispensed them to avoid this and everyone acted like I was crazy.  I cannot be the only one!  I am already furious when I am having an allergic reaction, and my meds splashing all over the place certainly does not help haha What type of ampule do you use? Is it the one with the flat, gray rubber top encased in metal, or is it the pointy \"break off the tip\" type? Never had this problem. I just lower it in the glass down towards the water but not all the way and usually any that splashes splashes onto the side of the glass plastic breaky kind....they package this stuff in metal?  For reals?  That sounds like an enormous waste of packaging I twist the tab off the top, squeeze it in the glass first, then add water. No issues. Uhhhh are you using glasses that are 36 inches tall?\n\nAlso I do not know why you wasted your time and mine to tell me that you do not have this problem.  I do not care!  Why would you think I cared lmfao Because you said everyone thought you were crazy and you asked for tips on the process so I thought posting the process I use which has no splashing might help? \n\nWhatever jerk. It depends on what it is for. I was not sure was cromolyn was cased in. The ones I was talking about with the metal are the kind they often use in immunotherapy injections. It is a glass cylindrical type bottle that has a sealed metal cap. In the middle of the cap there is a gray rubber bit. To get the medicine out, you put a needle through the rubber bit. Perhaps you can see if you can get your medication through those instead? I open a water bottle, drink some to make room, then stick the plastic tips into the bottle and squeeze them all at the same time.\n\nIf you are having a reaction and need it really fast, you can also squeeze the cromolyn directly into your mouth and drink the water afterwards. My daughter reacts to water, so she takes her cromolyn this way. I use short whisky glasses. I fill it about a quarter full of water then empty the ampules into it. I have had the same issue as you, I have found out it is based on manufacturer, I have had 3 different brands and all 3 were different to open. \n\nFirst one I could not squeeze the tube when I was twisting off the cap and would have splash like you do. \n\nThe second brand was smaller plastic tubes and was more of a pain to separate the vials. \n\nThe third brand had rounder vials (similar to insulin with twist off cap) I have had no issues with spillage. I break them over the water glass and there is a little squirting, but I do not think I am losing very much. Not worried about it. It is completely fucking bizarre what people will downvote. That is not an ampule.  That is a vial.  I am not sure why you asked if I meant vial when I said ampule. I already said that everyone else I would spoken to told me I should not have this problem, and then you come in here and say once again that you do not think I should have this problem.  There is absolutely NOTHING helpful about telling me that you do not have this problem.  That does not help me in any way, shape, or form.  It just makes me feel like everyone thinks i am a fucking retard for having my medication splash everywhere, and yet NOTHING I DO WILL MAKE IT STOP SPLASHING.  And all ANYONE does is LAUGH AT ME AND TELL ME I AM DUMB.\n\nI JUST WANT TO GET MY FUCKING MEDICATION INSIDE MY FUCKING BODY.  I have had this problem FOUR TIMES A DAY, EVERY DAY, FOR A YEAR, AND ALL ANYONE DOES IS MAKE FUN OF ME AND TELL ME I AM AN IDIOT BECAUSE \\*THEY\\* DO NOT HAVE THAT PROBLEM.\n\nI REALLY do not understand why you think it is anything other than INCREDIBLY discouraging to intentionally, deliberately tell me something I have explicitly told you I have already heard time and again, that was not helpful the first 37 times, and is not helpful now.\n\nI have spent HOURS on this subreddit helping people who are new to mast cell disease, and every time I ask a question that is not a question that every single other person in this god damn sub has, I get downvoted.  I asked about microcurrent treatments AFTER MY DOCTOR SUGGESTED THEM, and everyone downvoted me.  For no fucking reason!  MY FUCKING DOCTOR suggested it, not some random mommy blogger, and no one did ANYTHING but downvote it. If you Google photos of ampules, both pop up. I use them, and my allergist and immunologist refer to them as ampules.\nEdit: it may be called different things in different places. According to Google, both names are correct. I have no clue how that works,  That sounds, frankly, like the thing I would need to do if I wanted to make SURE it splashed everywhere.  How does that work?  Can you record a  video?  I have to use a cup that is at least 10 inches tall, AND THEN cover the entire opening up the cup with my hand, to not have it splash everywhere. Thank you, you are absolutely the first person to say anything other than that I am a fucking idiot.  You are my hero.  I would practically erect a statue to you.  I have been asking and asking and asking and all anyone does is laugh at me. Do you know which manufacturer it is? I have only ever had Wallace and horizon I think. Maybe other manufacturers have a weird spout or something? If you are going to be so nasty and do not want to hear anyone on here go to your DOCTOR AND ASK WHY YOURE HAVING PROBLEMS. I have read about people experience using the medication before I got on board and this is the first time I heard of it but not saying this does not happen. I just twist the top and squeeze the liquid out, apply max pressure to the 4 vial/ampoules together to a cup of water so that I do not have to squeeze each one of them. Or I guess you can drink it straight up lol.", "Wondering If I Have Mast Cell Disease? Its Just Getting Worse I have significant throat and tongue swelling that gets worse after every meal. Its been going on for over 6 months, but in the past month its become a living nightmare. Almost everything I eat, will cause swelling of my throat &amp; tongue where food &amp; water will start to get stuck in my throat. I have only been able to eat boiled potatoes &amp; plain oats.\n\nMy other symptoms are shortness of breath, hoarseness of voice, heart palpitations only after eating, and congestion of the nose, eyes, and throat. My throat swelling gets worse after eating, and the higher the food is in Histamine, the worse it will be. heat &amp; humidity also makes everything x10 worse.\n\nI have been Diagnosed with POTS. Also, I got an upper Endoscopy done and they did not find anything related to acid or anything else wrong, which is a little funny cause they make you stop eating 12 hours before so of course your not going to see any significant swelling if food is the main trigger.\n\nI am now down to 97 pounds and am wondering if this could be MCAS. I know that its somewhat related, having pots and MCAS together and am trying to get tested, but I am in Canada and my allergist is only willing to do a tryptase blood test, which I read in a lot of POTS patients shows up as negative who have MCAS and also is no where near the depth of testing that needs to be done in order for a diagnosis (they also do not think I have it). I have tried to ask multiple doctors about Mast Cell Disease, but every doctor says that I am either crazy and its all in my head or that I have anxiety. \n\nAt this point, I am scared to eat anything because my throat swells to the point where I cannot talk, eat, or drink and no doctors will take me seriously, let alone give me an epi-pen (not sure if that is something I should have).\n\nPlease leave a comment, any information and advice means a lot!", "MCAS Discord?

Tryptase, N-Methylhistamine and Leukotrienes were midlle-range normal. She said Prostaglandin D2 is a marker she finds elevated in many people, but my serum Proastaglandin D2 was 109 (ref range 30-115) and random urine was 57 ng/liter (which there is no reference frame for). Serum seems on the higher side and the random urine, I have no idea.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy doctor is unfortunately out of the office for a week (of course as my results finally come in). Does anybody have experience with these markers? My diagnosis of MCAS is based partly on elevated prostaglandin D2 (above normal range). I have never shown elevated tryptase or methylhistamine. But it has not been elevated every time. You may need to test more than once.\n\nAlso, be aware that these tests are finicky for labs. Not all of them know to chill the samples... Similarly when you so 24 hour urine, you need to keep it chilled and drop it off promptly after your last collection. Even then you are counting on the lab to handle it properly after they get it. So it might be worth seeing if there is anyone in your area with experience getting diagnosed and see what lab they used. What is your protocol for high prostagladin d2? Supposedly aspirin can help with it. But I am on a pretty common MCAS regimen: montelukast 2/day, pepcid 2/day, fexofenadine 2/day, oral cromolyn sodium two vials four times a day (30 minutes before meals and at bedtime).\n\nAlso I try to avoid triggers which for me is mostly food intolerances. Same experience with me. Had a doc who would not diagnose me just on the D2 alone and had to go thru retesting which they lost!! Went to a new specialist who took one look at my records and tests and diagnosed me immediately Yeah... \n\nUnfortunately I was told by my specialist that even if you test normal (which to her from her PoV and her other MC patients is that it is  relatively common to test normal for these tests since these tests are not readily available to patients and they are susceptible to false negatives due to lab handling.)\n\nWhen I initially thought I had MCAS prior to typtase and bone marrow biopsy this basically was stated to me and that her MCAS patients who test normal to these tests but respond to treatments needed for MCAS, then you are likely to just be treated as a MCAS patient in the end. It is VERY IMPORTANT that even if you test normal but respond positively to treatments, then you should keep the MCAS diagnosis regimen. If your doctor does not understand this ... Seek out another allergist/immunologist who understands mast cell disorders. I am seeing someone who specifically deals with MCAS patients in Chicago. She is also an endocrinologist, so she has also tested for the neuroendocrine tumor panel (VIP, 24-hour 5-HIAA, Metanephrines, Chromogranin A).\n\nOther than MCAS, the only other explanation could be some sort of autonomic nervous system disorder. I do not really have typical POTS symptoms, as my symptoms are unchanged by posture. But I suppose some sort of dysautonomia could also be at play if MCAS is ruled out.\n\nMost of my issues revolve around my GI. It is where it all started and seems that the other symptoms that have occurred over the years are manifestations of it as well. Most of my issues started GI then skin involvement.   has great info and they also have an advice nurse. I would just wait u til your doctor gets back before you potentially spiral more than you need to.

I wear a 99.7% filter mask when outside and still have problems. \n\nDoes anyone else have this problem who has figured out how to run air conditioning? Our apartment gets very hot but I get very sick when we run it when I am in the room. We have been compromising by running it at night only when my door is shut but my feet still feel weird walking on the floor and I cannot leave my room to go to the bathroom. I have considered adding some kind of filtering screen that will not burn out the AC (so like a big bunch of it attached to the front with lots of extra space?) or directing the flow of air away with cardboard. Considering trying to use fans and ice cubes instead. \n\nAny ideas, commiserators, or suggestions for alternate ways to keep apartment cool? Cannot help but ask. Have you tried ketotifen yet? That helped me so much with scent reactions. I can even go into a craft store now.\n\nOn the topic you actually asked about, have you gotten your ac system cleaned out recently? I am not sure what sort of system you have. My mom used to replace her whole portable ac unit once a year since mold tends to grow in it over the winter. God we are expensive haha We have got a window ac so it is essentially outside air being pumped in to cool the place. Does the portable AC just pump hot air out or does it pump cooled outside air in? Actually I can probably google that. \n\nYeah I love ketotifen, cromolyn, and palmitoylethanolamide as my main mast cell stabilizers. Would not even be able to go outside without them. I have a hard time with outaide, too. Im going to make two suggestions. The first is a cooling fan. You add water to it and the air it blows is cool. I have a hard time with it because of my allergy to dust mites and dogs. But its a nice addition and only blowing inside air. Keep it clean. The second is, if you are not treating with an H2 antihistamine, add it in. My asthma gets pretty bad from silent acid reflux and I have tons of allergy symptoms but its caused by that. Thanks for your suggestions. \n\nMy final setup: \n\n-tension rod halfway down hallway with a 10 gauge vinyl shower liner (same material as many mattress encasements). So I can go to bathroom in middle of night with no pollen exposure. \n-run AC in living room only at night when I am not in common areas and shower liner is blocking hallway. Cover up drying plates with tablecloth, move open snacks to room. \n-box fan in bedroom on chair aimed directly at bed\n-merv 11 filter for back of another fan in living room, leave running in addition to other air filters to keep cool and reduce residual pollen pulled in by AC\n-turn off all ac/fans in living room 2 hours before I wake up so everything has time to settle to ground \n-repeatedly forget to use flip flops in living room to protect feet from pollen on ground \n-run the shower on cold for 30 minutes with a fan in the bathroom as makeshift swamp cooler when forget to do previous steps or during the day \n\n\nThanks for the idea of adding the filter to the fan, fan in bedroom, and for emboldening our suggestion of running the shower. Evaporative portable AC units can cause problems with mold/mildew/whatever.  But I think you do not mind spending a chunk of cash you can get a non-evaporative portable AC step one: acquire basement\n\nstep two: warm air rises\n\nstep three: u in the basement with the colder air Step one, revised: acquire completely dry basement. Basement on a hill? \n\nAlternative: completely wet basement for cool. Literal ocean apartment, floating. \n\nNo mold or dust :( I have thought about it because my girlfriends apartment was in a basement and I considered begging her to live somewhere anywhere else but instead I just made her come to my place all the time lol.

Alternative H1 inhibitors? my kiddo gets a weekly anti-MCAS cocktail that includes IV Benadryl. It is given him some quality of life back, but the Benadryl leaves him feeling really wired and tired for over 16 hours -- he can be up till \\~4-6 am, even if he gets the Benadryl around noon.  He describes it as mostly wired, scattered, restless (but trying not to, knowing he will be really sore the next day wherever he uses his muscles). \n\nDoes anyone get this?  What do you do?  \n\n\nSince this is not the typical reaction, I am wondering if there a CYP enzyme to blame?  What if there is a Benadryl metabolite that makes you wired, that is \\*usually\\* created slowly and eliminated rapidly enough, but if it is created quickly and eliminated slowly, can cause that sensation.   Since young kids are much more likely to have this \"paradoxical reaction\", perhaps there is a difference in how they metabolize it?

This can happen in children with Benadryl it is not unheard of. You can google more and find info but here is a quick example it is a known phenomenon. More rare in adults. The fact that it is in kids and not as much adults prob does not have to do with cyp unless it continues into adulthood which does not seem the case but who knows!\n\n\n\nEdit- I have also heard of people who went through antidepressant withdrawal have paradoxical reactions to it as well as people who took in long amounts of time have it turn paradoxical over time.", "Thrombosis, blood clots, circulation issues How are they related to MCAS?\nDid/do you experience any of them?", "Calf cramps?

I have to take potassium when I am using a lot of Benadryl, or I get cramps like that. No I do not. But thank you for the info! It is not just magnesium, it is electrolytes, including potassium.\n\nYou can try electrolyte drinks like Nuun, Liquid IV, Gatorade, Pedialyte, etc...\n\nYou can try getting more potassium in your diet. Some of the electrolyte drinks have a hefty dose, but potassium pills are low dose by law. But potatoes with the skin have lots, so do bananas. \n\nAnd as far as magnesium goes, there is some evidence it can be better absorbed thru the skin. So you can take Epsom salts baths or you can get magnesium skin cream. Echoing others - When I did an elimination diet I was so deficient in potassium that I got palpitations and had to have a heart monitor after anaphylaxis. Potassium is a critical vitamin, so make sure you are not deficient. Also, maybe try rolling out or stretching your calves before bed. \n\nNote for others who might be low in potassium: TAKE YOUR SUPPLEMENTS (or eat veggies) BECAUSE POTASSIUM IVS ARE SO FREAKING PAINFUL. 20/10 would never do again. Yes I believe potassium was the issue for me when getting calf cramps bad. I was deficient likely from the constant diarrhea also caused by mast cell stuff. What Did your elimination diet consist of?\nAnd why did you have to get it IV? Hospital? Thanks! Cannot have potatoes or bananas, but I will try getting the skin cream :) This was before my diagnosis. I had self eliminated foods I thought I was  allergic to, which brought me down to 5 non-nutritious foods. I had anaphylaxis at work and had to be hospitalized overnight for observation. Oh, damn. What foods were that? Basically only bland food you might eat when you have the flu - saltine crackers, apple sauce, deli turkey, unsalted/unbuttered popcorn, and plain/boiled chicken. Oh, okay.

I have personally tried to ketotifen 3 separate times and I have not been able to stay on it.\n\nOn mastattack.org she talks about you have to give stuff 3 days because sometimes your body will build a quick tolerance to it. That happened with me and singulair I almost got off of it cause it was causing stomach pain and after 3 days it stopped now I cannot imagine not taking it.\n\nBut I want to keto so bad but have never been able to but I have talked to mastys that swear by it. And it is not something that sent me into a flare but just bothered my system enough i did not want to continue. \n\nBut everyone is different and I would at least give it a try. Thanks for the reply, I appreciate it. I did not know about giving new medicines a few days to see if any side effects go away. I have not been diagnosed with mast cell disease, although I am dealing with Lyme disease, gut dysbiosis, mould toxicity and heavy metals.\n\nI do suffer from sleep maintenance insomnia and the only thing that works for me is ketotifen (a second-generation noncompetitive H1 antihistamine and mast cell stabilizer). I take 1mg each night before bed.\n\nMy doctor and I have concluded that histamine production is interfering with my sleep cycle and when we are able to control that then I am able to sleep through the night.\n\nNot sure if this is exactly what you were looking for OP, but hopefully it is of some use. Thanks for the information.  I also have disrupted sleep due to high histamine levels. My doctor said histamines are at their peak around 3 am or so. I had read that ketotifen makes some people very sleepy so I was hoping it could potentially help me with my sleep issues. I really need to get over this fear of new medicines because I think a lot of my anxiety is caused by, or worsened by my mast cell disease.  Allergic reactions put you in that fight or flight mode. Yea I do not remember where it is but she goes over it on her website. I think she is one of the best most knowledgeable people on mast cell disease and I am greatfull for her website.\n\nBut if I would have quite singular after 1 day I would have regret it because it is almost single handily stopped the mast cell associated diarrhea I get. \n\nUnless something is causing your throat to close up then stop immediately but I have had good luck with the 3 day rule. Thanks! No problem glad I can help. Tbh it kept me really stable (still had reactions though), but there seems to be a lot of production issues and I was getting annoyed by it so...my MC doctor said to use a different medication in its place because the stop-starting issue was causing /so many/ problems for me. I do plan to go back on it soon though when it is sorted out. I hope the availability issue gets fixed so you can start taking it again.I had to have mine made at a compounding pharmacy because they do not sell it over the counter here. It is game changing for me. This and Ativan are most powerful stabilizers for me, and this I can take every day without messing my brain up. Take it at night if you are worried about brain fog the first few times maybe? I had no issues but some people get a little sleepy I think. You have got to try meds even if it is risky sometimes because the right med can change your entire life and reduce reactions overall, and you only find that med by trying ones that occasionally make you feel worse. Thanks, I appreciate the input and advice. how long did it take you to get prescribed? I really need this but where did you start with your doctor? I had to find an alternative doctor to get it prescribed, an ND but that was expensive. You could also check for a mcas doctor in one of the lists and they would certainly put you on it. A normal doctor is less likely to want to prescribe something they do not know about for an illness they are not trained in. You can also buy it otc some countries.", "New diagnosis I will start out by saying I have had issues for years not knowing what I had til yesterday. Bad vasculitis sent me to a rheumatologist and a test caught his attention and I was sent to an oncologist it was found that I had 30% mast cells in my bone marrow. Now all these years on symptoms the largest being migraines bone and back pain stomachs and skin issues. Also had tachycardia and my pulse has run high for years. I can pinpoint when symptoms got really bad about 14 years ago. Stress seems to set it off I am in a attack constantly. The doctor has ordered more tests to see what organs are affected and has told me that he will be having me to take chemotherapy and some type of bone medication in form of a infusion. I had to do some quick research of all this but apparently there is staging of this disease with him wanting to do chemo does it sound like it has turned into mast cell leukemia. Sorry to say, but I do not think anyone can give you a meaningful answer to that online. And if they do, you should probably ignore it. This is the kind of thing that you need to work with your doctor to figure out.\n\nCongratulations on finding a path to an answer, though. Many are not so fortunate. Good luck!", "Just got Cromolyn Sodium (gastrocrom) My doctor does not really care if I only use it when I want to eat something I should not (like a salad), or with meals and before bed.\n\nHow do you use it? What have been your results? Any side effects? I take it when I wake up, before lunch, before dinner, and before bed. Its the most helpful medication I have taken. I took it for a while, had to stop because of a side effect. My periods were already heavy, but after I started cromolyn, I started having a bleeding episode every morning at 6 where I would lose about two cups of blood. I was taking cromolyn three times a day, and I think the bleeding episode was when the cromolyn wore off. I did not realize it was the problem at the time, because it helped so much with my other symptoms. I had to have several blood transfusions (I reacted to the first one, not fun) and they gave me pills to slow the bleeding, but I still spotted every day for the next five months. Then in February I came down with a really bad cold (probably covid but they were not testing for it yet) and I was too sick to get out to the kitchen to mix my cromolyn, so I stopped taking it. My spotting stopped. About two weeks later, I started cromolyn again and the spotting started again right away. I stopped taking it and the spotting stopped again.\n\nSo no cromolyn for me, which is a shame because my stomach felt so much better when I was on it. Holy crap!\n\nWell, i have a mirena, and once it comes out, I get lupron, then a hysterectomy, so hopefully that will not be an issue for me.\n\nI will definitely keep it in mind though. Goodness. I am hoping to have a hysterectomy and then be able to get back on cromolyn at some point. \n\nMy daughter also took cromolyn and did not have any change in her periods. I had to jump through so many hoops to get mine. I do not have (or want) children of my own. Even with PCOS and Endo, I am just supposed to suffer. I had complex endometrial hyperplasia 7 years ago, so I will not have trouble getting the doctor to agree to it or insurance to cover it. I have put it off because I had a bad reaction to anesthesia when I had a d&amp;c and did not want more surgery until we understood why I reacted like that. \n\nI am sorry they were difficult with you. It seems unfair that vasectomy is so accessible for men, but anything that permanently stops female fertility is hard to get a doctor to agree to. I am glad you will be able to get it done when you are ready.\n\nYea, it sucks how hard it is for women to control their bodies, and get appropriate medical care.", "Allergic reaction to leftovers?   Crossposting because I think this thread may be useful to a broader audience. I think the person in the other thread had it right. Everything I have read states leftovers are pretty bad due to bacteria growth. Either cook as you go, or freeze leftovers to avoid the issue. Bacteria in leftovers increases histamine. The older the leftovers the more the histamine. Omg. This explains so much. Thank you!!!!!", "New Article: Quantitative Analysis of Intramucosal Mast Cells in Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Comparison With Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Remission - Journal of Clinical Gastroenerology ", "Getting diagnosed \u201cMy neurologist suspected MCAS in my first meeting with him due to my constellation of symptoms. However, he is not pursuing the diagnosis because my tryptase and IgE labs came back normal. I am surprised at this because my symptoms seem to fit the diagnosis so well. \n\nHas anyone else had these labs be normal yet still been diagnosed and treated successfully for MCAS?\u201d - my wife Yes. IgE has nothing to do with MCAS. Tryptase is only one marker. High baseline tryptase is unusual in MCAS - typically you are looking at the difference between baseline and reaction tryptase. \n\n There is a ton of good info here. You would need to test tryptase during a flare to see if it is elevated from your baseline. An allergist/immunologist should be able to help if your Neuro will not order more testing. Also, you can have any EGD/Colonoscopy biopsies checked for Mast Cells. I have mastocytic enteritis diagnoses by biopsy that way. Yes. I had a ton of tests done. Almost all negative. Nothing important was positive. I was diagbosed based on my symptom history and how I responded to treatment with a mast cell stabilizer. Same here. 1/5 mediator tests I did for mast cell mediators was oh wow high, and one more was suspicious but the sample was degraded. Hard to get diagnosed as leaving the tests out for just a few minutes without being on ice can ruin the sample. This happened to me. \n\nN methyl histamine, prostaglandin pgd2 or other variants, leukotrienes, and heparin are the ones my doctor checked after tryptase came back normal per usual. I took them during a flare- intentionally slept in a bed full of dust and ate something I was reactive to the night before the test.\n\nProbably could have gotten diagnosed even if they would messed up the tests though. It was pretty obvious that mast cell stabilizers turned my entire life around. Elevated tryptase usually indicates mastocytosis or hereditary alpha tryptasemia, so you if you were found to have elevated levels, you would either do a bone marrow biopsy or a gene test to exclude the above two conditions. For MCAS, tryptase tends to be normal but will elevate during reactions. There a formula for the increase. My baseline tryptase was low (below 1) but would increase to 10 during a reaction. I also did not have any IgE mediated allergies at the time. The Mastocytosis Society has a ( for MCAS. Basically you have symptoms with at least 2 organ systems in parallel that have no other obvious trigger, your tryptase level increases above your baseline level minimum of 20% above the basal serum tryptase level, plus 2 ng/ml, and you respond well to treatment. Thank you so much. This is very helpful. Thank you so much. How did you go about finding an allergist/immunologist knowledgeable about MCAS? How do you find a doctor knowledgeable about MCAS? Thank you so much for your response. My wife is having a flare and this helps her a lot. I am so glad to here you have found treatment. My wife\u2019s life has bee awful for years. I communicate for her via screens because light triggers pain for her along with a whole other host of \u201cfun\u201d symptoms. \n\nHow did you find a doctor to treat your MCAS? Thank you so much. \n\nShe definitely has problems in multiple systems. We read \u201cNever Bet Against Occam\u201d and were amazed at how similar my wife\u2019s story was to many of the case reports in that book. So we were a little surprised that the Md was dropping the idea of MCAS based on only a couple tests which triggered this post. \n\nDo you know of anyway to find a good MCAS doctor? I am in Minnesota so there is more options. I asked mcas Facebook groups from my state and hospitals for recommendations. \n\nIs she on medication? I am sure she is. But just in case. There is a lot of OTC stabilizers and you can buy ketotifen online, I can send you a link. I used the facebook groups to find someone semi-local. It took 3 tries to find one that I was happy with though. I originally started with an allergist at a research hospital, which just happened to be convenient for my location. I was that allergist's first potential MCAS patient, so after I met the criteria, I was tentatively diagnosed. My allergist then referred me to one of the leading mast cell experts in Boston. That required a referral and there is a minimum of a year wait time to see the specialist, but it was very worth it. The Mastocytosis Society has a doctor page that might be helpful for you. I have moved since so when I found a new local PCP and explained about my medical situation, my PCP basically referred me to my new state's research hospital allergy/immunology dept. as my PCP knew the local allergists were not going to be particularly knowledgeable/familiar with the condition. That was helpful as they are familiar with my specialist in Boston. I still am going to travel to see the specialist in Boston for a follow up at some point, but that will be every few years and then I will also work with my regionally based allergist. Good luck! That would be great. Thanks again. \n\nI guess I will have to get a Facebook account. Thank you! MCAS is not unfamiliar to allergy/immunology. They have conferences on it. Just as an aside: Many in the medical community believe that Afrin is overly broad in his symptom list and testing. He is often contradictory. If you listen to some of the podcasts he is on, he concedes that there needs to be more study, that diagnostic testing is important (he talks about the tryptase calculation), and that we do not really know yet if all of these things are related. Mast cells can not do all/everything. They cause specific reactions. The mastocytosis society has a great website describing what to look for. Not saying that you do not have MCAS, but getting a doctor to take you seriously going on Afrin\u2019s \u201cresearch\u201d will be tough. The main symptoms should come in episodes as a response to triggering event. Her symptoms certainly follows triggering events. We can trace her dips into new worse normals to extreme triggering events and her flares typically follow over extending herself, stress, eating sweets, etc. \n\nWe are not committed to MCAS, but it is the first potential dx that sounds remotely like her crazy symptoms in the ten years she is had it. Hello. I live in Boston  as well.  Would you mind telling me who that doctor is?  Thank you.", "Reacting to budesonide I have mastocytic enterocolitis.\n\nI have been taking budesonide for 1.5 weeks and I am reacting to it. Could not tolerate gastrocrom either. I wonder how long it will be until budesonide side effects to go away. Before ruling it out, I would suggest trying different manufacturers to see if you tolerate the fillers better. Or try a compounding pharmacy. That is a good point. Are the fillers in the budesonide or on the capsules? I am in the US so I am not sure if the pharmacy will be willing to swap anything such as different capsules. I also have to stick with what I got for now. Doctor did not approve refills. I do not know if you are in the US, but is it possible to make the pharmacy give you pills without colors added or do you ultimately have to go to a compounding pharmacy? My insurance is not contracted with any compounding pharmacy :/ I am in the US, I think you would have to go to a compounding pharmacy for that. Try asking the pharmacy you go to. They might have a non-dye option for those with allergies. Its always worth asking. Thank you. I actually talked to the pharmacist today (currently I can only get coverage at Walgreens), and she said the only option is to bypass capsules by opening them. I will try that and see if I react to the color in them. \n\nThe Walgreens pharmacist said that it is not possible to remove the fillers unless you have the raw material of the drug, even through compounding pharmacies.\n\nSo in the end, I guess I would have to find a place that could get the isolated drug compound instead of pre-made pills from the manufacturer. And get the insurance to agree. How are you taking this medication? As a pill form? To decrease inflammation? \n\nI have only seen it used for the asthma component via inhalation. I am taking it as a capsule. Usually it is prescribed for Crohn's and UC. I think the GI doc's hope is that the gut mast cells will finally calm down with this. It is the next step up from cromolyn sodium for my refractory mastocytic enterocolitis. Then the capsule is likely an essential component of the delivery system. It probably would not be beneficial to have it compounded with a different tablet and subsequent delivery system.", "Does this look like MCAS? ", "My failed attempt at bypassing drug additives I react with fatigue, mood swings, and other symptoms for hours from some prescription medication additives and dyes, so I thought about taking them as capsules so I can just open it and take the inside. I just had a gastro doc tell me that Ursodiol, my bile reflux med, is only available as a tablet at my dose. She will not increase my dose slightly to get the capsule version. My retail pharmacist said (about another another medication) that it cannot be compounded without these additives, and that the compounding pharmacy only crushes tablets to change the dose but you can open the capsule to bypass the additives of capsules. This is all because drugs come pre-made from the manufacturer. In addition, my (USA) health insurance only contracts with Walgreens, let alone a random compounding pharmacy. I am a person with very low income so that is how it is.\n\nIt is also funny that antihistamines can have dyes. What were they thinking?\n\nI hope this post makes sense lol Total sense. Some filler, I do not know what, makes it so I cannot sleep for about 8 hours after taking it. Every thing has dyes!  So frustrating. Dyes, flavors, perfumes, essential oils, whatever. I am allergic to so muxh because of these extras. What drives me nuts is that Epipens contain sulfites. I tried calling the manufacturer to discuss this with them and was told by some idiot that it is impossible to manufacture epinephrine without sulfites.\n\nWell someone tell my dentist, he has local anesthetic with epi and no sulfites! It is terribly frustrating! If you want, DM me with what you need and I can try too. That particular one sounds....impossible but another pair of eyes cannot hurt. \n\nLol @ antihistamines with dyes and additives. I had not ever thought of it but that is so wrong. Hah yep I am the same.  \nIt is so STUPID that they put these things in medicines designed to help treat the things the additives can trigger.  \n\n\nUnfortunately I have not found any solution.

We provide food that will not kill me and it is usually BYOB with friends, unless it is for a birthday or something special.

Play with our animals - doggo, bunny and mice. Or we find some fun project to do together, like building a large mouse inclosure. Golfing where I can ride in a cart for shade. During COVID, they accept the medical exemptions for masks, if needed, and friends ride in a separate cart so it does not matter so much if they have cologne on. Or just stay on the putting green and driving range. When my friends and I would meet, we would often do it just sitting in the backyard with a lantern on (like an electric one) and bring your own food/drink, or playing social video games inside someone is house.

My feet are frozen a lot of the time (even with wool-lined slippers), but I will still either overheat or be a normal temperature and sweat excessively relative to my situation. but my hands are always toasty, so I know it is not anxiety. I have to take breaks while washing dishes because I overheat so easily. i have been trying to figure out if this can be a version of dysautonomia, because the POTS thing does not really fit imo. i do give myself a high blood pressure if I have been talking, and other times I\"ve had an oddly low blood pressure for no real reason and felt quite faint.\n\nI also have chronic idiopathic urticaria, a normal level of environmental allergies that used to cause severe reactions but have reduced since moving, and cold-weather urticaria, pressure-sensitive urticaria and some form of exercise-induced vasculitis or some version of hives caused by heat/sweat.

It definitely could be, everything you listed is a symptom, but that is because MCAS is a multi-system disease. MCAS and POTS are common comorbid conditions, along with EDS and ADHD. In fact, Dr. Afrin hypothesizes that mast cells could be behind all aforementioned conditions. I would see if you can find a doctor who specializes in, or at least knows about MCAS and hopefully they can help you with some answers. Just saw this. MCAS patients typically follow a low histamine diet, usually based off the SIGHI list. Everything in chili is high histamine. That would make me have all the symptoms you described above. Tysm!!!! Ty!! I think what is been so annoying is that this has been multi-system and intermittent for so long it is kind of just all over the place? Like I do not have a good clear list of symptoms and triggers, or even like, daily issues. Sometimes things make my body flip out, sometimes they do not and there is no clear reason lmao. But I will definitely talk over it more with a doctor! Ty! The EDS/POTS/MCAD link sounds plausible. Additionally, excessive sweating and urination, along with very cold extremities (e.g. Raynaud's syndrome), are common effects of autonomic nervous system dysfunction, which is very common is that cluster of diseases. \ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96 more things to Google! I think part of this too is that it is felt...quite normal for a long time even though I have never ever seen anyone overheat as quickly/easily as I do. Do you know if the cold extremities can be intermittent? I worry that I am ~exaggerating~ bc I have such an unreliable memory. GUESS WHAT I DID TODAY.\nI woke up really groggy and felt super weak, so I finally got annoyed enough that after 45 minutes of exhaustion/confusion, I thought to Google how to take my pulse and I found that even when I am slightly reclined in my desk chair and not doing Anything my heart was still at around 90-100 BPM. Normally my resting heart is around 64-74. Finally!!! A concrete symptom!!!! I also have a Fitbit but it does not trend data over time which sucks. So I am going to get a notebook and write this shit down. In Raynaud's, exposure to cold can sometimes (but not always) trigger a vasoconstrictive effect (narrowing of the blood vessels) in the fingers or toes. This decreases blood flow and heat transfer to the extremity. Sometimes one, or a few, of the fingers/toes turn white.\n\nIt is associated not just with cold, but also with stress. That is, depending on the person, either one or both of those things can be known triggers. For me, both Raynaud's and the general phenomenon of icy-cold fingers is certainly quite intermittent, and it is dramatically more common in the winter. Huh! Is this why my feet never warm back up if I walk on a cold floor? Like, hours later, with my feet in a blanket and they are still cold/clammy. I do not think I have anything turning white tho, but I absolutely get the cold hands+feet combo when on the verge of an anxiety attack. The rest of my time my hands are Quite Hot and my feet vary. I am now at the point of taking pics when I sweat. Bc it is seriously like... I am wearing a t shirt and sweats, it is 73 degrees outside and 38% humidity and the windows are open, I went to go microwave some food and organize a notebook, and then I went to the bathroom, and upon washing my hands I notice that my face has rivulets of sweat. And about 15m later, I have still got some sweat on me. On the bright side, my resting is back to normal (72). Like am I really this weak?? Ffs I have hiked 56 miles in a week. And yeah, I sweat a lot and I was super uncomfortable and gave myself a full body rash my last day, but I feel like if I am able to do stuff like that, I should!!! Be able!!!! To do minor tasks without Overheating!!!! Yeah, I had the cold hands/feet for probably 15 years before I ever got the white digits. That said, having persistent cold extremities can be relatively normal depending on overall circulation and weight. But, y'know, stuff to research / maybe ask about. I really appreciate the help!

My family member has mast cell disease and gets severe adverse reactions to both Monteleukast and Zafirleukast. Zieluton is the only alternative for him. However, even after insurance did a formulary exception, the medication is still 800 a month (Tier 4). Insurance company will not do a tier exception for a drug that has been already given a formulary exception (we have already appealed multiple times). I have tried everything from looking at online coupons, contacting charity foundations, the local state prescription discount program, calling different pharmacies, even called the manufacturers multiple times (both generic and brand), no one can help. For those on Zileuton, how do you get it covered? Thank you. Your doctor has to state to the insurance company that there are absolutely no other medications in this drug class after trialing out the other two leukotriene inhibitors. Like the doctor has to explain to them that this drug is absolutely needed for you as a patient. It is literally the only way to get your insurance to be able to put it down to a tier for reasonable cost. \n\nI usually have to play back and forth with my insurance to cover it and usually when the doctor states to the insurance company itself ...they do an exception and approve and put it at tier 1 (or A ...which my company does). There are three generics for Zileuton ... however, keep in mind due to Zileuton being the only 5-alox inhibitor drug, they are relatively the same cost. It is Zyflo (brand name) that adds on to the already additional costly price. Thanks. Unfortunately Medicare does not allow a tier exception for a medication that has already been given a formulary exception so a tier exception is not going to happen. The doctor has appealed 3 times with very clear info that this medication is needed urgently, and why he cannot take the preferred drugs, but it keeps getting denied. We keep escalating it, but have been told that it will never be accepted due to Medicare rules which disallow tier exceptions for drugs which have received a formulary exception. So we have to find another way to get the medication covered. Can you maybe get Around this by having it compounded?", "Potassium and magnesium supplements that do not cause reactions I react to all food and soices except beef and ginger. As long as I get enough fat it seems to work (def not a cure, just helps a lot).\n\nBut my electrolytes must be supplemented (see keto diet). Salt causes no reaction, but I cannot figure out which potassium and magnesium supplements that will not cause a reaction. Any suggestions? I am doing really well with NATURELO Magnesium glycinate. However, it sources from plants so it might affect you. Are you working with anyone on introducing stabilizing medications and eventually introducing other foods? I was at 4 foods in March and now I am up to 35. \n\nI use Designs for Health NeuroMag but I was not able to introduce that until I had stabilizing medications on board. I am on Gastrocrom but have not really tolerated anything else, such as antihistamines and montelukast. I am waiting for my MCAS appt as I have almost given up on regular allergists. I do not have much hope about increasing tolerance to other foods, but I will be very grateful if it happens somehow. What country are you in? It took me quite a bit of trial and error to find the right doctors and medications. Regular allergists were suggesting things to me that could have killed me - i.e. allergy shots. Can pass along some names of you are in the US. \n\nThe absolute only thing I tolerated at the beginning was zyrtec - any other medication made me very sick including Gastrocrom. I lived in a bubble essentially - I could not tolerate any cleaning products or personal care items either. Was showering just with water. It was horrible. \n\nI started working with a mast cell specialist and began to introduce things VERY slowly. One thing per week. Stabilizing medications first. To introduce, over 7 days I do a skin test, lip test, tongue test, 1/8 serving, 1/4 serving, 1/2 serving, 3/4 serving, to 1 full serving only going up if tolerated. \n\nI did not tolerate any over the counter medication.

Hello, I have been told by my doctors that I currently am probably suffering from IAD and my pcp believes speaking with a psychiatrist will help me. For the last few months, I seem to have convinced myself that I have MCAS. Most of the problems I have experienced have been mild and not really life-altering. I have some stomach pain/issues, but it is not accompanied by severe diarrhea or severe constipation. I have some mild dermatographia, but it is not particularly bothersome, any other symptoms I may think I have are also mild. I am able to work and go outside normally without severe reactions even though I live around lots of animals, it is hot, and I work around lots of heat and chemicals. None of the things I have felt have been what I would describe as severe and recurrent in nature. I have Eoe which I have seen mentioned on this site as a common comorbid, but my doctors do not believe that to be the case. At this point, my eoe bothers me very little and I have not had much trouble with it in months after cutting dairy, despite not taking medicine for it. I have also seemed to have had it since childhood and I am almost 30 now. I have been to my allergist which has attended conferences on MCAS and he has assured me at least 3 times that it is highly unlikely I have any MCAD and that he feels further testing would be an unnecessary waste of my time and money. My PCP is also aware of MCAD and very clearly stated that he sees no reason for me to think I have it. During the appointment, he checked out my skin and palpated my liver and spleen. I have also had blood work done and everything has been normal. I have trialed myself for several weeks on both types of allergy medicines and have noticed very little difference in them versus off of them. I am beginning to believe that my doctors are right and I have an illness anxiety disorder and need help correcting it, but I still cannot shake the feeling that perhaps I suffer from a MCAD. I believe this stems from how I have read that many people are gaslighted by doctors and never test positive for the condition and that doctors do not know what to look for so they suffer for years. I have read the symptoms of IAD and admittedly I fit almost all of them. Is the IAD much more likely based on what I have written? Should that be my primary concern and I should try to move on from a MCAD as my doctors think I do not have one?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know this post may be insensitive, and I apologize, but this is something I cannot seem to get over or shake and I would like to know the opinions of people that actually have this condition. Thank you for posting this. It sounds like you are approaching this from a rational perspective and that is very encouraging.\n\nHere is how I like to think about it:  \nNo one's body works perfectly all the time. Bodies are extremely complex collections of interacting systems that are constantly self-correcting. Everyone will experience random symptoms and problems from time to time, and that is normal and usually nothing to worry about.\n\nSo, we tend to look at these kinds of things through two lenses:  \n1. Are you experiencing symptoms that are warning signs for a serious disease that might get much worse if it is not treated early? It sounds like the answer is probably not. And,  \n2. Are you experiencing symptoms that are causing you meaningful physical problems in your life?\n\nFrom the tone of your post, it sounds like the answer to #2 is also \"probably not\", but please feel free to correct me. If that is the case, then it sounds like the largest problem is that you are experiencing *worry* about a disease that is disproportionate to the actual risk or problems it is causing you. Does that sound right?\n\nIf so, then it would probably be useful to speak to someone who can help you deal with the worry. You both may or may not come to the conclusion that there is actually something physical going on. But if I misunderstood, please correct me! Yes, I believe those are both right. My doctors have listened to me fully and have tried their best to reassure me that what I am experiencing is nothing serious or life-threatening. My PCP stated that he never likes to tell people something is impossible, but he stated that he almost completely believes that I am okay and what I am feeling is due to an underlying anxiety problem. And its not as if they are blowing me off, my pcp and my allergist have both fully listened to me and told me the reasons why they do not believe I have a mcad. So everyone keeps telling me that what I am dealing with is from the anxiety and I am the only one that is afraid of having a mcad. \n\nThank you so much for your response. My pleasure. Good luck, friend. Reach out if there is anything I or the broader community can help with. I am not a Dr. but I can almost assure you that based on what you are saying, you likely do not have it. I think many of us can attest to the fact that our quality of life and abilities have been affected a substantial amount. Further, medications have likely saved all of us, so for you to say you are unaffected it makes me believe it is likely not MCAS. There is a stark difference between allergies and mast cell disorders, the latter being more systemic, debilitating, and chronic. I can pinpoint to you when in my life I started to have MCAS symptoms because my entire life quality changed, and I was suddenly not able to function as I used to. As OP said in a comment, no body is perfect. You can always expect that. But if you have something like MCAS, you will know. Even if you are not officially diagnosed, the symptom burden will clue you in. It can be truly miserable. That being said, I want to point out your insight is great! Also, bloodwork and tests can frequently be \u201call clear\u201d when there really is something wrong- this is NOT to say you have MCAS and these specific tests are wrong, this is to say that you should always advocate for your body and health and be persistent in your care. If in the future your symptoms worsen, always revisit with doctors. Best of luck! Okay, I will try my best to move on and pursue this with a mental health expert. Thank you so much for your response. I wish you the best! I agree with everything said here. It does not sound to me like MCAD, I do believe the anxiety disorder is the main issue you need to address. Like it was said if any symptoms or anything changes then it is time to reassess and see a doctor. When doctors were trying to figure out what was wrong with me my gp strongly suggested it was anxiety disorder. I said I did not think so but I would see a psychiatrist. I saw one for several visits and he concluded my symptoms were not related to anxiety or of my mind. So also if you are truly ill with a physical ailment a good psychiatrist should be able to pick that up I hope.  \n\nEither way it is no fun feeling not yourself or like garbage no matter the reason. BTW I have mcad caused by Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and for the longest time I was only effected minimally by symptoms I learned to live with and were normal to me. Always trust your gut you know you best. You seem like a logical person \n\nBest of luck, thanks for posting!\n\nEdit: word Thank you so much for your advice. I will definitely go see a mental health professional.  Look into mold illness mental symptoms No, I do not think I will. Thank you for your response though.", "Buspar making things worse? Has anyone else gotten sicker from taking Buspar? Tried it for my severe anxiety, but I think it is making things worse My daughter had more stomach symptoms when she was taking it. Wellbutrin did not get along with her stomach either. She is taking Prozac now and that seems to be better. Planning to try it soon\nSsri helps perfectly with my severe anxiety but I react to it", "Did anyone see the pricing for appointments with Drs. Afrin or Dempsey?? Mini rant: I am virtually uncontrolled right now (continues anaphylaxis despite countless medications) and am looking for a second opinion from a better trained specialist (not to diss my current doctor - she is great - but she is the only specialist in my state). I have had a hard time finding anyone and am willing to fly to see a specialty clinic somewhere so I looked into Drs. Afrin and Dempsey. Boy was I unpleasantly surprised when I received and email saying: 1) they are not accepting appointments within the next six months which is fair because of COVID and they are the experts, and 2) their appointments are $2,000!!! Um.. what?? For most MCAS patients, we have spent so much money on getting diagnosed (countless doctors,  special testing two or three times over, and medications) and now they want to charge us $2k to be graced with their presence? This is such malarkey. It feels borderline exploitative. I know I do not have to go see them (and I am not) but it seems so outrageous that the experts in a rare disease state are so inaccessible. For 2k I will have another hospital stay. The American health system is bonkers. That is crazy! I know my specialist does telehealth appts. Dr. Saperstein in Phoenix, Arizona. I hope you find some relief soon. Thank you! I know I will have to fly out somewhere for an initial visit, but if the docs can keep the treatment price reasonable I will swallow the travel costs. \ud83d\ude05 U have a specialist in MCAS in Phoenix? How can they charge that much?  Is not how much they can charge regulated?  I know I have talked to them but as they are East coast and I am West coast and there is a pandemic happening it is not feasible to fly out for treatment even if I could tolerate a flight of that length. But I would think insurance and regulations would limit the amount they can charge for services. I have no idea how that works. They probably justify it by their experience and the resources they use, but the tests are the same as any immunologist would do elsewhere. I am also really frustrated that the first line in the email I received was \u201cDr. Afrin spends much time with all his patients..\u201d. I do not think him taking his time with me is worth $2,000. Private enterprise, capitalism. I also see Dr. David Saperstein in Phoenix. He is excellent! One of the most compassionate, patient and talented doctors I have ever come across... and I have lived in 13 different states and have needed to see specialists my entire life. (I am 58 yrs old). His specialty is Neurology and he owns the Center for Complex Neurology. I live in Tucson, about 100 miles away, and because of COVID-19, I have not yet met him in person. All my visits with him and his two PAs have been virtual visits. The only downside is it took about 6 months to get my first appointment and the amount of paperwork I needed to fill out and send in before I even got the first appointment was excessive. However, it was worth it. I feel like he is a true partner with regards to my health and he is helping me with hEDS, MACS, POTS, and migraines. Good luck and take care! Thank you for the glowing recommendation! Yes. Dr. Saperstein specializes in EDS, MCAS and POTS. He is a neurologist. I am in the Old Pueblo as well! Yeah that is ridiculous. Well if anyone\u2019s in Minnesota I know one doc who takes normal insurance and another who takes about $350 per hour which is at least better than this racket Nice!  I was going to the Mayo but they no longer treat MCAS.  I also have POTS. Well, most doctors bill on 15 minute office visits and maybe he lumps in a bunch in order to get a comprehensive patient history but still, it should be something that is billed in a way that insurance covers so that the patient does not have to eat the cost.  Especially if patients are having to travel to see them in the first place.  Travel expenses are not going to be covered by most insurance plans so the patient is already out of pocket. Right - we all know our histories are what lead to our diagnoses, but if he is going to get records from us anyway then a typical records review is something all physicians do to prep for their patients. I feel like this is an exaggerated expenditure for something that is already expected of him and any other physician. Also they talk about providing insurance codes for reimbursement, not about how to get insurance involved in the from end. It just seems like a predatory thing to do. He is awesome. I live in Tucson but he is done all my appointments virtually. Nice to know I have an MCAS neighbor! Hit me up anytime, we may be able to share resources. Sounds good!  There is a few of us in Vegas. Well typically they would take your insurance first and see if you have coverage.  Almost all practitioners do for their own protection as having bills outstanding patients cannot pay is not what anyone wants.  If they charge over what your insurance covers they should let you know what that cost is upfront.  I pay through the nose for a secondary insurance but it means I can go anywhere I want  and as long as a penny is picked up by my primary  the secondary has to pay the balance.  So specialty hospitals like the Mayo clinic that charge extra fees are all covered.  So likely because of my insurance situation their costs would be covered by my insurance.  Travel, however would not be.\n\nPatients like us are going to require extra time because we are not cookie cutter.  Probably no two MCAD patients are alike.  Different triggers, different symptoms, varied history, different complicating factors, different reactions to medications.   That is why you want a doctor willing to sort it out. More importantly someone who knows how to sort it all out.  Not like those doctors grow on trees. While I agree with your points, I do have note that not everyone is in that same position. I recently had to leave my well-insured job (it was travel based and is now too dangerous due to both Covid and my health) for another position with an inferior insurance plan. I will have to attend treatment through the Mayo or Brigham and Women\u2019s or even a place like Dr. Afrin\u2019s office, but many of these research institutions have social workers that help identify a payment plans or at least do referrals for in-network providers. Moreover, these other services do not charge a $500 appointment fee. It just seems that there is a better way to help the patient and pay them for their time and expertise. Due to Afrin\u2019s super billing protocol, the patient is left out in the cold if insurance denies the visits due to a lack of coverage or a prior authorization. I do appreciate your perspective though. Oh I am not saying it is right at all.  I do not think it is right that only those that are rich or well insured can afford to go. But given they are a private practice and not a research hospital like most of the others you named they are not accountable financially as they would be self funding, not reliant on donors and grants.  With donors and grants comes an obligation to at least give a nod to social services, which is why those institutions have to help. Good point! I have heard from others that see him that he does not take insurance and everything is out of pocket. He is a pay-for-diagnosis doctor basically. He is guaranteed to give you treatment to see if it helps but if not you are out of thousands of dollars. That amount of money for a visit is a huge red flag. I would stick with the other recommendations you are receiving Hello all - In a moment of desperation I sought out Dr Afrin and paid the absurd fees for absolutely nothing in return. He is a very disagreeable guy, borderline rude, and seems to have a financial motivation behind everything he does. His office refused to release my lab work to my allergist until I came back and sat down with him (FOR $2,000). I had to legitimately threaten them with a damn lawsuit before they released them. They are quacks. The vitamins they try and sell in the waiting room should tell you everything you need to know. I am so sorry to hear about your experience! This is the exact thing I was worried about when I saw the email from his office. How are you managing now??", "I who also has multiple chemical sensitivity? I know I will probably never know but I am trying to figure out if b6 toxicity caused my multiple chemical sensitivity or iodine contrast dye and possibly mast cell and small fiber neuropathy please looking for opinions I was diagnosed with multiple chemical sensitivity when I first started having extreme allergic type reactions to seemingly everything before getting an MCAS diagnosis roughly two years later. A lot of the environmental abatement that I did for multiple chemical sensitivity has been useful for MCAS as well. I do think that a lot of these things are interrelated and/or hard to tease out. \n\nWhat kind of doctors are you seeing? What are your symptoms and diagnoses at this point in time? I do not really have answers for your questions, but my wife has MCAD and MCS. What is the difference between MCAS and multiple chemical sensitivity? What symptoms does she get? Does she know what caused it? I am not sure actually,I know mcs is not really recognized as an actual disorder by the medical community though I guess they are quite similar,most drs do not think mcs is a real disorder unfortunately. I have only seen a neurologist who is referred me to an allergist. My symptoms are burning mouth,small fiber neuropathy,twitching,anxiety depression,,any time I am around chemicals or perfumes cleaning products my skin burns my face and eyes will burn and tingle. See this all started after I had contrast dye but they also said I had slightly elevated b6 so idk what caused what \u2639\ufe0f Right now it is pretty severe. I am not exactly sure what all is MCAD, MCS, or her other issues. So, I will go through do not of the things I think she most relevant, but I am not sure how much is actually MCS. \n\nCurrently, she is bed bound can not tolerate fabrics, aside from the blanket she lays on and a sheet. So, she is unable to wear clothes off any kind.\n\nShe has constant smell triggers that she is hyper sensitive too. Things that most of us would not even notice give her raging head aches and head pressure. It also burns her nose. Everything I use has to be completely unscented (detergent, shampoo, dish soap, etc.). I need to do all cooking on the porch because the smell is to strong in the house.\n\nShe has very severe light sensitivity. We have to keep her room dark at all times and if the light must come on, she needs to cover her face. Likewise, sound can be a trigger.\n\nCurrently, she can only eat 3 foods. If she has something outside of that various things might happen. Her stomach will hurt as well as various parts of her body. She might break out in hives. Her head might hurt. She will become even more fatigued. \n\nSo, I guess in short: head aches, head pressure, fatigue, gi problems, nose burning, and hives. I think there is more, she just has not articulated then to me.\n\nWe do not know what caused it, but our best guess atm is a house she lived in when she was a kid. Jeeze I am so sorry,I do know a lot of people who say living in a house with mold made them incredibly sick,have you guys looked into functional medicine? Personally I have not but people keep suggesting it for these sorts of things Have you read Afrin's book yet? \n\nAlso, the Mast Attack blog has a long list of possible drugs.\n\nThe thing that intrigues me is that Gleevec works for a lot of people. But it is expensive as hell. Like $200 a month per Goodrx. I started it but did not get far. I need to get back into it. \n\nWe, thankfully, have just gotten a good team set up and are now on medications that seem to be doing good. My wife is drug resistant though, so we need to take it *very* slowly so it will be a long road to recovery. We have looked at a few functional medicine routes, or worked with doctors that integrate functional medicine into their treatments. I have tended to be a little more skeptical of these things, but she is a bit more open to them. \n\nAnd yeah, I am not sure if mold was the issue at her childhood house - but we just dropped 6 grand to get mold removed from our house. She did not become bed-bound till we moved here, so we are pretty sure it was at least a factor - and there was a lot of it. When talking to doctors about MCS (UT San Antonio refers to a similar diagnosis as Toxicant Induced Loss of Tolerance or TILT), I used the free self-assessment on the UT San Antonio website  and also tried to get a consult with UT San Antonio. \n\nUltimately a naturopath did the original testing for my IG serums and histamines and other immune issues which I then took to and immunologist/allergist MD in my insurance network to get the diagnosis. \n\nI got nowhere by going to a neurologist (I have some similar symptoms to you especially with the environmental reactions) or allergist without the self-assessment (I did them once a month to have kind of a progression of symptoms), extensive documentation and pictures when possible of my daily symptoms, and the tests from the naturopath - he was the most willing to do the less run of the mill tests. The immunologist/allergist initially wanted to do only skin prick allergy tests until it was clear that it was a larger systemic issue and I was armed with proof.\n\nBest of luck on your journey - it is definitely not easy. Feel free to ask any questions or DM me. Thanks I appreciate I might send a message over to you now! I am 65. I spent most of my life not knowing what was wrong and having to wing it with natural remedies and diet and lifestyle changes. I have to find a doc and get a formal diagnosis and treatment plan. Right now I use montelukast and OTC meds. My wife is taking Ketotifen and Pepcid. She also is taking Ativan (which helps with the attacks), and then Potassium, Vitamin D, and Fluoxetine.\n\nMontelukast is on our radar but we have not tried it yet because we were concerned about the possible mental health side effects since she already struggles with depression. There is an alternative to montelukast that has lower psych effects: Zafirlukast. But the other side effects might outweigh that.\n\nI have a lifelong history of depression and the montelukast is not affecting me. I am not taking anything for depression either. \n\nGood news for me is I have an appt for the covid vaccine on the 26th. Once I get that done I will call up my allergist and start going down the MCAS testing and treatment rabbit hole. BTW I have a list of treatments ( I went thru the Mast Attack blog and put them in a spreadsheet for easy reference. You can copy it and then note what works and what does not. \n\nThere are other sheets in the workbook, it is a work in progress. I add to it as time permits. Thanks! I just requested access to it :)\n\nAnd that is awesome I hope it goes well! \n\nWe were really confused and discouraged for a while because she had MCAD symptoms but her Tryptase was normal. Then we got a new PCP and she tested the Methylhistamine and it was elevated so we were able to proceed.\n\nI am also glad the Montelukast is working for you and not giving you any issues! That is awesome :) Try it now. It worked! Thanks! I need to come up with a list of diagnostic tests that can be performed. I get the impression that not everyone knows about the various tests and some of the tests are very specialized. In Afrin's book he had to insist on special staining on biopsies. Yeah, there is a lot of disagreement between physicians. My wife's Tryptase came back and one allergist was like, \"looks like you do not have it.\" and then that was it. \n\nWe have better specialists now lol. I figure I would start with my regular allergist, whom I see almost never, and ask him to start the process or refer me to someone else. Problem is I live in a semi rural area so I might have to travel a bit.", "New mast cell trigger found!  \n\nHey, I have done a lot of research and finally figured out what kept causing my severe reactions! Before I tell you about the reactions that made me so desparate that I did not know better than researching for my life: 1. We bought a new brand of mineral water and I got a severe reaction lasting for 2 days. 2. Although brokkoli is one of my 6 safe foods a few days a go I started reacting to it! I thought that I could eat nothing anymore! Although brokkoli and bottled water seem to have nothing in common both times I realized a slightly sweet taste that was a bit disgusting but did not keep me from eating/ drinking it. However I just found the common cause: Acetaldehyde!\n\nReaction 1: Acetaldehyde can migrate from the PET bottle to water:\n\n(\n\nReaction 2: Acetaldehyde content increases in brokkoli when brokkoli is stored in a controlled atmosphere with low O\\_2/CO\\_2 ratio in order to prevent it from getting yellowish. Especially in summer this is a wide spread method in food industry. This can lead to what is called \"off-flavor\" according to this scientific paper which explains why the brokkoli I ate tasted sweet.\n\n(\n\nIn order to make the story complete: Here is the article saying that acetaldehyde triggers histamine release in human mast cells:\n\n(\n\nI really hope that I could help you and motivate you to do research and figure out your triggers! Can you drink alcohol? No I cannot. Very cool!!! I love this kind of medical puzzle solving - when I am not the puzzle. :) Interesting. In people with alcohol intolerance, a genetic mutation (change) makes ALDH2 less active or inactive. As a result, their bodies cannot convert acetaldehyde to acetic acid.\n\nIf you can sometimes have alcohol, but other times not have alcohol, then I would disagree that Acetaldehyde is a problem.  The Ethanol in alcohol would cause production of Acetaldehyde in the body.  However, not being able to have alcohol, given your other dietary limitations does not mean anything to me either.\n\nHave you had a genetic test for ALDH2? What is ALDH2? I cannot drink alcohol either, the amount I injest also seems directly correlated to how much pain I will be in after too.... So what you are saying seems to make sense. Aldehyde dehydrogenase, mitochondrial is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the ALDH2  gene located on chromosome 12. This protein belongs to the aldehyde dehydrogenase family of enzymes.\n\nMore details here: &lt; \n\n\n\n*This comment was left automatically (by a bot).

That has nothing to do with mast cell reactions. \nI am not genetically intolerant to alcohol via the ALDH2 path, yet it is a mast cell reaction trigger for me, very unfortunately. \nIt  depends on whether a substance stimulates your mast cells to dump it is contents inappropriately, which in this case it sounds like the acetaldehyde is. ALDH2 is a gene that encodes the enzyme that oxidizes (adds an oxygen) to acetaldehyde.  The addition of the oxygen molecule turns acetaldehyde into acetic acid.  \n\nPeople with a mutation in ALDH2 that slows the conversion of acetaldehyde into acetic acid will have more acetaldehyde moving around in their blood after any activity that increases acetaldehyde. \n\nSince consuming alcohol will increase acetaldehyde, I asked if they could tolerate any alcohol.\n\nGoogle search lists of foods that are high in acetaldehyde if for whatever reason (slow ALDH2 gene, etc.) you need to avoid acetaldehyde. If the op said, \"I can drink alcohol\", then I doubt they have a problem with acetaldehyde alone.  Regardless of the mechanism in the body, if they can consume something that will increase acetaldehyde in the body, the problem is not acetaldehyde. I do not doubt your observations.  However, the hypothesis (acetaldehyde is triggering a mast cell release of histamine and that causes your health problems) is not fully supported by the observations.  You need more evidence.\n\nYes, a slow ALDH2 gene would leave more acetaldehyde in the body for longer periods of time.  So, if acetaldehyde is triggering a mast cell histamine release, then the extra acetaldehyde from the slow ALDH2 gene would add to the problem. Doh. Now I get what you are saying. Sorry, trying to think critically with migraine is not always my strong point", "Anyone Else Cannot Tolerate Ketotifen? Man i tried for a week every time i took it i was reacting but i just pushed through it cause i wanted it to work. I quit 2 days ago and know recovering from the flair it caused... Anyone else not able to take it? It just made me tired. I think I took 1mg nightly My wife tried it initially at 2 MG and it did *not* go well. We actually ended up trying .1 MG 4x a day which was much more doable. Doing it that slowly helped her to tolerate it and we have been building slowly ever since. We are about to go to .24 MG 4x a day. \n\nShe still has some reactions when we up it, but its been worth it to try it super low and slow. I am so sorry it has not worked for you. I started at 1MG with zero side effects besides salty residue around my eyes like I would been crying. 3MG at night and 1MG extra for a flare and life is almost livable. Oh how I wish it made me tired. I have never gotten any of the much-wanted sedation from antihistimes. Same. Before ketotifen, essentially every food made my stomach bloat up with so much gas that seemed to crush my spine like a boulder.  Had to make myself puke all the time to get rid of it. Foul. K dog made life livable.", "Vague symptoms, do they count? I want to ask you guys about symptoms, that are not clear enough to call them \"abdominal pain\", \"diarrhea\", \"malaise\", \"malabsorbtion\" and all the other names you can find in articles about MCAD or your doc's interview. \n\nI mean, besides major flares of disease, when symptoms rather falls to above categories, do you have chronic symptoms, but vague enough to not feel like... I do not know how to name it better - real symptoms?\n\nFor example, I have almost constant feeling that something is not quite right with my body (like when I have a flu and my body temperature could rise in every moment, though it is normal right now). Or I feel like usual, but everything I do is a little bit more tiring than should be. I can be months without flare and yet still feel that very low-grade... something.\n\nAnother example, I can have a little more red and swollen arms, but my doc would not call it \"flashing\", only I see the difference. I may have hyperacidity, but it is on the verge of feeling. Something is not quite right with my GI tract, but probably for a doctor it would not be a \"symptom\" at all, cause it is so mild, though chronic. And these things are totally chronic, although they do fluctuate because of weather changes and high humidity. I can feel weak and lightheaded, but I do not have arrythmia or low pressure, or any other symptom at all. \n\nSo, when I avoid my triggers, I constantly feel being just on the verge of health. I try to have a lot of exercises and eat healthy, perhaps other people woudn't say I am still sick... And time passes by, and I still have this backround, low-grade feeling of chronic illness.\n\nIs this what you experience, too? Do you think it is MCAD related?\n\nPS I think I could make some strange grammar mistakes, because I am not a native speaker. Sorry, guys! I felt like that for many years, then my symptoms got worse and became more obvious. They used to come and go, but they have been constant for years now. Thank you for your reply. I suppose this is how it is with this illness, but sometimes these symptoms are so vague that I am not sure. Yes yes yes!! This exactly. I went to the doctor last year I think and she could not find anything wrong with me, but I said I just have this constant feeling that there is just something not quite right. So much of the time I have various symptoms that are unpleasant enough to make me feel crappy a lot of the time, but they are so nonspecific and stuff that it is always hard to put my finger on it. I am just so so sure I have some chronic illness but am also constantly invalidating myself (other ppl have it worse etc etc) to the point where I really do not know what to think. Yes! \"Unspecific\" is the word. And yet it does not say anything about how you feel or about all the things you can not do because of it.", "Anyone get burning gums or tip of tongue?  For me that is a food reaction and a sign to stop eating whatever is causing it. I also get a very sore tongue during some airborne reactions. Only mine started with a burning tongue and whole mouth.  Now I have whatl)) seems to be some sort of red \"fever blister\" on my tongue and cheek.  I do not 'see' my Dr until Monday.  Hopefully he can tell me something. Wow! I had not even thought of a food reaction.  Then again, I now have an actual sore.  And No idea what food could mess with me like this. \ud83e\udd74 The sores I get are usually small white bumps, transient lingual papillitis. Sometimes I will get bigger canker sores on the underside of my tongue. A little bit of powdered alum sprinkled on the sore and then rinsed off seems to help with the bigger ones. Yeah. Though, if you are getting painful gums in the morning, it may be a sign of acid reflux. I got this from drinking a few boost drinks,no idea what is in them that causes that reaction It is so frustrating and it feels like your tongue is on fire but when I look at it there is nothing there it makes no sense Ah true I have read that &gt; The sores I get are usually small white bumps, transient lingual papillitis.\n\nI had a couple of episodes where that happened to every papillae on my tongue all at once and lasted for over a week. It was among the more painful experiences I have ever had... That sounds really painful, I am sorry that happened to you. Thanks... a super restricted diet seemed to do away with those kinds of mouth issues for me. So far, at least (fingers crossed).\n\nI am sorry that you still deal with canker sores and the like. They are not fun. Mine were better, then after I would been on xolair a while, food started smelling like food again and I started trying some of the foods I had been reacting to. I figured out I can have palm oil again, does not sound very appetizing but it really expanded my food choices. I can eat a bite or two of peanuts  but then I get the mouth blisters, which is better than anaphylaxis which is what used to happen. That is really interesting. I cannot eat any oil at all other than tiny bits of a couple animal fats, but I have not tried xolair yet. Thanks -- maybe there is still hope :) I used to get a very sore tongue and geographic tongue from eating stuff I was allergic to. It was like an early warning system to stop eating the thing immediately.", "Do H1 antagonists (anti-histamines) lower the number of mast cells if used daily? I keep reading this \"fact\" on health websites but they are notorious for pseudoscience. Does anyone know if they really work like this? Can they lower they number of mast cells in your body over time? I have never heard that, and it does not really make sense, because the most common mast cell disease, MCAS, does not involve an increased number of mast cells.  If h1s decreased your mast cells, it would be a problem for people who did not have an increased number.  I certainly do not intimately understand antihistamines and how they work on a cellular level, but my understanding is antihistamines just block histamine receptors... They do block histamine receptors but mast cells have histamine receptors too. I am wondering if that might be the method of action.  ??? why would inhibiting the docking of histamine to a receptor destroy a mast cell? It can help stave off the feedback loop of histamines being released and then causing more mast cell activation. \n\nIt does not kill the mast cells though. That does not make any sense. No. They do not do this or antihistamines would have never been released to the public, they would have killed people over time. Or they would be marketed as immunosuppressants which they are not. \n\nThere is no mechanism of action I can think of where this would occur. \n\nThe way h1s help with mcas is by blocking histamine which is very helpful and could maybe at least slightly prevent other mast cells from activating too- which would slightly increase the number of mast cells in the body. I find this unlikely too. It is most likely it literally just blocks histamine and has no other effects. Very little. It stops them from activation so new mast cells not made and recruited. It does not make them to die, mast cells live several years. Interesting. What are some things that cause mast cells to be made? I think injury is one, right? Do you die when someone covers your eyes? Oh is THAT why reactions can change over time?  These lil fuckers live as long as a cat?\n\nAlso, so this means that they *do not* die when they degranulate, right?  For some reason I thought that, though I totally think it is a thought I made up because I cannot remember ever actually reading it Injury causes degranulation, I do not think it causes new mast cells to be made. Yes, degranulation is release of granules full of histamine and other substances tnf-a, tryptase. It is called by igE antibodies, igG, allergens.\n\nApoptosis is cell death, not this time ) Long living bastards\nThat is why there is Cytoreductive therapy - cell killing therapy to lower numbers if their number is too high in mast cell leukemia (many mast cells)\n\nWe have normal level of cells that degranulate too much.\n\nAlso friends like eosinophils and basophils act like mast cells too) Do overactive mast cells contribute to eosinophils and basophils being overactive?  Every winter when the heat gets run consistently I stop being able to swallow, and  know that is eosinophils, not mast cells technically, but is there any kind of causal relationship between them? If anything they made my mast cells go crazy when I stopped taking it. Horrible horrible withdrawal.", "Do I have it? I have not been diagnosed but my recent symptoms are mainly chills, hives, nausea, stomach pain and really dry lip (just the top lip). I also get really cold hands and feet. I cannot seem to figure out what is causing the daily hives and it even happens overnight. I do know I have an allergy to dust mites but I have never reacted this badly before. I used to be able to vacuum the house without wearing a mask but I do now because I am afraid I might have a flare up. I also get hives sometimes after exercising and showers or even after eating. So there is no pattern other than it keep happening. My allergist diagnosed me with chronic uticaria and send me off with daily antihistamines. I did get a positive result for ANA 1:160 homogenous so now I am afraid I have an autoimmune disorder. The first time things went downhill was in July 2020 when I was developing dyshydrotic eczema on my hands. Then in September, my body just crashed and I started feeling extreme fatigue, nausea, stomach pain, headaches. This is all unusual for me because I was a healthy person before this and never had these symptoms before. I thought it was just stress but it never went away and just recently (starting January 2021) I started getting the allergic response (hives). So I am just wondering is this all piling up to be a MCAS? And what test will confirm it? Also, has anyone seen a functional doctor for this and how has that experience been for them? Your immunologist/allergist should be testing for it if they think its MCAS. Cannot know for sure based on this. You sure it is not just allergies? Allergies can get worse. Either way you can treat them with antihistamines, mast cell stabilizers, etc. Treatment for mast cell works for allergies too.  Not sure about chronic urticaria but I assume it is all in the same family of symptoms and treatments. \n\nOnly thing that sounds more specific to mcas is hives after exercise. After showering you could be reacting to something in the shower. You should test and find out- if you remove shampoo or soap or use lukewarm water instead of hot, if it is different. I have never had allergies before so all these symptoms are new to me. It very well could be a new allergy that I developed though. Is body temperature change related to MCAS? That is the only thing I can see for the shower and exercise hives. But yeah, I definitely have been trying to do a lot of trial and error but have not found any consistent triggers yet. Yes sometimes temperature change causes hives in mcas but again, unless you are using no products at all in the shower, there is a big chance you have an allergy to some ingredients. It is very common for people to have allergies to shampoo for instance. \n\nIt is infinitely easier to get tested for allergies than MCAS and will definitely be covered by insurance. In the same way you can develop MCAS at any time you can also develop allergies at any time so it does not matter if you were not allergic before you need to get tested again if you have all these hives. \n\nAlso you should follow up on the autoimmune thing because that could indicate it is something completely different from allergies or mcas. Not sure what that test is though not an expert. \n\nI am allergic to dust mites and have had to get a foam bed with air pillows it is so bad so it is probably the dust allergy causing reactions overnight unless you do some kind of product before bed. \n\nAnd again if the allergies do not pan out, that is when you investigate this more. Got To rule out other stuff first.\n\nIt is great that you are thinking through alternate diagnoses and doing trial and error exposure to things though. That will steer you well as you figure this out. Thanks for the really helpful info. Yeah, I am wondering if it is something to do with environmental allergies. I am having a hard time thinking it is just allergies since I have all the other non hives symptoms. That is fair. You know your body best. I just have to point out that allergies include symptoms like nausea, headaches, fatigue, chills, dry skin, stomach pain. That is why it is a good idea to do testing for one or both conditions. Heck some people like me have both. There is a huge overlap in symptoms because literally both conditions involve mast cells releasing their contents as the end problem, they just have different causes for those end symptoms. For allergies it is specific things, for mcas it is literally any scent, pressure, I mean I cannot breathe outside air without having a reaction because it is not that I am allergic to something specific it is that there is a lot in the air generally to react to in the weird way mcas does. Neither mcas nor allergies happen randomly though so it is good to figure out what you are reacting to and avoid it. Great points. How do you handle your triggers and sensitivities? Especially the ones you cannot avoid due to MCAS?", "Presyncopes and hot weather Hi! Today I got presyncope because of hot weather. I was feeling so ill, had this tight feeling in my chest and feeling of \"tired\" heart, so I had to call ambulance. Earlier when this happened I ate chocolate, then I had to go to toilet twice, and after that I felt tingling in my legs and weakness all over. I had to lay down, but I still felt that way. I had the same feeling of something really bad going to happen, that when I had anaphilactic reaction few years ago. But today, when paramedics looked at my life parameters, they said everything's fine, I am just nervous (because I had blood pressure 140/75 and pulse 100). I was pretty sure I was not nervous, just suddenly it was \"too much\", because of this hot weather I suppose... Sorry for my English, I am not a native speaker. Anyway, I did not have flushing, just these feelings. Anyone can relate to that? Is it mast cell related (I have mastocytosis) or rather something else, what do you think? I am a bit more familiar with mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), but its also a mast cell disease. With MCAS, Presyncope is common and is often a symptom of anaphylaxis. Hot and cold weather are also triggers for mast cell issues. While I am not 100% sure how it affects mastocytosis, they are both definitely things that could be affected by mast cells. So its very possible your issues were caused by your mast cell disease, but I am not a doctor, and I could not say for sure. If you are being treated for your mastocytosis, I would make sure to follow up with your doctor that treats it and let them know of your symptoms.\nEdit: To add to this, gut issues, like your having to go to the bathroom, and pain/tightness in the chest, combined with the presyncope, definitely sounds like symptoms of anaphylaxis, often caused by mast cell diseases. Thank you so much for your answer. I think mastocytosis can be quite similar to mcas. Being accused of being nervous or anxious has happened to a lot of us. It is an easy go-to for people who do not understand mast cell disorders, and I have had it said to me more than once. I was even told to see a psychiatrist (before my diagnosis by a helpful and more up-to-date doc). Not all medical people have any idea what is going on with mast cell stuff.\nI believe you. You were not nervous, you were in the middle of a biochemical reaction that they did not understand. A lot of medical people have NO background in mast cell disorders.\nBy the way (and maybe you already know this, if so, sorry for repeating the obvious) but, if you are already stressed (ie: hot weather), your mast cells are not going to approve of chocolate, which is a histamine liberator. Check this out if you have not seen it before, it might help:   \nI wish you the best. Thank you so much for your support, it is very reassuring to know there are people who understand me (though I am really sorry it is because of you being ill, too). Yes, that chocolate was a big mistake. Thing to do is get a baseline tryptase and the next time you have an episode get another tryptase test. I get cholinergic urticaria and dysautonomia symptoms (in addition to blood pooling) in hot weather. I even have had anaphylaxis too. Anytime above 85F ~30C for extended prolong periods it happens. Xolair has drastically improved this but it happens randomly dependent on other exogenous factors.\n\nI have mastocytosis too btw. 24 hour urine is probably the best test, random urine is the best test for a flare up. \nThat is the only marker that came up in the last 2 years. I think it is called n-methylhistamine (sp?) \n", "Update: Help me fix my night time sleep crapola. Hey, this is a less whiny post cuz I am actually okayish at least in this moment. \n\nBut I am just wondering if anybody has conquered the Sleep double that I seem to have to deal with on a nightly basis, and the tldr of all of that is, restless leg, itching, and eventually anxiety if I do not start getting into a restful sleep within a couple of hours.... It seems like sleep is an utter chore.  So I am looking for maybe someone who has figured out some sort of I do not know, process that works for them including medications and whatever else.\n\nI will give you an example of last night. I just rotated between symptoms, and I just could not f****** get to bed for hours and then by the time I did I suspect it was like five or six or seven in the morning.\n\nThat means my sleep is severely limited because I woke up at like 11:30 a.m. and was just hit with massive fatigue.\n\nI had constipation and diarrhea at the same time I guess. But also just this revolving itching that I could not get rid of until finally I took a shower and completely scrubbed myself with soap and a washcloth.\n\nThe problem is this creates a vicious cycle because I know that alcohol is bad for me and I need to quit everybody says. I do not drink everyday, but I will tell you what, that is the one thing that when I have massive fatigue which is just going to cause more anxiety if I sit there and try and force myself to go back to sleep most of the time.  I do not know if I explained that well. The alcohol, when I am at a loss of sleep, will put me back to sleep, but then after I get back up even though I feel rested I have to deal with other issues like anxiety, maybe prolonged fatigue the next day, weirdness in my eyes etc and I do not want to have to rely on it at all I want to cut it out.\n\nSo that is what I ended up doing today. Yes I know I should not, but I do not know what else to help to do cuz I have not got anything but my normal meds, that means the chromolin, that means claritin, and that means tagamet.\n\nSo I got back to sleep, after eating something I probably definitely should not have eaten but it was delicious, and now I have this anxiety so I worked out for about 40 minutes worked up a nice sweat, drinking a bunch of water ate some fruit...\n\nBut I got to get leveled off so that my sleep is okay.\n\nSo what are you guys taking? \n\nRight now I have hydroxyzine which makes me feel like crap and then gives me massive fatigue the next day, so I am basically laying down for a couple of hours extra when I should be up and active, and then possibly at night that could make me more awake and have trouble falling asleep.\n\nMy family doctor who does not know much about Mast Cell Activation Syndrome also prescribed me buspirone in an emergency, and I took it once, did not notice much of a reaction and did not notice it helping me much but by that time I was already in the s*** from missing a complete night of sleep. that is the only thing that was going to help at that point was to add event which also works really well to knock me out, but then is super addictive, and also gives me massive fatigue the next day.\n\nBut I looked up the and it says it actually is not good for MCAS. \n\nI tried ranitidine, but I think that when I took that it increased the episodes of my insomnia cuz it seemed like the two nights that I ended up taking it both were absolutely terrible.\n\nI do not want drugs that are going to make me sleepy, the idea behind the Buspar is that for some people it can just shut their mind off and let them kind of relax on their own. That is ideally what I am looking for.\n\nI would like a drug that does not induce tiredness or fatigue, but just lets me sleep I do not care if it is a natural supplement, or a prescription medication. There seem to be so many medications I do not like. Including supplements. I do not like valerian, I do not like melatonin, I do not know that magnesium does anything to me whether it works or not, sometimes in the past I think it made my restless leg syndrome worse and gave me back pain if I took it too much... I read about aspirin's therapy but I have the sneaking suspicion that aspirin after one or two days will actually induce back pain as well and sort of a weird toxic feeling in my body.\n\nAlso, how do I get rid of this incessant f****** itching at night!!!!!???\n\nI will tell you what, if I did not have to itch so much in the night time, if I did not have restless leg, that would improve my sleep probably by 50% or more just alone. And for me a 50% improvement is a gigantic improvement!!  am I just going to have to take a shower every night and scrub myself? sometimes my fatigue is kind of bad and I just want to get to bed I do not have the energy for a shower. \n\nI also know I have to change up my food and somehow start eating like one thing at a time until I figure out what I react to and what I do not and I have no clue as if to where do I start.\n\nWhat do I just eat white rice everyday for a while? Do I just start with potatoes everyday? I mean how do I do this?\n\nAdvice from anyone who has gone through this nonsense and seems to have it conquered a little bit?\n\nThanks in Advance! - Use a second-gen H1 antihistamine. Hydroxyzine is a first-gen and it is very common to wake up groggy afterwards.\n\n- If you do indeed have MCAS, get on a mast cell stabilizer. Cromolyn if you can. Quercetin otherwise since it is available OTC. There is no substitute for a stabilizer that I know of: it is a critical piece of the puzzle.\n\n- If ranitidine does not work for you, try another H2 like famotidine.\n\n- Alcohol is a no-go. People who are affected by it tend to have knock-on effects for up to several weeks afterwards. Think of it this way: you drink to fall asleep now, and in return you microwave your nervous system for 14 more days. You will have to break the cycle at some point.\n\n- If you have not already, restrict your diet to remove trigger foods. If you are still drinking alcohol, having foods with vinegar, or eating spicy food or dairy without having definitively determined that you can tolerate them, you are setting yourself up for failure.\n\n- Get the Headspace app and use the Sleepcast feature, or find another guided sleep meditation that works for you. Note that sleep meditations differ dramatically from daytime meditations.\n\nThere are decent odds that the combination of these approaches coule provide meaningful relief. Let us know if you need more details, e.g. on the medication options, or on materials to give your doctor, or on how to isolate trigger foods.\n\nGood luck! I do not have trouble sleeping but I pass out around 8 or 9 most nights so maybe if I tell you what knocks me out that might help. I use weed as a mast cell stabilizer. It is more effective than most of my meds.  Other than the weed, ketotifen and rupall have been the most helpful for me with flushing and itching. They do not have any impact on my awakeness. Another alternative would be Notriptyline. That one I take at bed time and it makes you sleepy. That one helped with flushing and itching too. It also was a fame changer for my POTS. Do you have itching all the time or just when you get into bed? Cannot do the weed. Wish I could. It gives me severe anxiety that will fuck me up for months and set off manic episodes. I only notice it when I am going to bed, I may have it during the day but I do not really care if I do or not so it is not that big of a deal. Makes sense. I get itchier if I get bored, ffs. Was just going to say make sure your laundry detergent is you-friendly and has not changed ingredients. Oh Jesus that too? It is like every little thing that I have to deal with, and actually I was going to update my answer.\n\nI noticed the after I work out and my sweat dries up a little bit, that I start the itch too what am I allergic to my f****** self? lol Ha! I am going to bet your laundry products are not helping. They leave trace amounts in your clothes...sweating reactivates them...and yeah, itch city. Of things to switch out, though, it is easy. No rx! Everyone is different on what they can handle. I used Seventh Generation unscented for years and now it gives me hives. All Free &amp; Clear seems fine so far. This at the grocery store? Oh wait. ALL\n\nnevermind. Duh! Eek that does not sound good. I would try the actual meds then. Whenever my sleep is messed up my mcas goes crazy so I can only imagine how annoying this is for you. Terrible.\n\nthat is what I am working on and it seems to be a hell of a grind, finding the right medicine. Lexapro seemed to help but it made me fat like put on 30 or 40 lb overnight. Epsom salt baths help me. I started lower amount in the water and not too hot. Played around until i found what felt best. The magnesium in the epsom salts is a life saver to me. hey_look_its_shiny has a lot of good advice here. And I second the alcohol warnings. As disappointing as it may be, alcohol just is not good for us MCAS peeps. Whether or not you 'tolerate' it in a food sense, it is a big diamine oxidase suppressor. Your body needs to generate diamine oxidase to metabolize histamine, or hello itching or migraines or tachycardia or depression or other symptoms (histamine can set you up for a lot of unpleasant side effects either by itself, or triggering mast cells to degranulate, dumping any number of crazy-making chemicals into your system). No offense meant, but dump the alcohol. Seriously. Ecos unscented/sensitive might be an option too. It seems fairly clean. yeah I run out of Epsom salt and then I do not buy it for months LOL I need to actually keep a bunch of Epsom salt on hand at all times Costco!! If u have a membership or know someone who does you can get huge amounts for great price. Lol. So easy to run out though. Enjoy a few too many baths &amp; suddenly so sad- empty bag \ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd2a I have a buddy with a Costco card. I just have to get him to come with me, unless of course I can just borrow his car but I do not know they probably have a picture on it or something.  Adding to not take quercetin at night. Its has caffeine-like psycho-stimulant effects. Yeah this is good stuff. I do not know why somebody would downvote this post though cuz it can help me but I can also help other people if they look for it so I do not know what the deal is with Reddit why someone would be like hating on this post\nI am sure it was not you, but anyway yeah really good stuff this is exactly what I am trying to look for is how I can help myself with this stuff.\n\nI suspected about that alcohol that it was doing something like that cuz yes it will help me sleep but then the next day my eyes might feel weird, or I will have extra fatigue that does not wear off.\n\nAnyway, yeah I will definitely do my best to stay away from it I just wanted to get my f****** sleep stabilized so I will ask my doctor about famotidine.\n\n**Materials to give my doctor**\n\nYes please! Oh great lol. I took some at about 10:00 Yeah, that explains my absolutely massive anxiety that I get after drinking, or just feeling like it is the end of the world depressed.  I am able to bypass those feelings somewhat because I know that they are not real, in the sense that there is something mentally wrong with me so to speak, and that it is just my body reacting, but still it is a pain in the ass.\n\nall right I am going to really really really really really try to quit the alcohol I just need something to save me on the nights, where I cannot get enough sleep.\n\nif I only get four or five or six hours of sleep a night, I have massive fatigue the next day and it really really affects me in a bad way whether or not I have alcohol and that is why I drink it period because I do not want to sit there with knots in my head and in my eyes, feeling tired and fatigued and then when I try to lay back down and get some more rest my body starts to shoot into panic mode. And I have only found it two options, one is Ativan which just leaves me with absolutely massive fatigue afterwards, and I do not want to get addicted to it, or alcohol. If there is a third option I am all ears Oh and I love spicy food.\n\nFor lunch today I had a breakfast pizza but I cut up onions and hot peppers and mushrooms and put it on it.\n\nI frequently make stir fry with hot peppers as well, so basically what no more hot peppers?  Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Oh yeah one more question. Added to my list of questions in the comment below, we were trying amitriptyline because I heard it can help with last cell and also anxiety symptoms as well, and I took a very tiny dose of it but it seems like both things I took it it ruined my sleep. It could have been coincidence, I am not sure, and I am just wondering if there is another sort of medication like that, lexapro, amitriptyline, etc that will help.\n\nIt seemed like the Lexapro was helping when I started on that, but then I gained a bunch of fat. I might have mentioned that in the above post. I have found that the site: mastattack.org is helpful. Here are a couple of pages that may be the most relevant:\n\n\nThe first link is an overview of some of the mechanisms, the second link is to a page on treatments taken from Lawrence Afrin's recommendations, probably from his book \"Never Bet Against Occam\" (about MCAS). The usual disclaimers about getting a doctor's assistance apply. \nAnd apparently, timing matters. 10pm or thereabouts, the body starts ramping up histamine production for the night. \nYou have my sympathy. I did a two week insomnia stint from an exposure to a nasty trigger. It was miserable and landed me in the hospital. And I recognize the 'feeling of doom' for no reason. Been there. I got rescued by an allergist and an excellent functional medicine doc. It took some time and patience and now I am on OTC Loratadine and Famotidine daily, low histamine diet with occasional forays into skipping a day or two of food. (allows your body to clear all the excess histamine out, but is not an option if you are too thin.) An occasional low-dose benzodiazipine, and/or occasional dose of full-spectrum CBD oil. (I hear that if you do not tolerate that, some MCAS can tolerate CBD isolate - but it is more expensive.) One of the biggest problems people with MCAS face is that it was not even recognized until 2007. Hang in there, we all have to keep reading up on this stuff. Get your doc (if you like your doc) to help you figure out the meds. If you do not like your doc, try finding one who is a solid functional medicine practitioner - the kind who has both the conventional medicine degree and a functional med cert on top of it. Or a really top-flight allergist.\nGood luck. I hope you find some answers that help. **I found links in your comment that were not hyperlinked:**\n\n* (\n\n*I did the honors for you.*\n\n***\n\n^( ^| ^( ^| ^&lt;3 I have struggled with sleeplessness my whole life. \n\nI take 10 mg of amitriptyline before bed. It is a powerful antihistamine and it knocks me the fuck out. \n\nIt does make me feel generally drowsy and I have read other people say it was a nightmare drug for them. Yep. Ruined my sleep..I had anxiety both nights from just a tiny dose. One night I did not sleep at all and went into a manic episode. That suuuucks. \n\nHey, the sneaking suspicion about asprin; well, have you looked into salicylate intolerance? That is a big one for me. Cutting back on salicylates helps me significantly. I think I am pretty cool with my doctors right now and I have not been taking famotidine, I am taking tagamet instead. I do not know how well that is working or if it is or if it is not.\n\nI am thinking I like xyzal better than I like Claritin but right now I have Claritin.\n\nI have had a crappy night so far, only because the neighbor downstairs thought that I was making noise, and kept throwing crap at the ceiling, combined with the guy next door who was doing hits off of a nitrous tank which kept making a loud whoosh sound.\n\nSo it is 5:30 a.m. here and I just took a milligram of Ativan and I am going to eat something and go to bed. I am thinking a sandwich on an English muffin, with a little bit of cheese and brown sugar, but who knows, I do not even know if I am allergic to bread or what the hell I can eat, cheese.... FML! \n\nAt least I am calm and with any luck the Ativan did chill me out. Oh. I have no idea what that is lol ( I remember some of your posts. Alcohol seems to be a common topic when you talk about MCAS. While I dont know your whole story or know what happens between posts, do you think you might have an alcohol dependency issue? You know its causing problems but cant seem to stop drinking it, even though people have said/are saying it could be the whole reason why you feel the way you do. No I can quit drinking anytime I want, as a matter of fact I can go days or whatever I am not going to have a weird reaction, again I will explain. When I do not get enough sleep, I know that is the one thing that will work to put me out so I can go back to sleep and wake up later instead of going through the horrible experience of feeling like my brain is in knots and having anxiety to where I cannot go back to sleep and have to live like that all day and fight...\n\nTherein lies the trap, which is why I keep asking these questions because I am trying to find out if there is another option that is not so dirty.\n\nI have been working with the same psychiatrist for over a year maybe even 2 years and I still do not even have a medication that I can go to that is going to help me with this stuff.\n\nI even took a DNA test to find out what medicines would react well with me and which ones would not. amitriptyline was on the orange list, but we tried it anyway and that was a bad idea.\n\nSo now I am back to square one . I need medicines that will help in situations like last night, where the a****** downstairs is throwing stuff at the ceiling, thinking that I am the one throwing a party when it was actually my neighbor who is making a bunch of noise but I could not hear my neighbor apparently the guy downstairs could but that did not stop him from keeping me awake till f****** 3:00 in the morning and then after that I cannot shut my brain down for another couple hours and before you know it I am still awake at 6:00 in the f****** morning and I have to drop an Ativan.\n\nIt would be nice if it did not take me 2 or 3 hours to go to sleep every night.\n\nSo far it seems I just have poor reactions with a lot of the stuff I try, other than Lexapro did not really seem to give me too much of a problem other than the fact that it gave me a lot of weight gain and a very short period of time.\n\nSo on a day like today, now I have only slept about maybe six or seven hours out of the total of eight which I know for sure makes a huge difference and so even though the Ativan helped, I still feel groggy and crappy and today I am probably going to spend a lot of time trying to meditate and clear my head and force myself to catch up on rest because if I do not and it is night time and I still have fatigue I am just going to panic more and it is going to restart this cycle.\n\nIf worse comes to worse, I may need to drink a beer or two again and go back out which I really do not want to do. Cool. I wish you a good sleep. Came back to add some supplements that might be of interest to you. Quercitin like the other poster said, I have found L-Theanine to be helpful too, along with large dose (5,000mg or so) vitamin C. Something I found out in the last 6 months is that it matters what strains of bacteria are in the probiotics you use, if you go that route. Some bacteria generate histamine, adding to the histamine burden. \nYou are right about the allergies and food intolerances. If you can figure those out, you will be further along to figuring out how to control the MCAS beast. Do you have an immunologist for the MCAS or a sleep specialist? \n\nI feel like what might help solve this is a sleep pill of some sort. The way you can get the sleep you need but do not need the alcohol so you can start calming down the mast cell reactions. Yeah I actually have an immunologist that is my specialist I just called her on the phone I think she knows about MCAS but it is somewhat of a beginner but she is the best doctor I have ever had by far.\n\nand then my sleep doctor, I am going back to see him I think in the future, I cannot remember when it is in my portal thing, but he has no idea what is going on period before I saw my specialist he was trying to tell me it was depression or anxiety yada yada yada I am always a huge supporter of getting a second opinion. If your sleep doctor sucks, try to find another. Maybe the immunologist can help you out? How did the quercetin work? I do not know how it worked, I did not sleep well last night like I said because of the neighbor downstairs throwing s*** at the ceiling and the next door neighbor doing a loud wishes taking hits off a helium canister.\n\nso now I have to catch up on sleep tonight and I am already feeling exhausted and wired and not happy, and it appears that none of the medication I have is going to help so I drank one beer and I am going to lay back down and hope I can fall asleep because if I keep taking this Ativan I am going to go batshit crazy, I feel like I am down to the wire right now and I need help to correct this, and I may have corrected it over the last couple of nights if these f****** a****** neighbors did not put a kibosh on things. Have you tried a histamine free diet?  Just need to keep testing foods and expanding your diet.  Not being able to go to sleep can be caused by high histamine levels.  So examine your diet closely.  Also keep an eye on stuff around your home that can also trigger: perfumes, cleaners, aerosols.   \n\nThis is I believe the best diet to follow.  But even the foods with \u201c0\u201d and do not have next to it an \u201cH\u201d (histamine) or \u201cL\u201d, should be tested, adding one new food every 2-3 days.  Keep a food diary writing everything you eat and what if any reaction.  Some liberator foods I notice can cause a reaction even 24hrs later.  \n\nPersonally I do not take any antihistamines, when I was at my worst they caused me more problems than helped.  So I learned to use foods to be my medicine and good supplements.  Some do not do well with sweet potatoes, but they have been a miracle for me for a few years.  I cook a few at night in the microwave until well soft all around(put hard end on bottom of plate), let them cool overnight, peel in morning and remove ends/ remove any discolored parts.  If I notice one store having moldy ones inside I go to another and I use brown ones instead of the dry reddish/ pink one.  I mash w a fork and add a teaspoon or so of Justin\u2019s almond butter.  Mix it up and it tastes great, like pie filling to me.  I cannot eat too much of the almond butter, but a tsp/ tablespoon is fine w sweet potatoes.  \n\nSweet potatoes are naturally antihistamine.  It might not work as well as Benadryl and can only do so much but it will not make you tired like Benadryl will.  Just can eat too much as I think a ton of fiber is not the greatest.  \n\nThey help.  Also blueberries are great and also natural antihistamine, I believe w the natural vit c in them.  I buy frozen wild blueberries.  But blueberries in a package are fine as long as they are not old and look fresh.  \n\nPeaches are fantastic.  But have to be wary of them getting old.  Aldi I found can have hard ones and those are the only ones I eat.  Very hard, as any ones that ripe a little cause me a reaction.  I have been buying a bag of hard ones and cutting them in quarters and storing in freezer bag so it does not ripe and grow histamine.  Peaches are also naturally antihistamine.   If I have a headaches or run down and eat a hard boiled egg, then sweet potatoes, peaches, blueberries I have a good chance of feeling well soon enough.  Unless it was a really bad reaction that I had no business trying to eat, would have to let that reaction just pass.  \n\nWith eggs just need to make sure they are cooked as the undercooked White has histamine.  I will just bring a covered pot w eggs inside to a boil and let them sit for 15 min or so.  Putting them in a bowl of cold water with ice.  And storing in fridge or bringing a cooler w ice packs and eggs, sweet potatoes, fruit inside for lunch.  \n\nBananas can be ok I found if Chiquita and very green.  They easily grow histamine when turning yellow.  So if squeeze and make sure they are hard.  If soft at all I do not risk.  When I get home from grocery I will peel and put them in a freezer bag for freezer storage.  I usually eat them soon after I take them out of freezer as I do not know how long they keep as they melt and get mushy.  \n\nAncestral Supplements kidney pills are a lifesaver.  They naturally contain and enzyme called DAO which naturally breaks down histamine in food.  They recommend starting slow with one a day and building up to make sure theres no reactions.  \n\nSo when I cheat with a higher histamine food(not too high and definitely not a liberator food) I take kidney pills 15 min before I eat.  And timing it right so the pills dissolve and take care of the histamine in food.  I only do that sometimes with for dinner.  So I will order some steak tacos with cilantro and onion and take 8 or so kidney pills beforehand and be ok.  But warning though as the kidney pills themselves can cause one to have a hard time sleeping.  So eating earlier might be the answer.  But I am usually ok going to sleep.  \n\nUsually I am able to eat seasoned meats this way when eating out.  Staying away from certain veggies on list on link above. Potatoes seem to be ok for me, though I had one reaction to one brand of red potatoes when another is perfectly fine.  That may be the case with quinoa and rice.  Always look at ingredients to make sure there are no additives.  \n\n\nFor cooking yourself you can try quinoa, cauliflower rice.  Maybe talk to a butcher if you have one available and try to get meat that is freshly butchered.  As meat left out grows histamine.  Maybe ask if they can freeze some for you.  \n\nLook into a mast cell stabilizer.  I take EMIQ from Natural Factors, it is quercetin in a bioavailable as regular quercetin is hard for absorb.  I also take Rutin from Country Life, though not their version with added bioflavonoids.  The Rutin is 500mg and I will take one at lunch time if having a hard and busy day.  I also take 1/4 pill of Rutin at night when I sleep.  As from reading on it on a study I saw it absorbs slowly and I have feel great in mornings after I started doing that.  Usually people feel so exhausted at night but that does the trick for me.  But also, I am usually not having histamine tearing me up before bedtime like it sounds you are.  So your mileage may vary.  \n\nAlso Vit C is a naturally antihistamine to check out.  One thing to be wary of is eating sugar or taking some supplements at night, too close to bed.  Blueberries at night keep me up.  So does Jarrow\u2019s krill oil at night, though its great for inflammation.\n\nOne thing I tried and liked when I also was having trouble getting to sleep is using magnesium flakes from amazon in a tub and soaking my feet.  The magnesium seems into the skin and you feel sleepy.  I was meaning to make magnesium oil from the flakes, which there is recipes online, but never got around to it.  Wanted to know if spraying some magnesium oil on can make me sleepy.  But did not get around to it. Wow great advice.\nI am going to save this. Thanks You are welcome.  I hope some of it helps.  If you ever have a question and maybe I could answer or possibly point in the right direction,  you can message me and ask.  \n\n\nAlso, a couple more tips I just remembered.  Supposedly regular salt might cause a little reaction so I use Himalayan pink salt.  Though not sure if regular salt is just a minor reaction.  I use olive oil for a healthy fat when cooking.  But there is many immigration olive oils out there, especially from Italy.  So I buy a certified olive oil from California called California Olive Ranch, their everyday variety.  Seems to be well stoked on shelves.  I will add some to a hard boiled egg that i snack on throughout the day.  And also add some to the sweet potato / almond butter mix.  I have read that olive oil can help absorb nutrients from foods so I eat a decent amount.  Ghee butter is also a safe fat to eat and cook with.  \n\nOne snack I like to make is cooking a sweet potato a different way.  Even pinkish ones do not well with it.  I will peel, cut off the ends and slice in 1/4\u201d or so slices.  And lay them flat on a plate, microwaving 10 min on both sides.  They get nice an crunchy/ chewy depending on how long they are cooked.  And they seem to do well not being a fridge and no worrying about growing histamine.  Thinner slices cooked taste like Frosted Flakes cereal to me also and are good. \n\n\nAlso, another tip I read from an interview with a mast cell specialist Dr was her emphasizing working out.  And I work a busy labor job and notice that when I am busy everyday regularly I feel better.  You can read her interviews on Yasmina\u2019s healing histamine website.  \n\n\n\n\n Hey there. Here are some materials for your doctor. They will need an UpToDate subscription in order to access some of them:\n\n- (\n    - This is a relatively authoritative literature review. In the last update that I read, it takes a narrow view of MCAS and requires the presence of some degree of anaphylaxis as well as laboratory confirmation (e.g. elevated tryptase levels). As such, this may or may not be applicable to or helpful with your situation.\n    - Of particular note in this article is a diagram titled \"Symptoms of mast cell activation\"\n- (\n- (\n    - A well-cited but somewhat older overview of the topic that does not use unnecessarily narrow criteria.\n- (\n    - A very new overview of the topic, that also uses broader criteria. It explicitly rejects anaphylaxis and elevated tryptase as requirements. However, it is also new and not yet widely adopted.\n- (\n    - A quick overview of standard medication options. It addresses both MCAS and mastocytosis, since treatment is often similar, and differentiates where needed.\n\nHope this helps. Let me know if there is anything else they might need. The most common story that you will probably hear is that mast cell patients end up reducing their diet to a very, very narrow subset of foods that they are confident do not cause symptoms, and then try to add foods thereafter to see what is tolerable and what is not.\n\nIt can be hard. But probably not as hard as not sleeping. ;) And, if you are indeed dealing with MCAS, I think you will find that the desire to avoid feeling like an itchy, foggy zombie will win out over the desire to eat more flavorful food... most of the time. But YMMV. No thank you, so do you recommend I give this to my doctors? Or is this more for me? Or maybe a combination of both? I know that amitriptyline is a TCA that has been investigated for anti-inflammatory effects, but I am not familiar with it in particular. I am sorry, but I do not have anything to offer you on this front other than a Google Scholar search yielding about 50 articles that you could take a look at:\n\n( Cool, well can you answer one more question? What about this Cromalyn stuff.\n\nAm I correct that I have read somewhere that some people report that when they first start taking it and makes them feel a little worse until it starts making them feel better? I am wondering if that happens because this is my second time restarting it and I felt like the first time I was getting muscle weakness, but also I am noticing my fatigue is a little heavier now since starting one ampule a day for the last few days. and I am wondering if that is what is happening, is my body takes time to adjust to it which is why they say start slow. I seem to remember this happening last time now that I think about it is that a thing or am I just imagining it? The best approach is going to depend on three factors: (1) your personal symptoms, (2) your doctor's disposition, your relationship with them, and how much reading you think they are up for, and (3) how comfortable you are navigating this type of information.\n\nThe current mainstream medical consensus is that MCAS is limited to a narrow range of cases (anaphylaxis + specific mast cell mediator levels). That may or may not be the case, but it leaves out a huge population of people who have extremely similar but less severe symptoms, and who also tend to benefit from the same treatments.\n\nPersonally, I think the current consensus does not make a lot of sense, but that is my opinion.\n\nSo, you will have to decide if and to what extent you are willing to provide your doctor with any of the less-mainstream articles I have linked above. If you are so inclined, you are welcome to put up a new post linking these materials and ask the community for advice. There are lots of people who had to go through this process and they may be able to provide a variety of viewpoints. First off: muscle weakness is listed as one of the \"very serious\" side effects of cromolyn. The product pamphlet probably advises you to contact your doctor about that right away. I would recommend that you follow that caution and get your doctor's advice promptly.\n\nBeyond that, yes, cromolyn tends to take some time to kick in and people can indeed feel worse when starting it or increasing their dose.\n\nGenerally, it takes around 4 weeks to take effect. We have seen reports around here (including from me) that it can have beneficial neurological effects sooner than that, but it does not seem to be the norm and I have not seen any literature describing it. well I am not sure cuz last time I was starting off on chrome when I was also drinking alcohol regularly period so what I am saying is I need to do this without the booze, but I tend to notice that when I drink and I have been taking chromolin for the last few days The hangover effects, which I do not think are hangover effects but I really just my illness flaring up, tend to be worse, worse fatigue, this weird strainy feeling in my eyes, and it even lasts into like the second day where I just feel drained even though I am not drinking. So, I hope I can cut it out and I wish I could do something like smoke cannabis or something like that but I will have a freaking panic attack that will throw me into a manic episode that will last months.\n\nSo I do not know what to do to get short-term relief that I am used to giving myself to try and at least have a few hours of Joy everyday during this suffering. So hopefully this stuff starts to kick in if I stay off the booze.", "Sharing my journey of 8+ years from steroid induced hell to non steroid alternatives It was a long journey of 8 years of getting my immune system to where I want it, and I wanted to share what works for me in hopes it spares anyone the pain I went through.\n\nConditions I have:\n\n* Mast Cell Activation Disorder\n* Asthma, Eosinophilic Esophagitis \n* GERD&amp;Gastroparesis\n* Some unknown Crohn\u2019s like inflammatory digestive condition\n* Osteoporosis\n* Avascular Necrosis of the Hips (from steroids)\n\nMedications and Supplements I take:\n\n* ErgoMax Optipea Palmitoylethanolamide: I want to thank whoever it was on reddit who recommended this. It is technically a supplement but it was the key to getting my immune system stabilized and getting off steroids for good. There is tons of hot research on pubmed on this particular brand (only kind manufactured in the Netherlands with guaranteed potency and purity between batches. Lots of other brands are manufactured in China with no oversight.)\n* Optipea Effects: Mast Cell Stabilization and Anti-Inflammatory: I take 1200mg a day (3 capsules) and it has dramatically decreased my allergic reactions after about 3 months of taking it. Flare ups down from 2-3 a week to \\~2 a month. Allergy Exposure Recovery time went down 50% after 3 months to 75% after 8 months. Lost sensitivities to some chemicals, scents and other mild allergies. Even reduces inflammation from bug bites and etc. \n* Optipea Effects: Pain Relief: this thing is awesome, way stronger than anything else I have had (including opioids), non addictive, not NSAIDs, no side effects that I have gotten or can find in literature. Had to delay my hip replacement surgery until my bone density was better, and this has been a real life saver. That being said, somehow this has traded my severe chronic pain into a weird needle-prick like pain a few times a day instead, but I am still happy with it. And these are gradually decreasing also. Also aside, seems to have increased my calcium absorption.\n* Additional Optipea bonus: no fillers or other potential allergens in it. This also cleared up my severe inattentive ADHD-like symptoms, which actually turned out to be mild ADHD plus brain fog from chronic pain and allergic reactions.\n* LDN: 11mg every 5 days. Yeah not technically low dose anymore, but after many many attempts at different doses and times, that is what works best for me. Too often and I actually became allergic to the fillers. I had to go off of it for over a year, which sucked. Anyway LDN keeps my throat open, helps me with my asthma. And between LDN and Montelukast, they keep my throat open from Eosinophilic Esophagitis, so much that my throat looks normal inside. I use home water compounding and filtration with a clean lens microfiber cloth (cheap and easy).\n* Montelukast Sodium: 30-40mg a day: For asthma and Eosinophilic Esophagitis. Works amazingly and also keeps me off nasty steroids. If I can recommend even just one person with EoE/Asthma to try this and maybe get off steroids, I will be happy. This was based on a research study that increased Montelukast Sodium dosage in increments of 10mg for EoE patients until their throats opened up. I also shared this with my doctor and he tried it on his other EoE patients, to great success, which was awesome. (( Only downside is fighting with insurance to cover it. And a dry throat, but I drink lots of water anyway. And it beats struggling to swallow or choking. (for anyone else very sensitive to lactose/casein in medications, I take Krem brand)\n* Flovent: I have this as a backup if I need it. I use it sparingly because regular use gets me throat infections, which aggravate my asthma. But I am glad to be mostly off it, steroids are best to be avoided as much as possible for long term use. For anyone else with chronic throat infections I recommend brushing teeth after eating anything sweet/carbs, rinse out mouth with water very often and I also gently and slowly rub a toothbrush against the back of my throat once a day as well. (Extremely slowly or you might gag.)\n* RenewLife Probiotic: I tried many, many, many different probiotics and heartburn cures and this one is the best I tried. The $50-60 ones are very expensive but carry the best variety and potency of good bacterial strains that I have seen. Awesome for Constipation/Diarrhea and also completely cured my volcanic heartburn better than the gazillion other acid blockers, home remedies, supplements and other crap I tried and wasted my money on. (Except American Health Papaya Tablets were not a waste of money, but I do not need them anymore) I took these daily for about 6 months, then dropped to about 1-2 a week, so the cost is not that bad. But you have to restart it again if you take any antibiotics.\n* Gastrocrom/Sodium Cromolyn: This has always helped me (been on it over 5 years) but it took me about 4 years to figure out how to best take it. For the longest time I did not bother with taking it 30min before eating because it did not seem to make any difference. Eventually I discovered that it is my gastroparesis that is slowing down the passage of Gastrocrom through my system. For me, I actually need to take it 20-50min before eating, based on how slow or fast my digestion is at the moment. I found eventually that waiting until it hits my kidneys and it is been 20+ minutes, and I need to pee, is actually the best guide for taking this for me. \n* Environmental: I discovered personally, that I am extremely sensitive to mold, and moving out of moldy places, and keeping the indoor mold extremely low is key to getting my allergies under control. This even includes small amounts of mold in the refrigerator, and even mold in the drains. And watching like a hawk for any leaks plus a dehumidifier to keep humidity low. I also have an Austin Air filter to filter out mold and pollen out of the air in my bedroom. And no carpet. Carpet traps particles and even small spills and humid air will mold in carpet extremely easily. Smoke of any kind is also another big trigger for me.\n* Diet: I tried many many different diets. Eventually settled down on an elimination diet. Do not have that many safe foods left but at least I can eat them all the time now instead of having to rotate them.\n* Masks: I was wearing n95 before it was popular! Joking aside, masks are a great way to lower exposure. For me, public smoking and diesel car exhaust are the biggest hazards, as well as frying onions somehow. \n\nAll in all, of course what works for me will not work for everyone else, but I hope there is something useful in here for you guys. If I can save one person from the steroid induced hell I went through, I would be thrilled. It took me 8 years and I think I have tried almost everything mentioned on this sub, many medications, and tons and tons and tons of supplements. I still need to get my hip surgery, and I am starting Avenity for my osteoporosis soon. After that I am seriously hoping I can get back to my life. But at least my allergic reactions are finally under control, and I can spend time actually doing stuff I want to do now, instead of sitting around permanently fatigued and brain fogged up like my head is full of soup like it was for years. Hey congrats on finally living for the first time. It must have been really eye opening that something so obvious could have contributed to something so life constraining.", "How to live life? How do you handle life? Do you have enough energy to study or work? What about relationships, friendships, family., pregnancy, earning money? \nDo you get any help?\nI do not know how to deal with anything of the above as even walking 50m to the supermarket feels like climbing the mound Everest. I am kind of hopeless regarding my future. I cannot even earn money currently. With all my powers I can barely do the basics like doing groceries and taking a shower. How could I ever take care of my own life or children? I want to work and help other people and not only be a financial and social burden. \nSorry for the rant, but maybe you can help me.  X My boyfriend has rheumatoid arthritis that he got when he was 2. He often feels like a burden especially bc he gets his money from his parents. What I have been telling him is that he should try to dedicate his life to being healthy. He does not have to worry about a job, his job is being his most healthy self and finding foods and medicines that work for him. \n\nAlso, the expectations society have on us are not the only way to live. Our governments want us to work til we drop and continue to dish out as much money as possible to them. Do not hold yourself to this standard of a 9-5 working 40 hrs a week . It is not healthy for anyone really. Your life can be lived the way you would like it to be. Got To figure out what you think your purpose is here. \ud83e\udd70\ud83c\udf37 When I graduated college in Dec 2018 I moved in with my sister with my only goal being to get healthier. At the time I had undiagnosed uncontrolled MCAS, POTS and uncontrolled asthma. I would had a love of my lung removed the previous year. What I am trying to get at was that my quality of life was terrible and no one thought I would ever be able to work a full time job or really do anything. \n\nI went to an immunologist and was diagnosed with MCAS and later POTS and Ehlers Danlos. I started treatment and by July of 2019 I had a job! A full time job!! I am on my way to work right now. I am a scientist, I work full time at my dream job. No one thought it was possible, least of all me. I definitely do get really tired, and have my bad chronic illness days. But! It is possible! \n\nJust focus on getting as healthy as you possible can. You have no idea what is possible! I went on an elimination diet and found my triggers, that was life changing. I have lived with it all my life, 64 years, most of it without treatment.\n\nSo lots of lifestyle changes. Diet is a big one because of food sensitivities. If you can figure out a decent nutritious diet that avoids all your food triggers that is a huge help. At one point there were only about 10 different foods I could safely eat. Over time that got better.\n\nFiguring out to heal your gut is the next step. you may have candida, or you may simply need to eat plenty of protein and take some supplements for a few months while things heal up and calm down. Once your gut calms down your food sensitivities tend to get better.\n\nSee an allergist/immunologist and get medications. Back in the 70s there were only heavily sedating antihistamines. Now there is a whole spectrum of antihistamines and medications that can help you. Many are OtC and many are prescription.\n\nOne drug that helped me immensely was doxepin. Which is a tricyclic antidepressant, but it is also a heavy duty antihistamine. I was taking the max dose every night and my allergies pretty much disappeared on it. It has the nasty side effect of dry mouth, especially in the morning. If nothing else works, this might.\n\nDo manage your stress. So meditation, exercise, guided relaxation, even drugs if necessary. Find hobbies and activities that make you happy and you enjoy and do them often. \n\nIf you are lucky you may find that your disease can go into remission or partial remission. Thank you. I am struggling and feeling same as OP and have been in the past/still beating myself up over this. Thank you :( I am going to continue focusing on trying to beat this Oh, that is really amazing!! So happy for you! It is giving me hope too. What does your treatment consist of? \nWhat kind of scientist are you? I take claratin 4 times a day, 2 ampules of cromolyn 3 times a day, budesonide nebulizer twice a day, performist nebulizer twice a day, singulair once a day, incruse once a day, and I am going to start Xolair when the pandemic calms down. \n\nWhat totally changed my life was my elimination diet. There were so many triggers that I ate all the time without even knowing it\n\n\nI am a research associate at a biotech company. I work in the cell processing lab. I isolate, analyze and cryopreserve various cell types from donated human blood, as well as working on data tracking projects and process development. \ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffe\u200d\ud83d\udd2c\nEdit: forgot answer your second question \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f What a cool job! I love sciences. :) \nElemination diet is key. If I deviate from consuming anything but meat and water I get instant agony. :/\nWhat does yours consist of? Were you able to include some foods again? We have talked before, and you know my story about my extraordinary dog, and because of her and the work she put in when everyone had gotten used to parking me in a corner and forgetting me, I got better.  I cannot express how much reassurance and confidence it gave me that this extraordinary animal love me so unconditionally and so intensely.  And I loved her the same way.\n\nHer sheer joy in life made my life fun and an adventure and she pushed me, protected me fiercely, made me laugh and made me be seen!  \n\nAt first people saw this magnificent animal, then they saw me.  She had star power.  People wanted to be around her and that social interaction she brought really helped.\n\nThe rest is finding ways to improve your life, lower your stress, be with the people you love and do what makes you happy with as few consequences as possible.\n\nI am always pushing the boundaries of what I can do, and sometimes that winds up in injury and setbacks but generally speaking it is pushed my tolerances for activities and things forward so I am now doing way more than I was capable of 10 years ago. \n\nIt all comes with a price though.  I know that no amount of medicine is going to keep me from crashing after a day or even hours of having fun living life and doing what matters to me.  But it is all worth it during the days I am paying for it.\n\nPacing yourself comes hard.  Get some emotional support, be it a therapist you can talk to when your family and friends are over it, or getting a servicedog, or whatever works for you.  Get help with things that you struggle with so you have energy to put into the things that matter.\n\nAnd do not let your doctor's rest easy.  Keep them working to find the best drug combinations for you.  You are not  a one size fits all patient,  so your doctor's are going to have to accept you are their problem patient they are going to have to work for. No easy 15 min office consult  and a referral out to yet another specialist to treat a symptom instead of addressing the root problem. Thanks! I love science too!!\n\nMy mom got me a MCAS diet book when I got diagnosed. It has a lot of recipes and stuff. When I started my elimination diet I ate white rice, unseasoned chicken, and steamed zucchini. \n\nI ate that for like two to 3 weeks then I added in apples. I am actually still in the process of adding things back in. But my diet is so much broader than I thought it could be! I just ate pizza! FROM A RESTAURANT! If you are interested I could find the name of the book. It was helpful to see what foods were common triggers. It also included an elimination diet plan. \n\nNow I can eat:\nChicken,\nBeef\nShrimp\nGarlic\nOnions\nSalt\nPepper \nKale\nBagels\nBread \nStrawberry jam\nPeanut butter\nAlmonds\nDark chocolate!!!\nEggs\nCoffee\nMilk\nGrape tomatoes \nAnd more! \n\nI am at the point where I try new things and then note if I have a reaction. My diet is pretty varied now! Congrats \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udf38\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29 That is amazing. Thank you for the advice :) Thank you \u2600\ufe0f\ud83c\udf40\ud83c\udf38 I am disabled, and that is maybe something you need to look into if you are not already.  But if I had to live on that alone I would be homeless.\n\nEvery person's situation is different but I would try to work as much as you can from home in a job that allows you flexible hours.  Flexible hours allows you to work at your own pace and rest when you need to.  Avoid stressful jobs and deadlines.  Some social interaction is good.  Too much can be overwhelmimg.  It is all about balance.\n\nGetting disability helps, then there is assistance through the Right to Work Act and other programs.  Salvation Army, Opportunity village and a lot of charity organizations hire the disabled.\n\nA good psychologist can help you with getting disability.  Took me less than 6 months.  And they can help keep you STAY  focused on goals and be someone you can be honest with about your struggle.\n\n  They can arrange in home help if you need it  and be useful in  a variety of ways. Advocacy for you if you need IT .  SORRY. It is late and I have been sick so about to fall asleep. Thank you! Why could not you live on that alone? Which country/state are you living in?\nHave a good rest \ud83d\ude0c I was disabled too early.  Auto accident caused all this for me so my disability is not about to cover everything.  My settlement was invested from the accident and that pays an annuity to make up the difference. I am in the southwest US.  You? Damn, sounds complicated... I am from Germany I lived in West Berlin as a kid.  Went to the forth grade there.   Beautiful country and city.  Been back once since as an adult after the wall came down.  Traveled through Germany from Belgium to Italy, making stops along the way. Awesome \ud83d\ude0e what is was your favorite place? Btw, every time I read your name the song \u2018James\u2019 by mgmt starts playing in my head In Berlin or Germany?  I would have to say in Germany the Contemporary Art Museum in Munich.  So much wonderful art. Cool, I will go visit when I am in Munich this summer \u270c\ufe0f\ud83d\ude07 The hunting and fishing museum was pretty awesome too.  I am an artist and a hunter so... they both had appeal. Great tip!!! Thx!!!", "Characterization of Mast Cell Activation Syndrome   Thanks for posting this one.

This is great. I was not familiar with it - thank you for posting it.", "Improvement in food tolerance after treatment for MCAS? Hello.  Just wondering for those with MCAS and food triggers that have seen improvement in MCAS with treatment (e.g. H1/H2 antihistamines, mast cell stabilizer, etc.) - did you notice much change in your reactions to food triggers after the treatment.  E.g. \n\n1. Were there foods that you reacted to previously that you no longer react to after treatment\n2. Did you still react, but the symptoms were less after treatment\n3. Did you still react to the same degree after treatment\n\nThank you in advance for sharing any of your experiences.  This is a tricky condition, and just trying to get a better understanding of people's personal experiences with food reactions and whether they found these reactions improved after treatment. Certain foods, yes. High histamine foods no. With treatment, gluten does not bother me. But I cannot eat dairy no matter what (I think its more than lactose intolerance since I cannot even drink lactose free milk but it is not an allergy). And other high histamine foods can trigger me if I have too much. Like mushrooms or anything from a can. Thank you for your reply.  So even after treatment it sounds like high histamine foods in particular you note continue to be an issue for you, but some other foods that you reacted to previously that were not high histamine, including wheat/gluten, you are now able to tolerate after treatment (dairy excluded).  Did I get that right?  Thank you that is helpful.  Just curious, do you still include some high histamine foods in your diet and just keep the load low, or do you avoid these foods all together now? I have been on xolair almost two years. I got back coconut, potato and palm oil. My reactions to some other foods have become less severe. For example, if I eat soy lecithin, a small amount will only cause mouth blisters, diarrhea and swollen tongue, which is better than it used to be. Glad you were able to get a few foods back.  Can you eat as much of those foods as you want now without symptoms (coconut, potato, palm oil), or do you find if you consume too much of those foods, or have them too frequently they still cause symptoms? I seem to be able to eat as much potato as I want, and I can peel and chop it without getting hives. Sometimes coconut will make my mouth feel cut up, and palm oil will make me cough, so I try to save those for days when I am feeling pretty good. Yes. I would react to a lot of different foods, gluten was the only one I could specifically call out besides high histamine foods. The reactions decreased. I can eat some high histamine foods with a minimal reaction. If I eat too much,the treatment does not have as good of an effect. Thank you. This is helpful information.  I appreciate your time. Thanks for sharing your experience.  Sounds like there is a fair bit of trial and error which foods you get back after treatment, and how much of certain foods you can tolerate.  Best of luck to you :) I feel like I am not super typical and can only speak for myself. I feel like I have figured out how to manage and stabilize my symptoms for the most part. *knock on wood* I also keep a detailed food and activity diary to really pay attention to my body.\n\nIf I keep to my daily routine, get plenty of sleep, take my antihistamines and Quercetin on time, am stress-free, etc., and if I follow a low histamine diet 98% of the time, then I can eat other foods maybe around 2% of the time. These are still mainly unprocessed or minimally processed foods.\n\nTo answer your question:\n1. Yes there are foods I reacted to previously that I no longer react to or maybe it is minimal enough that I do not really notice? These are mostly unprocessed foods I could not eat before, such as other vegetables, herbs, etc.\n2. Yes this is mostly how it is for me. If I eat well 98% of the time and follow the measures above, then I feel ok taking a small bite of something very high histamine (say 1-2 bites of birthday cake or a couple bites of pizza\u2014but I am serious, like 2 bites only) or having a small serving of something like a home cooked meal that is not super low histamine, but not high histamine either.\n3. I feel like for me that diet IS the treatment. It is the main part of the treatment for me. (I wonder if I took a stronger prescription if I would be able to tolerate more foods...but for me I decided to make diet a top priority in hopes of avoiding more prescriptions. Also my insurance sucks. Others might choose differently, and of course many have such severe cases they do not have the luxury of choice.)\n\nAt this point, I am in a routine and eat the same breakfast, same lunch, and same dinner mostly 7 days per week. (I could eat more variation than I do, but making it the same makes my diet easy to stick to.) Once every other week or so, if I am feeling GREAT, then I might eat something I really miss that is high histamine and it does not seem to throw me off much, though I do feel a difference. I have not had a major reaction or anaphylaxis in more than 6 months now, though, and I would like to keep it that way. Baby steps! Thank you for your detailed reply, and that is great that you have been able avoid large reactions for the last 6 months with your regimen.  \n\nIt sounds like you are very strict with the low histamine diet.  In terms of trigger foods, have you found that these are largely high histamine foods, or have you also found that a number of your trigger foods are not necessarily high histamine (e.g. you had mentioned highly processed foods, or other foods?).\n\nYou mentioned that you eat the same foods every day.  Have you found at all that if you eat a specific food too much or too often that is a part of your 'safe diet', that you can sometimes start getting symptoms with that food e.g. you can 'lose' a food.  Or have you found you can eat these foods as much and as frequently as you want and they continue to remain 'safe' foods, from your experience.\n\nThanks again for your sharing your insights/learnings :) This is a hard question to answer. Mostly, for non-processed foods, I do not have a big reaction anymore...it is more like I experience a cumulative effect when I break my typical diet, causing symptoms. (I do not, say, eat a spinach leaf and have an immediate reaction. But if I were to eat a handful of spinach every day for a few days I would start to feel symptoms again.) There are some things I do not react much to. And there are trigger foods like eggs that I avoid completely. A couples bites of eggs would not cause anaphylaxis, but my throat would probably swell up slightly and be uncomfortable. I still avoid eggs.\n\nMy symptoms now are overall less severe to everything, but I attribute this to my diet. My everyday safety diet includes organic rice varieties, split red lentils, broccoli, asparagus, cauliflower, oatmeal, one certain brand of peanut butter, sea salt. These are my safe foods and I have never lost any of these. I have reacted to different brands on a rare occasion, but I try to always buy the same brand. This one brand of peanut butter is an anomaly I cannot explain, but it makes me very happy!\n\nSeeing as I have been so long without a reaction, I hope it will continue to improve. But my time having frequent anaphylaxis was so scary, I am honestly nervous to break out my diet too much. Thank you for taking the time for answering the questions.  That was very helpful.\n\nIt sounds like you have figured out a diet strategy that works for you, and have a good understanding of how your system handles different foods.  Hopefully over time things will continue to  improve and you will be able to liberalize your diet some more!   \n\nThanks again. Sometimes you will get lucky, sometimes you will not. What is possible with montelukast and ketotifen is systematic desensitization, ie you put one tiny fragment of food a in a dish, swirl it around, then you pipette one drop into another container, and so on and so on until you do not react to that water. And you hit the drop after you take your medication + qucertin or chamomile tea, MSM, and l-histidine (if you can tolerate it.   \nYou increase the drops over time and at some point you just may be able to eat 1/4th the foods that normal people can eat. Partially worked for me. Whey and any form of sugar are the only things I have had zero progress  with.  \n\n\nNow if I could find a way to desensitize myself to mechanical pressure and textiles, then I might be able to live like a normal person. It is hard for me to pin down particular foods. Basically anything I eat or drink can go poorly for me, and every elimination diet I have attempted has not changed the results one bit.\n\nI would say that starting cromolyn (8 vials a day) reduced the frequency and severity of my reactions by at least ~50% however. It is not all better, but its been a lifesaver in terms of being able to eat somewhat normally. That is just my personal experience though. Thanks for you reply.  Your desensitization regimen is very interesting.  Is this something you experimented with and figured out on you own, or is there a resource you could recommend to learn more about it?  Would you be able to share an example of a food(s) that you successfully were able to establish tolerance to using this type of regimen and the time frame and dosing you used to get there.  If this is too much info. to share, no worries, it is just very interesting, and I am sure others would find this useful as well. That is helpful.  The overall theme I am hearing here is that getting the optimal medication regimen certainly helps increase the odds of food tolerance, but it is far from a magic bullet, and food reactions remain an ongoing issue for most.  Approx 50% improvement you mention, sounds like it makes a meaningful difference in your situation.  Thanks again for your feedback :) I found it in an extremely roundabout way, as advice an Australian physician gave someone on a salicylate sensitivity message board. I ran it by my doctor and he said it looked fine. \nAs for specifics, it is sort of touch and go, but you can look at regular allergy shot desensitization tables to get a sense of how minute you want to start and then increase. ok that sounds good.  I will look more into that. What would you say your success rate was with that e.g. approx. what % of foods were you able to titrate up in this manner and establish tolerance. This is not exhaustive but consider it a snapshot, all nuts, except peanuts and almonds. All greens, excepting cabbage. All spices in reasonable amounts, it helps that they are used in small quantities to start. \nFruit, I can have something like 3 grapes or an eyelash thin slice of orange. But I was not able to desensitize to most fruits and veg with a high sugar content, ie carrots, apples, pineapple.\n\nI have had no luck at all with dairy, and am subsisting on goat products. \nNever had a problem with meat to start. I have been able to desensitize a little bit to a couple artificial sweeteners, but not enough to be able to chew sugar free gum without problems.\nOh, I nearly forgot to add, I was able to desensitize to canola oil and I am currently working on olive oil, a bit trickier because of oil and water not mixing, but I am able to cook with it in moderate quantities, but a soaked vegetable olive oil roast is still a bit out of reach. For the foods you had success with, were these foods that you had previously reacted to prior to the desensitization?  If so, prior to the desensitization regimen, were these foods that you reacted to after the treatment with your meds, or only reacted to before the meds?  Sorry for so many questions - just wanted to make sure I had a clear picture of how this worked for you.  Thanks :) Yes, I only desensitized myself to stuff I would reacted to, which was basically everything save meat, bread, and salt.\n\nOh and I will add, desensitization for some things seemed to greatly advance my ability to tolerate certain like things, so I did not need to go step by step for each spice, each different leafy vegetable. I was able to go after spinach, black pepper, and a few other things at first, which meant I was able to start with higher quantities (in relative terms) with similar things. That is excellent!  You are very smart to have figured this out.  Well done!  Have you described your process in detail anywhere on this sub or blog, etc.?  I just do not want to bother you with unnecessary questions.  If not, I just had a couple/few more...\n\n1. For the foods that were able to desensitize yourself to - can you now eat all of these foods at any volume and frequency.  Or do still have reactions in some cases if you eat these foods too much or too often.\n2. For solid foods, did you have to blend/puree these foods to disperse in water?\n3. How long was a typical desensitization period for a certain food. E.g. did you gradually titrate up daily for a couple weeks per food, etc.\n\nThanks again for sharing your experience with this.  This is very interesting, and I am sure will be quite valuable for some people :) &gt;That is excellent!  You are very smart to have figured this out.  Well done!

Caution is very important here.  \n\n\nQuantities is a good question. There things like olives that I can eat in moderate quantities, but I will get a mild reaction if I have more and a bad reaction if I have a lot.  \n\n\nI did use a blender to macerate things, that is where it gets a little bit trickier because as you are diluting things by the gallon, you want to be sure you have some of the substance, I would like to say I used a microscope to verify, but I just went by feel.\n\nDesensetization period was approx 2 years. Slow and steady, I would use distilled water and make each dilution last a month or so, and then change the amount based on observed reaction. You want to have no reaction at all for the first stretch, because of the way the immune system clones T cells after inflammatory response. We are trying our best for that not to happen.\n\nI would dose with a dropper, and maybe after a month I would go from one drop of dilute to 2, or 3 if I felt confident. Again, would be nice if I was more scientific, but I was playing it by ear.  \n\n\nIf this helps anyone, I would be glad. I gave myself a mast cell problem with long term antacid use and after allergic reactions to caffeine, phenibut, and a chinese herb called yan hu suo , it disabled me. Now, I am not at 100, but I can eat, I can do some tasks, I have a wonderful fiancee, life is more livable. Glad this has helped you.  Sounds like it has been a long road, but you have gotten to a better place :)\n\nWere you doing desensitization to several foods in parallel/at the same time?  A month seems like a long time to adjust the dosing if you are doing just one food at a time, so I am guessing you were doing several foods at once if the process only took 2 years, but just wanted to check and make sure I have that right? Several at a time, using small tupperware containers of distilled water in the fridge, with a unique pipette for each. I have an interesting 'picture' of what your fridge looked like - and interesting science experiment in there :)  Thank you for sharing your process, that has been very interesting.  All the best to you! I am a licensed nutritionist who also has MCAS. Everyone has different food experiences, but I have found I actually react more strongly once I remove a food and then add it back in later despite MCAS treatments. That is interesting.  Do you have any thoughts on why this happens?  Blue-skying here...do you think this is related to an actual change in the level of immune/mast cell response to the food e.g. more frequent exposure may 'blunt' the mast cell response, or do you think that this is more 'perception' related e.g. symptom improved with food avoidance, and therefore reaction now more noticeable when you consume the food.  You may not have an answer on this one, just curious your thoughts. Hey, I know this was a while ago but I have been dealing with the same exact cumulative nature of my symptoms. My problem, though, is that it seems as if any food causes this. Would you recommend an elimination diet? I am trying to build muscle, which this is making impossible. I am not a doctor or health care professional and definitely not qualified to comment on your situation, but I can share what worked for me.\n\nWhen I first came down with symptoms I became really ill, really quickly. I lost a lot of weight because I could not eat, I had to take time off work, I felt so sickly like I have never felt before in my life. I could not work out, I was completely exhausted, and I could not think straight because I had horrible brain fog.\n\nOnce I figured what was going on (some type of mast cell situation), I adopted a pretty extreme diet just to be able to eat something/anything and gain some weight and get my energy back. I ate cooked broccoli, rice, and some red lentil soup which I described above. On a bad days I only ate rice and broccoli. On the absolute worst days, I sometimes only ate rice. Yes, I ate rice at breakfast, lunch, and dinner sometimes. Maybe once or twice per week I would have around a teaspoon of peanut butter (I mention above there is one random peanut butter brand I can eat). I was also able to eat a tiny amount of homemade apple sauce maybe 2 times per month. Everything was boiled and cooked\u2014almost over cooked. (Side note: I am aware that eating only rice is not a balanced diet with proper nutrition...but when I had lost 20+ lbs and was so weak, it really helped me make it through!!!)\n\nThe above is all I ate for maybe 3ish to 4 months at the beginning, and I credit this diet with allowing me to start feeling better and honestly getting my life back.\n\nI kept track of all my meals, workouts, sleep, etc. in symptom tracker app. This helped me notice any patterns. It is not perfect but it helps. My baseline MCAS symptoms/malaise started at a 7-9 out of 10 daily for me (so sickly that if it had not been covid I would have gone straight to the doctor or ER). Once I got my baseline to around a 2 (or under) consistently for maybe 3 or 4 weeks in a row, I was feeling better, thinking more clearly, and able to do light exercise again. At that point I started to experiment a bit more.\n\nI started to try to add in new low histamine vegetables, grains, and herbs. I only added one item at a time, and started very small. If I felt any symptoms, I did not push it. If I had any flare ups from anything I ate, I would wait a few days or even a week to try another item. If my baseline went up to a 3 or 4 out of 10 in terms of pain/malaise, I would go back to my earlier diet for a week or more until things settled down. I did not put myself in any situation that would cause a 4 or worse pain level. I have not even been at a level 3 of symptoms since around last 6 or 7 months now.\n\nIf there was something I really wanted that caused me symptoms (like coffee), I tried titrating up almost from nothing. Sometimes this worked and sometimes it did not. (Mind you, I am referring to unprocessed food like potatoes or mangoes\u2014not pizza or restaurant food.) For coffee, I think I had one teaspoon per day for 2-3 months before I tried a tablespoon. (I do not have this level of commitment for anything besides coffee, to be honest.)\n\nDiet is everything. Now that I am doing better, I am working out again daily and gaining muscle and definition well. I am not a body builder, though, so not sure what you are trying to achieve exactly. I have found low intensity workouts plus stretching and free weights to be extremely beneficial to my overall health and symptom level. HIIT, running, and anything that gets my heart rate up super high is unpleasant enough that I do not do it (yet).\n\nDropping a couple websites I used in my journey, and still use:\n\nHistamine Food List:\n\n\nI printed whole PDF out, and then I could go through and systematically try one thing at a time and make notes. I still take notes on this pdf on what works and what does not. It is a great list of things to try and it is helpful to see when something is red or green. Everyone is different so you should not assume you can simply eat all the green foods. Instead, green foods are ones to consider trying to add to your diet.\n\nHistamine Elimination Diet:\n\n \nGeneral info on a histamine elimination diet. When my symptoms first started, I used this mainly for the \u201cavoid\u201d section. The \u201cwell tolerated\u201d section is really individual so I do not necessarily look at that\u2014it is not true for me personally. But the avoid section is spot on for me.\n\nA sample method of adding new items to your diet:\n\n\nA sample low histamine diet:\n\n\nI really like these last two articles, and still refer to them sometimes. Two more comments:\n\nI only eat fresh or frozen organic, unprocessed food. For everything. I freeze things immediately after batch cooking.\n\nRegarding protein from meat\u2014I was so underweight at the beginning that I did try to eat meat and eggs in hopes of gaining weight and getting more protein, but they both caused me terrible symptoms. I have tried eggs many different ways, but have still not been able to tolerate them. (Before MCAS, I probably had eggs once per week.) Over time, I have been able to get back to a healthy place being vegetarian as I have been my whole life. Some people I know with MCAS have a similar diet to me, except replace red lentils with high quality organic free range chicken bought as fresh as possible.", "Mesalamine for mastocytic enterocolitis I have mastocytic enterocolitis of both the small intestine and colon. How hard is it to get on a drug like mesalamine if there is no evidence of Crohn's? \n\nI am so used to my doctors saying no, no, and no to me when I ask to try things like tests and medications over the many years. \n\nThe original doctor that discovered the mastocytic enterocolitis by biopsy tried me on budesonide but gave up when I told her I was reacting to it. I think she does not understand the disease. I cannot believe she did not try mesalamine first since it is weaker. I just wish I could TRY something without presenting a case like a damn lawyer to these doctors! So dang frustrating. Hang in there. I am on cromolyn sodium for mast cell enterocolitis and it is been working well. Been about 5 months now. Never tried the two that you mentioned though,  so no help there.\n\nEdit: I have lucked out with a good doctor and still get frequently frustrated so I totally feel ya. Stay persistent. You are the only one to really watch out for you. How long did cromolyn sodium take to work and how often per day do you take it? I had a hard time trying to take it 4 times every day It ended up being like a monthish. I started off with a low dose and then I screwed up the final dose and took a couple extra weeks to get to the final dose. And yeah 4 x a day is a lot especially with numerous  meds that are taken multiple times a day. I set phone alerts and have a large pill minder. In the morning I set oven timer  to get through all morning meds since I cant take them at one time. Now if I miss 2 or 3 doses I can totally tell. Has been worth it for me. I am newly diagnosed, but my dr is advising first step (after screening for SM) is skin scratch testing. They say my symptoms come from IgE allergies. Apparently we will do allergy shots for any environmental allergens and I will avoid any foods that come up.\n\nI do not know if this is because I have already identified a food trigger.\n\nAs far as I can tell we are incredibly lucky even to have been diagnosed. Looking for mast cells on biopsy is not common,", "How common is this in mcas ? Can someone relate ? \n\nHello all.\n\nSometimes when I shower in hot water, I get these claw marks on my body. Sometimes on my back but most of the time on my stomach.\nI doubt it is the soap causing this but I might be wrong.\n\nDo any of you with MCAS get this similar claw mark on your skin after a hot shower ?\n\nIs still a common symptom of mast cells activation ?\n\nThank you !! When I barely scratch my skin in the shower it looks like this. Scratches are definitely more pronounced but they do not happen out of nowhere for me. Same thing for me. Claw marks appear whenever I scratch myself, and stay for longer if I staych during a shower. Every time You get those and are diagnosed with mcas ? So i am not crazy lol ? Thank you for your feedback !! :) So these claw marks appear when you scratch yourself because you have mcas ? This should not be normal for those that do not have mcas, right ? Thank you for your comment !! :) I am saying that if I scratch my side in the shower then I get more pronounced scratches that look worse than if I wasnt taking a shower. I dont know if people without mcas have this happen. I see what you are talking about. I did the experiment yesterday actually after your comment. Went in a hot shower and scratched myself and then after getting out I noticed claw marks on my body, so strange. I think its called dermatographism ! Dermatographia. One of the common symptoms. Does not take much, just lightly drag your fingernail across your skin. I can make my throat turn bright red just by touching it with my fingertips.", "Oral Ketotifen--When Did Yours Kick In? Just started taking oral ketotifen 1mg 2x day.  Wondering if anyone here has seen improvement with their MCAS symptoms taking ketotifen orally, and if so how long it took before you noticed an improvement?  My doctor wants me to check in after 2 weeks, but based on what I have read I think it could take longer than that.  Thanks! I have had a huge improvement. Full results take a month to see. When did okay results start to be noticeable? I started very slow and with mixing in a few other drugs like cromolyn famotadine and more, I think it is helped my breathing and overall helped calm the storm.  I started with one pill a day and worked myself up to 4. I also had it specially compounded with rice flour, as the other compounds were giving me reactions. Thanks for your response--do you recall when you noticed an improvement? No prob! It definitely was not immediate and I think I am still seeing improvements.  I would say two weeks, give or take a few days.  If you can tolerate it, I would just keep it going.  It gave me allergy symptoms at first ever so sightly.  I actually had to stop it a few times before I could power through.  So if it does not work at first I would keep trying at later times. I saw a little improvement but I had to stop taking them because after 2 weeks I noticed it made me very depressed and tired After a couple weeks. Full results after a month at the full dose. My son has been taking it for 2 - 21/2 weeks.  Just 1 mg.   It is helping with the itching he has prob from mcas cell.  But it is really drying him out and making his fatigue worse we think! \n\nIt is def a strong antihistamine in my opinion.  His lips look like he has been skiing for  a week  as I can assure you he is super duper hydrated!", "So I am at 72 hours with no meds now... And I still have some dull stomach pain, but I have not had any multi-system reactions or anything intense happen even though I have been eating as I usually do. As some background, both my PCP and my allergist do not believe I have any MCAD, but I was not sure still as they were not specialists. Does the fact that I am having no reactions or serious symptoms after 72 hours mean that I need to look to other causes for my stomach problems? Can I definitively say that I do not have a mast cell disorder if I am the same on versus off medicine? What meds were you on? Could be two things, you do not have MCAS or you were not on the right meds to begin with. Everyone with mast cell diseases are different. For MCAS you need to have symptoms in multiple body systems, not just one. So if you only have stomach issues, it is not MCAS. i.e. I have skin issues, stomach issues, neuro issues, joint issues, eye issues, etc. I was taking a double dose of H1 and H2 antihistamines and noticed no real difference in how I felt. Everything I have read talks about MCAD patients have a fairly substantial response to histamine blockers and its one of the criteria for diagnosis. I also have not really had episodes of multisystem issues. So I think it would be best for me to look at other explanations. I also feel like the 40mg of Nexium I was taking daily for a few months may have something to do with my stomach pains as I was not having them when I was not taking it. If you do not have multi system symptoms I would say continue searching for another diagnosis. However, some mast cell patients have to try different types of antihistamines to find the right ones for them. Patients can react even to fillers. I know I did not get much relief until I was on the right cocktail of meds and dosing. I do hope you figure it out. Have the doctors tested you for other causes? Usually mast cell diseases are a last resort after other tests/treatments have shown nothing. Do you have or suspect any of the usual MCAD comorbids?  As these disorders are rarely found by themselves.  Things like EDS, POTS, Eosinophilic disorders, thyroid disorders, adrenal issues, sjogrens, reynauds, restless legs, early onset arthritis, or any of a number of other possible comorbid problems.\n\nI mean some of these, such as Eosinophilic Disorders can cause abdominal issues and still be linked to EDS for instance, without it being full blown MCAS or Mastocytosis.  Hence the question.  If you do not have any of the usual comorbids, you do not have any response to antimediator therapy, and you do not have multisystem involvement, that would be a sign to look elsewhere for answers.  Probably starting with a thorough endoscopy either upper or lower or both, depending on where the pain is located.  Possibly with biopsies taken.", "Promising new drug  Thanks for posting this very interesting. Xolair already available just in case", "Montelukast- has anyone tried to cut back? Has anyone tried to cut down or completely go off montelukast? If so what was your approach, why, and how did it go?\n\nI have gotten most of my triggers sorted and if I am *super* strict on my food triggers my lungs do much better, but still have problems, especially for environmental triggers I cannot realistically avoid. On the other hand, I am one of those who gets side effects from montelukast- bad dreams, random negative thoughts and emotions etc. Fortunately, as I already had estrogen dominance, I went on low testosterone cream and that helps a lot. I plan to keep the testosterone, but the montelukast is becoming problematic. \n\nDoes anyone have experiences they can share? If I wished to change my prescription medications, I would first ask my physician and follow their instructions.\n\nI am sorry about your symptoms, but there is a reason these are not OTC medications. Absolutely. But also, it is perfectly reasonable for OP to ask about others' experiences when considering whether or not to ask their physician for a dosage adjustment.  Montelukast is pretty bad for me. I have mood issues on it ... totally makes sense why I had child problems while being on it as a kid 20+ years ago. I switched to Zileuton and have not looked back. Zileuton is likely a better drug anyway for mast cell issues since it blocks a higher pathway. Thank you, I have never heard of that one. I thought I would heard/read about all of them, so this is great. I will go look it up.\n\nEta I am glad you have found something that works for you! If you are in the US you might ask your doc about zafirlukast, montelukast's cousin. I quit cold turkey two weeks ago when I realized it was making me suicidal. I was only on it for about two months. I did not feel like it was helping that much but I have been more itchy since quitting. I have just been taking more zyrtec, I added Claritin, and am taking benedryl and hydroxizine at night if needed. Thanks, I have also decided I would rather take claritin regularly than risk the montelukast having a stronger effect. I am going to do half pills for a bit while I wait for my next doc appointment. I remember the half pills I was on at the beginning having a very negative effect until I added the testosterone. \n\nIt is always a juggling act, one way or another \ud83d\ude44. Trying to find some equilibrium.\n\nSo you did not notice any other reactions from quitting it like that? Thanks, I will. Nope, nothing outside the norm. I did ask my phychiatrist first and she okayed it. Cool, thanks. I was worried about exacerbating the problems with a cold turkey approach. That drug made me so loopy its not funny. I stopped after only a few days. Sorry I wish I could offer tips for if you have been on it longer. I have had other drugs make me loopy, so I know what you mean (acetaminophen for one makes me high as a kite, haha). This seems like a common thing with us, that some random drug or other does that. Yea recently every single new med I have tried has not worked... Such a wierd thing to be allergic to medications. It is usually the added/inactive ingredients, not the actual active medication- so coloring, or something one company uses to make it easier to process (like cornstarch), or any number of other excipients. That is why us masties are known for reacting to one brand or formulation but not another, and why our otc med choices are *very* specific. Although sometimes it is the active ingredient, like me and acetaminophen.\n\nEta I have had several meds simply not work in any perceivable way for me. It is always a mixed bag. I react to meds nowadays that I never used to but I do not have the money for compounding. I know what you are saying tho. I just do not have the means to find something I can tolerate. Sometimes I react to my antihistamine when I take it, like this morning. Sometimes I even react to vitamin C. But fortunately I am getting by even in a quite weakened state.\n\nBtw, with your original topic... I have had to come off another med before that I was very dependant on. My experience was that incrementally is best. However Montelukast may be a bit different, you should probably ask your prescriber for advice relating specifically to that. Sometimes pharmacist can help too. *edited the previous comment to reflect that it is my experience not advice. And took out, \"you cannot do it slowly enough\" because that may vary according to different meds.\nSorry, this was not that helpful in the end.", "What to eat after an anaphylactic reaction?

It occurred to me that if I take them both midday that perhaps I would have more relief, especially in the evening.\n\nI could ask my doc but I was looking for real-life experiences and also trying to save myself the $50 copay to see her. Thanks. One in the morning and one at night for me. Its like an extra boost at night. Thank you. That was my intention as well. One in morning and one at night works better for me than 2 at the same time Thank you! Maybe send a message to your doctor about the dosage? Anyways, my doctor has me taking two Claritin, one in the morning and one in the evening (I do it around 5) and then I take Zyrtec before bed. My doctor also gave me permission to take an extra Claritin at noon if ever need it (ragweed season can be rough for me).

Man I wish I could take only one at morning / night. \n\nI have to take two doses both morning and night ....in addition to the H1 drowsy antihistamines at night.\n\nHonestly, I would not take two doses at the same time. It greatly depends on renal function and half life's of the antihistamine. Thank you so much. I think my renal function is okay enough but I only have one kidney so I am glad you commented. So far two Claritin are doing it, now that I switched to name brand stuff. Allegra in the morning, Pepcid and singular midday (these are important!), ketotifen hydroxyzine and Zyrtec at night. This works best for me, my worst outbreaks are always at night. I vote spaced out! :) I feel I need much, much more H2s than my doc prescribed. Around 5-8 fold (or even more, which I did not try)\nTherefore the H1 do not really help me that much because of the side effects Yeah I think I am going to need something on top of the Claritin.

I have a lot GI issues caused by MCAS and its theorized that it was behind my B12 and folate deficiencies, which definitely impact nail health. I had some vitamin deficiencies including B12, too. If you are not supplementing for it, how does that get fixed when you stabilize mast cells? I still have to supplement!

Currently diagnosed with multiple food allergies (apple, tomato, peanut, pea, most tree nuts), dermatographia, fragrance allergy, allergic asthma, severe environmental allergic rhinitis, and chlorogenic urticaria. I also have migraine headaches, nightly hot flashes/chills, intermittent bloating/abdominal pain, brain fog and fatigue. Recently I was diagnosed with patulous eustachian tube which causes autophony, headaches, tinnitus and ear pain. My ENT wants me to cease all allergy medication to treat this condition. Working with my allergist I was started on immunotherapy in January, ceased Flonase, started titrating Zyrtec slowly, started taking Atrovent nasal spray, and continuing Advair diskus 500/50 twice a day. I was having severe localized reactions to the immunotherapy shots and after my third one went into anaphylaxis. Also since I started titrating Zyrtec I have had an increase in asthma flare, urticaria, abdominal pain and bloating. Immunotherapy has been stopped and I will be getting a first dose of Xolair on Monday. My igE was tested in 2019 with the result of 535.

Should I just go off all meds? Go to a different doctor. I am a well established MCAS patient. I am trying to get accepted to a research hospital because my doctor does not know how else to treat me. You should not have to provoke anaphylaxis to be tested. Do not you have to have a tryptase drawn within four hours of an episode? I had three last week but the orders came in and now I am not symptomatic. It is really a question for your doctor. Is not the order just a script you bring to the urgent care/er so they draw blood during a flare? \n\nYou do not need to provoke it, just wait until next time it happens, then go in and have it drawn. That is true. I feel really impatient and dumb but I drive a lot for work and I am constantly anxious about having an episode when I am hours away from home or in the middle of nowhere and not close to a hospital. I guess I am just trying to get it out of the way so I can try to manage symptoms and get my referrals sent off. It is super dumb but I hate the anticipation. I get the impatience, trust me, but provoking a reaction can be risky, too. I am stuck between trying to provoke one when I have my partner and epipens and hospital near by or get surprised when I am driving like I did last week. This disease sucks. You are right, though. I will not risk it. Thank you. It is not worth it. Why cannot your doctor put in an order for tryptase and you go get tested when you have a reaction? That is what mine did and I just went to the after hours lab and had blood drawn since my reaction happened in the evening. Anyways I am diagnosed with MCAS and I receive the standard treatment and my tryptase went from normal (I was diagnosed because of the tryptase rise during a reaction) to above normal in the latest tryptase test intended to check my baseline.

Hello, so even though I feel like I do not have any of these diseases, I still want to learn about them since I do not know what is wrong with me. Hopefully it will also help others. What are the key differences in symptoms, and just in general?\nMy unusual symptoms are that I get red itchy bump(s) that look like hives, and that goes away in matter of minutes, but sometimes lasts a few days. This is my only symptom, and happens on face ONLY. It happens randomly, switched between cleansers, not eating \"trigger\" foods etc. There is no observable pattern so far.\nPicture:  Honestly? Often nothing. The differentiation is often made through tests rather than symptoms. Symptom wise i do not think there is a huge difference I just think people with mastocytosis get the same symptoms but much more severe and are much more sick then MCAS. Mastocytosis is autoimmune when MCAS is not. But they take the same meds for the most part and have very similar symptoms. Mastocytosis is not autoimmune, it is a myeloid neoplasm as per the World Health Organisation classification. Aka a proliferative clonal blood disease with multiple categories from cutaneous mastocytosis all the way through to mast cell leukaemia. \n\nSymptoms are the same disease pathology is not. In mastocytosis mast cells gain a mutation and proliferate in either the skin alone and multiple organs such as bone marrow, liver and spleen. The only way to correctly diagnose it is biopsy\u2019s and the correct staining, there are also very strict criteria on how the staining should be done. \n\nThis is explains very well about mastocytosis \n\n great info thank you. Straight out of the ( website:\nMast cell diseases are caused by the proliferation and accumulation of genetically altered mast cells and/or the inappropriate release of mast cell mediators, creating symptoms in multiple organ systems. The three major forms of mast cell diseases are mastocytosis,  mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), and Hereditary Alpha tryptasemia (HAT).\"\n\nSo mastocytosis is considered a clonal condition where you body produces too many mast cells. In MCAS and HAT (this is a hereditary genetic condition), you have a normal amount of mast cells, but they behave inappropriately, releasing mediators, impacting several different organ systems. So because they involve mast cells misbehaving, many of the conditions have similar symptoms, but the underlying cause is very different. \n\nI would recommend that you visit your doctor and perhaps a dermatologist to discuss the underlying cause of your skin issues.", "Medication sensitivity?

Had to start very low and build slowly.  Caused a huge symptom flare for a while but then I adjusted and do not wish to live without it now.\n\nYou got this. How low, specifically, did you start? And u/EnergyFax too? I just got the box of ampules from the pharmacy and have no idea what I am doing. I am not sure my dosing will help you with yours, but perhaps it is not too different.  I am paying out-of-pocket for *compounded capsules*.  A single capsule has 100mg of cromolyn sodium.  I do not know how a 5ml vial compares, but are we assuming that 5ml is ONE DOSE? In my case, two capsules or 200mg are considered ONE DOSE.\n\nLooking back at my notes, I can see it took me about 2 and a half months to get up to the recommended dosing schedule: 2 caps 30 minutes before each meal (with 6oz or more water, and *on an empty stomach*) and then 2 caps with water before bed. I do not eat lunch so I maxed out at 6 caps per day, or 600mg Cromolyn total.  My doctor told me I could even dose it 4 times per day (800mg). In retrospect, I could have started with just one cap (half a dose) and hung with that for a week...  If your prescribing doctor will not give specific instructions, why not try half a vial in the way you are supposed to take it?  Give yourself 24 hrs and see what symptoms you have.  It might feel like nothing.  Or it might take a couple days to notice negative symptoms.  Who knows?  You might ramp up cautiously and feel nothing but better than how you currently feel.  \n\nAs for ramping it up, I went pretty slowly because I had uncomfortable symptoms.  I started with one dose per day (2 caps/200mg cromolyn) for two weeks. This is the period during which I felt worse, not better.  I had a \"flare\" of all my typical symptoms - extra itchy, tired, achey, bloating &amp; abdominal pain, sinus pressure, headache, etc.   I waited until my flared symptoms calmed down before adding a capsule to my dosing schedule.  I noted around week 3 that I was feeling \"better\" instead of \"shitty\" from more cromolyn. \n\n I went up to three caps per day (two before breakfast, one before dinner as an example) and moved up the dose very slowly like this, over the next several weeks.\n\nHopefully, you will not have this experience.  I mean, I hope you attain relief sooner than I did.  I also hope, especially if your insurance covers it, that it turns out to be a really beneficial medication for you.\n\nI had an unusual but not unheard of response to it :  it lessened my multiple chemical sensitivity by a small but noticeable amount.  When I explained this to my doc, he hypothesized that due to leaky gut, I was having a systemic effect from the cromolyn.  Cromolyn sodium/Gastrocrom is really a local drug - not systemic - meant to stay in the gut and help the gut specifically. So this was a weird response, but for me a good one.\n\nTaking cromolyn also improved my fatigue by a small but noticeable amount.  That is why I say I do not want to be without it now.  \n\nGood luck, friend! My personal dosing is half a vial 1 time a day for a week, then 2 times a day, then 3, then 4. I am still between 2-4 of a half vial and I have been taking it for a month. (Took it months ago but got really sick from a virus and just forgot to take it so I am restarting) I go back and forth because it can give me headaches. I havent run into any issues with not taking a whole vial at once. I still feel better at the dosing I am on.", "Flushing...Every Day For the life of my I can not stop flushing, everyday bright red ears. Nothing helps-Cromolyn, H1, H2. Does not matter. Have no idea what the trigger is, as I eat like 7 foods and drink water. My doctor is giving up as he thinks I should have had some positives from the medications, which I agree with. \n\nAnyone have any ideas how I can get this to end, I would love one day free of flushing. It is really taking a toll on my, along with my rather large weight loss, bone pain etc.\n\nThanks in advance. Are the 7 foods low histamine? Have you tried fasting for a day, does it still happen? Have you been tested for autoimmune diseases / do you have a positive ANA? Starting rupall really helped with flushing for me. Its an antihistamine and PAF blocker in one. I still flush daily but not to the level I did before. I have to get it from Canada though. Here is something from the MastAttack site: \nAt the bottom of the page is a link to more in-depth discussions of flushing. I hope it helps. MastAttack is run by a microbiologist and research scientist who has Mastocytosis herself. Aspirin? Xolair? Which foods? All foods are low histamine, low Fodmap. Tried fasting a few months back during the summer and I still flushed. Typical flushing happens past 3 PM. Been tested, came back negative. Thanks for the link. A shame I cannot take Asprin as I have a kidney issue. I will look into it. Thanks Cannot do Asprin unfortunately. Have not tried Xolair yet. Same active ingredients? Super boring-chicken, pork, rice, carrots, cereal, eggs Well, at least something! (The only thing I can eat is fresh figs sprinkled with some antihistamines lol) \nIt could be the egg whites though. Those are a strong histamine liberator. (Also they inhibit proper digestion, are inflammatory etc.) You could try to just eat the yolks and see if it improves. :) Ugh sorry to hear! \n\nI have gone a couple weeks without eggs too. I will keep searching! Have you tried a more systemic mast cell stabilizer like quercetin or ketotifen? Xolair? The facial and neck flushing calmed down a lot when I was put on cromolyn sodium...but I just remembered I had another source of flushing. It was primarily my ears, nose and hands, and the flushing felt very hot to the touch. In my case that specific flushing appears to have been erythromelalgia and the underlying cause was a folate deficiency and low B12 levels. Those vitamin deficiencies appear to be indirectly caused by the GI inflammation caused by the mast cells. After about 2-3 months of being on the vitamins the flushing and other neurological problems went away. I have tried none of those. It is really sad because I have brought these up to my doctor and he will not prescribe me anything different since Cromolyn did not work. Maybe I can give the quercertin a shot since it is OTC, right? Yes, its OTC. Id also suggest a new doctor. That sucks, sorry. I have heard some people also do not tolerate aspirin on its own 'merits', too.\nI hope you find something that works. Aspirin, Xolair, Zileuton has helped significantly. \n\nI can only take aspirin sporadically because of being on anticoagulants but relatively Zileuton and Xolair has been beneficial nonetheless. If I eat something that causes a strong reaction or have strong emotions, I will still flush badly though... Well technically I still flush for everything but it is definitely not that bad compared to prior getting on Xolair and Zileuton. \n\nI am not on Cromolyn due to insurance atm. Agree with the new Doc. He is a jackass. Try going for immunostimulants or immunosupressants some patients have better response to the first and some to the latter.  stuff like prednisone and it is analogues. Try keto or carnivore diet", "Preferences between hydroxyzine (Ataraxia) versus Doxepin? I have taken both. I am presently taking hydroxyzine but I think I might switch back to Doxepin for the mental health side of things as well. Has anyone noticed if Doxepin is helpful with itching? I am pretty sensitive to it, so I know the sedating effects will be a bit of a doozy to get readjusted to. I took Doxepin before I knew I had MCAS so I was not looking for physical MCAS symptom relief at the time. I had to look up doxepin. It is a tricyclic antidepressant? What MCAS symptoms did it help you with? Yes, it is a TCA, but this class of antidepressants is often helpful with migraine headaches and insomnia. I took it for depression and insomnia the year before I was diagnosed with MCAS. My immunologist just brought it up to me again as an alternative to hydroxyzine. She noted it is also helpful with skin reactions (itching, from my understanding). I did realize that after I switched to a different antidepressant medication in mid 2019 (approximately three weeks after my switch) I began having anaphylaxis, so I think Doxepin did help cub symptoms for a while even though I did not know it. I have not taken any mental health medications since last summer but with the episodic nature of depression and our current living circumstances I think I might need one again. Well-glad it works for you. I guess I do not know how it would replace an antihistamine if the reactions are histamine mediated, but if it works...it works. It is probably an off label use of the medication, which is why you cannot find anything on it. It is the same for migraines - it is approved by the FDA as a TCA, but has other off-label benefits. I was just looking to see if anyone who had taken it before saw those benefits. Got it. Good luck!", "Mold Exposure Does anyone here know if they get flares from exposure to airborne mold in their living places? What do you do to manage it? I rent and my landlord is family and they will not get a cleaner service (not to mention its $$$). Mold is one of my biggest triggers. If I am living in a place where there is any at all that a healthy person could identify, I will just... never be OK. Ever. I use an air purifier and HEPA-sealed vacuum, but that is just to keep things alright in an already mostly-clean environment. If you absolutely cannot move or clean up, probably the only thing that would help is wearing a good filter mask or nasal filters whenever you are at home. Thanks. Do you have any possible recommendations on a brand of effective nasal filters that are easy to fit in? Woodyknows Super Defense Filters are the ones that work best for me. The frames come in 3 sizes and 2 shapes, and they sell a variety pack so you can try different ones. Wowzers I used to dream of something like this and it is been there all along!? \n\nDo you find the plastic itself to smell fumey? I would be worried about that setting me off... No, it is just silicone. They sell charcoal filters too, but they have to be replaced really often so I do not usually use them. There are other brands of nasal filters that are a bit better shaped to make them easier to keep in, but their filters are not as effective. Thanks so much for the info! I am going to order some :) Sorry I have no advice since I am nomadic. I have shifted living situations multiple times because of mold. My face breaks out in a red rash that easily bleeds, I develop breathing issues and cough up phlegm and I feel horribly dizzy. Sometimes I have been stuck in a place like that for a while due to finances but whenever I can I just pack up and leave. One possibility you could use is an air purifier, tho I have never tried. If you have got a permanent base it might be worthwhile tho", "Is having elevated liver enzymes related to mast cell disease? ", "GP's armchair diagnosing people on reddit and dismissing their symptoms Hi All,  \n\nI had to share this because this is a perfect in-the-flesh example of the kind of narrow minded self righteous crap we have to deal with all the time from the medical profession that causes us emotional stress, prevents us getting better or even makes us worse, and costs us thousands of dollars and lost time and life.  \n\nIt is not like me to speak so offensively to people - but I could not help it in this case - and being I am dealing with heightened sympathetic nervous system and brain fog at the moment I could not word my replies more eloquently.  \n\nHave a look at the replies from /r/tunesx10 in this thread.  \nHe dug up an old thread to tell me it is all in my head.  \n\n\n\nWhat do you think? Further to this by kind of off-topic; are there any good CIRS or mycotoxin subreddits?  \nI searched but cannot find any. Checked into his post history and he is (1) obsessed with anxiety, (2) a fraud, and (3) a condescending, not super bright douche. \n\nClaims to have a \u201cphd in medicine.\u201d There is no such thing. \n\nAppalling grammar. Cannot tell the difference between \u201cyour\u201d and \u201cyou are,\u201d or \u201ctheir\u201d and \u201cthey are.\u201d \n\nInsults anyone who disagrees with him. \n\nIf he had anything intelligent or thoughtful or additive to say, I would gladly look past the above. But he fails all the tests. \n\nEdit:  and seriously, this is medical law and medical practice 101:  do not diagnose people you are not treating. What a tool. \n\nThanks for giving me a good candidate to block. Hey thanks for looking.  \nNot that I need defending from these tools - but I must confess I was somewhat triggered given my experiences with dismissive professionals, and also I treat people with respect and benefit of the doubt by default - so it opens me up to honestly trying to talk to them which does not work if the other side does not show the same honesty.  \n\nSo hearing what you said makes me feel a bit better about it :)  \n\n:fistbumpemoji: :)\n\n\nAnd yes I had picked up on the grammar and general formatting - but I try not to judge on such things. Completely understand. We have all been there. \n\nConsider thinking of it slightly differently:  engaging feeds this guy\u2019s ego. He is pretending to be a doctor and getting off on the aura of authority. In one hilarious comment, he told a commenter that he \u201cexpected\u201d an answer.  It is ducking Reddit. I am betting that in real like he lives in his mother\u2019s basement and blames the women around him for being superficial when they refuse to date him. \n\nSorry he triggered you. Internet hug. He is not worth your time and you know your issues better than any internet stranger ever will. Wishing you a better night. Hey - yeah no totally agree with regard to not feeding the trolls.  \nBut as I said, I reply in good faith to begin with - as it is not clear it is trolling to begin with. He is likely not a GP but a GPwannabe. Quite honestly, I struggle with the same thing. But I will admit that I have developed a much shorter fuse with them over the past few years, and my radar for spotting them is finely tuned (a telltale giveaway is an entitled demand for deeply personal information, which makes me see red immediately). I wish there were not so many, but with the Reddit mask of anonymity, people like to play games. You sound like a thoughtful, kind, grounded person. I hope it is contagious. :-) You too!  \n\nAlso when I said triggered I was not meaning so much in a 'snowflake' kind of way (not to sound derogatory)   \n\nI more mean I got sucked in when I should know better. I read you as you intended. People like us do not have decades of chronic illness without developing a thick skin. :-) There is no way he is a doctor and if he is, he is not YOUR doctor so whatever he says does not apply to you and your situation. My bet is he is posing as a medical professional. I had a guy tell people he was a law student and he was going against the rules, providing legal advice, so I reported him to the school he said he attended. He was not even in law school. Guarantee it is the same situation. Hey,  \nYeah course what he says does not apply to me - I was more calling out the behavior in general, as the world needs less schmucks like that.   \n\nOne can only hope he is a poser and not any kind of professional.

We are all with you.", "Absence of severe symptomology and response to medicines Hey all, since learning about this disease I have developed quite a bit of anxiety about it. I have some symptoms, but nothing I have felt would be what I consider as severe. I have even placed myself on double h1s and h2s and have tried multiple brands. I have also added vitamin c into the mix, and changed my diet a bit and noticed practically no change in how I felt despite doing all this. I have brought this up with my allergist and he does not seem to believe I have the condition, as well as no one else in my family that I have made read about it thinking I have it either. Is the lack of a severe episodic symptomology and a lack of a noticeable response to medicines a fairly clear sign that someone does not have this condition? The fact that the tests for it are so inaccurate and even with negative ones, the condition cannot be completely ruled out has only added to my anxiety about it.  \n\nThis is a great resource with test explanations, diagnostic criteria, and advice nurses you can email. You are more likely not to have this than you are to have it, so if your doctor indicated it is unlikely and you are on the standard medications that treat it without relief then it is not likey. NAD, but as someone with illness anxiety, keep working with your doctor to find answers to your symptoms. Ultimately it comes down to the round peg/square hole saying - do not force your symptoms to meet criteria that they do not meet.  I am assuming you possibly also posted \n( and \n(\n\nEither way, it sounds like nothing we say here can really reassure you. Are you getting professional help for your anxiety?

He is in his 20s and since his friend died last year he has seemed to develop some serious health anxiety. He has discovered this disease and because of the vagueness and difficulty of diagnosis, he seems to have latched on and cannot let go. I, do not believe he has this but I was hoping some of the people here that actually do suffer from this condition can shed some light on it for me, and maybe I can show him. This all started last year when he started complaining of a headache that would not go away. He went to several doctors and even had an MRI and despite their reassurance, he still believed something was wrong. He then discovered this condition and subsequently went to see an allergist/immunologist and a GI doctor that also do not believe that he has this condition. The allergist was not a specialist on it, but he knew what the condition was and had been to conferences on it in the past. He stopped eating normally and lost around 20lbs and I genuinely became worried about him. After my encouragement, he finally went to the psychiatrist to discuss his anxiety.  He has almost no severe symptoms that severely impact his daily life that I have noticed and since going to the psychiatrist and starting on zoloft he has begun eating a more normal diet once again and has put weight back on and looks normal once more. His headache went away and he is almost normal from what I can tell health-wise. Today he was even cleaning his bathroom with bleach and lysol and had no noticeable effects from them. He is able to eat high histamine things such as leftovers and cheese now with minimal effects and he definitely has not suffered from any severe episodic symptoms. When he does complain of things, they seem to be occurring in isolation and not systemically. He has been a fairly healthy kid most of his life and definitely has not ever been chronically sick. He never had asthma and only has normal seasonal allergies that are quite mild. However, he still thinks he may have this condition periodically. Is it something that we should seriously consider based on what I have written? I should also add that he is never had any sensitivity to medicines SSRIs can suppress IgE-induced mast cell responses. He was not really having any serious symptoms before the Zoloft either though and went to several doctors before the psychiatrist that did not believe he had it. Having a headache that will not go away is serious. That would be awful. Yeah, but it was not like a migraine. I think it primarily came from his stress about it. It went away and has not came back in over a year. When he started eating low histamine or when he started the SSRI? Before either. He stopped focusing on it as much and it went away. He does not eat low histamine at all right now and he seems fine. He ate leftovers from Thanksgiving and was fine I refused to believe I was sick until my daily executive functioning was severely lacking. Even then my doctor had to sit me down and give me a reality check on how sick I was because I was not taking it seriously. (After multiple anaphylactic events)\n\nSounds like your son just has severe anxiety and mild allergies. Thoughts can make people sick so I would remind him if he hyperfocuses on it he might make himself even sicker. Okay. Thank you for your reply. That is what we all seem to think. I will show him this It is hubris to believe all human illnesses are known to science.  Doctors simply cannot diagnose all illness.  People with undiagnosed illness will latch onto various theories of illness that sound similar to their problems. Meanwhile, psychology will happily claim the right to treat anything which cannot be diagnosed/treated physically.  That does not make psychology the solution.  Psychology works when it works.  It fails when it cannot work.\n\nBe supportive.  Pay attention to the progression of the illness. Keep an open mind. Seek ways to avoid/neutralize triggers. Document what you learn.  Share what you learn. No offense but this is not really the thing to read or show someone who is experiencing health anxiety.  And I believe his doctors are quite knowledgeable. There is been no progression of any illness. I did not write my comment for you to show to your son.  I wrote it for you.  I hope your son is healthy and just experiencing some anxiety.\n\nMany of the people who follow this group fell ill, were ignored by doctors, and experienced friends and family try to convince them their illness was not real.

The next morning I felt nauseous in a way I did not expect and then that night I had horrible diarrhea (unusual for me). \n\nI realize that by posting this on reddit I am just fueling my anxiety, but I am worried that I have retained some of it due to the fact that most of the water I drank exited my body via the diarrhea rather than through my kidneys. Yes I have read everything on gadolinium deposits in the body being safe for most people. \n\nPlease do not post anything scary in response to this, I have scared myself enough already. I am just looking for reassurance. Thank you. If you had the diarrhea right after the water, it might be something to worry about. Since the diarrhea was the next night, it seems like your body would have already done what it needed to with the water. The dye is out of your system in 24 hours. I would assume it was from the large meal. Contrast dye can cause mild diarrhea but the dye doesnt stay in the body like you are thinking. And, mast cell reactions are often delayed for various reasons for up to 24 hours (e.g. symptoms being caused by a metabolite of a released mediator). So even if you reacted to the dye, it still could have been excreted before the symptoms of the reaction started. Very good point I totally missed. Do you know what brand you were given?\n\nWhen I drink water I tend to pee half an hour later. In other words, the water goes thru my system pretty quickly. \n\nIt sounds like you had diarrhea the next day? You would have already passed all that water thru your kidneys.\n\nAlso when you digest your small intestine pulls water into it from your blood, then your  small intestine and colon lets that water back into your blood. Diarrhea prevents the colon from reabsorbing the water, hence the watery stools.\n\n Thanks - I called the radiology center and they would not tell me what kind it was, just that it was gadolinium. \n\nI should have also mentioned that my vein broke the first time the tech administered it so some of it leaked under my skin. A day after the diarrhea I got horrible abdominal pain and upper back pain that I have been dealing with since, and GERD. Now three weeks later I have lost my sense of taste and am experiencing pins and needles.\n\nI will concede that I have some degree of health anxiety but I am just very worried about gadolinium toxicity due to the fact that some of it leaked under my skin (rather than went in my vein). There is no way for my body to expel that since it was not in my vein. Thanks - the tech messed up the first time she tried to administer it so some of it leaked under my skin. There is no way to know how that could get out of my system since it is not in my veins. Its slowly absorbed into your circulation system and expelled through urinating. It doesnt stay in you. You can have a mast cell reaction up to like 72 hours after exposures.  Does not matter how long the actual substance stuck around in OP's body. Not just 24.  72.

Initially, reading mast cell stories, I thought for certain I could not possibly have that. I have only been searching for some possibilities to explain the mysterious symptoms, and went down the list of things related or often comorbid with CFS (which I def have but does not explain everything). That is why I am here.\n\nSo I have had random symptoms of unexplained things came and went throughout my life. I have always that they were unrelated, and anyway doctor visits were *very* rare growing up. I was seen as sensitive and taught not to complain. \n\nSince the onset of the cfs, some symptoms and sensitivities got way worse, while others went away.\n\n**Symptoms pre-CFS**\n\n- heat sensitivity since baby. Sometimes got heat rashes. Sometimes not.\n\n- random shortness of breath. Like randomly it was like I needed more oxygen than the air I was breathing was giving me. I did not know I did this til I was older---my mom told me I did this as a kid.\n\n- random patches of discolored, terribly itchy skin. Sometimes seems to be triggered my some clothing, others idk, but I threw away some clothes bc of it.\n\n- not *hives*, but regularly get a single bump. Sometimes, I will get a few scattered around. Sometimes from nothing notable, sometimes after I shower.\n\n- also got multiple hives (4-100s) covering bigger areas, but only on occasion. Guaranteed hives with pit-fruit and some nuts, only on skin contact. I can eat them fine... I think?\n\n- ok I *do* get reactions (bloating to deep aches and diarrhea/constipation) with some nuts, sometimes. But *only sometimes*. Other times I eat it and it is fine. \n\n- about 1 year in 4th grade or so, had the most horrible, throbbing, pounding headaches. Constantly. Eventually they went away. I told no one back then. Never got it checked.\n\n- mucous. I thought it was normal, but since my partner moved in, I realized they do not alwaus have tissues for their regular mucous. I, on the other hand, have constant tissue pile by my bed.\n\n- itchy skin in general. There is not always something there. Perhaps due to autism sensory sensitivity?\n\n- felt ill around strong chemical smells\n\n- mild sensitivities to sugar and caffeine. Was addicted to sugar for a long while. \n\n- gut issues!!! Periods of chronic diarrhea, and when it got bad, I might go 7+ times or more in a day. Past couple years it is gotten mild. \n\n- general weakness. But I had low muscle tone, clumsy, and was easily fatigued as a child and that is probably more due to autism, plus restricted diet with little to no nutrition. \n\n\n\n\n**Since CFS onset, also comes and goes** 24-27 years\n\n- pretty much every normal cfs symptom, except chronic pain. Pain comes and goes but not that bad. Also some symptoms only appear with PEM.\n\n- artificial heat can... inspire... flu like symptoms. Not always\n\n- hot cold hot cold! What does it mean?!\n\n- when severe, pots like symptoms. When mild/moderate, little to no pots like symptoms\n\n- I was always sensitive to strong chemical smells, but since cfs, i cannot stand very many natural scents either. One natural lotion gets me flu-like from scent, the other gives me itchy rash bumps (finding products is a nightmare) \n\n- headaches range moderate to mild. Rarely severe. \n\n- brain foooogggg!!!! Not every day. Here and there. Sometimes after eating. Sometimes just randomly. Sometimes severe, sometimes very mild. \n\n- instances after eating, I would feel faint. Or dizzy. Or just unwell.\n\n- obv had very horrible reactions to the fires, pretty quickly. Pem got very bad.\n\n- acid reflux. Pretty normal.\n\n- itchy scalp!!! There is plenty flakes, sometimes acne? Normal itchy is fine but some products really inflame my head. I still have not found the perfect hair products :(\n\n- chronic athletes foot. It does not get that much worse. But does not go away and is there most of the year. I used to get it every once in a while, but when it got bad it spread to my hands. Thank heavens i got rid of my hand fungus. The issue is, most products that \"helps athletes foot\" seem to cause adverse reaction and get super inflamed.\n\n- very recurrent oral herpes. Normal I guess for cfs as well as the sore throats and everything else. Immune system being weak maybe? Idk. \n\n- heart pounding. Happens more with a reaction to food/substance/scent/etc.\n\n- tolerance to caffeine has gone haywire. Sometimes have very bad reactions to coffee. Not always.\n\n- tolerance to smoking cigarettes (i mainly smoked only 1 cig a day) gone haywire. Makes me sick more often than not. But not always.\n\n- tolerance to marijuana, haywire. Get sick easier, and causes mood swings often. But not always.\n\n- tolerance to alcohol, haywire. I am very careful as a result. But not always.\n\n- tolerance to *vitamins* gone haywire. Now I am very careful with some vitamins. \n\n- random reactions to food? Idk. Every so often I will get this hot feeling, then feel like fainting, then feel... idk... desperate? then get sick... probably mild food poisoining.\n\n\n\n**Notable events**\n\n- last August, ate a kelp supplement. Used to be fine to eat once in a while, but this time I had a toxic iodine overdose reaction... to a normal dosage. Wtf? Was worse than all my PEM (which gets pretty bad), combo vomit, crazy cramps, almost went to the emergency room but really wanted to avoid it bc covid. At worst, shortness of breath,, but not that long, and also could have been due to anxiety from feeling so so bad for no reason. Ended up calling poison control. One of the few instances in my life I thought I was going to die lol. Worse than past food poisoning experiences.\n\n- speaking of food poisoning, I had quite a few instances where I seemed to have mild food poisoning in recent years. I would share food but would be the only one to get sick. Idk. What Is up with that? \n\n- also had a toxic reaction to zinc, also with a normal dosage. Which i normally am fine as long as I eat with food. But this time, I was very ill. \n\n- had a toxic reaction also to some herbal sleep supplements. To this day, idk which ingredient made me react. Melatonin seems fine. Valerian seems fine? I think.\n\nI should note I had no outbreak of hives with the \"overdoses\". Which is the main reason I do not think this is MCAS. \n\nI guess the main reason I ended up here is on my hunt for products that do not inflame me, I got led to someone describing things they found safe for mast cell disorders. And I relate super hard to that aspect: the impossibility of finding products and food that work.  \n\nMy life for the past few years has been, there is a random issue, I use regular topical or internal thing for the random issue, then that creates some other random reactive issue, which getting rid of that, I create another issue, etc. Etc. Etc. Like a circus, around and around. Not fun though.\n\nPerhaps it is just a gut issue. Idk. Or perhaps it is just that CFS made my body struggle to tolerate things. Or idk. \n\nI am probably forgetting some other random symptoms but this is so long. Maybe no one will answer. Eek. With no history of anaphylaxis or recurring hives, I would look into some other disorders before narrowing in on MCAS.  It might also be worth looking into Ehlers Danlos. Does not sound like Mast Cell to me beyond some (albeit very frustrating) vauge symptoms that can be caused by other diseases and/or autism sensory issues, but you should get some bloodwork done to check your histamine/tryptase levels Someone else once suggested Ehlers Danlos too. I have not ruled it out, mainly bc I am autistic and mildly hypermobile, but I do not think so---the same way that lack of recurrent hives make me doubt MCAS, lack of chronic debilitating pain makes me doubt EDS. \n\nI honestly do not know what the issues are, and my last GP was like... *shrug* \"I do not know what to do for you, so I asked reddit lol, maybe people might have, um, a better direction in what to check for. I am currently changing doctors bc obviously I have gone nowhere with my previous one. Why cannot there be clear answers, clear treatments, and I move on with my life?! -.- lol.\n\nBut I will take your advice and push for checking histamine/tryptase. Last doctor refused to check allergies (is that the same thing?) bc she said it is impossible to check every food or substance i get into contact with. First off, I do not have hives ever, just flushing like you described. 70% of people with MCAS have hives which means 30% do not. I also do not go into anaphylaxis in terms of airways- but my blood pressure drops horribly when having a reaction and I sometimes pass out/fall asleep suddenly once I lay down and my adrenaline crashes after getting home. I just do not have my airway close up. I am a \u201cleaker\u201d not a \u201cshocker\u201d when it comes to reactions apparently. \n\nI am lab diagnosed with MCAS and I have it pretty bad. Mast cell stabilizers paired with an antihistamine made a world of difference and I would recommend trying one if you have got the money because it is the easiest test. Also I can work now and I could not before. \n\nAlso tryptase is an easy test but negative is common for MCAS. \n\nA lot of that did sound familiar, but it could still be other things. Or it could be histamine intolerance or oral food allergy considering your GI symptoms. \n\nFamiliar: the flu like symptoms after exposure. The cycle of symptoms you described after eating randomly sometimes (the feeling of desperation could be the symptom \u201csense of impending doom\u201d that comes with low stage anaphylaxis or high allergy reaction). The constant nose drip. The heart pounding, the reaction to normal scents. The reaction to alcohol. Blood pressure issues in reaction to foods. The random issues with some supplements are usually reactions to fillers. All of which could also be an allergy or histamine intolerance. \n\nOther indicators of potential MCAS- flying really bad for you, reacting to pressure or vibrations, do you have really long hangovers? Can you write on your skin. Family members with similar issues. \n\nRegardless: a Neti pot might help to get scents out of your nose so you do not keep reacting to strong scents after being exposed to them. Have you looked into Candida? Many of your symptoms would suggest this. Itching, shortness of breath, diarrhea, hives/rashes, food sensitivities, constant fatigue/low energy, headaches. Maybe try a candida diet for a few weeks, and look into taking enzymes on an empty stomach. There will be die-off at first, you may get sicker before you start to feel better. Candida is a bitch to get rid of, it takes time and commitment but it is worth it. I had to deal with candida after an extensive period on antibiotics, My Dr. prescribed 2 different anti-fungal medications in addition to modifying my diet and taking some supplements. Beep. Boop. I am a robot.\nHere is a copy of \n\n###( \n\nWas I a good bot? | ( | ( I have basically the these same symptoms, notably the random heart pounding after eating many types of food and the intolerance to caffeine, both thing that I never had and were worsening over time.\n\nA short time ago I started having anaphylaxis crisis (which we are not sure are anaphylaxis, right?) almost every day, so I dug up a bit and found about ketotifen fumarate, a mast cell stabilizer. It is considered a safe medication, OTC allowed. I started taking 2mg daily and a week later I was 90% better. Today is a month later and I still do not dare to drink a cup of coffee lulz, but things have improved a lot. I advise you to test this one ;} Its a frustrating disease! I lost my job, athleticism, and social life 5 years ago when it got to its worst. But it is treatable, if not curable.\n\nAllergy tests are to check for specific IgE allergies, like pollen and shellfish. These are the kind of allergies you will have no confusion over. As an example my throat closes and my eyes swell shut when I eat seafood, so I never bothered to get an allergy test. It is incredibly expensive and laborious to get a full allergy panel, so if there is no safety risk they will not push for it. My brother who had anaphylaxis as an infant got a full allergy panel, and I was offered one after being hospitalized for Mast Cell the second time. I declined, because several specialists questioned its usefulness to me.\n\nMany people who think they have an allergy have an intolerance of some sort. As an example, strawberries give me stomach cramps and nausea. My throat does not close and I do not get an itchy sensation on the inside of my mouth, nor do I get hives. This may raise my histamine levels, but is different from a classical allergy.\n\nChecking for histamine/tryptase is to see if these chemicals are baseline elevated in your body, which indicates Mast Cell disease. They can also do a bone marrow biopsy. \n\nA much easier and cheaper way to check is to take an antihistamine daily and see if it helps. It being helpful does not neccesary confirm a diagnosis, but it will make you feel better as you figure things it\n\nBest of luck! Can someone help? I had Covid, and was fine for 11 months but woke up a week ago to pressure heaches and now my pelvic area and right side/upper ribcage are suddenly painfully inflamed. I was feeling mostly normal the last 11 months with the exeption of burning rashes/flushing occasionally, occasional nausea, etc. This came on suddenly and I also have pain up my arm and bone pain. I am going to urgent care tomorrow but problem is I dont know where to srart or what to say since the medical community seems to be in the dark about MCAS. How do get myself out of this flare? After reading up on MCAS causing Covid I feel  like this is definitely what I am experiencing, but Benedryl hasnt been any relief. MCAS does not cause COVID. Have you already suspected/been diagnosed with MCAS, or are these your first symptoms? While MCAS can be activated by a virus it does need to be chronic and to have other conditions ruled out to be diagnosed. The only symptoms that sound familiar to me could be the rash/flushing/nausea but that could also be you developing an allergy to something. Have you gotten checked out for allergies yet? Probably since it is been 11 months but got to check. Also you could be allergic to something not tested for in the common panel. \n\nIf Benadryl has done nothing you could try a mast cell stabilizer. That is how MCAS people get out of flares. However I do not think your current pressing symptoms have anything to do with MCAS? You should make sure it is not something else even if you are diagnosed with MCAS. &amp;#x200B;\n\nHi there u/Razirra,\n\nI am sorry, I was typing that with extreme BRAIN FOG. I meant to type COVID causing MCAS. ( As Lyme and other chemicals, viruses and even breast implants can trigger it ).\n\nI unfortunately had Covid way before mask mandates and way before the government was being honest about what we were dealing with so I was still working my airport job around crowds and travelers. On the first night of the lockdowns I coughed and then thought...it cant be that. I say that to say if I knew more at the time, I would not have probably caught Covid, once I was more aware of what we were actually dealing with, I never left the house. I havent returned to work and I order groceries in, and am very strict about good quality masks, I also never have company.\n\nMy initial illness was mild, with the exception of a wicked cough. I recovered quickly with just Tylenol and a multivitamin ( there were no treatments then and no testing but I was diagnosed Covid by the doctor. I never had a fever or lost sense of taste or smell.\n\nI recovered within 2  weeks easily and thought I saw the last of Covid. My life returned to normal except for I noticed I would get chest rashes that burned here and there. Then I started having allergic type reactions on my hands, vasidolation, demogratophia, and occasional hives on my stomach. I noticed only coconut oil works for my hands, anything else they break out into hives, turn red and my veins swell. I thought if this was all I was dealing with Post- Covid, I was fine. \n\nSome of the other Long Haulers had it worse (  EXTREME body aches, fatigue, POTS, and multisystem inflammatory syndrome where their organs are inflammed) but mostly I just noticed rashes, flushing, hives and my heart/pulse beating after I ate. This continued for a while, but as I said the Benedryl always quickly cleared up my rashes or flushing, I never noticed heart beating or nausea were related til later.  I was drinking and eating just fine around Christmas until one day I cooked nightshades and began to cough and couldnt breathe well. I took nightshades out of my diet. Celebrated NYE like anyone else, but the champagne was giving me nausea, but suprisingly my hangover wasnt too bad and I was able to walk long distances, so no malaise, I did notice I get mildly lightheaded if I stand quickly but I do not think I have many POTS symptoms.\n\nFast forward to January 27th, the whole day I started having terrible brain fog followed by pressure headaches with sinus type pressure. My nose became increasingly strong, I could smell everything. Everyday I woke up the headaches got worse, and the pressure was never ending.  I started reading up on MCAS which I had heard of in the Long Hauler support groups and saw several parallels. If you check out the you tube page , RUN- DMC, you will see many videos that make a correlation between Covid and MCAS, they speak to MCAS specialists that are treating long covid patients. ( \n\nI noticed that my symptoms I have been having for several months could be MCAS, and then yesterday I woke up with right side upper abdomen pain, right arm pain, bone pain and swelling around my pelvis, I had the headache full blast. I started having a meltdown and thought I would ask here for answers. I have terrible insomnia after Covid and so I couldnt get to bed. I also get worse feeling at night and have adrenaline shocks that wake me out of sleep. Last night I got better after taking Benedryl and using on ice pack on my swelling and head. Today my body is still achey in the places from yesterday but I feel better and have not taken any antihistamines today  ( I hope this flare up of whatever is over, is over since this is day 21).\n\n My Quercertin supplement just arrived and Nasal Crom should come tomorrow although my sinuses feel better. Sorry I mispoke above. \n\nI was looking for help because if MCAS IS what I have now I would like to get it treated right away and not be self treating ( although I may start Zyrtec and Pepcid H1/H2 in the meantime.) My GP doesnt seem to believe in Long Covid and is not familiar with MCAS and just told me my headaches were due to the weather change. I think hes somewhat right about weather change as it is bitterly cold in the midwest and that overall cant help body function but I dont think all of this is due to weather. I have never had allergies or flushing in my life until now but lately I have been eating low histamine and juicing and havent had any rashes in a few days.\n\nI probably need a specialist since my GP is not too helpful.  I was asking here if anyone knows of a functional doctor or allergist familiar with the condition that I could follow up with ( I live in Chicago).\n\nBecause of Covid longhaulers coming into the picture, MCAS will probably start being researched more, and more research and funding hopefully means more treatments and understanding for everyone here. Thankyou for your help! Sorry for the long winded reply.\n\n\\- Roo", "MCAS Doctor NYC/NJ Anyone have a good referral? I was being seen by a Mastocytosis Specialist, who does not know squat about MCAS. His course of action, if Cromolyn does not work, then you do not have MCAS.

I have CFS long trips are out, ditto with walking around in a large city. Everyone I have tried to contact in North Jersey is clueless. Have not thought of Eastern PA, but I assumed it would be similar. Could be wrong though. Thanks! Will look into it. NJ Monthly rates top docs every year, maybe start there.   University of Pennsylvania Allergy and immunology. I see Dr. Fadugba but every doctor in that office is very knowledgeable about mastocytosis and other mast cell disorders. Afrin is a total quack who is only incentive to help is financial. Curious as to why you think that? What was your experience? Oof where to start. They essentially kept my test results hostage from my other immunologists/gp until I paid them $2200 for another video chat with him. They hock vitamins in their lobby. It is a pay to play system with them that takes advantage of people who are at their most desperate. Have you tried Dr Castells in Boston? I am not sure where you are located but there are more options these days than a Lyme practice in some office park in Westchester.", "Severe medication intolerance I have not been able to add in any new medications successfully.

How long have been eeperienced this? I have severe medciation and food intolerance too.", "Blood work I am new to all this. I have been having major health problems for years. I have been telling my PCP about it and they just dismiss it. I have been doing research on my symptoms and they seem to be similar to someone who has mast cell activation syndrome, it was basically everything I was experiencing. I have low iron and I get infusions and I see a hematologist. I told him that all my symptoms seem to be similar to someone who had mast cell activation. He looked at my cbc and metabolic panel of blood work and flat out told me no I do not have mast cell activation. Primary doctor refuses to refer me to any specialist and just tells me that I just need to exercise :/  I was wondering if a doctor could tell if someone has mast cell by regular blood work, or does a special type of blood test have to be done in order to see if someone has it?The only other thing that has some of my symptoms is PoTS but I am tried of being the only one who is trying to figure out what is wrong with me. Doctors just do not seem to care. They are basically implying everything I am experiencing is all in my head. I am sure the odds of me having mast cell is extremely low and more than likely I probably do not have it. When reading about it I basically have every symptom but  anaphylaxis. I have never experienced\nanaphylaxis. Since I am new to all this I am not sure if that is a requirement, but most of the website I researched on tends to put emphasis on experiencing anaphylaxis. I get hives on my chest and my face and chest will be flushed and get bright red and becomes hot feeling. It is very hard to tell the difference in Mast cell and PoTS because I seem to have many common symptoms of them both. I am thinking of spending out of pocket to see a specialist at this point because my primary told me they will not refer me to anyone.  I am thinking it is between a allergy doctor or a cardiologist but do not know which of the two would be best to start with. Any suggestions on where I should start with would be greatly appreciated. I just feel so overwhelmed. The blood tests are specialized. You will most likely need to see an allergist/immunologist with previous mast cell disease knowledge. This reads almost exactly the same as my wife's story.  Demand a referral, and it is best to find a Dr that has experience with MCAS and POTS and not just any allergist (if at all possible).  We are still struggling to get a diagnosis.  They definitely cannot tell from a normal blood work up either.\n\nMy wife has been trying to wear compression socks and consume more salt for the POTS - that made a noticeable difference for her. \n\nFor MCAS she is trying to avoid foods high in histamine.  That has been hit or miss.  \n\nNeither were that big of an issue until about 6 months ago after eating some spicy sausage and restarting wheat after avoiding it for several months.  It is been a rough go since then. Mast Cell means different things to different people.  Some Doctors are only going to acknowledge certain Mast Cell disorders like Mastocytosis. These are rare disorders.  There are tests for these disorders.  These disorders often leave effects on the body that be seen in scans and biopsies.\n\nMCAS on the other hand does not have a good test.  There is not a complete understanding of what is going on in the bodies of people diagnosed MCAS.  A diagnosis of MCAS just means you meet certain criteria.  Treatment involves diet changes, antihistamines, and mast cell stabilizers.  However, a lot of people diagnosed MCAS who are on those treatments continue to have a lot of problems.\n\nKnowing this, you need to assume the majority of Doctors do not diagnose MCAS.  They will look at your tests and tell you you do not have any of the Mast Cell Disorders.  That is it for them.  It is not a rare response from one doctor.  That is the common response.\n\nIf you want to explore MCAS, you need to see certain doctors that are willing to diagnose MCAS.  There are two things to consider if you seek an MCAS diagnosis.  First is, Doctors that know MCAS do not have some greater understanding of the universe than other Doctors. They are just well read in a theory of illness that is still being researched.  Second, poorly understood illness is the breeding ground of snake oil salesmen.  If someone is over promising, or asking you to pay out of pocket, then something is not right.  MCAS can be diagnosed with two office visits, a blood test, and a prescription for antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers.  They see you, do a blood test, have you take the meds for a few months, then follow up.  If you meet the criteria, they follow up once or twice a year. You need to go to an Allergist that specializes, or is at least educated, in mast cell disorders.  I am in the midst of this testing right now.  Tryptase and N-Methylhistamine are both elevated.  The 24 hour urine test goes out to Mayo Clinic, and I just noticed on my results that it is not FDA cleared yet, so that is prob why not a lot of doctors know to use it.  Appointment is next week to discuss results and next steps.  I experienced a severe, serious vaccine reaction and was punted from specialist to specialist for the last 8 months.  I have had more labwork and imaging over this period of time than at all times in my life combined, but not one doctor thought \u201chmm, maybe this is an immune or mast cell issue.\u201d  I self-referred based on ongoing symptoms, and luckily I found a great Allergist/immunologist who immediately recognized the symptoms and ordered the labwork.

I do not have evidence in a test yet. When I increased my dose to 1 vial twice a day I noticed worsened insomnia, but I am on 2 other strong Lyme medications that can flare it up. Also, can it help slow GI motility? I take oral Cromolyn sodium (I think that is what Gastrocrom is, forgive me if I am wrong on that). I have never had insomnia with it, but it can have some unpleasant side effects when you are just starting. I had to start with just one drop twice a day and slowly increase from there. You may want to increase slowly. Yes it is cromolyn sodium Lyme disease is treated by a two week course of antibiotics.\n\nChronic Lyme on the other hand, well...  It is possible (probably most probable) that Chronic Lyme was invented by some crook to make money off the chronically ill.  If so, practitioners still diagnosing and attempting to treat Chronic Lyme are either OK with the fraud or are just gullible unwitting-conspirators of the fraud.\n\nHowever Chronic Lyme came to be, there is hard evidence that most people treated for Chronic Lyme give up on the treatment because they cannot take the medication side effects and see no benefit from the treatment.  Maybe you are reaching that point too. Lots of chronic illness with symptoms including severe fatigue following infections like Lyme. I dislike the \u201cchronic Lyme\u201d label but I do believe many people are suffering from Lyme sequelae, good amount of overland with long Covid and good old MCAS. As for OP\u2019s point, I have not had insomnia with cromolyn, would be interested to see them try a dechallenge/rechallenge and see if it comes back. They could also be sensitive to cromolyn itself, sounds pretty common (it gave me mild wheezing).\n\nEdit to add: I fully agree that a lot of doctors treating chronic Lyme are frauds and disgraces!

Depends on the food. Raw onion feels like razors in my mouth. Tomato is GI symtops pretty soon after and fatigue a few hours later. That is pretty similar to me too. I have gotten better at noticing when my mouth is itchy from eating something. It probably used to happen all the time, so I assumed it was a normal part of eating.

Mod needs to check their privilege. My symptoms usually start during the night or until I get up -&gt; about 5 to 10 hours after I have eaten something wrong I get abdominal swelling and I will get spots on my skin flaring within 5-10 minutes. I will get respiratory symptoms (shortness of breath) next, something like 10-15 minutes. Pre-treatment I would get the the abdominal swelling, spots and flushing quickly, but I would also get diarrhea within 30 minutes to an hour and maybe vomiting-those symptoms have calmed down since taking cromolyn sodium. It can vary from seconds to hours. It can be mild or it can be full blow anaphylaxis. Depends. I get symptoms starting right away (e.g., my left ear feels plugged and my nose can get congested, the feeling of having something stuck in my throat.)\n\nFor more GI stuff, it takes a bit longer.

I have showed them official guidelines for another condition I have and they would not even look at it. Louisiana has no specialists in MCAS. And ditto.

I know that some do telehealth maybe that is an option? Antihistamines/mast cell stabilizers help me the most which is why I know MCAS is real. It sucks someone told u it does not exist. Depends on the food. Some foods cause symptoms within seconds and are minor. Others cause symptoms within an hour and are anaphylactic. No GI symptoms. All symptoms are neuro.

Does anyone know a good anti-itch for when you have a flare? I would like to put something on my skin specifically on my fingers when it gets really itchy and swollen. I have tried OTC hydrocortisone but they do not work. I am on H1 blocker and Quercetin and Vit C but I still get some flare ups. It is typically always in the middle of the night. I get terrible, distracting, sleep-destroying itching during flares and this ( stuff works very well with very little smell. Same! I wake up to my fingers and body itching so bad. Do you use it when it happens or put it on before bed? Just when I am actively itchy. When I am in a flare, the entire length of my arms and legs itches like crazy. It usually goes away about 10 minutes after applying and lasts most of the day. It is the only thing that has worked for me after trying a lot of topicals and antihistamine pills. Squirting cromolyn straight on your skin helps me. I use NasalCrom. It is an over the counter nose spray. It is a very weak dose, compaired to the prescription oral solution, so you may need to put it on a few times. I put Jason's vitamin e cream on with an ice pack. Seconding this! NasalCrom is amazing I wash my hands with cool water and then use Libriderm ultra healing. It helps a little. B12 Do you mean take a B12 supplement? Or is there a cream version? Supplement or injections.", "Bad breath with cromolyn or other MC stabilizers?  Not me!", "Does redness ALWAYS accompany MCAD? My wife had a telehealth visit with an allergist/immunologist today. The allergist said that she does not think she has a mast cell disorder because when my wife feels flushed her skin does not redden (it may have before, but it has not been since she was bed bound I do not think).\n\nDoes redness always accompany feeling flushed with MCAD? No. Symptoms are all individual. It definitely varies per person. I agree with Robot-penguins, symptoms are highly individual. You may want to consult another doctor. Most people with MCAS go through several or more before getting their diagnosis. I have been told some very weird things by allergists and other doctors. It took me 3 years to find the right doctor. Thankfully, this allergist seems caring and humble. She recognized that, while she does diagnosis and treatment Mast Cell Diseases, it is not what her expertise is. She is planning on seeing us up with a mast cell specialist if test results come back normal. Flushing is what they can prove and see.  That is why she wants it.  Just trying to CYA, I assume.\n\nIt is nice they are willing to give their opinion and still search for more evidence though.\n\nI think color changes happen due to circulation changes.  When I get joint pain (one of my usual signs) my foot will swell, and turn purple.  I assume this is just bad capillary flow so the blood is less oxygenated.  That same capillary flow is probably what makes people look red.\n\nJust because your circulation is not changing in the expected way, that does not say anything about the rest of the processes in your body.  Yeah, it is a single data point. My flushing is always redness (and warmth/burning sensation). Curious what symptoms she is describing as \u201cflushing\u201d or what other people experience as flushing if it is not redness? I think she typically describes it as a burning sensation. But they may not be entirely accurate. Interesting. Is it possible the redness is just mild, but still red in comparison to her baseline? Also, the flushing is usually head/face/neck/chest distribution. So look there when the burning sensation occurs. Mediator release causes vasodilation, so you would expect some redness. She used to get red in her ears during an attack. I do not think that is happened since we got on the benzo though. She said it is been rare for her to have a full on episode since then. IDK if that is part of it or not. Ativan does have some mast cell stabilizing effects, but I would be surprised if that alone would control MCAS symptoms. For myself, it only seems to help with the shortness of breath and maybe diarrhea. I will still flush. Hope you find out what is going on, Mast Cell or otherwise. Oh, I am so glad she is willing to do that. Good luck with the specialist! Whenever I have gotten flushing I do not always get red either.....sometimes very pale actually. My doctor did not question color of my skin when it happens she was more interested in what else I was feeling at the same time. Flushing is a distinct feeling, just be confident with what she knows she feels and hopefully the doctor will not make the color thing a pivotal issue.\n\nConfidence goes a long way when you cannot see or prove certain things.

(AFAIK there is a genetic switch, so it will not break out without a stressful kickstarter, _if_ they would even inherit it, right?)\n\nWas it more difficult to get pregnant?\n\nHow did things change during and after pregnancy?\n\nThanks &amp; have a great day! I had my kids when I was younger, when my symptoms were still intermittent. Pregnancy was ok, high risk because of my weight and because I would had two miscarriages previously. Both of my kids were delivered by c section. My oldest was in the NICU for ten days.\n\nI started having constant MCAS symptoms when I was 36. My youngest daughter was 9 and started having symptoms at the same time. Kids feel stress the same way we do, and the stressful event that triggered my MCAS also triggered hers, we think. It was not something we could have avoided. \n\nShe says she is never going to have kids, that she will adopt or find a partner who already has their own children. She says she is not dooming anyone else to the genetic shit show. She is 15, so her feelings may change with age. They may also develop better MCAS treatments in the future, at least I hope they do. My doctor that treats my MCAS has said that it would be best if I did not have kids. My MCAS is severe, to the point where he said my child would also develop MCAS. His other worry was that MCAS appears to get worse the further down the family line you go, so my child could potentially have even worse MCAS than mine. I would rather not take the risk of giving a child this disease, and would much rather adopt instead. \n\nHowever, I know several online friends who have MCAS and have had several children, none of which have developed MCAS. Some say that during pregnancy their symptoms went away entirely and they went into remission, while others say their symptoms got worse For health reasons, I adopted my daugher. I am in the beginning of my first pregnancy, doctor did not suggest against it. I got pregnant immediately and my symptoms have gotten much better since then because your immune system is lowered because of the baby. I can eat anything without my usual mast cell reaction to it. Being pregnant with my one and only child I felt the best I ever have physically in life. Child birth was nothing unusual.....besides hard kind of fast labour. This is my same reaction. Pregnancy went great (minus some CRPS issues third trimester) but I have not been the same since, my symptoms are way worse now than they ever were. Motherhood has been hard the past 18 months, I am just hoping I\ufe0f can get to a more stable point again in my life before she is a little older. Oh geez I sure hope you can stabilize also. Are you on any meds for it? Also curious if this is your first child? I have only had one but we are considering another....just nervous  No babies here!  Do not want to risk saddling a kid with something the medical community does not have a handle on &amp; cannot control. The world is hard enough if you are \"normal.\"  Do not want to doom a kid to struggle with the multitude of ways MCAS affects ones life.\n\nEven if I did not pass it on by some miracle, not fair to a kid to have a Mom who always has to rest, or go to one of her 10 Drs, or has a migraine, or is on the toilet all the time and cannot give them the attention they deserve. My symptoms showed up after I gave birth and have been overall progressively worse since, (4 years), with some waxing and waning.\nMy child is worth it of course, but I will not have another child.

Apparently pink Himalayan salt is good for electrolytes.  The recipes I have seen use lime and lemon to make it drinkable, but you could just eat it with food I imagine. I take the vega electrolyte berry powder. I do not care for the taste, not going to lie. It was much better when I could add citrus. My symptoms are just starting to go off tho otherwise have been mild. It does have a buncha vitamins in there so not sure if peeps would commonly react. Liquid iv is the best kind for me. Propel was working great until it started making GI symptoms worse and I swear the powder packets were impossible to open without breathing at lest a tiny bit of the dust in and having just the worst chest pain from. But yeah, apple pie liquid iv works great I drink drip drop ORS powder and find it very helpful. It is not the best tasting, but I just hold my nose and chug it. I would suggest trying an ORS.

My constipation improved A LOT. I cannot exactly remember why i stopped the vitamin D and will try it out again.\n\nNow after reading about MCAS, it seems vitamin d does stabilize the mast cells.

My guess was always that the high vitamin d worked against the suppresion of the VDR by lyme (see (\n\nI really appreciate any input here, thanks! Chronic lyme disease and MCAS have significant overlap - both in terms of the symptoms they cause and in terms of lyme potentially causing MCAS.\n\nThis sounds like it is worth looking into. Your symptoms are allergy-like, food-triggered, and modulated by antihistamines, fasting, and vitamin D. I would ask your allergist about it -- if they think it is plausible, they might trial you on additional drugs that might help. You could also be low on vitamin D. You need your levels checked in addition to Lyme and MCAS. What diet helped your dermographism? I am in the same boat, but it is kind of a chicken and the egg thing with MCAS and Lyme. My MCAS was triggered by Lyme as well! I removed milk (lactose intolerant) and reduced sugar and wheat. Dermographism was never an issue for me, but this diet change completely stopped my neurodermatitis from occuring (which was big). Yes, the levels were low which is why i started the vitamin d. I had to take massive doses to move the vitamin d level around.\n\nIn around 2 months, i start with the coimbra protocol. There you use way higher doses than the 10.000 IE/day for longer time, but you have to make a diet change (no calcium) and check some blood parameters (PTH).\n\nThe coimbra protocol helps many people with MS (multiple sclerosis) to go into remission and when i consider the connection with lyme and maybe MCAS, this could be helping me as well.\n\n(", "Anti inflammatories that will not flare me?? I am having severe bladder and pelvic floor pain from inflammation and need to take something to stop the inflammation, but I have flared from literally everything I have tried. Is there some formulation of NSAID that is safe? Aspirin is acidic and I am afraid it will hurt my bladder. I cannot take any nsaids, but there is one natural anti inflammatory that help me. I recently found out about black seed oil, and while clinical studies are few and far between, it helps me a lot, both topically and internally.   \n\n\nTumeric/curcumin is heavily marketed for this purpose, it might work but I did not notice a difference. \n\nYour classic icy hot with menthol + lidocaine is a great topical, if it does not flare you up.  I find the name brand is fine, the cheaper lidocaine only store brand gets me badly. Unfortunately, what makes you flare is individual to ypu. I take relafen, and it is great for me, but mast cells are picky beasts, and each person's go all pcp ragey on different stuff. That is part of what makes this disease so hard to fight/deal with/diagnose. My MCAS consultant suggested I try Diclofenac first and if that was not suitable to try Celecoxib. Both are NSAIDS, but I am in the UK so if you are not they may have different names possibly? Sorry if you have tried these already! Oregano oil helps with inflammation. I have used Now Brand gel caps. You need to eat them with food because it can be hard on your stomach. Curcumim but the effects differ from brand to brand as with many supplements.\n\nAmazing anti inflammatory technic is cold showers but you have to build it up slowly Do not try diclofenac if you have extreme reactions to nsaids. I use diclofenac topically You can handle it? Yes. I cannot handle prednisone or other steroids though. I used it, it worked great. 24 hours later my insides were hurting and burning, chest tight, then the next day I was peeing brown. It was a delayed hypersensitivity reaction- which I did not know about at the time. It was the only possible thing that could have caused it, and I am disappointed, because it really worked nicely.

Hi!\n\nBecause I have huge health anxiety. It consumes my days. My \"illnesses\" vary every few weeks. Oh, I see. Are you asking a question?

However, I am NOT a doctor, just a person with MCAS. Hi! I tend to have episodes of illness anxiety as well. I use logic to try to get myself out of preoccupations. First, symptoms of mast cell look like a lot of different things. Second, just having an allergy does not mean you have anaphylaxis or mast cell activation syndrome. There are a variety of things that influence facial flushing (being hot, stressed are two examples). Remember, too, that stress can impact the body. If you really do have illness anxiety disorder and these thoughts are occupying your mind, you may need to address your anxiety before you consider any medical condition (assuming you are not currently in treatment).

I have read that you should throw out any vials that are cloudy or have particles floating in them. \n\nI am only on week three and I have had to throw out 6 vials!! They all had white stuff floating around in them, they were  not completely cloudy but clearly had white particles. What a huge waste. \n\nMy issue is that I cannot see the particles until after I open the vial and empty it into a glass. I have tried holding the vial up to the light and tried shining a flashlight and it looks fine in the vial. \n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. Has anyone had issues consuming Cromolyn that has just some white particles in it? Does it have to be super cloudy to warrant throwing it out ? Are some particles ok?\n\n2. Has anyone figured out how to tell if the vial is \u2018bad\u2019 before opening it?\n\n3. How did you get a replacement? I am in the USA and my insurance is not going to fill this early for me because I have had to throw some out.

Just double check to save yourself future insurance headaches. Good luck! Thanks for your response!

Hello, I am 24 years old guy.\nFor the past 3-4 months I have had a range of truly bizzare symptoms. I suspected MCAS and went full antihistamine diet. It did not help. Tried antihistamines, all of h1, they do nothing. I was never consistent with H2 so cannot tell, but it helps for ocassional GERD. \n\nFirst weird symptom started a year ago, but it does not bother me and is not severe. It is chronic hives on my face only. I actually found out this year that I had Vitamin D deficiency, started supplementing and hives have reduced drastically.\n\nBUT the real shit started happening 3, almost 4 months ago. I developed weird sort of redness on my glans, been to derm, tried everything, nothing works (LITERALLY). Then I had a weird episode of constipation after eating some beans. I had bowel movement, but it was reduced, and main symtpom was rectal fullness, rumbling, and gas that cannot go out. It lasted 5-7 days. Then I had a weird episode of sort of sleep apnea, where just before falling asleep I would stop breathing for 3-4 secs and it would wake me up. Then started one of my WORST symptoms, which is throat tightness. It was almost ever  present for 2 months, like literally whole day. It was coupled by feeling of lump in my throat. Yes it felt like I am going to suffocate, yet I never do and my pulse ox is fine. It is still there, not as severe and it is not present every day. Lump in throat feeling vanished. Sometimes I experience wheezing from my throat,when inhaling, and pulmologist said that it is always there during hard expiration. Going for bronchoscopy tommorow. \nThen I started experiencing terrible heart palpitations (normal pulse, yet you feel your heart is pounding). This caused me insomnia, and yes it caused suicidal thoughts, I am not going to lie, I could not sleep for days. Brain fog and migranes were terrible. This went away.\n\nNow the problems with stomach returned (started 7 days ago) . My stomach is always rumbling, I have some level of constipation, and gas trapping is present. Rectal fullness is what kills me. It is always there, after I eat. It is not painful but it is just like an itch you cannot scratch. This and throat tightness (feels like I cannot breathe) alternate and when one is there, the other is not, and vice versa. Also for the past 7 days I get brainfog. I had severe nasal congestion, that was unresponsive to steroid nasal spray. It got better on its own after 2 months. Although it is far from perfect.\n\nThe problem is that this is EVERPRESENT, there is not a single minute in a day to where I feel nothing. I feel as if this is MCAS but I just cannot believe that symtpoms are present all the fucking time and are there in alternaring fashion. It just cannot be true. I did tryptase test out of my own interest, and it was fine. Now when the throat feeling came, I immediately went to do it again. Waiting for results.\n\nI had bacteria in my sputum called Haemophilius influenzae. Antibiotics got rid of it, but another one appeared called Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Now finishing course of antibiotics for that. Maybe these triggered immune response. \n\nGiven all of these, I do not know what to think. I do not know if I have MCAS, and no doctor in my shitty country knows about MCAS. I just do not know what is happening with my body. If some of you have diagnosed mcas, please tell if you had all of the symtpoms 24/7 in alternating fashion? I just hope from the bottom of my sould that it is not mcas and that maybe it will go away somehow.\n\nMaybe I had covid, and now these are post covid symtpoms? Please give me some words of encouragement, I wanted to live a normal life, but now I am basically fucked up. It is a carousel. Every time I flare new things join the concoction. Vitamin D is also a mast cell stabilizer. Low vit D causes a lot of issues as well. It can take a while to ee improvement. \n\nI get insomnia and sleep apnea episodes when I am in a flare, mostly when I am exposed to way too many triggers, like a lot of dust for example. But also includes the lumpy throat and palpitations. \n\nI always have something going on unless I am taking a mast cell stabilizer. \n\nQuercetin is an over the counter supplement/mast cell stabilizer people use. Its an option if no on knows what mcas is, just make sure your doctor is okay with you trying it. \n\nYou are on the right path either way. Mcas can still be present with a normal tryptase. Its a diagnosis after elimination at that point. Symptoms and medication trials are what aid in diagnosis when tryptase is normal. \n\nHave you have additional bloodwork or possibly ultrasound on your gut to see if that is all sound?\n\nMcas is more than histamine. There are many chemical mediators released during degranulation. Leukotrienes and cytokines are two. Hey man, thanks for answers. I have had ultrasound of stomach and it is all good. I have also had sputum tests. I had a lot of Haemopilius influenzae. Took a course of antibiotics for it. It resolved but when I repeated test I got a new one called Pseudomonas Aeruginosa. Now on antibiotics to clear that one.\n\nWhat I would like to know is if mcas causes for you personally to have symtpoms 24/7. Because it is just bizzare if it is like that. I mean, I was also on Singulair when that throat feeling came,  because I had asthma before, and it was in my regimen. Took that and h1 antihistamines but it did literally nothing.\n\nI am wondering what happens when you try antihistamines and stabilizers and it fails? Does that mean mcas is less likely? Antihistamines dont stop the release, they stop your body from reacting. Im on a double dose of 2 different Antihistamines plus an H2. Plus the mast cell stabilizer. \n\nBefore I was diagnosed, I had constant digestive issues for 15 years. It did not matter what I ate. \n\nIf stabilizers do not work, meaning you have tried multiple options, you likely do not have MCAS and its something else. I often get one symptom after another. Migraine goes away, fatigue starts. Itching goes away, bone pain starts. Etc. etc. But once I got on the right meds and supplements, it all got about 60% better. Except the heart palpitations - that got 100% better. I hope this is some help to you. MCAS usually has normal tryptase.  The tryptase method for MCAS diagnosis is collection during a baseline period (when you feel your best) which is then compared against tryptase from blood taken during a significant flare-up.  Like when several symptoms hit hard at once.  Timing is 30-120 minutes after the start of the flare-up to get the second blood sample taken.  Tryptase should rise by more than 20% +2ng to confirm MCAS.  Example.  If a baseline was 5ng.  Than a flare-up needs to be over 8ng.  So 8.1ng or higher.  And even though 8.1 is within the normal range, it still counts.  10ng baseline needs over 14ng flare-up levels and so on.  \n\nBut yeah, MCAS normally is lots of different symptoms taking turns attacking.  The thing is, there are other things to rule out first.\n\nThe rectal fullness sounds like hemorrhoids.  Which can cause that.  Hemorrhoids is annoying AF, and is a fairly common possibility.  The lump in your throat feeling could be MCAS related,. It could also be EoE.  EoE (eosinophilic esophagitis) itself is related to MCAS, as it is a disorder of both Eosinophils and mast cells, but it is easier to diagnose via biopsy.  It is often found alongside MCAS too.  (I have both).  But you would expect either trouble swallowing, reflux, vomiting, regurgitation, or other esophageal issues.  You did mention GERD though, which suggests you gave some.  So it is worth considering.    Either way it sounds like you might need endoscopies, possibly with biopsies to see what is going on in you GI tract.  \n\nThe difficulty breathing is alarming.  Could be MCAS or asthma.  It can also be caused by reflux if it is severe enough to get far enough up that you inhale the acid.  So GERD or EoE can both cause difficulty breathing due to inhalation of stomach acid.\n\nNone of these explain brain fog, or your hives responding to vitamin D, or your palpitations.  The vitamin D helping your hives suggests at least some level of mast cell activation.  That does not guarantee that it is MCAS, just that that symptom most definitely involved mast cells.  Though hives usually do on some level.  ( \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n ( \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n ( \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou should give these a read Without meds, was it present 24/7? I know that ppl say flares can last a while. But this lasts more than just a 'while'. Two weeks in of everpresent symptoms that alternate. Anxiety vs mcas, how can you tell. I read on the internet that anxiety can cause bloating, gas, insomnia, and feeling of suffocating. Tnx for answers! Thanks for answers. I wonder if gastroenterologist can figure out if it is mcas by biopsy. Sometimes I feel this is all just caused by anxiety (severe anxiety).  I read it can cause bloating, gas, lump in throat, suffocation and insomnia. My parents think it is all just anxiety but tbh I do not know. Thanks, so does that mean that if anaphylaxis is not there that mcas is much less likely? I never had anaphylaxis. If you are not having severe episodes with acute symptoms in multiple organ systems then it is extremely unlikely you have it. Even more so if you did not feel better with medicine. You are going to be fine. Anxiety is also a symptom of MCAS \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f very prevalent in many of us who have it Lol MCAS is catch 22. It entails pretty much every symptom out there. No. I would have some good days. Maybe 2 good days per week. Every symptom being present is only true if you listen to certain doctors. There is things that simply cannot be caused by mast cells. There is also characteristic common symptoms such as flushing that occur in the vast majority of patients. It is mind boggling for sure. I am strongly considering I have it at this point. I get weird symptoms that just change from hour to hour. Like there is bloatness in my stomach from literally nothing, constipation, and poof it goes away but then starts the headache. It is weired cuz I can get constipated bloated but I eat antihistamine diet. \n\nI will just straight up ask allergist, could this be MCAS, or what? Anxiety is how I was diagnosed. \n\nMy psychiatrist couldnt figure it out, nothing was working. I always explained it as medical anxiety versus mental anxiety. I could not be mentally worried about anhthing buy still feel like Im about to have a panic attack.they would come on out of nowhere. Once I started cromolyn, thr anxiety went away. Unfortunately mcas cannot be diagnosed that way. Its tryptase, 24 hr urine to check levels of N-methylhistamine, 11B -Prostaglandin and/or Leukotriene E4, and medication trial. Also considertrying a spray antihistamine for that lump in the throat. Likely post nasal drip. No, you do not need anaphylaxis to have mcas. You would really benefit from going to an allergist and not really paying attention to this site. It is only going to cause you anxiety and in my experience, people on here are often quick to attribute every thing to mast cells and say everything can be a symptom. Statistically though, you are a man which this disease seems to occur more frequently in women, you are not having recurrent severe episodes, which the leading experts say is necessary for diagnosis, you are not having characteristic symptoms that most people have with this condition so your chances of having this are not really that high at all. Seeing a psychiatrist may be a good option and if the psychiatrist thinks that it is likely you have a physical illness too, then you should pursue that.\n\nOnce again from one of those articles I linked from THE leading experts on this disease: \"Most patients with MCAS suffer from recurrent episodes of severe hypotension (anaphylaxis). If this is not the case, MCAS may still be diagnosed, but is a less likely diagnosis. In particular, there is no evidence to support the existence of a chronic form of systemic MCAS without severe episodic events.\"\n\nAlso the medicines do not help you. You should not be strongly considering it. You really most likely do not have this.\n\nGo to an allergist/immunologist and bring it up to them. They can test you or perhaps reassure you Thanks for the answer. It is funny because I was reading and listening to whar Dr Lawrence Afrin was saying and he said that some people with mcas can be in \"low level\" anaphylaxis 24/7. Maybe he even said that not everyone gets anaphylaxis (not sure about this) That is what led me to think about it. Also one person down here also said you do not need anaphylaxis to have mcas. Thanks for the answers and papers. I will for sure discuss with my allergist I do not think you technically do, but you would be having recurrent severe episodes. Those papers are the ones that the WHO decided to go with for diagnosis I believe so to me they seem more credible than the ones that claim everything can essentially be a symptom of mcas. And your allergist will be much better at discussing these things with as he will be there to listen to you and observe you. Good luck! Dude I am 34 and going through all the same shit. Trust me, more than likely not COVID-I have been tested 4 times. I too have the sleep issues, stomach issues with rumbling and gas. Always flushing, not matter what. Bone pain etc. My Tryptase came back 7.5 and I was tested for Bone Marrow Biopsy for Mastocytosis which was negative. I have literally been couped up for months as the heat outside will not let me last a few mins. I am currently taking Cromolyn Sodium but yet to see the effects. Benedryl does not work for me, so some days I am thinking it is something different all together. Good luck to you (us) my friend. Also deficient in Vitamin D. Always thought it could be an absorption thing, but seeing lots of MCAS folks have it. Actually yesterday I tested positive for COVID 19, so it could be COVID, or not. Time will tell, but the suffering is unimaginable. Also if meds are not working for you, it is possible that it is not MCAS. One of diagnostic criteria is that meds are working. If you tried many different antihistamines (levocetirizine, lortadine, deslortadine, bilastine, cetirizine - h1) and (pepcide, ranitidine... - h2) and they do not work at all then that is very suspicious that it is not MCAS.\nFor me h1 antihistamines do not do shit. I have tried every single one of those for more than a week each. My nose is still congested, my hives still appear, and they itch.\nNow I am experimenting with femotidine h2, to see if it does anything. If not then I am lost. Sorry to hear about the COVID test. It is frustrating for sure, the symptoms and the pain are real either way and lots of symptoms mimic other things as we know. Hope you feel better soon", "Reacting to Fillers in medication / MCAD I just got diagnosed with MCAS and am trying to work with a compounding pharmacy to try and find a filler (inactive ingredient) in pills that I do not react to so I can start H1 and H2 blockers. Since I am having reactions to most fillers, I am not currently able to take any medication to try and help my MCAS symptoms/reactions (throat swelling, shortness of breath, and tongue swelling are my major symptoms).\n\nI have reacted to Benadryl, Pepcid, famotidine, Claritin. I have started to try one filler at a time with no active ingredient to see what I am actually reacting to. so far I have tried Vitamin c (ascorbic acid) and Microcrystalline cellulose and reacted to both.\n\nwondering if anyone has any suggestions on what fillers worked for them? or how to navigate this situation? If you are like me, it is not anything on the active ingredients list.  There is something in there in a low concentration that triggers symptoms in some way. You may never find it.\n\nI have an old bottle of a med that does not bother me.  I have a new bottle of a med that bothers me.  If I crush the old pill and mix it with the new pill, the old pills counteract the new bad pills.  It works like matter and anti-matter.  Maybe call it a trigger and an anti-trigger.  If you can get you hands on a bottle of meds with an anti-trigger.  Maybe you can mix it with the meds contaminated with the trigger and the one will neutralize the other.  If you can get your hands on any liquid or food with an anti-trigger it might counteract the trigger in the meds you need to take.  Have you swapped out all your cosmetics/toiletries to natural basic stuff and started a low histamine diet? That is a good short term way to reduce your overall histamine levels, and also work out what your triggers are, which may mean you can tolerate some of these things better further down the line. I used to react to my folate supplement but now can take it just fine. It is so hard in the beginning!\nHere is the best list for what might be useful to avoid - but it will vary from person to person. It is a good place to start though. If you have not already please be sure to only follow a low histamine diet in communication with a doctor as it can potentially be very restrictive!\n\n You may have better luck seeing if you can build up a tolerance to one drug of choice (or a super basic compounding, but that could get expensive fast). I would work with an allergist to come up with ideas. This is interesting to me. I react by getting a severe rash from fillers. Or severe gastro issues. Magnesium Sterate and Silicon Dioixide seem fine for me.  \nAlso Rice powder.  \n\nMicrocrystalline Cellulose can be made from birch, can be an issue.  \nHard as it is in everything.  \n\nTBH OTC medications have a lot worse in them than supplements to.  \nI have come across MCAS and antihistamine meds that are film coated pills using known triggers as colour coatings. Terrible. Same symptoms and more - tachycardia, hypotension, hypertension, rashes - but what does not work for you works for me so I will share how I navigated my situation. \n\nGenetic testing, especially for CYP450 polymorphisms, gave me clues about which main ingredients would be a problem. Allergy tests for specific pharmaceutical ingredients. So many tests I do not know which one led my doctors to which conclusion. But once I knew what is a problem I use the ( to check meds before I fill a prescription. Also do an internet search for MSDS or other clues to unfamiliar ingredients. thanks for sharing, yes I have done all of these. down to only a few foods, and even those cause a reaction. it did help a few months ago a little but now I am so reactive to everything that it cannot really help anything. thanks for sharing, yeah I have pots so I totally get tachycardia when I am reacting too. the list is just so long I do not even bother naming most of my symptoms anymore, only the severe ones. \n\nthe genetic testing sounds interesting, if you do not mind me asking how did it give you clues based on the results? Pharmacogenetic or pharmacogenomic testing services give you a high/medium/low risk of having a problem with a particular pharmaceutical or supplement. It is a clue because it is not a certainty. Expect to spend hundreds unless it is a test that insurance covers which usually means only your doctor can see the results.", "24 hour urine test questions I am doing the 24 hour urine test of n-metylhistamine, leukotriene E4, and prostaglandin F2 alpha, starting tomorrow morning. I have been off antihistamines, anti-inflammatory meds (except cannabis bc no sleep), and have continued my super restricted diet to avoid reactions. \n\n**For these MCAS tests, especially the urine test, is it a mistake to not consume foods, beverages, or supplements that cause reactions?** The doctor did not say to start eating foods that cause reaction. He wanted me to eat a low histamine diet which contains many foods that I react to but was insistent that this would resolve my symptoms, with the goal of reducing my symptoms. **I am a bit concerned that I am going to screw this all up and then get a false negative.** It took 9 months to get into this doctor, so if I mess this up, there are not a lot of alternative doctors. \n\nI also did an immunoglobulin and urticaria blood panel today, but I think those are not affected by my avoidance of reaction-causing foods..? \n\nIronically I just started being really strict with my diet a week ago (which consists of 3 foods) because emotionally I just cannot cope with these disabling symptoms anymore after having them for many, many years (i.e. I am quite depressed). I have to be off antihistamine nasal and eye drops which is very miserable when I am already feeling depressed. My eyes get so irritated, itchy, and dry. Even worse, rhinitis almost completely closes my nasal passages, making me breathe through my mouth which causes my jaw to tense up a lot and affects my sleep. There are other symptoms but those are at least resolved by antihistamines.\n\nTL;DR: See bold text. From what I have heard it is difficult to get the test done correctly. Make sure your jug is in the fridge when it is empty so it is chilled before hand and make sure it gets in cooler/fridge at the lab asap. I have also heard of transporting the jug in some kind of cooler.\n\nI think I ate like I did normally. Do not make yourself sick for the sake of a test. I think it kind of depends. I went off my meds for it and ate very little but had anaphylaxis anyway. Just try to complete the test safely.", "How to tell the difference Has anyone had trouble working out weather they have MCAS or just anxiety? A lot of the symptoms occur with both. The first allergist I saw told me I had anxiety, not an allergy problem. My daughter was having the same symptoms and he diagnosed her with cholinergic urticaria and prescribed meds. I was very surprised that we could have the same symptoms and mine were from anxiety. He told me I needed to force myself to eat the foods I was reacting to so I did not become agoraphobic. I did what he said and ended up in the ER, where they prescribed an epi pen, told me to never eat the foods that I reacted to, and to find a doctor who was more familiar with food allergy.\n\nMCAS reactions can cause anxiety. I think anyone who is having reactions where they go from totally fine one minute to pooping their pants while their throat swells shut has a legit reason to feel anxious.\n\nI have had some anxiety issues in the past and it felt different, somehow. I would usually feel cold and my hands would get numb and I would start to feel like everything was getting further away. With MCAS, I get too hot during reactions. I get brain fog, which is kind of like I cannot think enough, where anxiety is thinking too much. Just read your other posts. So it is hard to get proper diagnosis. Have you been tested for Lupus? MCAS can make you feel like you have anxiety but anxiety does not usually make you react is a severely itchy way and would not connect to the other things you are reacting to. Now can you have both? Yes you can but it sounds like you should try to find a doc who is willing to help. If you can find a doc that specializes in MCAS that is best but do not be surprised if the closest thing you can find is an allergist. Now you might ask, is not an allergist a specialist?..you would think so but no, no they are not. Any doc you can find that knows what MCAS is or is willing to help you is probably going to be your best bet. You can try an allergist but just know what to expect before you go. They do not get taught that much or they did not get taught to them since it was not even known about not too long ago.\n\nDr Afrin is a good source of info and before the pandemic he would walk other docs through how to do the blood test properly but it is still unreliable for a lot of people. Good luck I am sure reacting to foods would be a differentiator between anxiety and non-anxiety. I pretty much flush red in the face as soon as food goes into my mouth ... I also bloat extremely fast too to cause enough distention that you will know something is wrong. \n\nI ate in front of one of my early doctors trying to figure out the issue.", "Has anyone else had an awful experience with CVS Specialty Pharmacy and Xolair? Same as title. They have messed up my xolair every month I have been on it (4months now). I am now 4 days late for my next dose and I have been more and more reactive since about a week ago.  My Dr. does not have samples either and that is how I have had to get my medication so I am sure they are tired of sampling me. \ud83d\ude43 I have had good luck with them, but I never call them\u2014I only use their app. (I am autistic and calls are not my strong suit.)\n\nThere is a chat function and a rx status in the app so you can see what is holding up your rx. Not sure if that helps at all. I dont take Xolair but in general, I think that chain standalone pharmacys are very expensive and under staffed with long hold times. If you are not happy then why not change to a local pharmacy of a pharmacy run out of a grocery store? I think you can only get Xolair through a specialty pharmacy because it is too expensive to provide via a regular pharmacy. \n\nMost MABs and TKIs are directly supplied to your doctor via either the pharmaceutical company who manufactures the drug OR supplied via specialty pharmacy where the doctor is shipped the drug from the pharmacy. U/xconomicron is right - they gave a partnership to reduce costs, so u have to use their services. I would see if your doctor has the ability to get it directly via Genetech. \n\nMy doctor and I was using a specialty pharmacy called Primesource RX for my Xolair, however, I am pretty sure now my Xolair is supplied directly from Genetech. I no longer have to deal with a third party specialty pharmacy to ship my Xolair to my doctor's office. Yes, they could not even get it filled and were impossible to get a hold of! I switched to Banner Specialty Pharmacy and have had no issues. Where are you located?\n\nEdit: I wonder if they would ship out of state AZ. Does not hurt to ask!", "Reacting to all my meds, anyone experienced this? As the title says, I am reacting to all of my medications and I am pretty freaked out. I had a severe reaction to benadryl and also to zyrtec. I am having insane anxiety from being off h1 and h2 blockers so I was given xanax, which I took 1/4 of a pill and had a panic attack. My doctor's are at a loss as to what to do. They have never had a case like mine. I am recovering from low b12 and low folate. Most likely low choline as well. Most antihistamines are anticholinergic, even the newer h1 blockers are mildly anticholinergic. The doctors think the low choline is why I am reacting to antihistamines but I have reacted to all the choline supplements I have tried. I have reacted to methylfolate,folic acid and folinic acid too. I am only able to tolerate a few foods,none of which are high in folate or choline. Just wondering if anyone else has experienced something like this? I am really scared right now. I have reacted to antihistamines before and had to switch to different ones.  When I start reacting to everything, taking predisone for several days seems to help my body calm down and sometimes I am able to take my meds again.  I have taken Now brand choline and insositol supplement, do not know if that is one of the ones you already tried. Thanks, I am going to ask my doctor about trying some low dose prednisone. I have not tried the Now brand choline yet, thanks for the input. Are you sure it is not an IgE allergy to a certain filler? Or alpha-gal allergic? I am not sure but I have reacted to liquid and pill forms. I am also reacting to things like motrin, which I know can be problematic for some people but I have never had a problem with it before. Are you reacting to meats or dairy products at all? The sudden reaction to everything that used to be safe, including all medicine, is exactly what many people on the alpha gal groups say is what happens to them before they are diagnosed. If it is alpha-gal, some of the generic benadryl is safe. If you are in the US, the children's chewable at walmart is usually safe, as are some of the generic pharmacy brands, but always check the ingredients. I hope you figure it out and are improving soon! I actually started reacting to dair, red meat and pork a year and a half ago. Reacting to my medications started about 4 weeks ago. Thanks for the info, I had never heard of that condition, I will look into it. I have the same problem. Ive switched to making all my own supplements with just gelatin capsules. I also get compounded meds with only gelatin and acidophilus filler. I split my meds up. I take cromolyn wait 10 minutes then take compounded meds and supplements wait 10 min and take meds im reacting to. Thanks, I will try getting my meds compounded. Unfortunately I reacted to cromolyn sodium when I tried it over a year ago. I am going to ask about trying it again but at a lower dose. Yeah that is a good idea. I did not tolerate it my first trial as well but tried a lower dose and it worked the second time around. At one point in my line there were only about 10 foods I could eat. I reacted to everything. I could not even brush my teeth with baking soda because I reacted to it. So for about 6 months I could barely eat anything. I was able to eventually expand my diet.\n\nI wound up seeing an MD who was a homeopath. She tried a bunch of different remedies on me. A few did seem to help.\n\nSo cut back your diet to only the foods that are safe. \n\nCut everything else out of your life that might provoke a reaction. So nothing scented, nothing with dyes, nothing that emits fumes. Use natural products. Wear natural fibers, use cotton sheets and towels. Wash stuff in unscented undyed detergent or plain soap.\n\nCan you tolerate rice? If so there are choline supplements your can take. There are also ones sold as a powder.  Thank you for all the advice I really appreciate it. I only slept 3 hours last night and I am not sure how long I can keep going like this. Your next steps are probably a leukotriene modifier like montelukast and/or a mast cell stabilizer like cromolyn sodium.  You could also look into ketotifen \n\nCan you not take an H2 antihistamine? I find famotidine useful.\n\nThere is the old standby of a course of steroids. Get a big ass shot of Depo-Medrol and a step down pack.\n\nCan you tolerate quercitin? It might help. I get the Now brand, it does not have a lot of stuff in it. Most of the other ones have apple or citrus and I cannot tolerate either.\n\nYou can search for hypoallergenic supplements and vitamins. Pure Encapsulations is one brand.\n\nI did really well on doxepin but it has a strong anticholinergic effect, and tricyclic antidepressants in general do, so stay away from those. **(\n\nKetotifen, sold under the brand name Zaditor among others, is a second-generation noncompetitive H1-antihistamine and mast cell stabilizer. It is most commonly sold as a salt with fumaric acid, ketotifen fumarate, and is available in two forms. In its ophthalmic form, it is used to treat allergic conjunctivitis. In its oral form, it is used to prevent asthma attacks or anaphylaxis, as well as various mast cell, allergic-type disorders.It was patented in 1970 and came into medical use in 1976.\n\n( - ( - OP can reply !delete to delete - (\n\n**This bot will soon be transitioning to an opt-in system.

I did not react but maybe I had side effects I did not like. I may have to try that again. I am really thinking I may need steroids at this point. Thank you again for all the helpful suggestions. I know montelukast can have psychiatric effects. There is a similar drug with less side effects Zafirlukast.\n\nThere are a lot of other meds as well, I have a list ( but also see the Mast Attack blog  Thank you! Genetic defects - other than IgE - make many medications a problem for me. Most Wow, that sounds like something I need to look into. What class did your doctor take? I would talked that doctor into signing for me to get YouScript/Genelex pharmacogenetic testing. After they analyzed my saliva, they charged me about $50 for him to have a phone call class to explain my test report (because he did not understand the written test report).\n\nI did all that several years ago and I think ( &amp; ( may be two separate companies now or maybe they merged again. There are lots of other services that do the same thing these days, but none of them help me as much as my mast cell doctor using a small sample of a med or vaccine to test how my body handles it before I risk my life taking it. Thank you for all the information, I appreciate the help! I had several YouScript test panels done, each for a different class of drugs or genetic defect, each a different price. Total was about $1500 five years ago. The panels for the CYP2D6 gene cover many allergy meds.\n\nRecently read about cheaper services that do not require MD approval in the SNPedia sub. Before YouScript, I used the SNPedia website for free, using my 23andMe raw data and my list of every med I have ever taken along with the reactions I had to them. I only used YouScript to prove to doctors that my DIY SNPedia analysis was correct and that my allergies were not imaginary. Ok, thanks. Sounds like I need to follow your lead and do my own research, although I will probably still look into testing. I am struggling so much right now with inflammation and reactions that is It is hard to focus on anything. I feel like I am in fight or flight most of the time. I am hoping to get some of my medications compounded this week. Hopefully that will help calm my body down enough to where I can start researching my genetics.", "Delayed reactions - how to determine triggers? I am trying to find out if I have MCAS or not. I have had many issues for the past 4 months, and currently I am facing my biggest one, bladder issues. This is hell on earth.\n\nI do not know how can I determine triggers. It is impossible to know for food for example if it is delayed. I cannot just eat one single food and live on that for a day. It is impossible. If it triggers reaction 2 days later I will not even know it is that food.\n\nI almost never get anything in that single day.\n\nThis bladder issue tho is probably the worst shit I ever faced in my life. It feels like I have to urinate 24/7 and my urethra is burning. Seems like IC.\n\nNever had anaphylaxis or anything similar. \n\nI am going nuts, and if this lasts forever than I am lost. Im sorry you are having a tough time love. Ive been there and still get into a depressed mindset sometimes. Ive been going through this all year and im finally starting to understand how to get most of my symptoms under control. What i did was start off on a low histamine diet and stayed on that for a couple weeks then started introducing new foods one at a time and giving it a few days to see if i react to it. If you think its more of an IC issue you can put yourself on the IC diet and slowly introduce foods/drinks.\n\nFinding triggers will take some time. I had constant symptoms for MONTHS at first when this all started. I also have IC like symptoms and what I found was it was mostly my pelvic floor tensing up when I ate or drank something that triggered my mast cells causing inflammation  I started pelvic floor stretching to relax the muscles  (need to see a pelvic floor specialist but its expensive and I have no insurance and moneys lol) The IC diet never helped me. I drink coffee and can eat most things that are a 'no-no' on the list. So far soy, eggs, and bananas seem to give me the urethra burning and pelvic pain.\n\nOne thing to point out. Are you sure you do not have a UTI? My pelvic floor and MCAS inflammation causes me to not be able to pee everything all at once. I will go and have no issues starting a stream and going full on pee but at the end I will have to push a little to get the rest out or stand up for a second then sit back down and push that last bit out. If I do not do that the lingering pee that stays in my urethra can cause a UTI. However, I have felt your symptoms and its was not a UTI it was my pelvic floor. Since the stretching and starting treatment for MCAS I no longer get the IC symptoms. I just have lingering Pelvic floor Dysfunction that causes me to have to push to get the rest of the pee out. Now, this is because my doctors think I have EDS. I am waiting for genetic testing results now. This would be why my pelvic floor is such a butt to me. But that does not mean you do not have PFD its very common and treatable.\n\nIf you speculate MCAS I would find a specialist near you and get evaluated. In the mean time, what helped me was water with baking soda (1 cup water, 1/2 teaspoon BS) mixed in and drinking that to help with the urethral burning. Just one cup and stretching. Do not drink this mixture all the time or to much because it can cause kidney stones.\n\nAlso, taking a benadryl helped me the most when I was flared up. Especially the urgency feeling. Usually I would take one at night and wake up feeling a lot better.\n\nHope this helps and I hope you find relief soon. Definitely get into a specialist and if they do not think its MCAS find a good urologist that has understanding in IC. Feel better! You can message me anytime. If you need to just chat, vent or have any questions. I do not know all the answers but I did help me when I was able to talk to others who had similar issues. You got this, it sucks at first but once you figure out what is going on and what to avoid it gets better. Im back to most of my normal things and eating most foods. Obviously I avoid the three that I know cause me issues but a few weeks ago I ate P.F Changs and IDK what was in there but yeah I felt like I had a bad UTI and broke out into FULL BODY HIVES the next day. It took a week to feel better. Just stay positive love and feel better soon! xx\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Added some links:\n\nIC DIET: (\n\nLow Histamine Diet: (\n\nResearch article that talks about hypertonic PFD and the symptoms its causing including urinary frequency, burning, etc: ( Food journal.  *Seriously*.  Keep a food journal and write down everything you eat, including spices and other ingredients and the time.  Write down every reaction, and the time.  After a month of data, the delayed reactions start becoming clear, as you can see the pattern more obviously.  Then you can try avoiding whatever you suspect and see if it helps.  Or if it does not help, you can see if symptoms return on reintroducing it.  Include pills and supplements in your food journaling.  Including MCAS type meds like antihistamines.  Reacting to medications is possible.  Though it is often the fillers, which is the bulk of most pills, and not the active ingredients.\n\nAlso, if you react to sunlight, heat, cold, smells, exercise, stress, menstrual cycles, vibration, infections, or any of the other triggers like those, you will want to write down exposure.  As all triggers are cumulative.  And definitely try the low histamine diet. Food journal. You can put patterns together and determine reactions time. Take one food at a time. Something that helped me a lot when I was dealing with the UTI-ish symptoms was chugging a butt ton of water. Chug chug chug. Also, you can look into vitamins and things that help with those issues for others and what dietary changes others with UTI problems have. Even if you have mast cell disease you can still deal with the symptoms the way others with those problems do and it usually helps a lot. \n\nI hate when I feel like like how you are describing so I hope you figure it out . This is the answer. But you need to find a practitioner that recognizes the right triggers and can put the whole story together. Alternative - rice/potato diet. No triggers there. Definitely keep a journal of everything you take in, including medications and supplements. Recommended medications for IC are amytriptiline, anti-inflammatories and antihistamines. The Mastocytosis Society has a list of doctors who are familiar with MCAS. ( Also track the brand of supplements and meds because minor ingredients in different brands can make a difference in a person's reactions.", "Are these MCAS temperature triggers? Not DX but I am trying to keep track of my symptoms and what triggers them. I wondered if these are MCAS things?\n\nYesterday I took a shower and when I got out I broke out in a rash/hives and my face was flushed. \n\nNot a hot shower. Just medium temp. Hot showers make me light headed.\n\nToday\nI had a snow cone and my throat was swollen like super painful and swollen. Hard to swallow. It did not calm down until I warmed up my throat.\n\nIve been having a sore/swollen throat but the ENT and a secondary GP/PCP said \u201cdo not see anything wrong must be globus\u201d \n\nNow sometimes I get the acid reflux feeling randomly but my swollen/tight throat reaction does not seem to coincide with that.\n\nI am trying to figure out other triggers for my throat.\n\nI had it for a whole day recently  until I entered a sterilized environment and it calmed down. Idk what the trigger was. Hot, cold, and sudden temperature changes are all known triggers for some people with mast cell disorders. Further reading: \n\nThat said, we obviously cannot say whether the specific symptoms that you are describing are caused by mast cell reactions. Being lightheaded in a hot shower happens for much more mundane reasons, and ditto for pain in response to ice.\n\nHowever, getting hives and a rash in response to a shower sounds closer to what one would expect with these diseases, depending on what \"medium temp\" actually describes. I am allergic to something in the tap water in my house. Regardless of temperature, i rash. I added a filter and it is fixed. The throat and reflux sound like a food allergen. Oh yeah we had to get a filtration system \nI was getting huge boils when we first moved here\nThe water is SUS I do not even know what could be a trigger outside of my temperature reactions Oh the lightheaded part is probably POTS XD \nMy cardiologist was like \u201cyeah let us test you for that\u201d so that is coming up.\n\nBut I appreciate this. I will read this Oh venom is a trigger???\nI get bad reactions to bites \nNot just a little swelling either\nI nearly had to go to the ER one time. I thought I had a bunch of mosquito bites and my leg was soooo swollen I could not move.\nBut it could have been a combo of that and a spider bite\nEither way\nI could not walk. So, do you often get esophageal/throat related reactions?  If so, have you had an upper endoscopy, and if so, did they biopsy to check for EoE?\n\nEoE (Eosinophilic Esophagitis) is a disorder that is frequently comorbid with mast cell disorders.   As the same suggests, it involves eosinophils building up in the esophagus.  In fact, it is diagnosed by biopsies of the esophagus that look specifically for eosinophils.  A count of more than 15 eosinophils per HPF = EoE.   However, mast cells play a part with EoE too.  In fact, the eosinophils and mast cells form couplets in the esophagus, where one cell type chemically \"talks\" to the other cell type.  And one cell type can then set the other cell type off as well. \n\nYour esophageal based reactions involving a sore throat, acid reflux, and difficulty swallowing are all pretty common EoE symptoms.  Though it will not cause reactions awatly from your throat.  So the facial flushing etc is not from EoE.  EoE is an \"allergic\" disease, that like mast cell disorders is not IgE mediated.  It is probably a good idea to look into it if you get reactions like these frequently.  (Assuming you have not yet been checked out for it.)\n\nUnlike MCAS, EoE has clear cut diagnostic criteria that is widely recognized.  Gastroenterologists diagnose it, but any allergist or GP can refer you to one to get an endoscopy.  But the gastroenterologist *must* take biopsies.  No biopsies = you have not been assessed for it.  The disease slowly remodels the esophagus over time.  Scarring it and forming fibrous tissue, often in the form of ringed strictures.  But in the early stages, no changes may be visible.  The mistake some gastroenterologists make is to see a normal looking esophagus and not take the biopsies.  Which only means it has not progressed yet.  Not that it is not present. \n\nEoE was the diagnosis that initially lead to me looking into mast cell disorders.  I would had trouble swallowing for years.  But I only had minor esophageal changes upon initial endoscopy.  I know one person who only had difficulty swallowing for 6 months at the time of her endoscopy and had a completely remodeled esophagus.  Everyone with it is different. I have not had an endoscopy I do not think\u2026. I went to the ENT and she was like looks normal. Maybe some irritation but that is it. Then she said must be globus. She put a scope up my nostril and down my throat. No biopsies as this was just a regular office LOL.\n\nBut yes for YEARS. My mom always complains that *I* complain about my throat constantly\n\nShe was like\nMaybe your tonsils? I think they are definitely larger than they should be but that is independent of my reactions. They are a constant/consistent element. Whereas my throat has a mind of its own.\n\nRight now I am eating breakfast and it is fine.\nA couple hours ago I drank cold water and my throat tightened again. OH I just remembered \nYou know minty gum with those refreshing \u201cballs\u201d? Those trigger over salivation and throat tightening \nUsually I feel like I am choking and cannot get my saliva down\n\nSome chocolate has this reaction too.\n\nBut I do not eat those regularly so I do not experience that frequently Yeah, I get occasional reactions too where it gets hard to swallow even liquids.  I have only gotten saliva issues when food gets stuck and I cannot clear it by taking a drink.  (Food impaction.)  Which is also when I usually get a lot of saliva, which thickens into mucus sort of.  It is really nasty.\n\nOther potential eoe symptoms would be chest pain that does not feel at all like heartburn.  Esophgeal spasms hurt, and can feel like a heart attack.   I also get a feeling like there is a lump in the back of my throat.  It was what first made me give up watermelon 20 years ago. \n\n\nBut yeah, if you have had swallowing issues for years in a reactive pattern, I would *definitely* talk to a doctor.  Either your PCP or an allergist, and request a referral to a gastroenterologist to check for EoE.   It is not the sort of thing an ENT is equipped to check for.  When you get in, of most of your esophageal issues are higher up, mention that to the gastroenterologist.  And *specifically* request biopsies regardless of how your esophagus looks.   \n\nMy own experience is I have the most trouble fairly high up.  Like near my larynx.  But everyone with it is different.  Others might have more issues lower down by the stomach.   Giving the gastroenterologist as idea of where you have the most issues is the best for giving feedback on where they most need to take biopsies from. Tysm! Literally anything you come in contact with. I react to so, so many foods. I have had to keep a food diary and eliminate a ton of things. Those were my exact triggers in the beginning of my disease. I started with itchy/red/swollen/burning hands and feet. Then one day I got out of the shower and my thighs looked like I was burned from all of the raised welts. It was soooo itchy. Cold foods made my lips and throat swell. \n\nMy official diagnosis is \u201cchronic idiopathic urticaria\u201d but my allergist says it is autoimmune. Been on Xolair for two years with complete remission of symptoms because my pressure and temperature hives were so bad that 10+ antihistamines a day was still not resolving my symptoms. \n\nIf you can, find yourself an allergist at a university. I went through several doctors before I found one that was willing to consider something beyond \u201cyou have hives, take Allegra\u201d (one even tried to give me an antidepressant wtf) Omg yeah. Like I take Allegra and Claritin and they are fine for \u201cnormal\u201d reactions\u2014\u2014actually. Now that I think about it\u2026 that might be a lie LOL.\n\nI can take allegra for example before I go camping. And well. It delays my reaction. But after a day I will end up getting sick. And the antihistamines do nothing.\n\nThey do not work with chemical reactions either. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nBut seriously??? Antidepressant??? What for!!! WHAT IS wrong with doctors I swear \nHello my body is swollen I am not depressed. Yeah, I had to keep taking more and more antihistamines and I was miserable. \n\nMy dad had passed a few months before my symptoms began and when routine blood tests showed nothing, my PCP decided I was just being an emotional female I guess \ud83d\ude44 UGH\nI get so MAD when doctors blow off issues like they are just anxiety.\nHello.\nAnxiety feels different thank you.

(Manual cross-post from /r/mastcelldisease \\- mod there removed the post for some god unknown reason)\n\nOmg. I cannot believe I am writing this. But I just got out of my car and stood in front of what I think is cell tower - like 2m away.\n\nWithin minutes I noticed jaw clench, wide eyed.Then came shallow breath, and then head pressure temples.\n\nI am a skeptic. I historically have dismissed EMF exposure causing health issues. But SOMETHING has activated me. This is distinctly different from prior underwater sensation - and distinctly different from before I got out of my car and stood next to the tower.\n\n \n\n\n\nCould be a tree or something nearby giving off pollen I reacted to. Still. Obvious exposure to something.\n\nI think I will go by there again next week, but this time wear my mask.\n\nAnyone else have any experiences? reply from /u/BlyTheMoon\n\nCurious: Was this an experiment you were conducting? Were you anticipating a reaction? Our minds are powerful and I wonder how much of this is the brain projecting what we think will happen. (EDIT: I re-read my OP and it does sound like I jumped out of the car in front of the tower to elicit a reaction)\n\nWow, the last place I would expect to find this kind of message is in a MCAS support forum, where we all face the ongoing struggle with medical professionals to be believed and not relegated to psychological symptoms.\n\nI am well versed in understanding the nature of my own humanity and as I said I am a skeptic - my first thought is always to disbelieve my own senses and wonder if it is in my head.\n\nIn any event, no this was not an experiment. I have noticed the pole in question many times on my drive home, and wondered what it was. This time I decided to stop and get out and see if I could figure out what it was for.\n\nCompletely was not expecting any kind of reaction whatsoever. It never even entered into my mind that I might have a reaction.\n\nBeing I suffer from MCAS, MCS, and HIT, I am well versed these days with looking out for situations where I might come across something that activates me. In those cases I likely am at hightened likelyhood to 'imagine' symptoms and raise anxiety, thereby creating a self fulfilling prophecy.\n\nLikewise I am versed at noticing symptoms from flare ups from an unknown source early on in the flare up.\n\nSo as I said, it did not even enter my mind that I might react in this situation.\n\nI only noticed when I drove off, and started to notice the symptoms I mentioned in the original post.\n\nMy first response to this was to deny it was going on, and treat myself like I was imagining it - as I had not done anything that would cause the reaction as far as I knew.\n\nBut the symptoms progressed as I mentioned, to the point where I cannot deny I reacted to \\*something\\*\n\nI still do not believe it was from the RF exposure - it must have been some other aggravant in the same vicinity. reply from /u/hey_look_its_shiny\n\nI get where you are coming from, and it sounds like you have a solid, reasonable approach to this type of stuff. A healthy dose of skepticism is crucial. But I do not think ( response is inappropriate, even in this kind of sub.\n\nA large part of my background is in cognitive science, and as you allude to, the only way for us to be able to be confident in our own conclusions is to be ready to second-guess our experiences and interpretations. Most people do not think like that, though, and it is both the first thing that I would bring up to someone else, and the first thing that I would want them to bring up to me.\n\nThere is a crucial distinction between \"exploring alternative explanations\" and \"invalidating our experience\". And in this age of heightened sensitivities, I think that is an important point for everyone to bear in mind when we listen to others' words about pretty much anything.\n\nIn this case, it sounds like you are open to the likelihood that the trigger was something else. It is also a correlation with an n of 1. At best, we should tell ourselves \"this warrants further study.\" Heck, if you want to put the hypothesis on a solid footing, get your friend to blindfold you and drive you around to a bunch of similar places, only some of which include cell towers. If you react to them more often than not... hey, we have ourselves a good theory! :) Yep - was not flying off the handle re: ( response - it just hit a trigger.\n\nWaves @ ( \\- no worries mate!\n\nI will definitely be taking the scientific approach to this. Would like to do a retest, this time wearing my mask to rule out any airbournes. Of course on second try there will be part of me expecting a response which makes it harder. You are right, blind trials would be perfect.\n\nI did recall that I also walked around the electronics curb-side box in the same encounter. There was a grill with fans humming inside, so I put my face up to it to see if I could see in - was expecting to see a bunch of routers humming away. But obviously could have easily breathed in something at that point. reply from /u/treesntreesntrees\n\nThis is a more controversial area of study, but I believe it is a factor, and it is one of the first things my immunologist warned me about after my diagnosis. There are a number of good studies and links you can find by googling relatively quickly. &gt; There are a number of good studies and links you can find by googling relatively quickly.\n\nHey! :) Would you mind linking some of these? When I have looked up this topic in the past, I have only been able to find research with horrible study design. If you have some good studies though I would be open to reading them! I am skeptical, but also open to reading anything that is out there. The mod at r/mastcelldisease removed the post because she is *very* restrictive about anyone discussing medical issues and anything related to diagnosis. But as far as I can tell, the rules are not clear at all and no one really knows what is allowed or not.\n\n Seems like you saw the sign first and then noticed body symptoms. Psychosomatic. It doesnt mean you did not have physical symptoms but its most likely not caused by a tower.  Hi,\n\nNo I do not have any on hand - hence why I said Google.\n\nI think Beth O'Hara has articles on MCAS with EMF\n\nI do not really read them because I have always been highly skeptical of it. I have not been able to find any of these studies but I see people reference them often. I have Googled them but have not found them, it sounded as though you had found some yourself from the way you were speaking. My mistake! No. You did not If you are thia close to high voltage structures you can feel something. On the safe distance - forget it.\n\nI bet on pollen. This is really annoying I had muscle twitches fired by 5 tesla MRI machine in some brain areas. If emf could activate mast cells it would be MRI.

I have been having symptoms of gastroparesis. I have read that LDN (Low Dose Naltrexone) can help with both gut motility and mast cell/histamine release Yes, there are mast cells in all body tissue. Everyone responds differently to medication, it is possible to see improvement. I think its from vagus nerve damage which is also why we have POTS sometimes too. There can be, for me a mast cell stabilizer called Ergomax Palmitoylethanolamide helps my gastroparesis. But honestly, it only started helping after some months of taking it, on a higher dose.

For the past maybe 6 months I have not really felt normal. It all started with a headache that continued for weeks. I saw a doctor, had brain scans, and corrected nutritional deficiencies and the headache has for the most part gone away completely. I then began having trouble swallowing foods and had an endoscopy and was diagnosed with EOE. After a course of steroids, cutting out dairy and wheat, and taking ppis my symptoms related to that have also went away for the most part. Over the last few weeks, I have noticed at work that my hands look a bit red in certain spots, although they are never itchy or uncomfortable and the only way I notice is if I look at them. I am a cook and am using them constantly, wearing gloves, in contact with heat and hot food almost constantly. On my days off I have not noticed much redness at all. I have stomach pain every now and then, but it is not consistent or related really to any one thing I eat or drink. I have had very little problems in my past with any health issues or chronic pains and have never reacted to bug bites, scents, heat, etc. I have always had allergies to pollen, etc but those are mostly controlled with nasal spray and maybe a benadryl here or there if I need it. I have, however, developed quite a bit of anxiety about my health and stumbled upon mast cell disorders in my seemingly endless google searches. Is a mast cell issue something I should be concerned with or should I just discuss normal allergies with my doctor next week? I started noticing issues with swallowing in my early 30s, my mother also had issues and almost choked while eating dinner one night which honestly frightened me forever.  I have noticed a lot of the same issues due to allergies, when I first saw my two rheumatologists they both diagnosed it as anxiety.  \n\nMy allergies, after being treated, have addressed both my muscular control issues, such as this, along with my anxiety.  I went gluten free at first, but then had to start a total elimination diet after that as I started noticing other triggers, though they were not triggering issues with swallowing. Not op, but how well are you in control of your symptoms now after treatment? My swallowing has definitely improved a lot, even with something as simple as water.  I do not have nearly the same issues these days that I did before I started all of the antihistamines and Xolair.  Every now and then when I get a flare it does show up again, but not nearly in the same severity as before. So are you able to live much more normally now?", "Pepcid question Hi, for those of you who take or have taken Pepcid for mast cell did you take it everyday or as a rescue? My geneticist told me I should take it but the papers do not specify when or how often. Thanks for the help! I take it twice a day. I rotate between Tagamet and Pepcid and I take it twice a day I take it but do not see major differences honestly. 20mg of fomotidine in the morning and night. H1 and h2 every 12 hours\n\nWithout it things get worse so I just take it anyway\n\nAnyone take a different h2 with better results? I was told to take it twice daily, but I honestly have not found any difference in my symptoms since taking it Also twice a day I used to take 3 times a day and the highest dosage 40 mg 3times a day. I gradually switched to ginger powder. It was hard at the first and I would get ginger burn but after a week I got better and now I have no symptoms. I take ginger pill after each meals and I have no acid reflux or burning in my stomach.\nGood luck! Famotidine 20mg BID and Benadryl everyday. I think it helps a bit. Twice a day with an H1 antihistamine. Personally the improvement was minor. It was not until I took a mast cell stabilizer that I noticed a significant improvement. What stabilizer did you end up taking? Cromolyn sodium. Yea same just curious Twice a day. It makes a huge difference for me. \n\nIt can also be used as a rescue with a 1st generation H1 antihistamine. Typical anaphylaxis ER protocol includes an H1, an H2, and a steroid.  Why do you rotate? I see huge differences. Ginger powder? Did you take H2s only for acid reflux? I do not have that, but I get other issues. GI, brain stuff, fibromyalgia, fatigue, anxiety etc. Ginger does not help because it does not block the H2 pathway, right? What form do you take it in? Liquid Same, everything but the h2 seems to make a big difference though Tolerance. Most of these meds are being taken 2-4x's the normal dosage and will create a tolerance effect faster. As with any medication, your body will adjust homeostasis to these medications. \n\nIt is really best to switch up these medications after a period of time.

They even cover it in the health portion of testing on 23 and me, if you are interested in getting it a little cheaper without health insurance.\n\nIron overload before menopause in women is extremely rare. It just seems so likely to me that my iron overload is somehow related to mast cell degranulation. Everything else that is wrong with me is related to either my mast cell disease or autism. Yea I am wondering if the changes in my iron are related to mast cells overreacting in some way too. I have to supplement iron myself, but ferrous sulfate which is the most common/cheapest form upsets my stomach, so I only take iron-free multivitamins. My current brand is ( and I also used to take ( Both are iron-free and have methylfolate. thank you! I have to wait for one more lab test now to know if I should stop supplementing iron.

I have been reluctant to get the second since I have actually been more reactive since. I did start Xolair shots 2 months after my vaccine though, so that could be impacting things too.

I had an anaphylactic response to the first shot and now that its antibodies have left my system I am going to have to get the second. It is becoming a huge undertaking to prep for the second shot.

(I buy the 500 count from Costco, but I have purchased a 1000 count in the past.) As for why I take them, the other meds put me to about where a 'normal' person's allergy symptoms are. If I encounter pollen (it is ragweed season now), I need to take the Benadryl to curb those 'normal' allergies. If I take another Xyzal/Ketotifen it makes me feel sick. I see. Thank you for replying.

Oh,  \nWell let us hope the low iron explains it - nice and simple to fix.  \n\nWatch out with the cromolyn - if you are one who ends up with stomach acid too low, it can actually give you heightened immune responses you can mistake for MCAS getting worse.  \nAs undigested food getting into your GI tract is not really supposed to happen, and it can cause inflammation, raised histamine, leaky gut, then immune reactions.

They came back negative but I know it is a difficult test to get correct. They said I do not have MCAS because I have never fainted... is that true? Should I be excluding it just because of that? I am not looking for anyone to diagnose me over the internet. I understand that is not a reasonable thing. I am just at my wits end and needed to talk about it. I feel like I am crazy.... I completely understand your difficulties with doctors. My advice would be to try to get a referral to an endocrinologist which is who I see for my MCAS and was also the one who made the diagnosis. A big part of my problems seems to stem from processed foods or food high in histamines. I suggest you try and keep a food diary so you can take note of the food your eating and see if that is what is causing some of your symptoms. You do not need to have fainted to have MCAS. And my doc diagnosed MCAS without a positive urine test (which I believe was actually for something else?). You need a different doc. I have MCAS, I have never fainted.  You definitely need a more knowledgeable doctor.  All it takes is some idiot lab technician leaving the urine sample out on the counter unrefrigerated for 30 minutes to get a false negative on the urine test.  It is really that temperature sensitive. What the other posters said. Diagnosed MCAS here too, never fainted. You might want to try for a Functional medicine or Integrative medicine doctor if you can find one. But you definitely need a new doctor. And a tryptase test can easily come back negative even if you do have MCAS or another mast cell disorder -  from what I understand it is hard to catch elevated tryptases because your body chemistry can change very quickly. It is not necessarily set in stone that you need a definitive diagnosis before being offered treatment.\n\nHere are a few angles you can try:\n\n1. Do a bit of intermittent fasting. Do your symptoms get better? Some immunologists will take that as slightly suggestive that your symptoms may be immunologically mediated.\n\n2. Have you tried over the counter H2 heartburn medicine? Pepcid, aka famotidine, is available OTC and is sometimes useful for the GI symptoms of mast cell diseases since it is a histamine blocker. Zantac (ranitidine) used to be as well but is not generally available anymore.\n\n3. Whether the above help or not, you may consider just asking your immunologist if you can trial oral cromolyn. They may or may not be up for it, but some people have had success this way.\n\nIf these meds help, the diagnosis is basically secondary. If they do not help, another explanation may be worth pursuing.\n\nHTH! You and I have the same symptoms. Find a new immunologist who is willing to at least try some meds. My bloodwork is normal too but a mast cell stabilizer made all the difference for me.\n\nFainting is not part of mcas. Its commonly seen in POTS, though. Theyre comorbid syndromes/diseases. I dont even know why they use tests if theyre so sensitive. Honestly, medication trials seem to be way more effective. Functional and integrative are not a real medicine Tryptase test is #1 Can you identify with  \n\nr/RCCXtheory **I found links in your comment that were not hyperlinked:**\n\n* (\n\n*I did the honors for you.*\n\n***\n\n^( ^| ^( ^| ^&lt;3 Sort of, I do not believe I have any symptoms of EDS. I did feel that I had some POTS symptoms but my doc also said it was ruled out when my tilt table test was normal. I have had one random blood tryptase test done and it was within normal range. Taking Zyrtec definitely helps a lot of my symptoms. It just does not completely resolve my symptoms. I do not know if that is because one a day is not enough? Or that I need to be on a combination of antihistamines and a mast cell stabilizer. I mentioned this to the allergist who did my urine tests and he said that I would see almost complete resolution by taking the Zyrtec... but I am starting to think maybe that is not completely correct and that finding the right meds is trial and error? I used to take Ranitidine until they pulled it and was never put on a replacement. \n\nAs for the fasting, I have not purposefully tried it. I have found though on days where I am just not hungry and do not eat until the afternoon my symptoms are not as severe those days. But maybe I will try to track that with some intermittent fasting. I thought I also had some symptoms of POTS! Mainly I go through a few days at a time where I notice my pulse considerably rise and get dizzy when I stand up. But I had a tilt table test done and my doc said it was normal and that it rules out POTS... Some people here take 4 different, or more, antihistamines to control their symptoms. One Zyrtec is not going to cut it. The paper says it has ti be made as soon as possible after reaction I probably would try to find another allergist. Most do not know much about it. And even some \"knowledgeable\" ones pull that kind of BS.\n\nI found one that listened to my whole history, agreed that it sounded like MCAS (I have fainted but it was 6 years ago and was likely from POTS not MCAS. That is definitely not in the criteria for MCAS.) I had already been put on 2x a day H1 and H2 antihistamines and a leukotriene inhibitor. The previous doctor refused to consider cromolyn for me because she said it was not \"warranted\" because my urine testing was negative (and she repeated scratch testing but did not tell me to be off of the antihistamines long enough, so most of that testing was negative too). The new doc said it was worth a shot. \n\nCromolyn changed my life. I was barely able to work my part-time job when I was put on it, and it made a huge difference. I still have to avoid my triggers carefully and we have had to make a couple of medication changes since then, but it is obvious to my doctor that it is MCAS.\n\n\"TMS does recognize, however, that capturing a mediator rise is not always easy, and depends on many factors, internal and environmental. We have seen 24-hour urine samples test negative simply because the lab technician did not refrigerate the sample in a timely manner (when the test was repeated and handled properly, the result was positive). Therefore, we support the use of a clinical diagnosis and advise that the patient continues to be treated when the following criteria have been met:\n\n- An exhaustive work-up has ruled out other medical conditions with similar symptoms and presentations\n- The patient has exhibited consistent symptoms of mast cell activation in 2 or more organ systems during the same period of time, such as skin, gastrointestinal tract, central nervous system, etc.\n- The patient responds to antimediator therapy\n- The patient is monitored on a regular basis, with testing for mediator rises performed periodically, by a mast cell or other specialist and/or in conjunction with an established local allergist or other physician\n- The patient is evaluated for other disease processes on an ongoing basis in order to be inclusive of any new changes in the patient\u2019s condition.\"  A dysautonomia neurologist might be a good bet then. That Is the doc who diagnosed me with mcas. Sounds like maybe you have other issues? I honestly do not even know anymore. I just was not sure if the dizziness was related to the possible MCAS or possible POTS. Or both? Hopefully I can find someone that is willing to let me trial meds I guess?? I definitely have like big episodes with most of my symptoms but in between those the symptoms also sporadically pop up through out the day. Do you know if that is normal? You also want it done at baseline, when not reacting. You are not crazy-I too have many of your symptoms, my ears flush daily, heat sensitivities, Bradycardia, the anxiety. Mostly everything. My stool is a bit different as mine often floats from malabsorption. \n\nI took a different route and saw hematologist/oncologist (I know it can be scary) and had a BM biopsy done to confirm/rule out Mastocytosis. My results came back negative and they now believe I have MCAS. \n\nBest of luck to you, it is not easy, I think that is one thing everyone here will agree on. Including all those tests for carcinoids...Gastrin, CGA etc. I have had my fair share too. \n\nThey also said my lymph nodes were swollen and \u201cnormal fatty\u201d Hmmm, well it does not have to be everything in that list. Maybe you will find some helpful tips in the self-help post \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Hard to tell. Ive had migraines since I was 5 but theyre silent (without severe pain) so I never knew but my dizzy spells are related to migraines. Those migraines are part of my MCAS symptoms. So its possible its MCAS. u/GetOffMyLawn_ is correct. Zyrtec targets H1 histamine receptors, which means that it decreases the effect of histamine on classic allergy symptoms like itchiness, hives, runny nose and sneezing.\n\nHowever, there are also at least 3 other types of histamine receptors (numbered 2-4) that zyrtec does not generally help with. In particular, H2 receptors are where histamine will tend to cause digestive symptoms like heartburn, pain, constipation, diarrhea, etc. The OTC drugs mentioned in my first post (e.g. Pepcid) can help with this. Take care to note that Zyrtec (an H1)  is not the same as Zantac (an H2).\n\nIt is also not uncommon that mast cell patients report that various antihistamines &amp; stabilizers help with additional symptoms beyond their labeled ones, such as general pain and brain fog.\n\nIn addition, histamine is only one of many, many other inflammatory chemicals that mast cells release. That is why mast cell stabilizers, and sometimes other mast cell mediator blockers, are also used. Not all condition have high baseline. It is stated that some MCAS cases have normal tryptase I was really scared of the carcinoid tests. I was grateful they came back negative on both occasions and that the CT and scopes were clear. Did you have high tryptase levels? Is that why they did biopsy? I had a tryptase blood test done once. It was normal so the allergist ruled out both mcas and masto. Tryptase came back 7.2 then 7.5 at a baseline. Agree. I am one of them. My Tryptase is normal. All I was saying it is important to measure at baseline to get true reading. If a man went to a doc with all these symptoms he would be taken seriously. Also I believe \"Idiopathic\" means the doctor is the \"idiot\" who does not know what is wrong with you. I went through all the frustrations you have been having. It took decades for me to get the right diagnosis. Yes, i may be little bitter! I hope you find the right doctor. Yep, that is definitely normal for mast cell patients. It is pretty unusual to only have the big episodes - if we did, we would not need to be on daily medications. tryptase is highly unreliable Zyrtec 10mg is too low .. you need to take at least 20 or 30mg. Start to day with low carb and do not eat too much, eat hypoallergenic such as fresh raw meat or specific vegetables ( there is lists online ). IF you eat something that triggers mast cells or hypo/hyperglycemia you are screwed for the rest of the day. Intermittent fasting sometimes helps. The main problem is fixing IBS wtih fermented and raw pro-biotics because they all contain loads of histamine. Raw milk kefir it a problem for most.\n\nDo not eat big portions otherwise it can trigger POTS , better to eat small amounts and many times. Switching to keto can als solve IBS ( no carbs ) Same here but only in high temperatures POTS is in most cases the result of MCAS, Vasodilation by interleukins and other chemotaxis chemicals cause vascular permeability. Only way to decrease is to prevent mast cell degranulation ( partial or full ) or taking vasoconstrictors. lower dose SNRI might help. Beta blockers do work as well Fainted a few times get epinephrine or ephedra, anything that is vasoconstrictor or beta adrenergic seem to prevent it ( such as beta blockers ) According to newest studies tryptase is highly unreliable Hyper or hypoglycemia is a symptoms of MCAS so you have to be carefull with that. You might want to try benadryl  with cromolyn salts Tryptase is pretty unreliable marker. Worth tho check it out but chances are extremely small. I take zyrtec and max strength pepcid ac twice a day. I get xolair once a month and take benadryl as needed. Just added ketotifen as well. So for sure 1 zyrtec is not enough. Intermittent fasting is very helpful in my opinion. since when? histamine test is unreliable, tryptase keep the levels much longer and possible to measure Doctor will not order the baseline if the first test was unremarkable. While you can have spikes Well, WebMD acknowledges them and even has a \"Find a Functional Medicine Practitioner\" app on their site. Although I would probably do a Google search for my area and then compare it with the search app on The Institute of Functional Medicine's site. \nI have two functional practitioners who do different things for me, one is a NP who also has a Functional certification on top of it, and the other is an MD with a Functional cert. This means they know more than the conventional medicine practitioners. Mine go into genetics and nutrition. Their counterparts in conventional medicine rarely have either.  Apologies for being US centric, but I do not know what other countries' rules are. Only in USA you have pseudo-science ALT-med institutions. In normal countries homeopathy and other pseudo-science is prohibited.\n\n If we were talking about some of the further out \"modalities\" I might agree. But a doctor having a background in nutrition and genetics *as well as* a board-certified NP or MD is a different situation entirely, which is what I was referring to. Apologies for not being clear. I think the above link is painting with too-wide a brush. As with any other circumstance, it all comes down to doing your homework on the professional you are looking to deal with. if you have chronic diarrhea you may well got ome nutrient deficencies which can cause a lot of trouble. have you had a comprehensive stool analysis? Hi are chemotaxis chemicals considered iodine dye? I think I had mast cell degranulation from contrast dye", "It is surprisingly hard to find a day to do the 24 hour urine!

It is inconvenient but do not mess it up for yourself and have to do it again\u2026 My lab messed it up so I had to do it twice. I have no doubt they messed up the second one, too. I have also just had different docs order it for kicks it seems. I know, I briefly thought I could just take a urine cup in my bag when I go out or to work. But that would be silly. It is ruling iut a big nasty thing, it needs to be done right. I would push back on that so hard. If they ruled out SM once, why do they need to do it again?

I am in upstate new york and a doctor that could likely diagnose me would be really far away, so would like to see if you think it would be worth it.\n\n\nFor over two years I have tried to get a diagnosis for what I feel is wrong with me. After getting sick with bronchitis and the flu two years ago, I feel that I have not gone back to normal. \n\n\nI developed a eustachian tube dysfunction and have some constant pressure in my eustachian tubes. \n\n\nI have constant phlegm or post nasal drip in the throat. I do not have a stuffy nose but my ENT notes inflammation at the confluence of my ENT. \n\n\nI am fairly fatigued and require a lot of sleep. I got a sleep study done that notated slight elevated ReRAs, but nothing that would explain my symptoms, my doctor says. \n\n\nThe main issue I complain about is the brain fog. I feel in a cloud and like that I do not think clearly. \n\n\nI do get flushing when drinking wine and when nervous. \n\n\nI have never had a real rash but I do get pomfillic dermatitis where my hands and fingers get bubbles on them that burst into a patchy, itchy area. I developed this about 4 years ago. \n\n\nI have asthma. Colds will often turn into bronchitis. \n\n\nI have frequent bowel movements, bloating and frequent urination. I got a colonoscopy and everything is fine.\n\n\nAfter showering I need to lay down as I feel overheated. I also have poor temperature regulation and am often cold when everyone is hot.\n\n\nI have painful periods and have cramping when not on period.\n\n \nI had an increased ANA titer 1:1040, but the rheumatologist could not explain why from an extensive panel. \n\n\nI recently developed eosinophilic esophagitis, which can go hand in hand with mast cell diseases, as I have read there eosinophils in the throat attack in partnership with mast cells. This feels like a constant lump in my throat, trouble swallowing, thick mucus, and has been accompanied by chest tightness as well. \n\nI know some of these may be unrelated, but wanted to include all in case there would be some connection. Not a doctor but pretty well all of those symptoms sound like MCAS, from what I have had and what I have read that other people have. A lot of people have had improvements in brain fog after giving up gluten and dairy. MCAS symptoms appearing or worsening after illness or trauma seems to be common. I hope you can find the right doctor. Are you hypermobile(connective tissue disorder) or have dysautonomia?gastroparesis? MCAS can pop up in these illnesses and yours sounds very familiar to me. Thank you, I did eliminate gluten and dairy about a year ago to see if it helped with brain fog and it did not. I have had biopsies done for EoE during an endoscopy and celiacs is negative, but still could have an intolerance. Now with dealing with my EoE I am doing an elimination diet (dairy, gluten, eggs, soy, nuts, shellfish, corn, legumes, alliums) to see if my eosinophils calm down. I have not been diagnosed with any of those. I think the rheumatologist would have been able to spot the connective tissue disorders, so I do not think so. I do have acid reflux and bloating that goes along with gastroparesis, but none of the other symptoms really. As far as dysautonomia, I have quite a few of those symptoms: after showers i am exhausted, brain fog, high heart rate, flush - i have never really thought about why this happens but i have always hated having to shower and just learned over the years to take super quick showers to lessen the effects. i also have chest discomfort, shortness of breath, weakness, excessive sweating, bloating, fatigue, high bladder frequency, flushing, feeling cold, brain fog, aches. I think a lot of those symptoms are non-specific and can be seen with a variety of disorders? but you could definitely be on to something... Well, I certainly would not rule out the possibility. There are a fair number of familiar themes.\n\nThere are two primary diagnostic viewpoints on MCAS. There is the restrictive mainstream definition currently accepted by the AAAAI (American allergists), and there is the permissive definition put forth by a growing number of researchers challenging the mainstream definition.\n\nAt this point, I believe that the totality of considerations fall in favor of the alternate criteria. If you are willing to wade through the research and/or share it with your doctor, here are two papers of note:\n\n- (\n- (\n\nIf you choose to share these with your doctor, do bear in mind and advise them that it is still an alternative viewpoint, but nevertheless one held by a number of prominent researchers. Whether or not it is MCAS or another possibly unnamed mast cell mediator disorder, *the treatments that target mast cell stability tend to be helpful to a much broader range of patients than the AAAAI MCAS criteria encompasses.* And, ultimately, for some doctors, that is more than enough reason to be openminded and explore. Do not forget to check what is in your medications (if any) or supplements (if any) including fillers. Also, if you are taking probiotics, you might want to steer clear of the histamine producing varieties, just to see what happens. Definitely bring it up with your doctor, since you do not want to change too many variables at once and then not know what part of what you are doing/not doing is responsible. Dr. Anne Maitland is a leading immunologist focused on mast cell disorders and she is in Tarrytown, NY. She is doing virtual intake and appointments this year. Of course you will have to make it to a lab in your area for blood tests. You should check her out. She is also just one of the only immunologists I have found that sees patients rather than focusing on research, so even if you have something other than a mast cell disorder, she can help. She mostly sees zebras. You still need to have your own team of doctors locally that she can coordinate care with. Q12\u00b9", "Help understanding My 10 year old already is diagnosed with Eosinophilic Esophagitis. He has not made improvement with this disease despite being top 6 free, potato free, pea free, navy bean free, string bean free, on Budesonide, on Flovent, and using Neocate to supplement his diet. They now suspect he may have Mast Cell Activation Syndrome as well. His blood test came back with elevated Histamine and Tryptase and the doctor wants the tests reran to confirm the results. Does this suggest he does have MCAS? It *might* suggest MCAS.   It depends how high the tryptase was, when the blood sample for the tryptase was taken (meaning, was there a flare-up of symptoms etc).  In all honestly, both tryptase and histamine being elevated is strongly suggestive of MCAS.  I will add more details below. \n\nEoE and MCAS or even mastocytosis are often found alongside each other.  And a lot of us with both EoE and a mast cell disorder have to avoid a *lot* of foods.  I have to avoid every single legume or my EoE flares up. (Legumes are my worst triggers.) As well as alliums (onion or garlic), the only top 8 food that is currently not causing me problems is ironically wheat.  Then there is rice, oats, melons, berries, peaches, pears, nectarines, cherries, plums, apricots, apples, tomatoes, peppers, citrus fruit, sunflower, and I am probably forgetting a few.  Basically anything high histamine triggers my EoE as well as often my MCAS symptoms. There is some out there with corn as an EoE trigger.  And corn is nearly impossible to avoid.   The point of this is, there might be far more triggers than you are aware of that need to be eliminated.  There were for me. \n\nWhen EoE and mast cell disorders are found alongside each other, it is a good idea to look at the family and see if there are any signs of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.  It is a group of hereditary connective tissue disorders that are often found alongside mast cell disorders or eosinophilic disorders.  10 year olds are hard to assess for it.  Because all 10 year olds are always hypermobile.  But if either parent has a high ( or if there is a history of family members with unstable joints that sublux (partially dislocate) from time to time, or just lots of general joint pain, it can be worth looking into.  The most common types of EDS are autosomal dominant.  Meaning one parent with it = a 50% chance per child to inherit.   Depending on age, any Beighton Score of 4 or higher could be significant.  ( would require googling. \n\nTryptase is unique to mast cells.  No other cell in the human body releases it.  Elevated tryptase is pretty solidly suggestive.  However, there is more than one thing that can cause elevated tryptase.  Histamine can be released by basophils as well as mast cells.  But mast cells release the bulk of it.  Elevated histamine + tryptase is highly suggestive of a mast cell disorder\n\nThe difference between a baseline draw, and a reaction draw are as follows.  Baseline samples are taken when the patient feels their best.  Reaction samples require the blood to be drawn when they feel their worst.  Typically it is 30-90 minutes after the start of a significant reaction.\n\nNormal tryptase range is 0-11.5ng.  If baseline tryptase is over 20ng, it is suggestive of mastocytosis.  If baseline tryptase is between 10ng-18ng consistently, it is often the result of Hereditary alpha tryptasemia.  (Genetics test can be used to confirm this.) But can also be the result of monoclonal mast cell activation syndrome.  A baseline tryptase that is always in the normal range does not rule out anything.   For MCAS testing, it is supposed to be a comparison between baseline and reaction tryptase draws.  And tryptase should spike up between the two.  (It is 20% +2ng for a minimum spike in tryptase.). So even someone with a baseline tryptase of 2ng, could have MCAS.  Or even mastocytosis as 15% of mastocytosis cases present with normal tryptase. Not all plants are completely edible. However, you can actually consume the entire sunflower in one form or another. Right from the root to the petals. Thank you for your reply. His draw was a base line draw. I have hyper mobile Elhers Danlos and a high beighton score and my brother has a Chiari one malformation which as I understand, is often found with Elhers as well. I am frustrated because I asked two doctors previously if he could have a mast cell issue and was dismissed. His EOE was diagnosed as reflux initially as well so he is been struggling with symptoms with little to no improvement for over a year. Yeah, ( which likely contributes to why there is both a fair amount of comorbidity between mast cell disorders and EoE, and why (  Essentially, the Eosinophils form couplets with mast cells and the two cell types \"talk\" back and forth with each other.  One cell can set off the other etc.   \n\nEosinophils tend to cause more of the delayed symptoms but long term damage and scarring that narrows the esophagus and is the more significant in the long term.   Where as you can get more short term immediate symptoms from mast cells.  Though (  I have noticed those with EoE who also have MCAS (or mastocytosis), tend to be in the short term reactions camp.  (Though this is just a tendency I have noticed in online groups, and not one I have seen any papers written about.)  This, however, can make it easy to overlook foods that are subtle and cause symptoms the next day or two.  Which is what the majority of EoE patients experience.\n\nSo it might be worth keeping a food journal.  Though I understand just how much of a logistical issue that is as a parent with a school age child.  (My daughter is 9.  And has her own set of food related issues, as well as joint problems.) But if you can keep one, it is often the most effective method of locating subtle trigger foods.  It usually requires a few weeks of data before things start to become obvious.", "Safe Laundry Detergents? Would anyone have advice on laundry detergents that are safe for MCAS as well as just generally very sensitive and reactive skin?  I use a very small amounts of detergent when I put in a wash, put it on a whole second wash (without detergent) and rinse cycle after the first wash (with detergent) and rinse cycle is complete, in order to get rid of as much of the detergent residue as possible, but I can still wake up with hives from my freshly laundered pillow cases. I just recently switched to All free and clear laundry pods and Seventh Generation dryer sheets. So far its working for me! Molly's Suds unscented. The only product that does not give me hives but still does a good job cleaning my clothes are soapberries, I use a similar product for shampoo as well. I will have to look into these Seventh Generation dryer sheets.  Are they scentless?\n\nAll Free and Clear here as well. Mine are yes. They also make slightly scented ones. I know a lot of the people in the MCAS community on Twitter also love cotton dryer balls Interesting.  I have literally never used dryer sheets in my life, due to the scents.   I would like to see what I am missing. Trial and error with any detergent that is free from scents and dye.  I use Seventh Generation successfully, the type without added fragrance or color. (  I also throw baking soda on top of the load in the wash too, and I use wool dryer balls in the dryer (because my mast cells will try to kill me if my clothes have static, because they are THAT petty lmao)\n\nI recommend skipping dryer sheets - even the \"cleaner\" ones are still not great. You are not missing anything but an allergic reaction, pal haha &gt;soapberries\n\nI am working through daughter's reactions and would love to know more about this. What source do you get these from, any prep, how much do you use? Thanks You can get them on Amazon.  I have not tried them yet because I already had a detergent that worked, but they seem easy to find. All free and clear and method free and clear both work for me. Reacted a lot to tide free/clear and seventh generation free/clear. Think it will vary per person. Seventh generation products were the answer for me. I had some sort of reaction or psoriasis flare to most others (like all free &amp; clear). Bonus: they smell good, but not overpowering (no instant migraine). Double bonus: they actually work I got a pack on amazon of soapberries called eco nuts, they are easy to use and last for many cycles through the washer and dryer.

Have no clue if that is related\n\n-I have noticed a weird visual spot issue follows these symptoms too\n\nSO this long winded story is to ask: does this sound like Mast cell? Sorry for the huge post! OH last thing, I get these weird red dots like pinprick size. They are not raised, they do not itch, and they do not go away once they appear.\n\nAgain, I have no idea what is related to what I just want to make sure I have some clue what the hell im talking about before my appointment There are a few different mast cell disorders out there and people experience them in unique ways with varying degrees of severity so anything is possible. I will share that this does not sound similar to my experience or the experience of other people I know with mast cell disorders. We all experienced typical anaphylactic reactions to foods and medications. \n\nMy mother who does not have a mast cell disorder experienced unexplained itching and it ended up being due to an ingredient in the oatmeal she was eating. The answer to these questions is always going to be maybe or maybe not. It sounds like you might want to consult with an allergist to check for allergies, but mast cell disease are incredibly complex so it is hard to say if you are dealing with one. We are also not doctors so any response should be taken with a grain of salt. If you think this is something to bring up with a practitioner then find an allergist who can help guide you more than a general practitioner. Like the other poster, this does not sound akin to my experience, which has been primarily skin, GI, cardiovascular, and allergic (meaning anaphylaxis) in nature. Seconding this, but adding that I know a number of people diagnosed with mast cell disorders (some \"MCAS\", some \"unspecified\") who do not experience reactions that are severe enough to typically be labelled anaphylaxis. Instead, they experience multi-organ reactions of lesser severity. Those reactions tend to increase in severity over the course of years and it would not be unreasonable to infer that they might progress to anaphylaxis if uncontrolled.\n\nWhatever you want to label those conditions, they appear to clearly benefit from antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers. That is a sign of flushing I have definitely had the trembling and twitching eyelid but I also have hashimotos. Have you had your thyroid checked? Not just TSH but free T3,free T4, etc? I would also get your B12, ferritin,vitamin D and folate checked. Thyroid dysfunction worsens allergies. It does not sound like my experience with MCAS, but who knows! I would get some bloodwork done, preferably testing of your vitamin levels and thyroid. If you are having trembling and twitching and tingling, plus eye involvement, I would most definitely see a neurologist as well. Agree with all of this - it is highly individual. I also did not go from living a normal life to waking up on day and having anaphylactic reactions to everything - it progressed to that stage over 15 years. I would go through long periods of being fine and others when I was having significant symptoms. \n\nThere are, however, lots of other conditions that respond to the same types of medication, so it is good to keep that in mind and leave no stone unturned. 100%", "Help with headaches \u201cHave any of you who have had bad headaches with MCAS found relief with any particular drugs?\n\nI have chronic migraines and occipital neuralgia along with a lot of other symptoms (GI issues, photophobia, itching, fatigue, brain fog, etc). The photophobia and pain are the WORST, so I was wondering if anyone has found that mast cell stabilizers (I was Rxed Chromyln this week!) or antihistamines have helped with pain.\n\nThanks for your input.\u201d\n\n- my wife who cannot look at screens due to photophobia A relative of mine has occipital neuralgia. She is tried everything and found shots of botox are the only thing that helps. \u201cThanks. Botox actually made me worse. I have abortive medications that work for my headaches but I cannot tolerate any preventatives. What I was wondering is if anyone has found that treating their MCAS helped with their headaches.\u201d I just have regular headaches and migraines. However, Cromolyn helped a lot with preventing them. I always thought mine were from EDS, then once the Cromolyn started doing it is magic I realized they are from MCAS. I used to get them every day, now maybe 2 times/week, have not had a migraine in a couple months. I hope the Cromolyn helps yours as well! Ohhhh. I misunderstood the question. I had daily chronic migraines and cromolyn sodium took them away. I get one every once in a while but theres always a trigger. It also fixed my photophobia. I wore sunglasses all the time but now I even forget to put them on sometimes. I take melatonin for migraine prevention.\n\nBest advice is avoid all your triggers. I know it is not easy. Foods are my main problems. Citrus is a guaranteed migraine trigger for me. Does not take much either.\n\nIf screens bother you they do make migraine glasses, have not tried them, there are 2 different brands.\n\nStay away from low frequency florescents.\n\nIt is been very sunny lately, I have been keeping the drapes closed. I wear sunglasses and a hat outside.\n\nA great migraine preventative is psylocybin. Or LSD. I got rid of my migraines for 20 years thanks to LSD. \u201cThanks you so much for responding. Avoiding triggers is good advice but very difficult for me since my main trigger is light. I wear migraine glasses and they do help. \n\nFascinating about the LSD. Were you micro dosing?\u201d \u201cI am so glad the cromolyn worked for you. It very encouraging to me. I am excited to try it!\u201d \u201cHi friend \ud83e\udd16 \ud83d\udc27. I am starting to feel like I know you and we have a lot of health issues in common. I am so happy for you that cromolyn helped and cannot wait to try it. \ud83e\udd1e\ud83d\ude00\u201d I hope you get relief with the cromolyn! I went very slowly at first and worked up the dosage. Good luck. Yes. I take a custom-compounded medication that helps with all of my mast cell symptoms, including headaches. \u201cThanks, curious what it is.\u201d (\n\nNothing works for everybody, but it is the only thing that works for me. I have been able to reduce my migraines by about half on amitriptyline. \n\nOther than that, the only thing that helps is medical marijuana, but I know this is not an option for everyone. Just plain CBD oil helps me as well, but does not set in as fast as vaping CBD (again, I know many cannot vape) What is in it??? main ingredient is the patient's processed blood I second the amitriptyline suggestion. I take it nightly before bed and it is reduced my migraines by about half. As soon as the bad ones start to hit, Ubrelvy helps start them, or at the very least make them not severe. Sounds interesting, been wanting to see how lsd might help.  I did not even think mushrooms would be possible, thinking with them being fungus it will cause a reaction themselves.  I guess maybe taking kidney/ DAO pills beforehand could help prevent a reaction. If you have MCAS, the first and most important treatment in my opinion is an antihistamine diet.  Being very strict and avoiding histamine rich foods and histamine liberators is critical.  I use this diet list, it is pretty accurate.  Though for myself I cannot do blackberries.  \n\n\n\n\nSome people have problems with \u201cother amines\u201d, though I do not.  Most important is avoiding foods with \u201chistamine\u201d and avoiding \u201cliberators\u201d which liberate histamine in you body.  \n\n\nI also eat foods that have mild antihistamine properties.  My favorite being sweet potatoes.  I eat them everyday and if I do not I will have a slight headache.  But it is not a miracle in that I can cheat eating histamine foods and it will relieve the headaches it would cause.  Peaches and blueberries have antihistamine abilities, though cannot eat peaches that are ripe or too soft, as fruit grows histamine as it ripens.  Even an apple, usually a very safe food can grow histamine on one spot if their is a bruise(it is fine if I just do not eat a bruised/ discolored spot).  \n\nSweet potatoes tastes great after I thoroughly microwave them at night, let cool in Ingrid overnight, peel in morning.  And mash and mix with a little almond butter.  I snack on that and fruit in the day.  Eating lots of hard boiled eggs, making sure the white of the egg is cooked as it must be cooked thoroughly and allowed to cook off to get rid of histamine.  Green bananas are good but as soon as they start to soften some/ yellow they grow histamine and get bad.  So I make sure to get very green/ hard bananas and peel/ freeze them in freezer bags, though I do not allow the frozen ones to completely defrost with worries it will grow histamine.  \n\nI like eating red potatoes at night, a lot of times with eggs.  I will only use Himalayan salt for seasoning most of the time.  Cook only with California ranch olive oil, many olive oils are imitation and could have histamine that brand is certified olive oil.  \n\nFor a stabilizer I take EMIQ from Natural Factors.  It is quercetin but the bioavailable form since regular quercetin is hard to absorb.  I will sometimes take krill oil from Jarrow brand if I am in pain and it helps.  Nature made Vit d tablet(not capsule).  A lot of times I will take Rutin from Country Life.  From doing reading Rutin gets absorbed in the body and turns into quercetin, but it just takes longer to absorb.  The Rutin pill is 500mg and I take 1/4 at night before sleep, so 125mg and it really helps me feel refreshed in the morning.  \n\n\nAlso a vitamin C is a good idea as it is a natural antihistamine.  Looking for one myself.  \nSodium bicarbonate/ baking soda is used as a natural antihistamine by some.  Online has more info on how much.   Potassium bicarbonate is also antihistamine and some mix 50/50 so one gets a balance of sodium / potassium.  \n\nI find meditating also helps.   And working out can really help when one is able to.\n\nOne mast thing is kidney pills from Ancestral Supplements.  For some foods that have some histamine (not a lot), you can take some of those kidney pills 15 min before eating some histamine food and help prevent a reaction.  They naturally contain DAO which breaks down histamine in food in your stomach.  Though it does not work on histamine liberators, only foods with some histamine.  I will use it for when ordering out and eating a steak or steak tacos w cilantro and onion.  It is always a guessing game on how many, sometimes I take 4, sometimes 8 at a time.  Though the brand recommend starting out at one pill a day and building up.  They can cause me to have a hard time going to sleep if I take them too late at night. High dose magnesium made my migraines almost completely disappear, but I have electrolyte issues that come with POTS, so I might have just been treating that. I still need to avoid triggers (alcohol, bad sleep, stress) but I do a lot better now. Mineral supplements (magnesium, potassium etc. without fillers or dyes) in water may help a bit. \u201cThank you for all these great ideas. I have found several food triggers like sugar that I avoid like COVID-19. But I recently tried gluten free + diary free for six weeks and I actually degraded. I will look into trying these supplements and the antihistamine diet. \n\nGlad you found things that help you!\u201d \u201cWhat dose are you taking? I take 200 mg a day.\u201d \u201cThanks!\u201d Your welcome.  I am not sure if you have been diagnosed with mast cell activation or if it is your hunch.  But the first thing to try is the anti-histamine diet.   If you feel relief after a couple weeks than you probably have your answer.  \n\nThere are other lists online of the worst offenders, but anyone with a \u201c3\u201d or \u201cL\u201d for liberator is a bad one.  I do not even eat anything with a \u201c1\u201d unless I take a kidney pill.  But before buying supplements I would do the diet to see if there is any improvement with that alone.  \n\nOne thing to keep in mind, some have issues with things like salicylates, which are in sweet potatoes I believe.  I do not have any issues with them, but some people have to avoid them as well as histamine.  I do not think it is with most people who have to avoid histamine.  There is food lists online on salicylates, I guess it is one of the \u201camines\u201d, but I do not know much about them since it is not a worry for me.  Just wanted to share since it is another issue some have to worry about.  \n\nGood luck, I hope you get better.  \n\nAnd one thing, on that link I shared make sure to read some of the details in the notes.   It shares things to be wary of.  Like cantaloupes can be fantastic and make me feel good but then I noticed some made me feel horrible, the notes had info that some have too many pesticides and are intolerable.  So I figured it was why it was iffy.  So there is nothing set in stone for a lot of food.  And I believe things like quinoa, it can be good or bad depending on where it is grown and the species.  \n\nSo it can necessitate testing foods to make certain they are 100% ok.  Getting 100% safe foods where you can feel great is ideal, and then adding 1 new food for a few days and making sure no bad affects happen (of course if you feel bad just a couple hrs later you have an answer that it is not good).  And that is for a lot of \u201csafe\u201d foods on that list, seems like the veggies and fruit on the list are mostly ok for me, as long as they are fresh.  Potatoes are good as long as I cut out discolored spots.  But stuff like grains and rice are hit or miss.  \n\nAnd meat can rapidly grow histamine.  Best to buy frozen poultry/ beef at stores or online.  Beef I read recently is aged for two weeks after butchering, so has higher chance for growing more histamine than poultry.  Though I am always taking those kidney pills 15-20 beforehand for meat.  Any meat leftovers must be frozen.  Rice needs to be frozen as well.  \n\nJust some more things I learned for myself.  I was able to relive all symptoms and feel normal again, but it takes daily work with diet and supplements.  I have to take that EMIQ everyday no matter how good my diet is.  Good luck! I take 500mg, I used to take a lower dose but more = more effective for me. Magnesium does not work for everyone, unfortunately.", "Baseline Tryptase Just got my BL back at 4.4 ug/L. I have no clue what that means or if it is even accurate. Does anyone know where I am supposed to go from here? Basically trying to see if I have any mast cell issues happening. Have you done the 24-hr urine test? No just a baseline for now Sorry - I am not following.  The 24-hr test is for creatinine and n-methylhistamine, not Tryptase. I have not done those tests. Only a baseline tryptase blood test. You should have an order to return to the lab when you are in a flair. That way, they can compare the baseline to the flair and see if it is 20% +2 over your baseline number. Granted, this is just one possible test and often does not show anything even when someone has mcas, simply because their issue is another marker, like histamine or leukotrienes. \n\nMine was a clear demonstration, though. My first test was 13.1, did not even realize I was in a flair. Returned when I was feeling well for a better baseline and got a 6.8 I think. They were like, \"yeah, do not bother returning for a flair result, you have got it\" lol Ooo ok. I hope I can persuade my doc for more testing cuz she was like meh My tryptase did not show any abnormalities. I even took a strong trigger on purpose before the test!  \nSometimes it is just not a good measure from what I have read. Not sure if the following would help but...here it is anyway.  :) \n\n  \n\\*\"Can you have mastocytosis with normal tryptase levels? While is it possible to have mastocytosis with normal tryptase levels, it is pretty uncommon. The more challenging situation is whether anything can be made of a normal tryptase level. Some experts in mast cell disease have been asserting for the last several years that a rise in tryptase by 20% over a baseline asymptomatic level, plus an additional 2 ng/ml, identifies a state of mast cell activation (compared to the state of mast cells when the tryptase level has not risen by that much, and even when the \"20% + 2\" result is still within the normal range for tryptase levels in the blood) and that a rise of \"20% + 2\" should be the sole laboratory marker for diagnosing MCAS.  However, so far this formula is only an assertion, and no data has yet been published demonstrating any validity to it.\"\\* (", "Did anyone try tofacitinib? ", "Is Pre-Medication (for us) still recommended for the Vaccine? I already got my first shot and I Pre-Medicated by doubling my normal antihistamines. However for my second shot I am unsure because I thought it might have the potential to affect vaccine efficacy (honestly do not know). I also see that some countries have changed their guidance to not premedicating, as a general rule. However I wondered if the mast cell experts are still recommending Pre-Medication specifically for us with mast cell disease? I have MCAS btw \n\nBtw I am aware that many people on here have already been vaccinated. However I do not live in the US and my country is very far behind in rollout so please bear with me that this is still topical for my situation. From what I understand there has been some information released by the CDC advising people not to pre-medicate before getting the vaccine, but this does not apply to people with mast cell disease. \nYou may find more info here\n\n\n\nI do not have any further info on other countries, here in the U.K. I have been advised to pre-medicate. The bottom line is to do as advised by your doctor really! I have been told to pre and post-medicate differently due to my reaction to the first dose. My allergist-immunologist is a a bigwig in the mcas/eds/pots medical circles and he would not allow me to get the vaccine **unless** I premedicated (for reference I am in \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6). For the moderna shot last week I took 40mg Zyrtec, 40mg pepsid, 20mg singulair, 200mg nalcrom 4hr prior to getting the vaccine and I still required Benadryl and salbutamol during the one hour waiting period afterwards. I continued to have systemic reactions/fever for about 72hrs post injection despite maxing out on mast cell stabilizers and antihistamines but for me the most challenging aspect was how it affected my autonomic nervous systems. My resting heart rate fluctuated bw 55-175bpm and I could not get up off the couch without fainting due to my bp bottoming out. Have pretty much returned to baseline by day 7 and when all\u2019s said and done it went better than I was anticipating\u2026hurray for no anaphylaxis \ud83c\udf89 I took usual morning fenfaxadine and a ketotifen beforehand. Started itching about 30 minutes afterwards so took diphenhydramine, then repeated an hour later and I was fine. No side effects at all.\n\nTook diphenhydramine only before first jab and had no issues with that one at all. I was advised not to pre-medicate other that what my AM medications are. Idiopathic anaphylaxis and I had no issues aside from a localized site reaction one week after the vaccine. My daughter was told not to premedicate before the Pfizer shot. She had a reaction right afterwards which was treated with benadryl, but she is not able to get the second dose now. \n\nI took 100 mg benadryl an hour before I got the J&amp;J vaccine, and after I got it, I felt very warm and nauseated, but nothing worse. We were told to keep my son on his normal meds (cromolyn, zyrtec &amp; hydroxizine) &amp; not to pre-medicate with anything extra. Allergist/Immunologist said if we gave benadryl before, it might delay the reaction &amp; we would not be around medical professionals anymore. She said she preferred the J &amp; J for my son (11) but to take whichever was approved first for his age. \n\nOf interesting note, I asked if he was considered more at risk for the inflammatory issues happening in some kids. She said info was showing his MCAS actually put him more at risk for long haulers I had the Pfizer,  and took extra Allegra before the shot and benadryl  after.  I had a relatively mild reaction to the first 1.  The second 1 put me down for 3 days.  I was extremely sick.  Took another week to feel normal.  All in all still better than covid. I did not pre-medicate for my first but my immunologist wants me to pre-medicate for my second due to reaction. I think the worry about pre-medicating is that it can retard a severe reaction. I took all the meds. Zyrtec, Pepcid, montelukast, Allegra, cromolyn, and Benadryl. I take them normally and I also got an epipen just for the occasion. We might need to get a specific vaccine in the future but for now you should follow your trusted docs advice and what you and your history reflects and take all precautions necessary. My hospital has been tracking patients that take certain meds and track exposure and will probably try to get people in this group to get tested to see how effective the vaccine is in this group. People with transplants have been tracked at the hospital as well and immunosuppressants(so definitely check in with your doc if you are immune suppressed) have made the vaccines not work well and will likely be recommended to take Johnson and Johnson but it is all new research and recommendations are changing by the day as more and more information gets published. I would suggest keeping up on the recommendations alert not anxious. It is difficult for sure! Hope this helps.", "Anyone use Amitriptyline? I just got off an appointment with my psychiatrist, and this is one of the medications we decided to give a shot. Amitriptyline.\n\nAccording to this article, it is one of the options for a medication that can help so I do not know.\n\nMy biggest issues, number one being brain fog and fatigue, and the other one being a hyper focus that actually causes me to not be able to sleep, sensations like restless leg, things like that.\n\n Amitriptyline made my POTS really bad, but it helped mcas symptoms kind of. I didnt do well on it. It was not for MCAS though, it was for anxiety. My anxiety got much better with proper treatment of MCAS by an immunologist. If your doctor prescribed it, they think it will help. Its worth a try. Everyone is different and responds differently to meds. I have a really bad hyper focus problem, that I think is related to Mast cell, smells, sounds, thoughts, become super sticky and it makes it hard for me to get rest.\n\nSo she said, my psych anyway, after reading this and discussing it that that might be a good candidate for me since it has been helpful for MCAS. I dunno.\n\nI really just want to get rid of this brain fog. That would be amazing. Do you have POTS? If not It could be very beneficial for you, it is certainly worth a try. I mean even if you do have POTS it still might not affect you the way it did me I do not know what pots is. I do not think so nobody has diagnosed me with anything like that. I took it for depression before my diagnosis. I think it unwittingly treated me because I only manifested anaphylaxis a month or two after I transitioned off it. I liked it - I took higher doses than is used for MCAS. I did get headaches with it but it helped me sleep and thinking back I wasnt nearly as itchy. I have it prescribed for migraines. It has reduced them from the occasional awful migraine to more frequent lesser migraines. I do not feel like it has done anything at all for my depression, whereas other meds such as trazodone and sertraline worked better for me. It has not helped my sleep or restless legs nearly as much as trazodone has. It has helped the brain fog just ever so slightly, almost not noticeable. In my personal experience, amitriptyline is better as a migraine med than as anything else. How do you get in to see an immunologist ? I guess it depends where you live. Have you found anything that works well for brain fog? Quercetin has helped a little! Hmmm. I have that, I have only taken it a few times I do not know if it makes a difference or not I took a small dose of amytriptiline for  15 - 20 years for sleep and pain, and it worked well. I was encouraged to go off it, which i did very gradually. I had no adverse reactions. After being off it for 2 or 3 years my doc suggested i try it again. I had all the bad and paradoxical side effects this time and lasted less than a week. Idk why but I feel Quercetin gives me low blood pressure Oh weird. But it worked when it worked. We are starting with a small dose. I believe amytriptiline can cause restless legs - you may want look into that. Have you considered Trazadone? I am taking it and I am very happy. I take a very low dose (10-20mg) and it helps me sleep through the night. My insomnia was bad before, and lack of sleep makes me have more brain fog than this medicine. I can hardly tell I am on it, every other sleep medicine and even other tricyclic antidepressants made me so sleepy or depressed. So they are starting me at a very low dose. Good. I hate sleep medicine that makes me over tired", "UK - can you help? How to motivate a referral for testing, illumination and possible diagnosis Hello all,\n\nBeing my first post on this subject in any forum, I am most definitely new to this and as was demonstrated only 3 weeks ago, with my first series of whole body shock responses, increasing in severity across the following 3 further shock responses and at the most recent \"event\", admission to emergency treatment and discounting of Anaphylaxis (based upon appearance of torso-based lesions, red marks etc).\n\nI would like then to please ask for your advice on how to motivate a referral to prove or disprove a Mastocytosis Activation diagnosis?\n\nIt is important to note that I am diagnosed with Autism and ADHD, as well as, three further trauma-based mental health conditions all of which are under supervision from Psychiatrists, and a medication regime that has been stable for more than 2 years.\n\nToo, the response from a wide range of NHS medical professions, including all GPs and Senior Nurse at my GP Surgery, have brought me to a point where three responses to visual, research, statistical and consultant-based evidence are defined by: you are making this up, your mental health is to blame (leading to questioning for possible sectioning) and misdiagnosis.\n\nIn this way, without doubt my GP Surgery will refuse a referral. As an alternative however, I have approached past and present Consultant Psychiatrists - at this level are able to refer into any service regardless of own specialism - that has resulted without surprise, in questioning of my current state of mind.\n\n...and I believe to change GP Surgery now, to build any sense of patient-GP relationship and get to a point of seriously discussing a referral - based upon evidence and fact - will result in my increasing the possible next shock response and risk to life, which I value too much to wait around for.\n\nIn short then, how in your own experience have you motivated a referral? Has this included a particular set of evidence? Have you paid privately? Have you explained your own situation in a certain way that seemed to work? Or any other experience-based suggestion that did not result on a judgement of mental ill health?\n\nNaturally, I believe, I have been through several round of such sanity questioning, but only return to fact and evidence proving that now, an unknown trigger creates in me a response (captured with photos when physical), is not Anaphylaxis (defined by Consultant since I have never previously had lesions, red marks etc on my torso), the current stability of medication regime (clearly, own responsibility but evidential through dates of prescribing), and on the last occasion, a need to call for emergency medical help as a result of the severity of responses. Thus, leading to the only other disease that exactly fits and was made aware to me by a leading Anaphylaxis organisation.\n\nI hope and trust the above does not sound like a help call from a crisis state - a recurrent judgement from others - rather a sense of relief at the possibility for an answer, or not and if not, the possibility for new answers to be made available to me somehow, somewhere and at sometime.\n\nThank you for your time reading, and should you like to respond, thank you for your time taken writing about how things have been or are for you.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you.

Hi all, I originally shared this in the EDS sub but someone recommend I check out this sub too. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nOG post\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nIt is me. Again. I know it is common for people with EDS to have things like MCAS but I do not really think that applicable to me. I was wondering if anyone knew if similar conditions that are not as severe\u2026?\n\nMy allergies, so far, are mostly environmental\u2026 but it seems to be\u2026 everything?\n\nLaundry detergents. Skin care products. Hair care products. \nUhh lotions. (Oh latex and a lot of bandage adhesives too)\n\nLots of nature. Tree. Grass. Pollen. DUST MITES are absolutely the worst for me tho. Along with mold.\n\nI am sure there is a lot more going on than I am unaware of because I am constantly in an inflamed state despite my blood work coming back \u201cnormal\u201d for inflammation.\nMy face is always red and rashy and you can see the skin around my eyes clearly because it is not covered. \n\nTons of dermatologists are confused and do not know what to make of it. Even if I try cleansing diets and and topical creams the rash persists.\nAnd it covers a bit of my chest too.\n\nI do not get hives (or I have not gotten hives) but im just\u2026 chronically red. Skin is rough. Frequently itchy. I get chemical burns SO much from \u201chypoallergenic\u201d products too.\n\nI do not even know where to begin looking.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAdditional information:\nI am pretty sure I have temperature deregulation and a plethora of other symptoms (maybe POTS/dysautonomia)\nI thought maybe my thyroid was a factor because my neck is always swollen but my TSH levels are normal\nMy thyroid ultrasound was also normal \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nA lot of folks in the EDS sub suggested MCAS but I wondered if there was anything else similar to that that I should research???? \n\nI am reading through other posts on here as we speak.\n\nUHHH. Ok another change \nFood wise I do get GI issues because I have diverticulosis. Have you had labs to assess mast cell activation (sent to Mayo) from the plasma and urine at the time of a flare? No I have not \ud83d\udc40 how do I do that? Call and ask your specialists if they are able to assess you for Mast Cell disorders. Not all drs no what it is. I recommend finding an immunologist with experience in MCAS to start the lab work process. Ty! In the past (1970's - 1990's), people with reactions to laundry detergents, skin care products, hair care products, adhesives, artificial fragrance, etc. were said to have \"Multiple Chemical Sensitivity.\"  The MCS theory was not received well, and few doctors actually diagnose it.  It is more common for people to get a fibromyalgia, ME/CFS and/or MCAS diagnosis.  \n\nMy personal theory, and there are reasons I have come to believe this, is that some subset of substances used in the chemical industry cause other substances generated by microbes to undergo a change.  The body only reacts to the changed microbial substance. Take the microbe away, or take the man made chemical changing whatever the microbe produces, and there is no reaction. \n\nSo you think you are reacting to laundry detergent, but actually something in the detergent is changing a substance in the air that was generated by a microbe that lives in the soil around you.\n\nThis theory would explain a lot.  It might explain why people move and do better for a while, but go downhill again several months after the move.  The microbe needed time to take up residence in the soil in the new home.  It could explain why people get sick initially while having a virus.  The immune system got activated, and decided to target the modified microbial substance.  The immune system is having trouble desensitizing because the randomness of the change the microbial substance undergoes.  It could explain why people get sick in water damaged homes.  There are a lot of microbes that start growing in water damaged homes, giving the immune system a lot of microbial substances to get confused over when a virus activates the immune system.\n\nAt any rate.  I am afraid no one can give you a really good answer.  Lots of people will try.  There is so much that is unknown and so much misinformation out there.  However, the involvement of the immune system and/or mast cells might be a good guess. I have MCAS, but I do not have skin sensitivities or sensitivities to chemicals like you are describing. Just saying that because I do not have specific recommendations for what you are experiencing. I do not hear this book recommended a lot on here, but I read Never Bet Against Occam by Dr Afrin when my doctor told me he suspected MCAS. There is a lot of content in the book that will not be relevant to you, but it does a great job of explaining how testing is done, why it is so difficult to test for MCAS, what research needs to be done, and it talks about how each major body system can be affected by MCAS. I learned that my migraines may be associated with MCAS from that book, and over time, my migraine frequency and severity largely correlated with when I ingest trigger foods that make me have a reaction. You may learn things about yourself that you did not know that could help your issues overall if you do end up having MCAS. I read the book not at all convinced I had MCAS, and I was more reading to rule it out. It was very valuable to me to know why some of my MCAS tests were negative and what other testing could be done to get a diagnosis. Also, there is tons of information in there about medications that can be used because if you have MCAS, a wide variety of medications may help you and they all have pros and cons, like side effects and cost. Good luck to you. I hope you figure out what is going on. I always suspect MCAS when someone has a condition like EDS and they are highly reactive. Does not mean they have it, but it means it is probably worth trying to rule out at the very least. I have EDS,MCAS,POTS and hashimotos. Your symptoms sound like mcas to me. Keep in mind it is very possible to have normal test results and still have mcas. I have heard a lot of doctors will dismiss mcas if someone has a normal tryptase level and it is fairly common for people to have normal tryptase. You will probably find this video interesting:\n Thanks for this!!! Tysm! I may be wrong on this, so hopefully someone else can chime in. I am wondering if you have any spots on your skin that are part of the rash/reaction that stay there consistently and whether a doctor would be able to biopsy this to analyze whether it has abnormal mast cells. That might be more for people with mastocytosis though. I do not have skin involvement with my MCAS, so I am really not knowledgeable on the skin testing stuff. Hmm.. \ud83e\udd14 I am unfamiliar with mastocytosis \nBut my face is almost always inflamed. But it does calm down sometimes/get worse.\n\nSo today I went to the hospital for some bloodwork and a CT scan. And the sterile environment calmed my throat so it is opened up now for the time being. But then I stepped outside and sometime after I left the hospital (maybe in the car) I started flushing and my ears and face were hot to the touch. Not a fever.\nBut it happens sometimes without explanation. And my face has kind of like that until I got home. Maybe something in the car caused the flare up? Idk. \n\nSorry this was a ramble and unrelated XD \n\nBut a biopsy might be an option. Idk Mastocytosis is easier to test for than Mast Cell Activation Syndrome. They ruled out Mastocytosis on day one of testing for me, but it took about a year to get an MCAS diagnosis because testing is tricky. Skin biopsies are common with Mastocytosis. Not sure about skin biopsies and MCAS. \n\nHave you had regular allergy testing done like skin prick tests and blood tests? Mastocytosis is easier to test for than Mast Cell Activation Syndrome. They ruled out Mastocytosis on day one of testing for me, but it took about a year to get an MCAS diagnosis because testing is tricky. Skin biopsies are common with Mastocytosis. Not sure about skin biopsies and MCAS. \n\nHave you had regular allergy testing done like skin prick tests and blood tests? \n\nAlso, I love beignets. LOL I also love beignets.\nI did regular allergy testing in like middle school and it was very general. Grid on the back.\nMold. Trees. Grass. Pollen. Uh certain animals?\n\nI also do not have any of those records. OMG. ARE YOU ME?!? Did I unknowingly post this?!? Holy cow!\n\nWhat have you tried to mitigate your symptoms so far? \nFree and clear detergents? Dust mite covers? Air purifier?\n\nAre you taking any allergy medications?\n\nHave any sinus symptoms?\n\nWhat exactly are your GI symptoms? Diarrhea? I use pillow covers when I can but I could be better at that. Not all my pillows have them. I have a fan/purifier combo in my room currently and in the family room.\n\nMy mom buys the detergent tbh hahaha but she found one that does not make me itch (I am blanking on the name rn). \n\nUhh shampoos and soaps are hard. Some make me itch while others make my rash on my face worse or even make me break out. \n\nI take allegra or Claritin for my \u201cseasonal\u201d allergies or when I am around friends/family with pets. I have dogs but they are hypoallergenic and I keep them short and clean etc. others\u2026 I always have reactions with their pets.  \nOne time I had to walk home from school in college and my eyes were nearly swollen shut because I walked through pollen. And my mom came home and found me crying in the ground\u2014eyes raw and puffy.\n\nSo sinus wise \ud83d\udc46\nI get the sneezes and the headaches (especially in the eyes)  the tickle in the throat in a dusty classroom\u2026 \n\nGI symptoms:\nNausea often after eating, usually diarrhea, gut pains, etc.\nGreasy foods hurt. Uhh a lot of meat hurts. Hell sometimes cold water hurts. Strawberries for sure hurt. I am supposed to stay away from high fat foods and seedy foods according to my GI doc (was legit told this yesterday or the day before) Let me start with: I am not a doctor, but\u2026.. \n\nEncapsulating my mattress did wonders for my itchy skin. And every pillow I use at night. Which is 3, because I am a high maintenance sleeper. I also replaced our 7 year old fabric couch with a leather one. \n\nWith all these allergies, do you have an allergist? Mine is who handles my MCAS stuff. We connected the dots after a presumptive EDS diagnosis. I am on FIVE medications from her alone. 2 Rx, 3 OTC. I have been drastically better just following her regime for the last 9 months. She has referred me to an MCAS specialist to see what she has to say. \n\nJust starting with an H1 and H2 histamine receptor medicine could probably help you. Since you have indoor and outdoor allergies, she would probably say take those year round, not as needed. I personally take Zyrtec and Pepcid. Allegra (and it is generic) are to damn expensive! \n\nMy gut is the same. Allergist referred me to a Gastro to rule out any other diagnoses, and I got scoped from both ends, then an upper GI bowel study. We found out I have super fast bowels and stuff moves completely through me in 45 minutes. But other than 1 diverticulum, pretty normal overall. I have just decided to do OMAD/intermittent fasting, or I would be on the toilet all day long.\n\nMy allergist is absolutely amazing, and the best doctor I have ever had. She is my medical detective, and loves the pursuit of a diagnosis. \n\nWhere is the rash on your face? Specific parts or all over? I do not have an allergist. I am kind of in limbo but I am also new to my insurance? I started it in March of this year \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f (I am at that age you get booted off your parents plan automatically)\nMeeting with a new GP tomorrow\nMight ask about allergist\nIt is not one of the initial concerns I brought up with the first GP because I did not think of it \ud83d\ude02\nMy brain fog has been making me super scatter brained.\n\nThis rash in particular is on my face and chest.\nBut only my face red. \n\nI do get random allergic rashes from unknown cusses and they are different. Today I got some on my arm \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAlso I get bumps on my hands or lips if I use something that I am allergic to like\u2014most chapstick brands and a lot of soap/hand sanitizer \n\nBut those are allll different from my face That is kind of what mast cell is. Nothing freaking makes sense. It would be easier to pinpoint 50 things you are actually allergic to. Foods for me can be fine one day, and then make me flare, then fine again. \n\nStarting the H1 and H2 inhibitors could probably help you. And they are both OTC, so no need for a doctor for now. \n\nThere is a prescription drug called oral cromolyn that is the gold standard for MCAS food related issues. It is a capsule you open and mix with exactly 4oz of water to drink. You take it 4 times a day, 30 mins before food and before bed. It was genuinely way to high maintenance for my lifestyle, so I have not tried it yet. \n\nI would search your area for allergists (and read reviews) before propositioning your GP, and also make sure they are covered under insurance. I just self referred myself and child to mine. \n\nAlso get that mattress protector for the dust mites! It is a game changer! Maybe you have an few super sensitive environmental allergies that are true allergies versus MCAS. But it sounds like you have reactions to weird things like MCAS people do versus more simple true allergies. Yeah that is why I am puzzled.", "Was this an allergic reaction? Hello. I got take out for the first time in a year, and had some type of reaction. It was chicken lo mein from a chinese restaurant. I laid down after eating, I think I fell alseep for just a little while. Then when I woke up, I had chills. I also a bit nauseated, and i felt a sense of dread. The dread got worse, I then checked my BP and it was high 155/110. I was also shaking at this point. I thought I was going to pass out. I think it must have been from the lo mein. Surprisingly, my stomach did not get heart burn or pain. However, my throat became very sore and felt like it had a lump in it. I look back there with a flash light and saw raised inflamation, almost such that you see with some sort of blister. Is this an allergic reaction?  \n\n\n I have been on gastritis diet for severe heart burn / stomach pain. I started cromolyn a week ago just to see if it would help with the heart burn, cannot tell if it is working. However, it is weird that I did not have the stomach pain today if it was from the lo mein. My body reacts weirdly to MSG which can be in Chinese food. Google \u201cmsg bad reactions\u201d... Hope ya feel better soon! MSG is in almost everything. Chicken Parmesan for instance is loaded with it. You have any dish with protein/fats together with salt, and it is going to happen. Thank you for explaining this. Chinese food is known to have high levels of MSG. That is a bit of a misconception though. Chinese food gets a bad rap but MSG is naturally occurring or added almost everywhere. We can agree to disagree on that one.   Lol.  Enjoy your holidays! No. It is a verifiable fact. I am not going to agree with you for being wrong. Wow! Argumentative much... Not really. You are just wrong. MSG is naturally occurring in things like tomatoes and cheese. Google msg and racism or xenophobia. The Chinese Food msg narrative is basically just a trope. Did you ever hear the This American Life episode about it? It is really interesting. \n\n\n Do you have a gluten allergies or wheat. \n\nFor me onions, black pepper and garlic make my throat close up.  \nThe other possibility could have been mild food poisoning. No. Good stuff. I get reactions like this all the time. They are the worst. The sense of impending doom and anxiety are awful. So not only is it factually wrong to say that Chinese food is the main culprit for MSG, but it is also racist!\n\nGo buy some peanuts.  Just regular old salted peanuts.  They have tons of MSG.  I do not think peanuts are Chinese food.", "Weird knots at the outer side of the breast (lymph nodes?) \nThey appear and regress since they first made themselves noticeable by pain and swelling last year. Shortly after MCAS flared big time. \n\nAFAIK MCAS often goes hand in hand with gynecological diseases, fibrosis, malignant growths etc.\nSo I wonder if that may just be a secondary symptom of the MCAS immune response or if that has become a primary issue on its own which requires attention.\n\nBesides a plethora of other symptoms there are ear pain and a sore throat as well. \n\nWhat do you think?\nDid anyone experience the same? How many are there? I have a bunch of little painful masses all around my ribs and chest. Dude get a mammogram One on each side. I guess they are the sentinel lymph nodes. Did you went to a doc? Guess I should Ya both need to go to the doctor. Do not mess around with that. In my 20s I used to get armpit pain. No one could figure it out. It went away. \n\nA few years ago I noticed a bump in the armpit. Ultrasound and mammogram diagnosed a fatty lymph node, an age related change. \n\nSee your doc, make sure it is nothing. Was it benign? What happened? Benign. \ud83d\udc4d very good to hear Go to your doctor, get a mammogram. I have had several that showed swollen lymph nodes, but that is benign. There are small tumors, of course, that are not benign though. I am sure you are fine, but go make sure, please. A 3D mamo might be best, if they offer it. Good luck YEs I have experienced the same, my doctor sent me for ultrasound/mammogram/biopsy. \n\nI asked them to perform the ultrasound first and that if they saw anything of concern I would agree to mammogram/biopsy. \n\nThe ultrasound was painless and for me; the lumpy bit around the side is benign, fibrous tissue.\n\nI did not need a mammogram or biopsy. \n\nI got a big lecture because breast cancer is very aggressive and I should have ruled it out sooner. \n\nSo I want to both reassure you that it is probably nothing scary and encourage you to make sure.", "Mast cell activation found in long COVID ", "Anyone have siezures with mast cell activation syndrome? I am suspicious that my non epileptic siezures are caused from mast cell activation syndrome. I have siezures after too much exercise, certain food and a hot bath. I also have pots syndrome. Just wondering if it a common thing to have non epileptic siezures with this My sister had seizures.  Lots of non epileptic ones.  It cost her the ability to drive.\n\nI am pretty sure she also had MCAS.  She had a single positive tryptase differential test. (Documented rise over the 20% +2ng threshold above baseline).  However her doctor wanted her to get a second confirmatory test before making the diagnosis.   We lost her to suicide before she ever got a second test in.    She was diagnosed with both POTS and EDS though.   (Among other things.)  She also had symptoms consistent with recurrent anaphylaxis.  And other symptoms highly suggestive of MCAS (flushing, hives, angioedema, you know the drill)\n\nAs to which disorder caused her seizures, as far as I know, that was never determined.  I could not attest that it was MCAS, nor that it was not.  Simply that she had seizures, and most likely had the full trifecta. I am so sorry to hear that you, your sister, and your family went through that. I am so sorry to hear that. I know from personal experience everyday is a struggle and so sad your sister could no longer cope. Thank you for your reply I used to have mini seizures/seizure auras until finally a full blown grandmal. Keppera stopped the mini seizures after that for me. I am not sure if it was caused by MCAS issues or my PMDD but figure still might be worth mentioning Yes, I have kind of seizure auras and sometimes twitching when I eat foods high in histamine or miss a dose of antihistamines. I have heard other MCAS people say they get non-epileptic seizures too. Good luck with it all. YES and I have POTS and my seizures are actually dystonic storms and definitely there is major mast cell involvement and 100% they are in no way psychosomatic. \n\n Hmm I get the twitching too but never connected it to MCAS so that is a good insight. I have also suspected myself of having absence siezures since teenage hood. I cannot drive because I just lose moments in time.", "Does serum IgE have to be elevated? Hey folks. I know tryptase is often normal, and that our allergies are usually not IgE mediated, but I have not heard of even using serum IgE for diagnosis. Functional doc ordered it and I tested yesterday but it was very unremarkable. There are a fair number of different mast cell disorders (e.g. allergy/hypersensitivity, mastocytosis, mast cell activation syndrome, etc), and those causes fall into several different buckets (secondary, primary, and idiopathic, respectively).\n\nBefore considering a diagnosis like idiopathic MCAS (where idiopathic means \"of unknown cause\"), one first has to rule out potential known causes of the symptoms.\n\nSo, to my knowledge, elevated IgE is not used to positively identify IMCAS, but rather to potentially point to other explanations. For example, elevated IgE could indicate the presence of IgE-mediated allergies that might explain some or all of the symptoms being experienced.\n\nAnd, of course, there are different strategies used to deal with mast cell activation caused by allergies (IgE-mediated \"secondary mast cell activation\") versus idiopathic mast cell activation (i.e. what is generally called MCAS). But, there is likely overlap between the two -- the science is still murky and the clinical practice is even murkier. Okay, that is kind of what I was thinking re: ruling out other IgE mediated allergies. Thank you!", "Return of symptoms - MCAS? I know I cannot be diagnosed online but I have got a bit of a strange situation in that I was not officially diagnosed with MCAS (or even discussed) but treatment worked but it is come back and I am looking to go back to the immunologist.\n\nSo 2016 I moved into an old house which had mould. I started to sneeze in one room and we joked that I was allergic to that room. One night after a nice meal and lots of wine I woke up with my eye itchy as hell, it swelled up overnight and since then I had daily rhinitis and loads of brain fog and fatigue.\n\nImmunologist diagnosed dust and storage mite allergies and gave me Fexofenadine, some eye drops and nasal spray. They kept the physical symptoms at bay if I used then religiously but the fatigue and brain fog never went even in summer when dust mite allergy symptoms tend to improve. My quality of life was on the floor and I could barely work. She gave me Montelukast and sent me on my way (I have no history of any respiratory issues). Within 6 months all my symptoms were gone as was the urticaria I got from hot showers and the flushing and pustules from rosacea. As well as reducing stress, cleaning up my diet and removing the mould I was feeling better than I ever had in my life. For 2 years I did not take a single Antihistamine. \n\nBut I have been having more exposure to mould (long walks in the woods for COVID exercise), my stress went up (lost my job because of COVID) and the fatigue and brain fog are back. I am getting the sporadic sneezing and itchy eyes, urticaria is back and more prevalent. I am also being diagnosed with POTS which I think I have always had but never actually felt other than a need to sit down more often than others, but now it seems to be most noticeable when I am super fatigued after an 'allergic' episode (a bad sneezing fit and itchy eyes can wipe me out for the rest of the day, it is definitely the driver of the fatigue).\n\nIt is easy for me to blame COVID but looking back i can see those first warning signs that things were flaring up again for at least the whole of the year, increasing fatigue, waking up with gritty eyes, random sneezing in the shower, tiny bits of urticaria. It was only from learning about POTS that I learned about MCAS and the fact that my symptoms never quite fit a typical allergy and the Fexofenadine and Montelukast cured everything seems to fit the picture. \n\nDoes MCAS come and go like that? It is so confusing! I need to talk to my GP to refer me back to the immunologist as I am not able to work right now because of the brain fog. But I also feel like I must be a fraud because so many people here have it so much worse. So I would really love to hear what you guys think or any advice on dealing with Drs. I am in the UK so they are not exactly keen on investigating things unless they need to. Yes, MCAS symptoms can wax and wane over time. This is a characteristic of MCAS that is often listed on papers by the Mastocytosis Society, and is discussed in Dr. Afrins book about MCAS called \"Never Bet Against Occam\". On top of this, MCAS puts us at a much higher position to become tolerant to medications of all types. Some MCAS specialists recommend rotating treatment/meds every so often so that your body does not become immune/tolerant to the medications", "Does Anyone Get Hives While They Sleep? I have been breaking out in hives while I sleep. Occasionally I will get a few when I am not sleeping, but most of the time when I get hives it is while I am sleeping. It is not just at night time, because I have been completely fine until I fell asleep and then I could feel my skin itching and hives forming. I have not been diagnosed with mast cell, but I assume what I am having is a histamine dump. But I do not underspend why it would happen while I am sleeping. I will also wake up drenched in sweat and with my heart racing. But these symptoms do not happen every night, they seem to be flares. My daughter and I both get hives while sleeping. We have fans beside the beds. I had to switch from a queen to a king bed because my husband puts out so much heat when he sleeps and even with the fan on, I was getting hives on the side closest to him. Oh do you think it is because I am over heated while I sleep? Could be heat, could be dust/mites in the sheets/blankets/pillows, could be a buildup of oil/sweat/product from your skin over time, the material of your sleepwear, or the detergent that you use for your sheets. Could also be a delayed reaction to something you do or eat at a consistent time of day or evening, or something about your particular circadian rhythm.\n\nAre your reactions just as strong with freshly laundered sheets as they are days later? I am not sure, it all seems to be random but I will keep an eye out for those things! But what is it about sleeping that triggers it? Because I would bet if I stayed awake all night I would not get hives. There are a lot of different possible mechanisms depending on what is causing it. I am not speaking to the quality of the following, but ( has an overview of some possible mechanisms. Update: Just woke up with my heart racing, having to go number 2, chills and the inside of my mouth numb. I almost called 911, but it went away. No hives this time though, possibly cause I took Claritin. Histamine naturally increases in the body at night for some reason. I do not break out in hives during the night, but I do generally become itchier.", "Constant itchy, burning, tight throat as only symptom (eating ANYTHING makes it worse) I am pretty convinced that I have got some kind of mast cell issue going on right now, because I cannot think of any other possible explanation for what I am going through.\n\nI felt unwell back in March. I was in NYC at the time and thought I had COVID, though I tested negative (and have tested negative a couple more times since then). Had cough, fatigue, lower appetite, dizziness. Was not too bad. Took some antibiotics and cough syrup and was on the mend.\n\nStarting May and onwards though, my cough came back, alongside a burning throat. And it is pretty much been a constant since. Just an ongoing itch and irritation in my throat.\n\nHad an endoscopy (mild gastritis and esophagitis). GI doctor did not seem too concerned. ENT took a look, saw mild redness and prescribed some stuff, but they did not help the symptoms much, and he declared that that meant it was not reflux. \n\nDexilant 60mg and Famotidine 40mg for nearly a month had no effect. Azelastine, Mometasone Furoate, and Xyzal (or Zyrtec) for a few weeks have not done much either.\n\nThe only allergies I have tested positive for were a lot of the pollens. Negative on dust, mold, pets. There were some potential food allergies with the skin test, but they came back negative in a blood test. So no food allergies.\n\nYet, my throat gets worse almost every time I eat ANYTHING. The only thing that never seems to get my throat itchy and irritated is water. Otherwise, I have no clue what food is \u201csafe\u201d for me. One day, something I eat might cause a mild itch, but the next day, it will be CRAZY itchy and raw. My ears kind of feel itchy, throat feels tight, and lips kind of burn when it is really bad, but the itching throat is the big one.\n\nEven low histamine stuff is setting me off. I was eating baked sweet potato like crazy because it was mostly fine for me, but now it gets my throat itchy. Same with egg whites, or rice.\n\nSometimes it will start itching the moment I put something in my mouth. Sometimes it will itch 15 minutes, or 2 hours after I finished eating. Sometimes it will itch after I take some meds. Or sometimes it will itch after going downstairs. It itches moment-to-moment. It feels raw and irritated seemingly at random too. There is no rhyme or reason to it.\n\nOtherwise, I am kind of burpy and lightheaded (though I have also been barely eating bc every meal stresses me out, so I have unfortunately lost a ton of weight). Nose has been congested a lot too.\n\nAnd looking back on my health history, I am starting to wonder if I always had this, and the stress of 2020 just got it raging.\n\nIn terms of allergies or chronic health problems:\n\n* I had oral allergy syndrome since I was a kid to several fruits\n* Besides that, my actual pollen allergy never really manifested until a big hives outbreak in high school after a cold, which was cleared up with Zyrtec. Since then, I have never had hives, and the pollen allergy was fairly mild (itchy eyes, runny nose). I even stopped the Zyrtec early on and had no problem.\n* I get a sun rash on my forearms unless I take a Zyrtec the night before. Same kind of rash can appear during the summer when I take a hot shower, so maybe it is a general heat sensitivity\n* When I am out in the cold, I will get itchy bumps on exposed skin (face and neck really). They are kind of red and look like mosquito bites. They would go away once I got warm\n* When I am cold (in an chilly, air-conditioned space, or like even at the pool), my knees and elbows get these red, itchy bumps that go away after I cover/warm them up\n* I once got a red, itchy bump on my chest thanks to a cheap necklace that I would worn as a kid without a problem\n* Chronic frequent urination since I was in middle school. It is almost always only during the day and mostly happens when I am more nervous about it (i.e. work meetings, long car rides, watching a movie).\n* TMJ since I was kid (though maybe that is unrelated). Migraines every month or so due to TMJ\n* Pretty bad Vitamin D deficiency\n* My stomach has generally always been quite gurgly, and digestion is not always great\n\nI think I am lucky in that my symptoms are not so numerous right now (I can get up and walk around fine, and I am not having crazy stomach pain or anything like that), but the throat symptom is SO UNCOMFORTABLE and STRESSFUL. I am scared to eat anything at all. I need to eat more and stop losing weight, but I have no clue what is okay for me. Genuinely, it feels like I am wasting away and I am scared.\n\nI went to an allergist today, but he seemed unconvinced that it was MCAS since I was not really having symptoms elsewhere (i.e. diarrhea, hives). He thinks it is a combo of pollen allergies, potential asthma, and a bunch of undiscovered food allergies (though I also react to stuff that I tested negative for). I suppose it is understandable since the condition seems pretty rare, but I think I am going to contact him again soon and stress how bad this is getting for me. \n\nWhat do you guys think? Is the throat itching/tightness/irritation enough of an emergency that I should meet with the allergist again ASAP? I am really scared by all this. Is there a chance this could be something else? I do not know what else would make sense... And I am taking antihistamines, but is it not enough? I could really, really use some kind words and advice right now :( You might want to see another doctor depending. Also you are not crazy. You know your body better than the doctor.\n\nLet us see in my experience, MCAS means your allergy tests are wonky, your reactions are wonky, and you are going to see more than 2 allergists.\n\nYou might want to do an elimination diet if you have not. They are a pain in the ass and there is a few out there. \n\nSince you have been tested I doubt it is other food allergies. Skin test right? Blood tests are interesting but not very helpful. Oh. Also, it is possible to have allergies develop as an adult. It is common I think. \n\nIf it is asthma then montelukast or zafirlukast should help. \n\nI am not surprised the allergist gave you the run around. As far as seeing them again sooner rather than later... Did you say your throat swells? Did the symptom get grouped with other symptoms or treated like a major issue? You might go back and get something different. You might not. Also, did you like and respect the allergist you saw? Did you visit NYC or just move out of Nyc back to somewhere?\n\nDid you get a covid antibody test. Thank you for your reply.\n\n&gt;Let us see in my experience, MCAS means your allergy tests are wonky, your reactions are wonky, and you are going to see more than 2 allergists.\n\nYup, yup, and yup. Though to be fair, the last one is because the first one who did my recent allergy tests was booked until October. They were both highly rated.\n\nDo you have any elimination diets you recommend?\n\nAs far as food tests go, I was only tested for the top 8, both skin and blood test. I was devastated when soy came back as a potential allergen, and overjoyed when the blood test ruled it out, but now I am grappling with the possibility of being severely allergic to ALL FOODS and it is freaking me out.\n\nI have been prescribed Flovent, and I tried it out today. Did not do much.\n\nI did tell him that my throat felt tight -- I am not sure that it actually swells or not (I am mostly able to talk and swallow, maybe with some difficulty), but the itching and burning can get really intense and scary. If I was getting a bad stomachache or something after every meal, I would not be as alarmed, but the fact that the reaction is in my throat makes me feel like I should be worried about potential anaphylaxis anytime it happens. Is that accurate? Or are all symptoms kind of weighed the same, and you are okay as long as you are not having more than one (i.e. throat + hives) at the same time?\n\nI did not get a chance to tell him my full history of allergies -- I honestly thought a lot of them were skin conditions, like the cold sensitivity, and not worth bringing up until I did some more research on MCAS. The allergist himself was nice (I unfortunately started crying when I talked about not being able to eat anything, and he reassured me that we would figure out what was going on). I just worry that I did not get across to him how urgent this feels. \n\nI think I will go back to him because he was one of the few in my area that came up in search results for people with knowledge about mast cell disorders. He said to come back in 2 weeks though, which seems like a lifetime away right now. I used an elimination diet my internist recommended. It was something about functional medicine I think? I would ask your doctor next time you see him. Otherwise Google might be your friend there.\n\nSo technically anaphylaxis is when the reaction involves like 2 or more systems I think. So throat, skin, GI, brain fog, etc... Anaphylaxis. Anaphylatic shock is probably what you are thinking of. If you are not having actual swelling and trouble breathing, and you are staying on allergy meds your doctor must think you are fine. Waiting for the next appointment might be better because the doctor might be more prepared for you then, as compared to meeting you for the first time. If you are super anxious then I would try calling (or the online option) to ask if you need a prescription for an epi since you have symptoms with your throat. \n\nAnd I would ask for singulair/montelukast when you see him again. \n\nOh and maybe see a dermatologist. In my experience it is better to go when you are having the reaction so they can see it. \n\nI am glad to hear he was reassuring! That is a good sign. And that 2 weeks would give you time to research mcas more? I would been living in NYC since October with my sister, and we were super careful about quarantining when the pandemic hit. I got the antibody test in mid-May when my cough came back, and the result was negative, but I read that the antibody test doctors were using at that time might not be reliable.\n\nWe quarantined until June and then headed back down to family in Virginia because my throat symptoms were not getting better and I was scared to visit any more medical facilities in NYC. I have tested negative 2 more times since.\n\nHonestly though, I am starting to think I DID have it. What with feeling unwell in March, and my sister apparently was kind of fatigued around the same time. She is back to 100% though. I am wondering if I did have the virus, or maybe it was the stress of the pandemic, that could have triggered MCAS. I have read stories about folks who have recovered but are dealing with permanent lung damage, MCAS attacks, etc. I was thinking more along the lines of new allergens you are not used to being in a new state. The burning is making me lean towards sulfur foods / night shades. \nTry cutting out onions, garlic and black pepper.\nYour going to have to read everything, I mean everything. If it says spices skip they also. \n\nSome foods will not test positive to a skin reaction test. But there biological reaction with the body after you eat it can make high levels of sulfur, which will burn you from the inside out. \nHad to learn this the hard way also. I would visited NYC a bunch of times beforehand without issue, so I do not think so. Symptoms kind of feel like they have been getting worse over time, and traveling back down to Virginia to stay with family (after continuous quarantining) did not help my symptoms. I actually got in contact again today and will see him Monday morning. \n\nI do have 2 epipens with me, but I am scared and unsure of when to use them. I am noticing more some lightheadedness, nose congestion, and head pressure (sinuses?) after I eat, in addition to the throat stuff. If symptoms persist for hours, can I still consider it relatively \u201csafe\u201d since it did not get severe in a short amount of time?\n\nAnd my throat burns even from taking allergy meds. It is really concerning. \n\nWhy do you prefer singulair/montekulast? I also have albuterol, though I have not given it a try yet. I have been avoiding those for the most part. The burning can even happen after I swallow a pill. I wonder if my throat is just irritated by everything, but the ENT I went to a couple weeks ago did not see much of a problem. I do not have a good answer to your first question. Make sure doctor knows about the other symptoms you have noticed. \n\nSingular helps with mcas symptoms. I never remember what it effects/does but it is definitely worth trying. Google can explain better than I can. You probably have an Oxalate &amp; Lectin sensitivity. Check out~ Mastcell360.com it will explain a lot! **I found links in your comment that were not hyperlinked:**\n\n* (\n\n*I did the honors for you.*\n\n***\n\n^( ^| ^( ^| ^&lt;3 \nAsk for Singulair or other leukotriene inhibitor, I find that the OTC things like Claritin and Zyrtec are not enough for me anymore. You will probably need more than that but it is a starting point.\n\nI did not get the burning throat but I would get the raw tongue. Back in the 70s the only drug they had was Atarax (hydroxyzine) and it did not help a lot. I think I got down to about 10 foods I could eat safely. I would eat one thing and only one thing at a time, wait a while and see what happens. \n\nMy allergies were weirdly specific too, like certain varieties of apples but not others. I could eat Florida oranges (the juice kind) but not naval oranges. I reacted to things that should not be a problem, like baking soda or rice.\n\nI find the low histamine lists useless. I can react to low histamine stuff and do not react to high histamine stuff. It is all over the map what bothers me or does not bother me.\n\nThe good news for me is that as I avoided a trigger for long enough I would lose my sensitivity to it. There are some things I still do not go near because if I do I just become resensitized, but a lot of things are tolerable now. I can eat apples a few months out of the year but then get resensitized.\n\nAnother thing that helped is eating ethnic foods I had never eaten before. So look for things you do not normally eat. For example, millet, buckwheat, amaranth, teff, exotic vegetables or fruits, just as long as it is something you normally never eat. So go to ethnic market and look around. Or look at vegan food if you are normally a meat eater.\n\nAnother trick is cook everything. Cooked was easier, it changes the chemical composition of the food. Fermenting can also help. I cannot drink milk but cheese and yogurt are fine.\n\nDo not worry if a food is \"healthy\". I reacted to plenty of healthy foods but was able to chow down on potato chips just fine. I would suggest a ct scan to see if the soft tissue is irritated. I have found x-rays font show much. \n\nI have also found ENT dismiss younger people. At least the one I went to did. \nI had a pet scan &amp; ct done. I do have low up take around my thyroid gland.", "Allergic to a person? Has anyone experienced having reactions to a particular person? Is there anything you have found that is helped? That sounds more like a spiritual/energetic type problem I am pretty sure it is allergic--it shows up shortly after they enter an area that shares the same air space as me even if I do not see or hear them, and clears up shortly after they leave. It is developed gradually over time and symptoms include flushing, dizziness, shortness of breath, coughing, brain fog, anxiety, etc.--same as most things I react to. I live with them. Some days are better than others, but I am not sure why. i really do not see logically speaking how you can be allergic to a person, there has to be some valid reason behind that, and the only thing i could think of is something on their clothes, fragrances, mold spores, etc I read about a ( who became allergic to her husband. I was wondering if other people might have experienced something like that too. stress is a huge trigger for MCAS? Do you get stress around this person if so that could be the reason why it seems like you are allergic to this person. \n\nor maybe they wear a fragrance your immune system does not like. No, I do not get stressed around them. Even if I did, it happens when I do not know whether they are there. I live with them and this has been happening consistently for months over a wide variety of situations, wearing different and brand new clothes, washing with different things, etc. It is better after they wash with activated charcoal, but only for a while, and worse when they sweat. I think it is possible you are reacting to the person but more likely you are reacting to something on them. The only hint that suggests otherwise is that after showering it is better but then gets worse again without them going anywhere or doing anything. If I had to guess it is probably their detergent, pets, body wash, etc. I pretty highly doubt anyone is allergic to that person themselves (unless there is concrete scientific evidence, all I have seen is anecdotal) but rather something the person has on them I had a MCAtriggered by kissing and having sex! I am like going to become a nun.... bummer! Omg! Ugh \ud83d\ude2b I never updated this, but I eventually figured out that one of the main things causing problems for me was a yeast or bacteria in their microbiome that I was hypersensitized to. They started taking high-dose probiotics, and that improved things a lot. \n\nI also found a particular Crystal Light-type drink mix they were using that I am extremely allergic to--it would stay on their breath after they drank it and cause severe problems. So I banned them from using just that one flavor (there are plenty others I do not react to). \n\nThings still are not perfect, but they are much, much better.\n\nSo, if this is someone you live with, and you have already followed the suggestions others have made in this thread about checking soaps, detergents, grooming products, etc. you could try something like that. If it is someone you do not live with but see regularly, you could make sure their living space is not the issue. If you were only going to see them the once--yeah, you probably cannot do that anymore \ud83d\ude1e\n\nAlso--I did not mention it because I have known all along it is an issue, but my partner vapes, and they cannot get it anywhere. near. me. Like, they have to do it in a shed in the backyard with the door closed, wait for it to dissipate and take off their outer layer of clothing before coming inside, and then scrub down in the shower with activated charcoal before getting anywhere near me. If they do it out in the open in the yard I am sick for days, even if I never go outside. \n\nI say all this to emphasize that if any of your partners or potential partners vape then it could definitely be or become a major trigger and you should take it seriously. Very informative! I am only beginning in this realm... thanks abacus \ud83e\uddee You helped me a lot!", "Is this MCAS? MCAS, yes or no? I think it is just one thing causing this. My case (which is not complete):\n\n ( \n\nOther links that may be of interest to people here:\n\n(\n\n( You cannot get a  \u201cyes or no\u201d on this sub- mast cell disease is too complicated and diverse. You need a doctor to do the testing and review the patient history tell you yes or no. Anyone could post an array of symptoms on here and get a \u201cmaybe.\u201d I am not saying this to be harsh but this has a lot going on and I have not seen someone on here who is a doctor and could even begin to dig through that compilation of data. You did a good job journaling everything, though. That data will help a provider immensely. Will help a provider...are you kidding me? They do not even take the effort to go through my history and/or read papers about MCAS. I am not here to get a diagnosis, just want to poll some thoughts. Believe it or not, the case description given is only a fraction. They cannot deal with patients having tons of symptoms. Doctors do not care browsing through history .. None of them do the majority of them are ignorant about mast cell activation syndrom. Mine did. Lawrence Afrin and his team take the time. If you find someone who has attended conferences and knows how complicated the disease is, then you might find someone who will do their job correctly. I do not know where you all are from or your stories. I am just saying I am not an expert and I know nothing about the comorbid  disease states listed in this data. It is too complicated to say yes or no and I do not think it is right to send someone down the MCAS rabbit hole without the research and expert opinions to support it. I was just being honest through my opinion and I am not trying to fight with people. Doctors need summaries and should be asking you questions. If you got a doctor not asking you questions and not looking at your paperwork I hope you can find a new doctor. Not all doctors are willing to admit they do not know either. That is one of the problems with this disease. \n\nIf you are taking paperwork that resembles your forum post to a doctor then you are giving them too much information all at once. Serious case of TL;DR. Doctors are people too. \n\nI think you need what I am going to call a \"higher level\" symptom, things to focus on instead of a long list of symptoms. Maybe start with what effects your quality of life the worst. For example by higher level symptom I mean migraines or headaches as compared to all the symptoms you have when you have a migraine or headache. The doctor can then followup and ask you more info about your migraines or headaches. \n\nAnd I will be surprised if you find a doctor who looks at your history before a new patient appointment. They will probably look at your appointment/few minutes before while you wait, and then need a followup after they look more. The good ones anyways. Hey man. A lot of your symptoms resemble mine, and I have been diagnosed w MCAS by an immunologist at a respected hospital. There is a connection between hypermobility and mast cell mediator release diseases. I have read a theory on pubmed, or an interview w Dr. Theoharides or dr. Afrin, on the connection between bone marrow, hypermobility, and mast cells but do not have it handy and it is very light. There is the supposed cluster of MCAS, POTS, and hypermobile EDS which remains unproven. But I note with interest your brother\u2019s diagnosis of pectus excavatum. This makes me think of Marfan\u2019s which can have a quite varied presentation- not everyone looks like the classic medical photo. How do you and your relatives rank on the Beighton Scoring System? Have you checked yourself on the Mouldering criteria? Have you tried the step-wise treatment for mast cell diseases from mastattack.org? A few vitamins like C, D, fish oil, chondroitin are apparently mast cell stabilizers and have helped me, along with the prescription stuff (cetirizine, nizatidine/famotidine for H2, montelukast, hydroxyzine at night for brain fog during the next day.) since you have been fighting and studying this a long time, do yourself a favor and do not add or remove more than one medication at once, give them each about 3 weeks and see if they are really making a difference. Also, since you are dealing with POIS, be careful on the H2 antagonists like famotidine, ranitidine, cimetidine, and nizatidine since the first 3 are proven 5ARD2 inhibitors and the 4 may we will be. \n\nAt times it is hard to believe that you or I could have so many different syndromes and problems at once, and still be alive and functioning. What are the odds? Dr. Afrin addresses this in his book Never Bet Against Occam, and someone in here recently posted about the RCCX theory which I had never heard of, seems to explain a lot. \n\nI went to a famous sexual medicine specialist about 10 years ago after I had a similar crisis to what you had at age 28, but mine started when I quit taking propecia. So expected to be diagnosed w PFS because of my massively reduced sex drive and genital numbness. Instead he said if I had PFS it is not that bad, but that I definitely had POIS. A famous allergist out of state from me heard about my symptoms and said that I have POIS but there was no need to come see him since he would tried tons of things on many patients but had no successful POIS treatments. (Autologous human seminal protein injections is a treatment he uses but I think mainly on women trying to get pregnant- he did not see any success with them for POIS.) It is hard to believe that nothing can work for POIS. My POTS has generally been much better when my MCAS symptoms are under control, and post ejaculation, my POTS gets much worse, and none of the symptoms have improved no matter what MCAS treatments I am taking. I am sure that I have a semen allergy because in addition to all the brain fog, exhaustion and confusion, racing heart etc after an ejaculation- I have the same problems if exposed to someone else\u2019s semen in the usual places (I am gay) and worse. My urethra becomes redder, swollen meatus, painful urination, etc. I have even gotten a rash from my own semen on my abdomen. all this crazy stuff made no sense until I was told about MCAS. The first 10 times I came across MCAS when I was researching my symptoms, I did not think I had it and did not believe it could be real, because I had never heard of such violent anaphylaxis to innocuous triggers and I had never experienced it. Apparently that is the difference between being a \u201cshocker\u201d and a \u201cleaker\u201d. I was DX with chronic pelvic pain syndrome at one time too but the symptoms got a lot better with the years. \n\nI am sort of OK with where I am in treatment, beating brain fog and being able to be productive at a job is such a huge improvement and montelukast and hydroxyzine have made all the difference there. The other stuff I just put up with like anyone else with a chronic disease learns to do. I regret trying out one exotic medication because withdrawing from it made things much worse for me. Some folks have said that Xolair made things much worse for them, and some people (including me) developed a kind of Zyrtec addiction that makes them itchy when they tried to quit. I say that as a preface to this last comment. \n\nSince I have POIS too, the next thing I want to potentially try, is pentosan (PPS). I am surprised no one has mentioned it on the POIS forums. I thought i was so smart for discovering it in my quest for mast cell stabilizers where it is used to treat interstitial cystitis as Elmiron. But it turns out that Dr. Afrin already uses it and calls it the equivalent of cromolyn for the urinary tract. It seems proven to cause a novel form of retinopathy in long term users, and I am sure some who have taken it have regretted it. For those who think it is worth the risk, once they have consulted with a doctor, I would love to know the results. \n\nGood luck and feel free to message me. Stay strong, keep fighting, keep living! Corrections or comments on any of my statements are welcome. Find mast cell society, list of doctors, pick the closest", "What is the difference between Chromolyn and Chromolyn Sodium?  I think people are always referring to cromolyn sodium when they say cromolyn. Also apparently it is \"cro-MO-lyn,\" for a long time I thought it was \"CROM-o-lyn\"  but it is not haha (just in case you had been pronouncing it wrong in your head like me) Hmmm...We have a (old) prescription (in capsule form) that just says \"cromolyn.\" I figured it would say \"cromolyn sodium\" if that is what it was, but maybe I am wrong.  My prescription says Cromolyn sodium. Not sure of just Chromolyn. \n\nFrom a quick google search, it looks like cromolyn sodium is a solution, while cromolyn is just the cromoglicic acid. My prescription says cromolyn sodium. It is the plastic vials of solution. Oh, well that must be it.  I have never heard of anyone being on capsules, so it must be that regular cromolyn is the capsule form and cromolyn sodium is the ampules.\n\nI love the ampules because they hit really quick since they are liquid, so it is worth trying to get those.  I use them in place of epipens since I am not sure if epis are safe for me.", "A List of Mast Cell Stabilizers \n\nThis is the wiki list of Mast Cell Stabilizers.\n\nBut the one people overlook is Vitamin D3 I noticed a decrease in symptoms when i started on Vitamin D3. I think it gets overlooked because it is a vitamin. But it really helped me. How much D3 do you take? 5000 IU a day. It is extremely safe and i am one of those masty people that react to everything and have to have most of my meds compounded that is how sensitive I am. \n\nBut VITD3 is great. I noticed within 2 days my body was less reactive and gut pain improved. Thank you! Be careful if you do not have a deficiency. Like all things, too much of something can generate problems. I am deficient and take 2,000 per day. It was enough to raise my levels and moderate symptoms. They make me sick to my stomach for some reason, otherwise I would keep taking them Can I please ask what is your daily regime? I am really stuck, I have a good doctor but specialist care seems out of the question. \n\nI need stuff that I can do without a prescription. I am looking at quercetin, vit D3, H1/h2 antagonists but I do not know how it all comes together. I am low on vitamin D, so taking it helps in two ways but I definitely notice when I havent taken it.

I have cromyln sodium, and took 2 benadryl last night, what do I do? I am out of town and really want to avoid ER! No expert by any means, but try gargling some cream for your throat and flush your eyes with saline and maybe some cooling eye drops like rohto's. I would also like to say see a doctor, but I get why you do not want to. That sounds fucking awful. It is! I am out of town and the EMT said all they will do is moniter you at the ER, burning is less than yesterday but still hurts. I am going to look for some eye drops If you are able to take maalox or mylanta, mix it half and half with water and try to gargle it a little before you swallow.

IMPORTANT: any flavor that does not have mint\u2014mint will make it worse\n\nIf you can get some saline in addition to eyedrops, a long rinse of each eye can help, too.

Oh-oh, some minor hemorrhoids and these I guess wave thingies that are in my intestines that can sometimes cause a little backing up up stool but really not that big of a deal from what the doctor said.\n\nJust eat more fiber and drink more water and maybe lose a little weight.\n\nSeriously? So how in the hell is me going to the bathroom such an absolute disaster when I have to do the number two?\n\nI mean I was convinced there must have been some blockages or something going on, and they said pretty much all clear.\n\n????????????????? I think you might be surprised what some fiber can do. It has a lot of benefits besides just bulking up your stool. Stuff like Pysllium husk can be a prebiotic for important gut bacteria. It can seriously help IBS, Leaky gut, and all kinds of ailments linked to autoimmune diseases. I will take a look. There is lots of studies about Psyllium and Partially Hydrolyzed Guar Gum (PHGG). Oh cool, I will check them out. Same thing with me. I had both an endoscopy and colonoscopy. Minor hems and gastritis. \n\nThey were looking for carcinoid though.

Yeah I am pretty sure that that must be what is going on which is why....\n\n\nI am sick of the f****** fatigue I am sick of the GI issues, I am sick of feeling like s*** every f****** day of my life and I do not even know if this is really the disease I have or it is just something my doctor is saying but I have a ton of these weird f****** symptoms.....\n\nI am just fed up. Obviously I am by no means a doctor and I know absolutely nothing about you beyond what you have just said, so I do not want you think I am telling you that what I am about to say is necessarily going on with you.  I am just telling you what I am about to say because it happened to me and no one ever talks about it.  \n\nAnyway, it is possibly you could have fascial adhesions and/or calcification that is rendering some of the muscle of your intestines paralyzed.  Fascia does not show up on most kinds of scans, so if that were the case, it would make sense that they did not see anything during the scope.  This is even more likely if you have connective tissue disorder.  \n\nI had fascial adhesions and dystrophic calcification that had spread from my abdominal muscles to my stomach and my diaphragm, and as a result, the left half of my stomach and diaphragm were paralyzed and numb, causing gastroparesis and compulsive breath-holding.  \n\nObviously your intestines are relatively deep inside of your body (as in there are other organs in front of them) so it is hard to get a feel for what is going on in tissue that deep, but if you try to pull up the skin on your lower abdomen where your intestines are and the skin feels stuck, then you definitely at least have angry fascia on the more superficial levels.\n\nI broke up my calcifications and adhesions with acupuncture, cupping, and gua sha.  It was the best thing that ever happened to me. Psyllium husk is an absolute miracle, so I definitely second it.  In addition to these reasons, it is also great because it will help BOTH constipation AND diarrhea! It definitely sucks, and I am sorry you are struggling so much right now.

It took me years to find out the right combination of all different kinds of antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers, but now I \\*almost\\* can live a normal life, as long as I work from home (to prevent exposure to environmental allergens) I am taking h1 blockers, they gave me ranitidine as an H2 blocker but I think when I take it it makes me feel like my body is in pain like I get some sort of weird high blood pressure I am not really sure it just feels like my body is like hurting slightly weird way so I only take the h1 blockers right now and I also have been yaking cromolyn.\n\nI got to go to my doctor and iron out a couple things because they keep screwing up the prescription for the cromolyn and I literally got a miniscule amount from my Pharmacy today who I am pretty positive has no idea how to fill the prescription that the doctor is giving me and so they keep f****** it up. Yeah I am not really sure. I guess I have diverticulitis or something.. and a few hemorrhoids. That is about it.\n\nThey acted like the diverticulitis was not that big of a deal and just eat more fiber and I am good to go.\n\nas far as pulling up on my skin, I do not know I just went to my lower abdomen and tried pulling up on my skin it seems normal if I would not know the difference or whatever. Yep, having it 10+ years already. Traditionally without an findings\n\nIt s not blocked, the bowel movement is impaired, it is spastic. Yo want to find the single reason - it is Histamine, but histamine have huge and different negative effects in the body when in excess How much and often? I take to much meds so cannot find the proper time\n\nI eat green bananas in yoghurt for the same purpose I cant eat wheat. Maybe also gluten but mostly wheat. Gave me GI issues for 18 years. I also cant eat certain high histamine foods, as they also cause GI issues. So I follow a low histamine diet. Have you tried eliminating foods? Somewhat, no I have not done any FODMAP diets or anything like that You should check out the low histamine diet. People with MCAS are supposed to be following it. I have been taking a teaspoon or two of psyllium with a couple of glasses of water every night. \n\nI usually get flavored psyllium as the OG straight psyllium husk powder is god awful.\n\nIn addition, keep in mind psyllium is a bulk fiber.

Rest of day is done for me afterward.\n\nI did not know either, they just did it for me? mine said he had a hunch and added the testing- I did not even know before hand he explained to me when he was going over the results.

Rice, oat, tomato, vinegar, are the only main triggers I can remember right now. Right now I am able to have mango, coconut milk, mct oil, a bit of chia, and pear/pear juice, noodles a bit of salt. I need advice. I take quercetin and l theanine. I get triggered by smells they make me start having a fever and more after that. Also triggered if I eat it but I can tell by smell if it will trigger me. Have been having bathroom probs just liquid shit that burns. Foods going through me in an hour or two. Can I take Zyrtec to help would it help? I have read about this but my brain right now is not a sound machine. Help is majorly appreciated. Any way to make this body less reactive please help. I can contact a doctor over a phone but I do not know if I can get a prescription due to a shit insurance situation  and abusive people gate keeping my medical care thanks in advance (sorry for spelling mistakes) Absolutely take Zyrtec unless you are currently taking any medications that might cause an interaction.  And even though Zyrtec claims to last 24 hours, and there is a part of it that may stay in your system that long, it will not be effective enough for 24 hours of MCAS.  I alternate a Claritin and a Zyrtec every four hours.  You may also want to take an h2 antihistamine - that helps more with food stuff (though Zyrtec will help with food as well).  I just started cimetidine, and I really love it.  The burning poop (boy am I familiar with that) may be another reaction to a food that you might think is safe - wheat does this for me, so maybe you are having a milder, delayed reaction to that, or it could be something else, I am just guessing.\n\nAs you take antihistamines and get your symptoms better under control, then it is much easier to tell what you are reacting to.\n\nZyrtec, at least in the US, not sure where you are, is over the counter, so you will not need a prescription (though it is often cheaper to get OTC drugs from a pharmacy with a prescription, but you can still get them without one)  I am taking like 8 different things for MCAS, and only two of them actually prescription only.  You can get definitely get your symptoms to improve a lot without any prescription meds, so do not worry.  I know what you mean about gatekeeping - my parents were abusive and I was so convinced that no on would ever believe anything I said, so I totally avoided doctors altogether for a long time because it hurts to much to not be believed.  It can help to join a Facebook group that is specific to MCAS and your geographic area.  If there is not an MCAS group specific to your area, try to find an Ehlers-Danlos group specific to your area - MCAS is often discussed in EDS groups.  They will often be able to refer you to a doctor for treatment.  Of course, you likely will not be able to get seen anytime soon, but once things calm down, you should be able to find someone. \n\nThere are also a few other posts in this subreddit about OTC mast cell stabilizers - there are TONS of options that you do not need a prescription for!  Quercetin and l-theanine are a great start, and there are many more! Zyeryec and Clayton ever 4 hours all day? Everyday? I do not want to hurt my body.  What is an h2 histamine blocker like what is something I can take. Yes feel like my body\u2019s so reacting right now it just is not accepting. Think if it calms down I will be able to handle some food. Yes I am in the US. \n\nThank you for response. Made me cry because it is horrible bring gatekept and not believed. Heart goes out to you. Yes I have recently looked at the mast cell stabilizers on here I just cannot gasp it right now. Is there an alternative to Claritin. Thank you \ud83d\ude4f Many of us are taking higher than normal doses of Zyrtec. I take two zyrtec twice a day, also pepcid and vitamin c. I do not take Claritin because it does not work for me. I used to take Allegra until I started reacting to it.  \n\nPepcid or another h2 blocker will help get rid of the allergy shits, although it can take a while to see a difference. It took me six months of taking it before all my food stopped passing through undigested.\n\nThe prescription meds I take are mostly for the breathing issues MCAS can cause. Is Allegra and Claritin the same? Thank you for telling me about this. I did not quite realize food passing undigested could be related. Makes tons of sense thank you so much how far apart are your doses of Zyrtec ? Allegra is fenofexadrine, claritin is loratidine.\n\nI take zyrtec when I wake up and just before bed.\n\nWhen I had the food passing through undigested, I gained a lot of weight, and I have been able to lose some of that weight as my body has started processing food properly again. Thank you for that   Easy to understand. \n\nThank you. If I have an 8 hr span between Zyrtec doses (1 pill then 1, 8 hrs later) is ok or too close? \n\nInteresting I have not been able too keep the weight on with the food going through 8 hours between zyrtec doses is fine. Quercetin does not last very long in the body, 4 hours for some, 8 hours for some. Either take it more often or get another mast cell stabilizer. Stabilizers are the most important in treating mcas if you do have it. Search this forum for other over the counter options, there is a lot.  Thank you for that &gt;What is an h2 histamine blocker like what is something I can take. \n\nCimetidine, as I said in my original comment.  I really do not like ranitidine, which is what people usually start with, and someone else said recently they also did not like how it made them feel.\n\nIn terms of h1s, if you do not want Claritin, there are TONS of different OTC options.  I do not know what country you are in, again, so I do not know what you can take, but we all end up having to try lots of different things and seeing what works for us.  Zyrtec, Claritin, Allegra, and Benadryl are probably the most common used h1s, but there are tons of other kinds that I have never even tried. Yep, I take quercetin every four hours (and cromolyn too) I am not sure why you are asking if eight hours between doses is too close when I told you I dose every four hours...\n\nI do not know about others, but there is no substance on earth that can last more than four hours in my body.  I need extra anesthesia, and I need to dose almost any medication more often than able-bodied folks.\n\nRe: not being able to keep weight on, you know how they talk about with celiac, how that the gluten intolerance actually rips holes in your digestive tract?  That actually happens with all food intolerance.  Tryptase destroys connective tissue, and many of your organs are composed in large part of connective tissue.  If you have been eating foods you cannot tolerate for years, you will have a limited capacity to absorb nutrients.\n\nOf course, what weight your body will stick to is a very complex issue dependent on lots of factors.  Some people, even if they do not eat much, will maintain a higher weight.  So I cannot boil it down to just one factor.  But, I am willing to bet your ability to absorb nutrients is still compromised. You are welcome xx", "Supplement recommendations of probiotics for SIBO Any recommendations for supplements for SIBO if you react to a lot of different foods? The only thing the doc would give me for SIBO is s. boulardii. All regular probiotics seem to  make SIBO worse. I also occasionally take soil based probiotics which seem to be helpful for SIBO. Dr. Amy Myers has those. Apparently they travel past the small intestine before dong their thing in the large intestine. &gt; s. boulardii.\n\nDo you have a brand you trusted for the S. Boulardii? I just got the Klaire labs one.   Did you take with a meal or certain time of day? The doc sells it to me. The name is Biotics Research. I usually take it after breakfast with other supplements. I would recommend looking into Dr. Amy Myers' protocol for SIBO. It helped me more than low FODMAPs or anything else the doc suggested. It includes a natural antibiotic and the soil based probiotic. FODMAPs did not help me except I found out I need to avoid fructose. The little buggers love sugar and carbs! I am pretty sure the Keto diet has helped my gut issues as well. Sorry if this is too much info! Bifido probiotic only  strains, it is basically hypoallergenic and for older people with weaker digestive tracks\n\nThe only one I can take are named bifido off Amazon and I do see a difference.\n\nAny other probiotic strain or brand causes me issues The only thing that worked for me for SIBO was antibiotics. :(  They threw everything else out of whack but the SIBO seems to be gone. MastCell360 has an article on this exact topic! Honestly, your best bet is knocking it out with Xifaxan and then starting probiotics. &gt; MastCell360 \n\n I do not know about SIBO, but I have done really well on GoodBelly probiotic drinks and shots. It now comes in a pill, I just got some. The type of bacteria it contains is \n\n&gt; Lactobacillus plantarum \u2013 several strains reduce histamine, including Lactobacillus plantarum K-1 and L. plantarum LP299v.\n\n", "Diagnosed MCAS'ers: How serious were your hives when you had your \"flare\" tryptase test done?  Hives were/are very sporadic. I was tested a year ago and my new immunologist wanted a new tryptase test done for a base level a couple days ago.", "Anyone else more reactive after lack of sleep? Hi all,\n\nI have googled and there are lots of articles about MCAS causing sleep issues - but I cannot find any about the other way around.\n\nHowever, it is fairly commonly discussed that sleep is important for immune system recovery - so I am wondering does anyone else have any experience with being more reactive to triggers after a night of no sleep?\n\nFor example, I had next to no sleep last night (reasons other than MCAS), and this morning I had a major trigger on Shampoo fragrance which I am exposed to on and off reasonably often (stubborn flatmate) - but other times have not reacted this strongly (or at all).\n\nWondering to myself if my lack of sleep has had my immune system at a heightened alert level leading to the stronger reaction. Yes for sure. Being over tired is one of my major triggers. I struggle with being able to work full time because I require so much sleep sometimes. I will miss an entire day of the weekend because I sleep through it after pushing myself all week.\n\nEdit: I should add the mast cell stuff also likes to wake me up in the night right after I have fallen asleep or within a few hours of sleeping. Like clockwork between 11pm and 2am it would hit. Build up of things from the day maybe? But yeah definitely a strong connection between mc stuff and sleep for me. Same here, I crash Friday and during the weekend. I also wake up at least once between 2-4 am every night no matter what medication I take at night. Sleep with out a doubt causes me to be more reactive the next day. It almost feels like my bucket does not empty. Yep. Definitely. Yes definitely. For me the mose noticable thing is that I become vert anxious, to th\u00e9 point if paranoia. Yep. My daughter has seizures and Cyclic Vomiting related to MCAS, and sleep deprivation is one of her main triggers.", "Tryptase Is Tryptase levels the only measurement for Mast Cell Disease? My doctor told me that tryptase is only one measure. Your tryptase can be within normal range and you can still have a mast cell disorder. \n\nMine was diagnosed through a biopsy take during a colonoscopy. They tested it and found an excess of mast cells in my small and large intestine. no.  there is all sorts of diff mast cell diseases.  some are diagnosed by biopsies or genetic tests.\n\nif u mean idiopathic mcas, tryptase testing is the only method that is been validated.  there is ofc other tests some doctors do.  but other cytokines like histamine can come from other sources besides mast cells.  tryptase is the one most **specific** for mast cells.  so if tryptase levels go up dramatically after an attack, that is the best evidence for mast cells being a major source of the symptoms.  \n\nbut there is still a humungo gap bw that an mcas diagnosis and that is ruling out all the other diseases that cause mast cells to go off. Interesting!   The only thing my current doctor has looked at is my Tryptase levels. I got tryptase measured *during* a huge flare, and it was not even elevated.  \nA lot of sources say tryptase is not reliable.  It is not at all. You could be in a flare during your doctors visit but the level would remain the same since it is stabilized in mcad / mcas patients. \nI am actually considering drawing my own blood during a really bad flare. I heard apparently you got to do it very quickly and cool the blood then. \nThen bring it to the nearest lab. Excess mast cells in my colon sounds plausible. I have always have gerd and other gastro issues. Have a current flare for two months. Suspect the cause was eating food that was heavily smoked with pecan wood. The flare includes issues with brain fog and headaches that I self treat with Zyrtec, Zaditor, magnesium, and Quercetin. So now I am a bit annoyed and pissed at myself.  I had gone back to thinking I had issues due to a previous Lyme infection or migraine/neurological issues.  The Neurologist recommended drinking more water, magnesium and prescribed blood pressure medicine.  I stopped taking Quercetin, Zaditor and Zyrtec.  This worked to a point but not very well.  Was having a horrible time of it.  Now, back on Quercetin, Zaditor and Zyrtec I feel much better. I feel I am back to 90/95% of my normal and getting better. My doctor first tried Zyrtec, Pepcid, Montelukast, and Quercetin, but they did not do much for me. I just started Cromolyn a couple of days ago and I am really hoping it helps. \n\nMy symptoms are mostly gastro/gut issues, plus I am super itchy all the time, get some weird rashes, and react to a lot of foods.", "Allergy testing Those of you who had skin prick allergy testing, did you stop stabilizers when you stopped antihistamines? I was not on any at the time and I was positive for everything including the control haha. You should ask your allergist what to do. He said I could possibly stay on cromolyn but I am thinking it might screw up the results. Mast cells are different than allergies so it likely wont mess with much. Your mast cells are releasing a bunch of stuff so if anything, I would assume, being off stabilizers would mess with the results in a bad way, giving false positives? Or maybe it isnt related to skin prick test. Yeah there is no clear answer that is why I came here. Guess I will do one skin prick off it and the other on it and see what happens. I would think the effect of being on or off the stabilizer would be minimal either way.", "Is anyone with MCAS/ MCAD able to tolerate a b complex supplement? I am looking to start taking b vitamins as I do not think I am able to get enough with my restricted diet.  Is anyone able to tolerate a b complex supplement, and if yes what brand?   \n\nI am not sure if it is even possible to take a b complex as I have read B1 is not great for mcas.  If that is the case and people just take folate or b12 or others by themselves, what brand/ brands work well for you?  \n\nMuch thanks and appreciation for any info! Is b1 really bad for MCAS? I do not know for sure.  I did not tolerate one brand so I did not try others.  And one website said that b1 was not tolerated by people with mast cell activation.  \n\nHave you tried it yourself?  If yes, was it tolerable?\n\nI will try and find the website I came across that suggested against using it.  I would love to find a complex with all of them that is well tolerated. I take jarrow brand chewable b12 and ritual prenatal multivitamin for the folate. I recommend the multivitamin. I am taking it now it seems like I can tolerate it sometimes but not at others. But I still feel like total hell all the time. I take the b\u2019s all separately. I am taking the brand by seeking health as thiamin HCL I found a couple links that advise against b1:\n\n\n\n\nIt is halfway down the page on this site:\n\n\n\n\n\nI saw it originally on another website that I could not track down.  Thanks for the brand name you are using.   I am doing pretty well with my health, just avoid most foods and eat a handful of certain things.  I do think my EMIQ / Quercetin from Natural Factors is a big help.  As is Rutin from Country Life.  \n\nMy b Vitamins are very low from the restricted diet though. That is interesting that it has iodine. I have read iodine is not good for those w MCAS.  A part of the reason I avoid table salt and opt for Himalayan.  But I am just going by what others said about iodine, I never tested it alone on myself and see if I react. Sometimes you just have to try it and see because if I do react to it, then the benefits outweigh the negatives. What are the fillers in the b vitamins? I take b12, b6, b2. I usually eat egg yolks in the morning, I remove the egg white. This should be a good source of b vitamins. I also eat red and yellow bell peppers for vitamin c since oxalate and citrus give me issues. As long as the fillers are just gelatin I am ok but I have heard people have reactions to those as well I think the fillers depend on the brand of vitamins.  I usually look at the ingredients and make sure none are at the bottom of this website, which is good for histamine diet.  \n\n\n\n\n\nAnd I eat tons of eggs as it is a safe food for me.  But still am low in b vitamins.  I will eat 6 eggs a day.   And I eat the entire egg, as everything I have read with egg whites is that they just need to be thoroughly cooked.  And I noticed not eaten right away helps.  \n\nI will bring a bunch of eggs to a boil and then turn off the heat, letting them sit in a covered pan for 15 min.  Then put them in cold water, switching to cold when it warms.  And refrigerate or bring them in a cooler with ice packs to snack on when I am at work.  \n\nMaybe try cooking them well and not eating them right away.  But of course everyone is different with their reactions.   I will keep them in a bowl of cold water and they are good for at least 24-30 hrs for me.\n\nI need to try adding sweet bell peppers to my diet. I have trouble with B multis, there is always something that seems to bug me. I think a lot of them have yeast and yeast and I do not get along well. \"Thorne Research - Basic B Complex\" is yeast free but I have not tried it.\n\nI can take Emergen-C, it is not a full B complex but I have no problems with it.\n\nTry searching for \"hypoallergenic B complex\" and see what you find. I notice that Pure Encapsulations comes up in that search and I cannot take that comfortably. Makes me dizzy.\n\nEverybody has different sensitivities, something that I tolerate may be horrible for you, and vice versa. I am just hoping to find the root cause suspecting an infection I can also tolerate emergen-c. I tried Integrative Therapeutics B Complex. I can tolerate it for a couple days but it ends up making me sick. &gt; I think a lot of them have yeast and yeast and I do not get along well. \n\nMe too.  I was going to buy selenium because I know I am low on it...but it was made from yeast, so I was like \"Why do not I just buy yeast?! It solves a lot of my other vitamin issues if it works!\"\n\nIt did not work--a couple of flakes was enough for me to react to. :/\n\n&gt; Pure Encapsulations comes up in that search\n\nI tried a Pure multi that also did not work for me.  Have not tried the b vitamins on their own, though.\n\n(I am pretty sure now that I react to citrates, so that may be why the multi did not work for me...) Like you, I am on a super-restricted diet. Another Masty mentioned Patch MD.  It is a patch on the skin rather than ingested.  I have no clue how much of each vitamin I am actually getting through the skin, and I was not able to find any peer-reviewed research on the topic, but I do feel better taking it.\n\nI take the multi vitamin.  I started with a 16th of a patch, then an 8th, then a quarter, now I am at half a patch a day.\n\nThe b12 patch has an antioxidant in it and I reacted to it when I tried it. YMMV. I have to take selenium for my thyroid. I get yeast free selenomethionine off the web. At least 1 manufacturer makes it. When I think of all the food, vitamins and drugs I have had to throw out because I have reacted to them...  I could probably buy a Tesla or two. That sounds very interesting, thank you very much for the info.  So when you first used it you cut the patch up into 1/16 or whichever to test at first? Yup, exactly!  Our reactions are generally dose-dependent, so starting off with a tiny amount is a good idea when introducing anything new. :) Oh, I know. Im still having to do that. Thibking back to how many years' worth of stuff just makes me sick. There is a lot of vitamin C in that (not to sound dumb) so I wonder if it mediates the histamine effects of the B vitamins. I developed small fiber sensory neuropathy, erythromelalgia, fatigue, memory issues and so on thanks to a B12 and folate deficiencies. It was terrible. I was originally prescribed folate and took a standalone B12 supplement. Once my levels got back to normal I transitioned to over the counter folic acid and continued B12. Lately I have switched to a B vitamin complex because I could not find folic acid. I take the Nature Made currently as I react to yeast and certain food dyes and I find the products so far to be safe. I have also been successful with Nature's Bounty products. But yeah, B vitamin deficiencies are no joke!", "Near contstant reflux for months and lost tolerance for nearly all food First I aplogize for this being so long but I am really beyond desperate. I have always had trouble with having a lot of heartburn and flares were I got intense heartburn and abdominal pain from everything I ate for about 2-3 weeks. This has incresed in frequency over the last few years along with my respiratory symptoms, flushing and other mast cell related symptoms getting worse.\nThe longest I had one of this flares for before was two months but now it is been nearly 8 months. It is getting better but only very, very slowly. I have been an a diet of nothing but noodles, chicken and potatoes (everthing pureed) and warmed up to a bit above body temperature water (colder or warmer makes the pain and reflux worse again) for most of the time. I also never eat late. I have had to stop taking the pill and stopped taking all supplements. I am now slightly underweight but was able to mostly keep my weight over the last few months by eating suffice it to say a lot of noodles since I have no other way to get the necessary calories otherwise, since I can no longer tolerate anything else. This is obviously a lot of carbohydrates but I really have no other choice since I have no idea when this is finally over and I can not tolerate fatty food even under normal circumstances. I do know for sure that I do not have celiac. I also can not just try out eating something else; one mistake and I am thrown back weeks or at worst months... and this is what I already came up with through trial and error.\nMy stomach has never before been that sensitive to food/medications as it is now, though I need to avoid a lot of food even under normal circumstances.\nMy symptoms right now are: Literally all day taste of stomach acid in my mouth (except when waking up in the morning, before eating) and belching and burning/stabing pain on my chest and under my ribcage. Also maybe a globus feeling though it is more of a constant feeling of something coming up and burning pain in my esophagus. Eating makes it worse and it also easily gets worse again from a bit positive or negative emotional turmoil (this lasts for days). When it was worse in the beginning I was also constantly nauseas, had stomach acid coming up all day, horrible pain and no appetite. I strongly believe that my very likely (was also the idea of a genetist and my neurologist) mast cell disease is the cause of this especially since it is the same as always aside from the fact that it is now far, far worse than ever before. I think it may be be gastritis and esophagitis along this time. (Just a guesa but nothing else to go on.)\nMy GP does not really take this too seriously and claims it is \"just reflux\".\nRigt now I am on 20mg Famotidine (prescription only; only got it because I asked for it specifically) and 10mg Loratadine every 12 hours and no other medication. The famotidine definitely has helped with it getting faster better, but it is really obvious that I need a higher dosage but my GP refuses so far because they claim that more is just for specific diseases and also not for mast cell diseases anyway. Different antacids and PPIs do not help me, they have actually made it worse when I tried them a few months ago. Taking both Famotine and Loratadine has made my other symptoms including my rather servere urticaria far better than just Loratidine alone (which I already took before). But my GP simply ignores this when I bring this up and refuses to believe that this in itself is a strong indicator for mast cell disease. They also refuse to believe that anyone's gut could be this sensitive. I have also had negative scratch and IGE testing; despite server live-long seasonal-allergy like symptoms (through some all year and over the last few years my airway also seems to swell up somewhat) and I have a lot of other symptoms that are a strong indicator for mast cell disease, which no one can explain otherwise. I am also already diagnosed with histamine intolerance. (Although I obviously have trouble when avoiding histamine-rich foods and leftovers completely.)\nI have now compiled a lot of information about mast cell disease, which I am going to give to my GP next time and will push for H. Pylori testing and a gastroscopy (neither has been done so far). If more Famotidine (should I get any more) and the two tests should not yield anything I will try to contact a specialist (very difficult to get there or at least an answer; there are bearly any doctors in my country that take this seriously or know anything about it).\nI could try to take oral-cromolyn (non-prescription medication in my country), which I am reluctant to try because I am scared of getting thrown back again, especially considering that it makes symptoms worse at first for most people and is not even always effective. I could otherwise try to push for ketotifen but I have not been able to find out if this also has a tendency to make things worse at first like cromolyn does (because in that case I could just try cromolyn instead anway, since it would not make any difference anyway aside from the fact that cromolyn is often less effective).  I also worry about malnutrition since I could not take any supplements even if I got prescribed any should this get tested at all and I also worry about loosing any more weight depending on how long this takes to go away. I would just like some advice (not asking for a diagnosis) on how to proceed since I am really getting more and more desperate and running out of ideas what to do. You need an immunologist not a GP. You should not have to be the one determining your course of action for your health. You need someone who understands MCAS so you can take a break from trying to treat yourself. Must be frustrating to be in that position. \n\nCromolyn is not bad for everyone. I tolerated it just fine, of course everyone is different. Its helped a lot but not my acid. Im on prescription omeprazole. Ive had ulcers in the past, too.  Yeah, it is really terrible and really stressful. I tried going to an immunologist a few years ago, who ended up claiming MCAS is not real and completely mixed up systemic and cutaneous mastocytosis. The consensus of the community of people with mast cell disease in my country seems to be that there are nearly no allergists or immunologists in my country that know anything about it. And many that do know something refuse new patients outright without prior positive diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis (they refuse all MCAS patients). Going of histamine blockers for testing would also really be bad right now, since it already took so long to get to where I am now and it is probably MCAS anyway since SM is so rare. I have not been able to find any addreses except for my country's for most specialists (as already stated above, difficult to contact or to get to them) anyway, despite searching for hours. But maybe this really is my only option except for taking the plunge and trying cromolyn. I was on 40mg of acid reducer before I moved to a PPI. Are you taking the max dose or low dose?\n\nWhy not try cromolyn? Its for GI mast cell degranulation. I am on the lowest dosage (40mg a day) since my GP refuses to prescribe me more so far. Obviously I cannot know without trying but I am scared of cromolyn making it worse, this is why I am still trying to first get my GP to prescribe me more Famotidine and to only try cromolyn if this should fail. My stomach has been getting worse again several times just because the warmed up water I am drinking was about two degrees celsius too cold or me eating maybe a tinsy bit too much (not a lot just more than my stomach can handle right now), it is really crazy easy to irritate further right now. That Is not a low dose. 10mg is a low dose. If its systemic then I would personally go with ketotifen or increase in antihistamines. \n\nI was frightened to try cromolyn as I had just come off a horrible flare from trying lexapro. But I had nothing to lose. \n\nHave you had colonoscopy? Or a scope of some sort to rule out any other issues? Have you done the 24 hour urine test/tryptase for mcas? 1) Get to a gastroenterologist for an endoscopy/colonoscopy to make sure nothing else is going on and try to calm down whatever they can see flaring here and now. \n\n2) Get to an allergist or immunologist to address the mast cell symptoms.  has a list of doctors all over the world and also an email address for advice nurses. \n\n3) Stop playing pharmacist on yourself and get to a doctor who will listen to you and work with you. The physician database seems to have been sadly removed and an older version is also not accessible via the Internet Archive.\nLike I already stated this is sadly not so easy in my country (something I see in every online discussion I look at), I will obviously continue to look though.\nI am going to push for a referal to a gastroenterologist anyway but since the last gastroscopy I had several years ago, when I had the same/ a similar problem (lasted only maybe about six weeks back then) came back negative this seems to have become \"nothing\" in my GP's mind and has not yet been deemed \"necessary\". I see, thanks for the info. I have not yet gotten any doctor to actually perform tets for MCAS. My last gastroscopy when I had the same/ a simliar problem for more than a month came up with nothing and ended with me getting a referal to a psychiatrist, which also ended up with being \"nothing\". This sort of made these tests unnecessary in my GPs eyes every time this issue came back (usually every few months).\nI will defintely push for a referal to a gastroenterologist, by now it really should be deemed necessary to do a new one. And once the pandemic is better/over I will better also look for a new GP. Gastroenterologists dont necessarily treat (or diagnose) MCAS though. Immunologists do. Its a GI issue but the cause is MCAS which is an immune system disorder. It is really hard to find an immunologist in some areas. It took 1.5 years and an email to tms to find the only one who exists in my state. Have you had any cat scans with dye?", "Confused and looking for insight Hi there,\n\nI posted this in r/ehlersdanlos but maybe it could also be posted here too? \n\nI (28f) have possible EDS/MCAS (in the process of seeing an allergen and urologist that specializes in both). Im currently on Zyzal 5mg/Claritin 10mg in the morning and Benadryl 10mg at night. I still am having issues though and not feeling much relief. It is better than it was before taking the antihistamines but I feel like I need a mast cell stabilizer?...Mostly neck swelling and stiffness (which causes ear clogging and dizziness), hives and flushing from prettyyyy much everything. -.- lol especially hot weather and showers, and chronic nasal congestion (especially when I eat food?) Im in the process of a low histamine diet but my MAJOR symptoms are IC/UTI like bladder symptoms.(irritation when voiding, slight burning after voiding, but no frequency) Symptoms will come and go with this but most days there is mild UTI symptoms that will not go away. I have been tested and always negative for UTIs and when I do get a UTI, I get awful super itchy hives from the antibiotics that last forever. Honestly, this all started after I had a UTI that was treated with Bactrim and I had a severe allergic reaction to. Never been the same since. :(\n\nMy question is, can anyone relate to these symptoms? All of this is so new and I am so lost. My whole life I have had tachycardia, easy bruising, allergies to freaking everything, double jointed and ive been okay but this past year something triggered and I am miserable.\n\nIm not asking for a diagnosis but i am hoping all these doctor appointments that I have coming up will clear some things but I am asking how does this all correlate? Is it a Mass cell /EDS thing that has comorbidity to other illnesses?\n\nThanks, any wisdom will be greatly appreciated.&lt;3 Hi! First, I want you to know you are not alone. Most of us have struggled to get a proper diagnosis, and an efficient treatment. GPs are not taught enough about them, are therefore are often underequiped to correctly help patients. (Or, like my former GP, do not Bellerive EDS exists!)\n\nSecondly, there is indeed a correlation between EDS, MCAS and other autoimmune illnesses, such as dysautonomia and POT, as well as anxiety and depression. They can also be hard to distinguish.\n\nAs far as I know, the most recent explanation is the RCCX theory (/r/RCCXtheory). *Very roughly*, the RCCX is a module of genes implicated in a lot of biological pathways, and just a few mutations generate a lot of issues, causing a wide variety of issues. It also partly explains why people with EDS often have family members with other illnesses. However, this research is very recent and unknown. (I recommend reading the website, but it is science-heavy)\n\nIf you want to get me information on MCAS, I recommend Dr. Afrin's work, either reading his book (\"Never Bet Against Occam\") or watching one of his conferences (I like this one :  from 2016).\n\nI (27 F) have MCAS, and probably EDS too. And I used to have cutaneous mastocytosis when I was a child. Do not hesitate to ask me questions if you have any!\n\nI hope your physicians will help you figure thing out fast \u263a\ufe0f I get the neck swelling and stiffness too, along with shoulder pain, uterus cramps, rashes, hives, brain fog and fatigue. From my experience Cromolyn will not help the neck pain and stiffness and is difficult to take (I am in tropical climate so I need to take an insulated pouch with me and still have to find a cup).  It needs to be taken with food to work for me and I do not always eat 3 meals a day so I have got a 17 pound box of Cromolyn beside my bed (also can be expensive if you are in the US) I have tried ketotifen (can only get at compound pharmacy and insurance will not pay for it, goes for $4 a pill here) and it caused nauseousness for me. \n\nI am on Hydroxyzine twice daily, quercetin (I cannot do any with vitamin C, so I get mine off Amazon), singulair and was advised if that was not enough I could add Zyrtec at night (have not needed to) I still get rashes and hives and everything outside is a trigger. \n\nMineral sunscreen is going to be your best friend, it helps prevent my rashes and I do have my MMJ card so I have access to CBD/THC topicals, they work as well to prevent inflammation so no rash. MMJ is the only thing that helps my breathing as well. I still have horrible dry mouth in the mornings and have post nasal drip. Yesterday my husband said \"you are face is really red\" I forgot to put on my lotion. My allergist told me to just buy baby mineral sunscreen so there is less to react to. \n\n\nIt is a lot of information, I have been trying different meds since December and still am learning thing. This is an excellent answer. Thank you for posting it :) Thank you for the reply! &lt;3\n\nOi, that is a lot. I unfortunately do not have insurance and going to the doctor and getting tests done are all out of pocket for me. The neck pain and stiffness i can manage with CBD oil and trigger point massages. Its the urinary, digestive, and hive/flushing that is bothering me daily. I live in a humid climate of the US so i just sweat and get flushed by just existing outside. lol\n\nHow does the Cromolyn work? I do have the quercetin...i stopped taking it because i felt like it was not working but ive read that you need to take a decent amount. Thank you so much you are so kind! &lt;3\n\nIs urinary/digestive issues common with EDS/MCAS? Both are very common with MCAS yes. I am not sure for EDS, but they share a lot of symptoms, so the same basics might apply.\n\nUrinary issues have a twist compared tu standard UTI : they are often non infectious inflammation! The urethra is inflamed without any infection.\n\nDigestive issues are also a major issue, but can be lessened by avoid trigger foods. Example : for me, no gluten, no raw fruits, no mushrooms, etc. &gt; I live in a humid climate of the US so i just sweat and get flushed by just existing outside. lol\n\nIf you find a fix let me know lol. Hydroxyzine is the only thing that stops the GI issues after the point of no return, if I can catch the churning quick enough I can prevent it by using CBD/THC vape pen. Have not found a fix for hives though, mine are pressure hives so wearing banded pants leaves hives from one hip to the other. I have heard of people saying Xolair helps but I am not sure I am at that point yet plus it is only approved for cronic unknown hives. \n\nCromolyn worked but not enough to make a difference, I could also have endometriosis on my bowels so that could be why I did not see a change. \n\nI get better improvements off quercetin daily, I have less days of pain (before getting diagnosed I was having back pain that did not go away with steroid injections and my next step was lower back and neck surgery) \n\nIm getting quercetin by toniq off amazon, it is 1000mg per capsule and does not have added ingredients. I have been taking one every morning and the box says 2 capsules up to twice a day. I also have EDS,POTS,MCAS and hashimoto's. It is very common for people with EDS to have all these conditions. My first episode of anaphylaxis was also to bactrim. My children are all allergic to sulfa too. You will find these videos and youtube channel very informative:\n\n(\n\n(\n\nNeck issues are common. I did not know that until I saw the videos.( should try adding famotidine (pepcid ac) to your daily meds, it is a H2 blocker whereas zyzal and claritin are H1 blockers. As far as mast cell stabilizers the one that really helped me was xolair but it quit working. Ketotifen is a mast cell stabilizer that helps most people. I reacted to it so now my doctor has me taking an incredibly small dose in hopes that I can work my way up to the standard dose. The congestion after eating is food allergy/intolerance. I tried cromolyn sodium but I reacted to that too. After I eliminated gluten,dairy,eggs and soy from my diet my neck issues improved tremendously. Get checked for hashimoto's and celiac disease if you have not already. If you ever did a dna test like 23 and me or ( you can upload you raw DNA info to livewello's gene tool and check if you carry the EDS gene. The site seems to be very accurate. It correctly identified the EDS gene type I have. It is a lot cheaper than getting your full genome sequenced. It also correctly identified several other rare disorders I have.  (\n\nMast cell treatment plan:  ( Wow, thank you! that is so informative. I have done a dna test like 23 and me. I will be doing that. Ever since the reaction to Bactrim, I cannot tolerate eggs. :(\nThank you again, this was very helpful. Once you upload your raw dna data to livewello, go to the gene library and type:  Hypermobility Ehlers Danlos--TNXB. That is the report I ran. it will ask you if you want to install the template and once it is installed you run it and it give's you the results. You can do that for mast cell and pretty much any other condition you are curious about. Hiya! Wanted to update you that turns out, most my Urinary issues resolved with pelvic floor stretching. Dr thinks my mast cell flair ups causes me to lock up my pelvic floor. I have overall muscle issues through my body. Especially neck, shoulders, and lower back. (Bad car accident) so doing this helped. I am hoping that starting a MCAS treatment with a mast cell stabilizer will help keep my from flaring up so bad when I eat or drink something that does not agree with me and avoiding major triggers. Just need to figure out what those are... lol At least now you are on the right track to get better :)", "Horrible experience with Quest Diagnostics lab  I have had nothing but problems with them.\n\nThe phlebotomist cannot figure out what the test codes are every time I go. The first time I went, the phlebotomist thought that the immunoglobulin A&amp;M test was supposed to be done only in the morning! I had to argue with her and even her co-worker was annoyed with her. Due to this in other issues, I had to be there for 90 minutes. From this experience I learned that the minute there is a problem I will call my doctor's office. \n\nThe same phlebotomist forgot to put one of my tests in the freezer and left it sitting out for 20 minutes. I really wish I had forced them to repeat it, but my chronic fatigue was horrible at the time I went in; I just wanted to go back to bed and sleep.\n\nOh, and then my doctor's office was useless in helping me with a problem at Quest today. I had painstakingly taken care to not mess up my 24-hour urine tests, keeping them refrigerated at all times and not taking meds even though it was extremely uncomfortable and painful to comply. \n\nWhen I went to Quest to bring it in, I thought it would be a simple drop off. Nope. The phlebotomist could not find the test code. Luckily I had packed the bag with a ton of frozen bags to keep it cool.\n\nI called my doctor's office, but of course the person that knows these codes was not in today, even though she told me to call anytime they were open to get my problem resolved. I even waited to do this test on the weekend to make sure I could bring it in on a Monday.\n\nI am just going to take it to LabCorp instead. They seem to suck a bit less than Quest. I used Quest for a few tests, including a 24 hour urine, which is supposed to be kept refrigerated. I brought it in in an iced cooler, and the person there did not seem to care or understand about keeping it cold. It was a completely wasted test. There were other examples as well. They seem to hire people who might as well have \"Do not give a shit\" stamped on their forehead. I have also had the same experience at quest Been to Quest dozens of times and never have a problem except when I do not go to my regular location. Maybe changing locations will help .   \nIf fatigue is a problem, try a mobile phlebotomist. They cost a little extra but they come to your home so you can go back to bed as soon as they leave. LOL dude... for fucking REAL.  \n\nI took the 24 hour urine test and had produced a little more than the 3L jug they gave me (what can I say?).  So I called the doc who said do not skip any - pee in a  Nalgene or something and bring it and make sure they combine it in a bigger jug at the lab and immediately refrigerate.  \n\nSo I go to the lab and bring both in a cooler on ice.  They are taking my blood first so I politely asked them \u201csorry - my doc was adamant that sample needs to be kept cold is there any way you could please refrigerate it?\u201d  She give me a look of death.  \n\nSo finally she takes out a little cup, opens just the 3L jug and takes a sample.  I could already sense her frustration so I was overly polite and walking on eggshells - but I was like \u201cexcuse me but would not you need to combine them to get total volume and whatever amount of what you are testing for out of it?\u201d  \n\nShe lost her shit on me.  \u201cYou want to tell me how to do my job!!?!?\u201d   So her boss comes in and asked what was going on.  The tech goes on this tirade and tells the boss I am telling her what to do.  So I just said \u201cI am sorry but I thought the whole reason for collecting a sample over 24 Hours was to get total urine volume and see the levels of (whatever it was - Tryptase maybe?) over that time.\u201d   \n\nThe boss just goes \u201cno\u201d and walks out.  It was at that point it dawned on me that no one in the lab - not the tech or the manager - understood basic math principles and how levels of something could fluctuate during a day and how decreasing the denominator could impact test results.  \n\nSo now the tech had calmed down.  She grabs the 3L and the Nalgene, walks into the bathroom, dumps half the 3L out, pours the nalgene in, and I am just sitting there smiling laughing like \u201cok... that is not going to work either but at this point I just give up.\u201d  So I just totally wrote that test off. \n\n2 weeks later, I took the test again and sought out a different Quest.  Same thing happened - 3L + about 1.2 in another bottle.  This time the tech was very nice - but when I asked her the same question about combining specimens she politely replied \u201coh they did away with the bigger jugs and containers nationwide.  So we cannot combine the two because we (and no other quest) do not have a vessel big enough to combine more than 3L.  I just laughed and threw up my hands at that point.  \n\n4 weeks of waiting, hundreds of dollars in testing and ongoing health issues and the staff was rude and uneducated and the lab did not even have the right equipment. OMFG you had some bad experiences with them! I will never go back for any test. They do not seem to train their staff at all.", "UK - can you help? How to motivate referral leading to testing, elimination, possible diagnosis Hello all,\n\nBeing my first post on this subject in any forum, I am most definitely new to this and as was demonstrated only 3 weeks ago, with my first series of whole body shock responses, increasing in severity across the following 3 further shock responses and at the most recent \"event\", admission to emergency treatment and discounting of Anaphylaxis (based upon appearance of torso-based lesions, red marks etc).\n\nI would like then to please ask for your advice on how to motivate a referral to prove or disprove a Mastocytosis Activation diagnosis?\n\nIt is important to note that I am diagnosed with Autism and ADHD, as well as, three further trauma-based mental health conditions all of which are under supervision from Psychiatrists, and a medication regime that has been stable for more than 2 years.\n\nToo, the response from a wide range of NHS medical professions, including all GPs and Senior Nurse at my GP Surgery, have brought me to a point where three responses to visual, research, statistical and consultant-based evidence are defined by: you are making this up, your mental health is to blame (leading to questioning for possible sectioning) and misdiagnosis.\n\nIn this way, without doubt my GP Surgery will refuse a referral. As an alternative however, I have approached past and present Consultant Psychiatrists - at this level are able to refer into any service regardless of own specialism - that has resulted without surprise, in questioning of my current state of mind.\n\n...and I believe to change GP Surgery now, to build any sense of patient-GP relationship and get to a point of seriously discussing a referral - based upon evidence and fact - will result in my increasing the possible next shock response and risk to life, which I value too much to wait around for.\n\nIn short then, how in your own experience have you motivated a referral? Has this included a particular set of evidence? Have you paid privately? Have you explained your own situation in a certain way that seemed to work? Or any other experience-based suggestion that did not result on a judgement of mental ill health?\n\nNaturally, I believe, I have been through several round of such sanity questioning, but only return to fact and evidence proving that now, an unknown trigger creates in me a response (captured with photos when physical), is not Anaphylaxis (defined by Consultant since I have never previously had lesions, red marks etc on my torso), the current stability of medication regime (clearly, own responsibility but evidential through dates of prescribing), and on the last occasion, a need to call for emergency medical help as a result of the severity of responses. Thus, leading to the only other disease that exactly fits and was made aware to me by a leading Anaphylaxis organisation.\n\nI hope and trust the above does not sound like a help call from a crisis state - a recurrent judgement from others - rather a sense of relief at the possibility for an answer, or not and if not, the possibility for new answers to be made available to me somehow, somewhere and at sometime.\n\nThank you for your time reading, and should you like to respond, thank you for your time taken writing about how things have been or are for you.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you. A ( is a UK based charity for mast cell activation syndrome. They can give you a list of MCAS aware doctors in UK. \nThey also have a (\n\nI ended up going to see a Dr privately. I was completely covered in blisters/ welts from mainly food reactions, and had got to the point I could only eat popcorn without getting itching/ diarrhoea/ mouth swelling. I thought GP would refuse referral too, especially since I discovered MCAS by working my way through a huge immunology book I would downloaded - I actually emailed the MCAS Dr first describing my symptoms to see if he thought it was worth investigating, and so I had his email back confirming that he did think I had MCAS to show GP. I also completed this ( to add weight to my theory - some questions I could not answer as did not have those results but still scored &gt; 20 (A total score above 8 but less than 14 indicates a pathological activation of mast cells. At a total score of 14 and more, a systemic mast cell mediator release syndrome is clinically verified.) The true test is whether you respond to treatment though, after Dr has decided you may have MCAS.\nLuckily, GP will prescribe the drugs he recommended. I thought GP would be crap about it but they have been great. Treatment is working really well. I have never had any allergies/ sensitivities so find it weird this happened but \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nMany of us have had symptoms for months/ years, have seen different doctors and made to feel we are crazy. Thank you ever so much for your comments and sharing of experience and document. It has proven critically valuable and now, with the appropriate language, fact, evidence, research and statistics it is certain  a referral can and will be made. I am happy that you feel it is helped. It is very frustrating feeling unwell and being unable to get answers, or not even knowing what questions to ask in the first place.\nSome NHS clinics will not take referrals for MCAS, as there are no specific NICE guidelines for treatment and they can pretend it does not exist. So many people get referred with symptoms of chronic urticaria (itchy welts) ... which is treated with same drugs as MCAS. So use this route if going NHS. There is more information about this issue on the Facebook group.\n\nThere is however some information here from The Royal College of GPs, linked with ( If you go down to the bit about ( you will find links to MCAS information they recommend for GPs.\n\nAnother thing - photograph all your reactions and keep them in an online file. Then you have the evidence it is a) happened and b) ongoing over a period of time I second everything here (although I do not have the exact same symptoms, obviously!). I am in the UK and have recently obtained a diagnosis privately after years (since about 2014) of failing to get the NHS to help. I saw a consultant I found through that charity. Also as above, the NHS is now prescribing a number of things based on my consultant's input, so I do not have to pay for all meds privately at the moment, just the consultations. It has been very much worth paying privately to get a treatment plan and access to these meds, which have helped me a huge amount. \n\nI will add some thoughts about practicalities of dealing with the NHS which expand on some of the points made, as it is an ongoing process and they may or may not be cooperative in the longer term. I have not found a magic approach to get them to listen, or to stop with the frankly bullying behaviour, but some random thoughts that may (or may not!) help:\n\n- As above, any symptoms that you have that are objectively verifiable are the things to lead with when talking to the NHS. Sometimes the things that are least problematic for you are the things that get you referred, which is completely mad but if you can find a nice neat box into which a subset of your symptoms fit, try that. Do this separately for each 'set' of symptoms so things do not get confused (and the NHS is easily confused). This can be useful to access specific medications, not necessarily to get you an MCAS diagnosis.\n\n- Following from above, be strategic, think of it as a long term campaign and not a series of one off encounters, and consider your approach at each one. I have had most success when I have been calm, collected and rational, and not thrown too much at them at once (really hard I know, and sometimes impossible when they are being difficult and you are ill). Want help for respiratory symptoms right now? Focus on that, ideally with data to show like peak flow drops. Rashes? Photos. Evidence, evidence, evidence - even if it seems unimportant, the more of a picture you build, the harder for them to dismiss in the long term.\n\n- it is apparently not completely impossible to get an MCAS diagnosis from the NHS, but it is really hard and you have to be lucky enough to end up being referred to one of a tiny handful of Drs in the entire country who will do it, so the odds are low. And if you are not lucky, you could probably go completely mad trying!\n\n- if you make it clear you are going to go private, GPs will agree to a referral much more easily, so if you go down this route make sure you tell them that is your plan at the start of the appt. If you can afford it, I highly recommend it, provided you pick your specialist carefully ( and again, see above).\n\n- in terms of other diagnoses, if your GP practice offers it, sign up to the NHS app so you can see all of your test results. They do not usually want to discuss what they have done in detail or give you numbers; this gives you access to all of that info. Also get a copy of your medical record if you do not have it (they are legally required to give you access, although you may have to pay a fee). You will then be able to challenge them when they say 'we have ruled that out' if they actually have not, and it can give you valuable insight about how they think/interpret things. It may be hard reading - mine had a number of outright lies in it  - but if you are prepared for that it is of value.\n\nFinally, I am so sorry you have been subjected to the    horrible NHS gaslighting of 'you are making it up' / 'it is all due to mental health issues'. I do not have the diagnoses you do, but have still had those accusations thrown at me too for a very long time, and I know how awful it is, especially when you are so ill, and how you question your sanity when it happens. It does not go away with a private diagnosis, but like you seem to be, I was focused on trying to get help and the possibility of getting better, and now I have that.\n\nYou do not sound like you are in a crisis or panicking. You sound considered, well informed, and like you know what you need. I really do hope you can get some proper help. Wow, your sentiment, sincerity and honesty has brought me to tears. Thank you. I am taking the point you make and being on the Spectrum, strategic I do very well. It still surprises me today - though it should not based upon the level of inarguable evidence now inaccessible widely within an online folder - for example, the witnessing by my Mother, of me entering and coming out of what most likely was a convulsion is responded to as make believe and practically impossible to evidence - clearly one could t induced and a brain electricity scan would not show the effect. \n\nNevertheless, it seems as always that private might work. \n\nI wish you very well and again , thank you. You are very welcome, I am glad it was helpful. \n\nThe 'not in the NICE guidelines'='does not exist' approach can be endlessly frustrating, especially when combined with a refusal to accept basic logic. At this point, I know I should not be surprised when this happens, and yet, somehow I always am! I think we both see the lovely Dr. Yes, I guessed as much from your description.", "Overcoming medication related weight gain? Any helpful strategies? Count calories. Meds can make you more hungry so we unknowingly eat more.

My histamine intolerance issues and mast cell issues started a week after getting the flu vaccine for the first time in November and while I am in the process of healing from mold, SIBO, and candida, I am concerned what the COVID vaccine may trigger. I had the Astra Zeneca vaccine. It is the only one available in my country. After the first shot, I felt fine (for me). The only symptom I had was a 15 minute hot flash the next morning.\n\n Two weeks after the second shot I developed flu-like symptoms - nausea and very bad diarrhea, and general malaise. The doctor said it was definitely a reaction to the vaccine, and he has many patients who had the same symptoms.\n\nHe gave me a herbal remedy, methylene blue, which I took for five days. It has helped quite a lot. Unfortunately I am still in a flare and feeling very unwell, but the original symptoms are gone. So sorry to hear you are still dealing with a flare and not feeling well, but glad you have improved from the original symptoms. It is interesting you developed flu-like symptoms to weeks later. Reminds me of my flu vaccine experience with sudden food sensitivity and allergy symptoms a week after that. I had both doses of AZ. Very slightly sore arm but no other reaction 1st dose only so far, was Moderna. \nSore arm for a week, and mild headache/fatigue/fever for less than 24hrs. Unfortunately this post will be seen negatively.  I am sorry for that.  Please keep in mind.  I have had severe symptoms of illness for 30 years with no diagnoses.  I understand the difficulties we go through, and I really wish to help people.\n\nYou claim to have 4 controversial illnesses at the same time. Get the Vaccine.  Stop listening to Alternative medical theories.\n\nI react to practically everything.  Fabrics, food, the air. Even tap water.  If I had not discovered tricks to neutralize the things I react to, I would probably be institutionalized, or worse.  I got the Moderna vaccine without hesitation.  Nothing changed.  The change a vaccine makes to the body differs little from the changes the body goes through to defeat a virus.  People experience post viral illness at a higher rate than post vaccine illness.  Go with the vaccine over the virus. I do not think your post is negative, but I am just going off of my sudden health issues that came about a week after the flu vaccine, so that is where my hesitance stems from and my prior extremely elevated inflammatory markers. I am working with an integrative doctor who is an MD and supports my getting the vaccine, but wants me to be somewhat cautious and be as prepared as possible before getting it.

I have had anaphylaxis from a flu shot before, but I have been on xolair the last two years and my reactions are generally less severe than they used to be, so I decided to risk it. I took Benadryl beforehand. I got warm and nauseated from the shot, but nothing more. 3 weeks after it, I started reacting to all my safe foods and had to take steroids for a few days.\n\nOne of my sisters got Moderna, she says she had no reaction at all.\n\nMy other sister has lupus in addition to MCAS. She cannot get vaccinated.\n\nMy daughter got the first dose of Pfizer and got hives and facial swelling 10 minutes after the shot. She cannot get the second dose now. Sorry to hear all of you are dealing with MCAS. Glad those who could get it were safely able to. I appreciate you sharing and wish you all well as you navigate this. Curious if you got your second dose and how it went. Yeah, got it Tuesday (Moderna again).

She then prescribed me a corticosteroid.\n\nAlso, I remember being young- mustard, popcorn and advil would make my skin itch a lot. No idea if this is useful. Maybe due to my soy allergies..\n\nSTORY TIME:\n\nA couple years ago, I noticed some stomach problems. Whenever I would eat, I would get very bloated and standing up in the metro became hard due to the stomach bloatness. The stool were kind of \u201csick\u201d very soft.\nHad also lack of appetite for like a month-then the appetite came back.\n\nTests:\nDoctors found nothing and blamed it on ibs without any examination.

It was extremely weird\n\n\nSo: tachycardia, uncontrollable anxiety, fatigue, brain fog were the main symptoms.\n\nTRIP TO GREECE:\n\nIt was bad. I noticed that I cannot tolerate the heat anymore. In the HEAT I would get anxiety and brain fog very often. During BREAKFAST I would shake from inside and have uncontrollable anxiety. HOT SHOWERS would also make me feel bad.\n\nI felt like I was losing it. The anxiety was uncontrollable.\n\nThe anxiety was horrible in the heat.\n\nAt night It would be mostly brain fog walking outside.\n\nI think at night in the house I would have no symptoms.\n\nI also had random itching but the itching felt like it came from inside my body like on my organs and not on my skin.\n\nI also noticed that being in a car in high altitudes made me want to vomit.\n\nAlso had globus sensation. Sometimes when I would eat I felt like something, like a piece of food was stuck at the top of my mouth or throat but there was nothing there. The sensation came back a couple of times.\nAnyways\n\nBACK TO MY COUNTRY CANADA\n\nMY GP\nsaid it was depression and did not believe me. I told him it could be sleep apnea. It could explain some symptoms.\n\nInvestigation: In a private clinic- They said I had an AHI of 6 based on a home study. So I had light sleep apnea. \n\n2ND OPINION\nHowever, when I went to a hospital specialized in sleep apnea; I stayed overnight AND next morning had a sleep latency test and the results: no sleep apnea but I went into REM very fast 1/5 naps. Should be investigated.\n\nGP AGAIN\nTold him it could be POSTURAL ORTHOSTATIC TACHYCARDIA SYNDROME because I noticed my heart rate always being high upon standing and my blood pressure being high in hypertension stage 2 ONLY when being upright. Said no it is depression.\n(Noticed by hr being around 112-115 when walking and being always in the 140-94 bp zone whenever upright and good bp when lying down)\n\nINTERNAL MEDECINE\nSo went to internal medecine and doctor did the poor mans titl table test:\n\nGood hr and bp upon lying down for 10 minutes and 10 mins after standing it went to: 155/108 bp and 124bpm. They concluded that it can certainly be POTS so they sent me to a cardiologist.\n\nAT THE CARDIOLOGIST:\nRefused to do a tilt table test (a real one) but performed a poor mans tilt table test. \nFindings: high bp but hr went to 109 and it needs to go +30bpm or to 120bpm so her diagnosis is NO POTS. However, she noted that I do have high blood pressure upon standing.\nShe gave me a 24 hr bp test to do-strapped on my arm\n\nThe results: nothing relevant...did not have a meeting with her due to covid-19.\n\nThis test I performed when my orthostatic symptoms were very low, they seemed to be fading away...so the results as you can imagine were normal. Even though my hr went to 116bpm at some point. She said maybe it was because of me taking the stairs or something similar but I never did that day.\n\nSo...\n\nI was back to square one !\n\nNowdays my symptoms are random anxiety not as bad as it was before, my orthostatic symptoms are way better. \n\nHowever sometimes after exercice I feel like my face becomes extremely hot- as if i am about to have a fever but I dont. My face doesnt turn red but feels feverish. I also get random fatigue and I feel like I am not myself anymore.\n\n\nPOTENTIAL DIAGNOSIS !!?!?\n\nI recently found out about MAST CELL ACTIVATION\n\nI put a 2 And 2 together...\n\n-Having a blocked nose since kid with lots of mucus coming from nose and throat\n-Anxiety when eating, during heat, when exercicising and during hot showers (BUT NOT ALWAYS)\n-The stomach bloating and sick stools\n-The tachycardia when eating certain foods\n-The random brain fog\n-The face feeling feverish\n-Sometimes I get rashes on my stomach like claws after a hot shower but I doubt that is relevant...\n\nBecause of all I have been through, lots of psychiatric symptoms and some gastro\n\nI do not feel like myself anymore. I feel different and anxious most of the time..\n\n\nCOULD THIS BE MAST CELL ACTIVATION ?!\nEven though I do not have any skin related symptoms ?\n\nBased on the entirety of my story, could MCAS be plausible ?\n\n\nThank you so very much to everyone reading this and helping out. Means a lot to me..\n\nI am tired of suffering !\n\n\nThank you !!!! Everybody has different symptoms but these are a lot like mine. Try going on a low histamine diet. U can do that without any doctors help U can try over the counter meds like Allegra or Zyrtec as well as Famotidine, increase your fluid levels especially before meals and see if any of that helps. Many of us have been through the same frustrating visits with doctors who do not understand. It feels awful to be told it is all in your head when you are suffering physically. I hope you can find the right doctor. Try ( Hey, thank you for helping me out !! Are you diagnosed with MCAS ? I will try your diet and maybe try some antihistamines.. Hopefully I see some change !\nThanks again !! :) Thank you for your helps, means a lot :)\nI will definitely try these and see if there is any change\nFingers crossed !!\nThanks again :D Thank you so much !!\nIt really is frustrating having weird symptoms, feeling bad and no one believing you !!\nThank you for sharing you I will definitely look into it\nThanks a lot :) Yes I am diagnosed with mcas. Antihistamines and a low histamine diet has helped me with a lot of the symptoms Yes I am diagnosed with mcas. Antihistamines and a low histamine diet has helped me with a lot of the symptoms I am 64. First coma was at age 6 months. Went into remission around age 7 but then it came back in grad school.\n\nObviously most of my life the whole thing was a mystery. I learned to manage my diet and chemical exposures. Never got much help from drugs because the old style antihistamines put me to sleep. \n\nThen the new antihistamines came out, like Hismanal and Seldane . I was allergic to Seldane  so I stuck with Hismanal . I do not think either are available anymore. \n\nBack in the 90s they put me on doxepin for severe depression. Doxepin is also a heavy duty antihistamine. Relief. Pretty much went back into remission for a years and years.\n\nAlso learned to manage my stress via meditation and yoga.\n\nThen Claritin arrived. And more. So I did pretty well with OTC stuff until last year. I had to start taking montelukast for my spring allergies.\n\nStill watch my diet and exposures, still do stress relief. Drive my doctors nuts with what medicines I can and cannot take. Thank you for your help :) Thank you so much for your feedback and story !!\nDid you have symptoms similar to mine ?\nI hope life continues to treat you nicely and wish you all the best !!\nThanks again :) Sometimes yes. Mostly hives, anaphylaxis. Sleepiness, brain fog, fatigue. Geographic tongue, sensitive stomach. Very often if I ate the wrong thing it would go right thru me. Itchy skin, but more like inside the skin than on the surface. Sometimes I wanted to take my body off, I just felt so uncomfortable. Cold intolerance. Getting cold water on my head will make me pass out. Even very cold weather and I start getting shocky. I am sure there is more I have forgotten about. Thank you so much :)", "MCAS increases appetite? Anyone find that you have a higher appetite with untreated MCAS? When I take my cromolyn sodium regularly like I should, my appetite drops and I dont snack nearly as much. Or maybe its just a side effect of cromolyn? I am not complaining hah just something I noticed. When I am flaring, my appetite does not have an off switch.  The more I eat the hungrier I get.  The type of food does not really matter, it is not a carb thing, as this happens with a pure carnivore meal with say, pot roast with just salt and pepper (no potatoes or veggies).   Rather it seems to be trigger foods that cause it.  Pot roast is slow cooked, which = higher histamine.  Or say, anything with food dyes, or the usual fruits that cause me other issues etc will also trigger this issue.\n\nIt is a vicious cycle as the hungrier I am, the more likely I am to eat something I should not, or to continue eating waaayyyy too much of something I should not. Yes! A vicious cycle is right. When I flare I get ravenously hungry eating so many things and so many things I should not which aggravates it even more. Hard cycle to get out of. It requires me starving myself sometimes to reset everything. Unless I get soooo sick I cannot eat anymore. I have acute flares which are obvious but I am wondering if I have long-term flares that are not as noticeable. This definitely sounds like me except the meat part. I have this weird aversion to meat so I dont normally go wild on it. Man...this is all so difficult. Timing my meds out, eating a certain way, figuring out triggers... it takes so long to get to a good place and even then there is stuff you can still be figuring out. I tend to go through cycles.  Certain types of things give me flairs that result in drastic weight loss and the inability to tolerate just about any food.  Going through 1 right now.  And it is hard to get out of.\n\n Same with the crazy munchies where it does not seem to matter what I am eating as long as I am eating, although I tend to crave high histamine foods more during this time. And everything seems to be a histamine food when I cannot eat. \n\nSometimes I seem fairly balanced but I never know how I got there and I cannot seem to maintain it.\n\nI know somw of what triggers the not tolerant of food stage.  Still figuring out the rest. An Instant Pot will cook your pot roast in an hour or less, still enough structure that you can slice it, but as tender as if it had been in the slow cooker all day. I do not really have an appetite anymore. Food is a lot of trouble. I am not currently taking cromolyn (made my fibroid bleed until I needed a blood transfusion) but I did not have an appetite while taking cromolyn either. I think it is because i have to cook everything from scratch and I react to heat from cooking, so by the time food is done, I am tired and covered in hives. I keep meaning to get one and try it.  Avoiding the slow cooker, instead of avoiding pot roasts would be amazing. It does pork tenderloin in about 20 minutes too...9 minutes cook time plus the time to come to pressure. And it makes great rice, and hard boiled eggs that are really easy to peel. I agree with the if I have to cook it I am probably not going to eat it.  It is too much effort.  I have Orgain protein shakes and some protein bars and pumpkin seeds for salt and to munch on and beyond that it is effort.\n\nAlso some egg bites.  Those are easy to heat and eat.", "How can you predict the onset of a flare/anaphylactic reaction? Do you get any specific symptoms? I feel like this body revving sensation and usually for a few days/weeks I just feel off.

Only Mastocytosis does. \n\nYou can research that in a plethora of sources. From technical texts to toilet door poetry.\nHere is an excerpt I copied from a blog. First(!) entry of my Google search - what a complicated Venture!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n&gt; \n\nWhat the level of tryptase in a person's blood principally reflects is simply how many mast cells the person has.\n\nA persistent large increase (&gt;20 ng/ml) is more commonly associated with mastocytosis, a rare disease featuring chronic inappropriate mast cell activation and a chronic cancerous extent of mast cell growth/proliferation.\n\nA persistent mild increase in tryptase is more commonly associated with mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), a common (or \"prevalent\") disease which features chronic inappropriate mast cell activation (i.e., inappropriate production and release of the mast cells' large menagerie of potent mediators, which upon interaction with other cells throughout the body cause most of the symptoms of mast cell disease) with little to no excess in mast cell growth.  \n\nHowever, this mild elevation of tryptase is found in only 15% of MCAS patients; the other 85% of MCAS patients have a normal tryptase level, again an indication that the principal problem in MCAS is *not* excessive growth of mast cells. &lt;\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\nHOW on earth can THE HOLY Charit\u00e9 Not know that!?\n\nOr is this financially motivated?\nIs a MCAS patient less effective in making money from than a Mastocytosis patient?\nAre they only looking for Mastocytosis patients because they are easier to cure and MCAS people destroy their good statistics?\n\n\n*And, most importantly: what can I (and people like me/us) do to get any help?*\n\nI feel like talking to myopic walls when I encounter most doctors. But there have to be exceptions out there. Doctors that actually do their research and want to help people instead of making money. Is that a too naive thing to hope for? This whole health issue is consuming so much energy. I feel so empty and misunderstood.\n\nI hope you can help me and all the others with similar issues with some advice.\n\nThank you! I have no solutions. The same exact thing happened to me at Stanford hospital. Refuses to take MCAS patients but will gladly take mastocytosis patients. I had 3 separate doctors try to get me in and they all failed. I have resorted to treating myself at this point. They give zero fucks if we live or die so I might as well give it a shot... This system is pure, inhuman cancer. \nHow Do you treat yourself and since when? How old are you and what are your symptoms? \n\nIf no one else helps us we have to help ourselves, totally agree. I came to that conclusion once in pre school and once in middle school when I was in so much agony (chronic pain, severe depression and gut issues) and no one took me seriously: \"You just want to skip your duties\" they said. -.- \n\"You cannot always be in pain, that is impossible.\", \"You are too young and healthy to have such issues, you do not know what you are talking about.\"\n\nAre not it pathetic how people cannot image things they did not experience themselves?

I am 27. Last year I lost all food tolerance and there was not a single dr locally that even really tried to help me through it. I did a trial of xolair and it ruined me. The dr who prescribed it then became very hesitant to treat me and ultimately told me I am beyond her experience. When I eat, I get vomiting, gastritis, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, rash, PVCs, tachycardia, headache, and brain fog. No matter what I eat. I am so sensitive its annoying. Same for scents except I get a migraine instead. My mcas is also triggered by the sun, exercise, and heat. I also have POTS, IST and GI dismotility. I do have appointments with Dr. Afrin still every 6 months. Its annoying because he says he will not manage your case but will do it through a local dr. I have yet to find a local doctor that actually knows what they are talking about and is more educated than myself. But he does give a nice long list of all the meds to try for MCAS. When I suddenly got really bad, I started trialing some meds by purchasing them through Japan. Ketotifen was my first unsupervised decision. Since then, I have been trialing meds from Japan that are specifically for allergic diseases and different supplements. The research there is so far more advanced than what is in the US. Ive had a lot of luck with that and am making small improvements. With more research, I found weed is a fantastic mast cell stabilizer and if I take enough antihistamines before using it I will not react to it and then it allows for tolerance of many foods and I only get flushing and tachycardia with meals. Im still not happy with where I am at though. My memory is getting worse so I am trying to find alternatives to the weed but so far no luck. My primary is trying to learn but admits she is never treated someone with this severe of a case before. I do not want to make it sound like I have no doctors though. I also have a GI, neurologist, cardiologist, and dermatologist but they all just do not know how to treat the MCAS and have tried to refer me to the individual that treats mastocytosis with no luck. I do think my efforts have really paid off though. If I had not intervened, my primary was discussing TPN as my next step as I have tried all formulas and do not tolerate a damn one but I figured out a way for myself to survive no thanks to anyone at Stanford. Have you tried checking for experienced drs on various websites?  I found one on this site \n\n\n\nMy insurance refuses to pay for them however so I am on the hunt again I had a really bad experience using that website. I went to a dr listed on there and she was incredibly confused why I thought they had more mast cell experience than Stanford. She was pretty much like we send all our complicated patients to Stanford so why the hell are you here. She wasnt even familiar with testing and even said she was going to use my records of my diagnosis from Afrin to help her going forward. So maybe someone else will benefit my dead end. That is helpful information, the woman I saw was very knowledgeable and experienced, I am surprised they would not not only vet the drs but also that it sounds like the one you saw was not even aware she was on the site Yup, did not even know she was on the website! Any of the other leads I found in my area do not accept insurance or have an annual fee as well. I found suggestions on Facebook groups that when called do not treat mast cell diseases, but i had good luck with the one I found on that site. Unfortunately looks like now I am forced to go to the only university hospital my insurance will cover, unless they refer me elsewhere, then it is back to the preauth and appeal processes I have already been through. Too bad none of the major providers will work with a single visit Auth and no tests covered without prior Auth I made the same experience at a similar German site Wow, sounds like you are also quite affected by that stuff. I also can barely eat anything. Something very simple that helped me a bit is betaine HCL. When I take it it dampens my reactions a lot. I think one of the most important reasons for food reactions is low HCL which leads to improper digestion. Also I saw a big improvement in eating as little (to no) fiber as possible. Maybe that is worth a try, if you did not test it yet, what I do not assume - but sometimes very easy things go overlooked, so better hear it twice than never.\nDid you try pure CBD instead of weed? Maybe it is less triggering and works even better, maybe not.\nI made similar experiences with doctors, it really is a mess.\nThe only doc that brought me a decent step forward was the one that diagnosed histamine. (And the one that told me my legs had a small length difference which could be fixed to help with my backpain.) Apart from that everything I learned and did to improve my condition came from myself. We are not children of the society, we are our own parents.\n\nWhat does PVC and TPN mean?\nAre you from Japan or do have friends and relatives who live there? \n\nOh, and are you also female? I am 22 btw and also lost the last bit of food tolerance last year.\n\nOur symptoms overlap quite a bit, but I have also got fibromyalgia and joint pain which is bare hell. Do you also get itchy skin, eyes and nose, Depression and Tinitus? And the painful feeling of blood clots in arms, hands, legs and feet? It is uncanny. Icecold extremities.\nNot major symptoms, but they are still annoying. I am on betaine but honestly did not notice less reactions. I might need to just pay more attention to that though. Definitely helps with absorption for me though. I do particularly bad with veggies so I hear you on the low fiber. \n\nSurprisingly cbd does absolutely nothing for me. Its the thc that helps me.\n\nPVC- premature ventricular contration. Aka its an arrhythmia that feels like your heart skipped a beat. \nTPN is IV nutrition. \n\nIve got no ties to Japan but just had a curiosity after learning about ketotifen and them seeming to be further along in the research than the US. \n\nI am female. Like most of us! :)\n\nI do get really itchy mostly on my arms though. Sleeping me LOVES to itch and break the skin. Awake me not a fan! I am constantly cold too. I thankfully do not have many joint issues. Just my wrist and tmj is a problem. The problem is that MCAS is not recognized by the World Health Organization. Several doctors are trying to get it recognized. Dr Afrin is not taken seriously because his symptom list is too broad and contradictory. So far, the consensus has gone with Dr Akins recommendations. Many allergists are familiar with the condition and they are treating it, even without it being recognized as an \u201dactual\u201d disorder.\nEither way, there are diagnostic criteria proposed. \nAn elevated tryptase with flare and mediators in the urine. That should get someone is attention, if you can get them to order the tests.\nGood Luck! My hematologist said it will show in a bone marrow biopsy. Thank you! :)\n\nOuch, TMJ, I feel you. Did you know about the connection? \n\nWhat kind of med-recommendations did you hear about?\n\nI made a list with supplements and med which I heard of:\n(Not sure if the names are written correctly as some of the are from podcasts)\n\nCyrtec, pepsid, vastrocrom, singulair, celecoxib\n\nBetaine (provides choline, mast cell activation pathway, acidify the gut)\n\nL glutamine\n\nIgG protect (leaky gut)\n\nZinc carnosine (leaky gut)\n\nHorse chestnut seed extract\n\nIndole 3 carbinol\n\nStreptochlorin\n\nMarine actinomycetes\n\nMestadon\n\nMetformin?\n\nMagnesium, Zink und Kupfer\n\nsodium cromglycate\n\nBenadryl (sadating)\n\nHydroxyzin\n\nLaratidine/cleratine (non sedating)\n\nZertec(h1)\n\nLivozatyrosyn(h1)\n\nZantac (h2)\n\nCetirizin, Loratadin oder Diphenhydramin\n\nNatrium cabonicum (Indigestion)\n\nPhosphor, calcium, zink, magnesium , b12, iron to boost DAO\n\nOral chromoline , octo chromoline, nebuliser chromoline Well, the symptoms ARE contradictory by nature, that is the issue... \ud83e\udd14 \nI am pretty sure my progesterone is going to be high (that is what you meant by mediators, right?)\n\nThank you for your explanation :) Often enough it does not show, even in bilateral BMB.\n\nSource: Dr Ruscio podcast with Dr. Afrin I think you mean prostaglandins. That is also mastocytosis. Whoops brain-fog, of course I do! Thx The symptoms should not be contradictory. Disorders have a specific symptom list, otherwise, you do not have a definable disorder. \n\nConsider hypertension, for example. It is defined by elevated blood pressure. You cannot then say that it also means hypotension or low blood pressure. That is contradictory. You also cannot claim that it causes toe pain, because hypertension cannot do that. \n\nAfrin\u2019s symptom list is ridiculously broad and contradictory. It is vague and broad, basically covering nearly every symptom known to humankind. \n\nMediator release causes specific symptoms. If what we experience cannot be caused by mediator release, then we are looking in the wrong direction. Well, yes. Hypo-/hypertension is a good example. If there is a disorder in the system it can vary a lot inter- &amp; intrapersonal. That means one person could be hypo, the other hyper. Or the same person is hypo one day and hyper the next. As far as I know that is quite characteristic for Mastcelldisease.\n\nAlso I have to argue against what you said regarding the 'toe pain':\n\n&gt; \"You also cannot claim that it causes toe pain, because hypertension cannot do that.\"\n\n&lt;\nActually, yes. Hypertension and thrombosis are quite related. (Very easy to research.)\nAnd thrombosis can lead to toe pain if you get clotting in the feet, which is very likely.\n\nHow would you state the contrary? Not quite. It is not characteristic to have contradictory symptoms. That is my point regarding Afrin\u2019s \u201cresearch.\u201d It is contradictory and you will not find a doctor that takes it seriously.  Dr Dempsey is no better, often citing \u201cchronic Lyme\u201d as a cause. The medical community does not recognize chronic Lyme.\nGet tested for the mediators and go from there. Yes, mediators are important but I do not see the main point as wrong. That would be like saying: manic depression is not a symptom of mental illness because you either have to be depressed OR manic.\nNo one would say that.\n\nAnd what about the thrombosis statement? Bipolar disorder is known for discordant mood states, which is characteristic of the disorder. Contrary symptoms in MCAS is not characteristic because mediators can only cause specific symptoms. They literally can not cause all symptoms. Obviously, you have something going on, but if it changes frequently and is contradictory, you may not have MCAS. As far as I know mediators can be out of whack. High on on one day low one the other. \nA good metaphor/comparison would be: your adrenals create a lot of stress hormones one day because your nervous system is chronically irritated. That means it used up all it is resources and cannot produce any for the next few days. If it loaded up on enough new resources it produces too much again. Until there is a lack again... And so forth.\n\nWhat do you think about that theory regarding mast cell symptoms?\n\n\nAnd what could people have that evokes this symptoms but which is not MCAS? Oops-I am not talking about mediators being up one day and down the next. That will vary depending on trigger exposure.\n\nThere are A LOT of diseases/disorders that cause \u201cmast cell\u201d symptoms, other than MCAS. No, but I did to explain the contradictory symptoms.\n\nWhat conditions for instance? That would be very interesting/important to know? :) The list of differential diagnosis is too long to list here, but I will include a link. The medical community has accepted Dr Cem Akins recommendations in a consensus statement.\nIn my own case, my doctors ruled out hyperthyroidism, vitamin deficiencies, auto immune disorders, asthma, allergy, anemia, hypoglycemia, anxiety, arrhythmia, carcinoid syndrome, and more before diagnosing me with MCAS.\n( Regarding hypertension and thrombosis leading to toe pain. There is no consistent data linking high blood pressure to deep vein thrombosis. Further, deep vein thrombosis does not cause toe pain. It is in a deep vein. May cause leg pain, but you are really reaching here. \n\nUltimately, it does not matter what I think. You have self diagnosed MCAS using criteria that is not even accepted in the medical community. In the mean time, you are probably missing what may actually be going on with you by focusing on something your doctors do not even think you have. \n\nI wish you well. My GP told me that a lot of allergists do not have a lot of patients these days due to the pandemic and recommended someone to me who is thorough and has a good bedside manner. I was not expecting them to have MCAS knowledge too but they do! I think working with a doctor is important for a couple reasons, 1) they can help you plan your treatment \u201cexperiments\u201d more seriously and scientifically than most people typically can do on their own by just bouncing around on your own, and 2) if you need to have epipens and end up needing to use them, and in the ER, you want to have someone to call who is familiar with your mast cell struggles. I strongly recommend avoiding handling it all on your own and ordering medicines from internet pharmacies etc! Also suggest having a therapist - a sympathetic ear can help you think clearly and plan your own treatment better. I know, it is crazy- many well educated immunologists also cling to this useless test in the USA as well and it is so frustrating!  But you are in Germany- maybe you can find some recommendations from the institutes in Bonn, many published papers rated to mast cell diseases from there. Thank you, I did not think of that yet! I am so sorry :( \n\nCan you please elaborate on what Xolair did to you?\n\nAlso for anyone wondering I see dr Al Hirdt in NY and he is amazing. The best. And takes insurance It increased my sensitivity to all foods and meds. I do not actually tolerate any food anymore. I react to everything. I was already a severe case and xolair really pissed off my mast cell and made it 100x worse. The meal after my fisrt injection was not on the scale that I had previously been dealing with. My reactions are just much more intense now. Omg I am so so so sorry to hear that :( that is horrible. Thanks for sharing. I have yet to try Xolair. I really hope you find something to help you improve.

A catheter was used during surgery. \n\nThe first three days were pretty okay. But on the third I experienced extreme urethral burning. It is not a UTI, I had it checked.\n\nIt is my urethral sphincter causing the pain, but why was there a three day delay? I am not officially diagnosed so cannot get any prescription strength meds. Benedryl helps a lot, but it is struggling and I have never had to wait so long for it to start helping. Claritin, zyrtec, and tagamet do not seem to have an effect. \n\nWhich sort of histamine causes urethral spasms? Prostaglandins? I read aspirin can help, but I am extremely afraid of flaring myself worse.. what brand of aspirin is safest for us?\n\nHow long will this last for? Also I experienced extreme dizziness when the pain started. It is not the first time I became very dizzy during a bladder flare. Have you tried those Azo pills that turn your urine orange? They help my mast cell related bladder pain. They do not help me much because my pain is muscular rather than the internal tissue. Valium helps.    Could it be inflammation from the catheter itself causing a little bit of injury to the urethra or from your surgery itself? That alone will cause mast cells to be released.\n\n\n\nI am sorry you are going through all that pain love. \n\nI am not to familiar with aspirin but I do know that Aspirin blocks production of prostaglandin D2. Usually it helps with flushing. But i have never used it as most otc pain medications make me feel worse. So I have been scared to try. I usually take CBD up to 100-200mg and it helps most pain I have. \n\nUnfortunately I do not know what else would help but time, heat packs and the Benadryl/Valium. I hope this all clears up soon the more you heal from your surgery. Best wishes on your recovery! xx Usually irritation from a catheter only lasts about 48 hours and my symptoms started after that. BUT, the worst of the inflammation from surgery starts about 3 days afterwards which is around when the pain started, so I am wondering if the general inflammation from all over could cause the pelvic floor pain.\n\nI am very afraid of OTC meds too for the same reasons. I am also afraid of the pain meds they prescribed because it has Tylenol in it. Thank you for your reply! Benedryl. My bladder and uretha swell often due to MCAS, even had to have my bladder drained by my doc once because it was so inflamed. 50 mg of benedryl really helps with the pain caused from the inflammation.\nI am so sorry, get better soon! Thank you! Benedryl has been one of my rescue drugs for awhile, but strangely was not working yesterday. It helped my pain a lot today.", "What is your symptoms &amp; 100% safe foods?  In my case, I feel fatigue, muscle pain, tendon and joint pain, headache, dizziness, heart palptitation and extreme depressiveness 30min\\~1hour after taking foods.\n\nWhen I take new supplements, I got tearing pain on my joints&amp;tendons,swelling neck and heart palpitation.\n\nI could not find any 100% safe food yet. I thought rice, sweet potatoes, fish and some veges were fine to me, but it was not.\n\nI am Korean, and in Korea, there is too little information. I can sure 'no information'. I want to hear you guy's stories and safe foods.\n\nThank you. Fresh beef and lamb, dayfresh fish, cooked cruciferous veggies and zucchini fresh beef means slaugthered and eaten at same day? No, I am usually fine with eating meat that has hung for maturing. But I need to eat it right after purchasing, not leave it in the fridge till expiration date. Organic, antibiotic free? or just normal meat? Normal meat in Scandinavia = antibiotc free Look up 'high histamine foods' and 'low histamine foods'. That has helped me a ton.\n\nSometimes if I eat an allergen my throat gets scratchy and I cough a bit, other times I can feel very hot, my stomach feels like I ingested a ton of bricks and I want to vomot. It really seems to depend on the allergen. I have pretty much your same reaction to foods. Chicken is about the only meat I can safely eat. I think I would be ok with other poultry, but I have not tried yet. Also, do not eat leftovers if you can avoid it. I will sometimes eat leftover chicken up to one day later without issues, but I throw it away after that. \n\nI can also eat cucumbers, zucchini, apples, honeydew melon, green plantains, onions, carrots, and broccoli. I cannot eat any grains at all. I can eat very small amounts of sweet potato. I notice that almost anything will cause a reaction if I eat too much of it. That sounds really ideal. My reactions involve contaminants in foods.  That is to say my reactions involve something that gets into the food externally rather than something that is produced by the food.  What works best for me is buying food staples (rice, beans, lentils, flour, etc.) in bulk - 5-10 kg bags.  If a particular bag of food does not bother me, then I keep it sealed in an air tight container and use it to make my meals.  If something I buy bothers me, I donate it or give it to friends/family.  \n\nAt times my tap water has been bad for me.  Other times the air around the house would get bad for long periods of time.  Which could confuse someone who is trying to figure out how their triggers work.  Who would suspect a contaminant getting into their tap water or seeping into the house through the cracks in the windows which is then absorbed into foods.\n\nAlso, I have become so sensitive  I can feel a reaction in my lungs if the back of my hand is near something that will trigger a reaction.  I can use this ability to search for safe foods at the market. My 100% safe foods are: beef, chicken, turkey, uncured pork (no ham!!! And bacon isnt 100% safe either as curing makes them not safe).  All organic because I need them antibiotic free.\n\nPotatoes used to be on that list.  But I am no longer as certain as I used to be.  I am starting to have issues when I eat them if they are fried.  Even if I am doing the frying myself at home. \n\nI have a long list of foods that are \"iffy\" foods I tolerate without symptoms on a good day.  But cannot have much of, and do not dare risk if I am feeling off at all.\n\nAs for symptoms.  Brain fog, fatigue, itching, dermatographia (it breaks through the antihistamines whenever I am in a bad flare), vertigo (especially positional vertigo), abdominal pain, difficulty breathing, diarrhea, my EoE flares up too. Occasionally nausea or vomiting but that *might* be my EoE.   Anxiety.  Feeling of impending doom. (Makes the anxiety look like it is a firecracker compared to a ~~nuke~~ world ending explosion.  It is impossible to really describe), irritability/anger/rage, depression, anhedonia (the inability to feel pleasure or happiness),  Blood pressure rises, then drops.  Occasionally visible flushing but usually my neck and face just feel hot.  Sweating and chills, migraines, and persistent overheating.  And during my most severe flares or anaphylaxis I get this really weird thing where the moment I shut my eyes I am starting to dream.  But it is all nightmare.  Sleep state is not required.  Only present with ongoing feeling of impending doom.  \n\nNot all of my symptoms are present at all times or in response to all foods or triggers.  A lot of my airborne triggers just trigger migraines and difficulty breathing (my asthma flares up).  \n\nIf I was to eat some red vines licorice, I would experience immediate difficulty swallowing (EoE), followed by pretty significant irritability and anxiety for 8-12 hours.  Possibly with a mild headache but not usually.  And I would be stuck with anhedonia for a day or so. \n\nSome triggers on the other hand have left me in an anaphylactic flare, barely conscious, sweating and freezing, flushing, severe migraine, vertigo, pretty much chained to the toilet unable to risk being more than 30 seconds away from it, feeling like the entire world was about to end, unable to escape from the nightmares should I shut my eyes for even a second.  The worst parts lasted 8-10 hours.  The mental symptoms afterwards (*severe* anhedonia, anxiety, and depression) lasted for weeks afterwards.  Same with the GI flare.  Before I realised this was still anaphylaxis (despite a lack of significant difficulty breathing) I thought I was going crazy. Here is a helpful food list for histamine.\n\n My reactions have changed over time. I used to get dizziness, diarrhea, vomiting, fainting, etc. Now it is mostly migraines, fatigue, muscle pain and weakness. I cannot say i have any 100% safe foods, but I eat a fairly varied diet. Mostly paleo.", "Stopping Nalcrom / Cromolyn / Sodium Cromoglycate - Stores? Experiences? Hi all,  \nI am about to stop taking Nalcrom after taking it at 400mg/day since September 2019.  \n(before anyone asks, yes I have docs approval etc etc)  \n\nAnyone have any experiences to share? When I stopped, I had burning pain in my stomach for a while. I took slippery elm to help. I get a rush of symptoms when I forget it. I am constantly sick after eating. I do not have advice or experience with this but I would eventually like to taper off some of my medications. Are you replacing it with something else or are you dialing back on medications generally? If it is the latter, if you do not mind me asking, how did you and your doctor decide it was safe to do? Are you going to gradually decrease or are you just going to stop taking it one day? Neurological issues came back within a week. Gut issues came back in a month or two. I have been taking it since September 2019; and to be honest it never really helped my symptoms that much.  \nOn the other hand, my red blood cells, hematocrit, and hemoglobin levels have all been dropping since, and have just crossed the threshhold into anemia.  \nOn the other hand; many of my food reactions STARTED after taking Nalcrom.  \nBefore that most of my triggers were environmental.  \n\nAdd all of that up, on top of recently having major gastritis, and learning that Nalcrom lowers stomach acid by ~40% and has equivalet action to ranitidine for lowering stomach acide, and I have the situation where I appear to have gotten worse on the Nalcrom; and have a reason that fits - low stomach acid causing lack of absorption, essentially slowly starving me of nutrients over time hence the blood markers, as well as improperly digested food getting into my gut and causing food reactions, and ultimately over a long time setting my stomach up for gastritis.  \nI even got SIBO whilst on the Nalcrom; and low stomach acid is a risk factor for SIBO.  \n\nOf course; all this would assume I am on the low side of stomach acid production naturally - so the effect stacks causing me problems.  \nFor people with high stomach acid, the Nalcrom would help bring things down to manageable levels.  \n\nSo safe to do is kind of a relative term.  \nI never noticed much going ON the Nalcrom; I have still had issues all the way through my time on it; and so do not have much reason to expect a major issue getting off it. That would be gastric rebound, as cromolyn inhibits stomach acid to the same level as ranitidine does. It is  a crime that they do not list this as a side effect on the fact-sheets - because it is a large effect and people using cromolyn need to be aware of it/take it into account. Oh wow - so sorry you went through all that. They tried putting me on cromolyn and I reacted poorly to it Immediately, so I am on ketotifen for a mast cell stabilizer. I was having lots of very severe food reactions prior. That is interesting they put you on that without food reactions, had not heard of that. Well I did have food reactions. But I think they were different to the kind of food reactions I developed after Nalcrom.  \n\nThere was the 'fast' kind - the kind where as soon as I swallow something (or even put it in my mouth sometimes), I start reacting. That was the MCAS I believe.  \n\nHowever I developed another kind of 'slow' food reaction that would happen maybe 30 mins after I ate the food, and would last 24hr.  \nThat was after the Nalcrom started. Oh ok, I misunderstood your previous message. I hope you figure out what works for you and start feeling better soon! \n\nWas wondering about your story because I am doing so much better one year on, that I was hoping with another year or so I might be able to roll off my medications as well. I do not have any negative side effects from them except weight gain. Any update? I have been trying to decrease myself (very slowly, 2ml/week (a little less than half a vial)) and it is been going horribly :( I cold turkey'd it.  \nThe next day I had extreme agitation, anxiety, anger, emotional issues.\nBy night time I was feeling happy and some joy, which I have not felt in months.  \n\nThen I went through a few days of having major histamine reactions to food - feeling spaced out and underwater after eating.  \n\nThen I started getting ADHD and overstimulation.  \nTurns out I had to lower my L-Tyrosine dosage because I think my nutrient absorption is getting better without the Nalcrom.  \n\nMy sleeping has improved, I am able to get up in the morning now.  \nMy blood tests show my nutrition levels are going up and my anemia markers are going down.  \nI FEEL better.  \n\nAll in all, Nalcrom stole 19 months of my life, gave me chronic malnutrition, anemia, SIBO, constipation, food reactions and sensitivities, gastritis, a duodenal ulcer, depression, chronic fatigue, anhedonia - as well as tens of thousands of dollars on consultations, tests, and supplements to try and figure out what was making me sick and fix the problems Nalcrom was causing.   \n\nIt is a crime that the stomach acid inhibiting effect of Nalcrom is not listed clearly as a side effect. Thanks for your detailed response.\n\nSo sorry you went through this, but glad to know things are getting better off it.", "Move to where I am reactive or stay with reluctant hosts? So I found out I was allergic to my new apartment. Like, I do not go into anaphylaxis but I could not move much while there and was falling behind in classes and only really able to feed myself each day. Luckily my boyfriends parents live in this state too so they offered a room for me. Unluckily I do not actually know them that well. When the dad offered he also said that he felt like they had to offer. Like they were held hostage by their morals because I was suffering so they had to help. I feel pretty bad about that. \n\nI ended up taking them up on the offer but I feel like I am supposed to be more considerate? I have only been here a couple days but it would be nice to be here two weeks, long enough to find a new place maybe. But will I ruin my relationship with them? I just do not know what to do. My current plan is to go back to reactive place on Friday but I am second guessing myself due to it being extremely awful. How can I gauge how long is too long when they feel they have to say yes? I do not know anything about your life, but my experience with living places I react to is that the longer I am there, the less ability I have to move somewhere else, no matter how badly I need to.\n\nStaying for a bit in a car, a tent, even on the street might do more to preserve your abilities and momentum than going back to a place that causes symptoms, depending how severe they are. (Pre-COVID I would have also said a shelter, but you would have to judge the level of risk for your situation--being on immunosuppressants, I do not think it is an option for me anymore.) \n\nIf it seems like you could stay where you are for a bit, I would gratefully accept the offer--just line up your next place ASAP, and be a really great houseguest. If you can cook and clean, people are much less likely to be frustrated with you staying around. Hi, OP. This sounds like a really tough situation. I would absolutely stay where you are until you can find a place that does not trigger your symptoms. Even if you are not getting along well with your boyfriend's parents, I would hope that they do not want you living somewhere that makes you extremely ill. \n\nIf you have not already, is there any way that you can sit down with them and explain how you are feeling\u2014e.g., \"I am so grateful for you giving me somewhere to stay while I am looking for a new place. I do not want to impose, so is there any way that I can help out while I am here?\" If they are being unpleasant to you, can your boyfriend step in to help establish some boundaries?\n\nGoing back to a place where you have to self-harm to be at all functional should be off the table except as a very last resort. I am going to be honest. I do not think under any circumstances you should move into the apartment. I made that mistake and am trying to get out of it. It had made my life so so so much worse. \n\nWe felt obligated to accept an apartment that I was reacting to (I think the carpet?) because we needed financial help.  We cleaned the carpet many times and house but I am still reacting. Not wheezing all the time life before but still . \n\nBut reacting to the apartment was not where it ended, it was where it began! It bumps your histamine up so that of ALL of my food reactions got worse. I am much more disabled overall as a result. I have very, very few foods I can eat right now. Ive had to take a lot more medicine overall (basically everything that is recommended except I have not started quercetin due to allergies to all the sources and I do also take benedryll, which I know people avoid) which is probably contributing to exhaustion. I am starting an inhaled powder steroid my asthma became so bad. \n\nJust honestly. I do not know you. But this was such a huge mistake for both me and my family. Like ok yes I reacted to the apartment. But because it was constant, I started reacting to foods I can normally eat fine! And then fewer foods means less energy, maybe more effort to cook foods, or just exhaustion at only eating the same few foods. Low energy from maybe not getting enough nutrients or nutrients coming from a vitamin and not whole foods . Exhaustion coming from an increase in antihistamine usage. Side effects from using my inhaler (I have to use a special one that increases my chance of a urinary tract infection). Side effects of having to use a steroid (headaches for me). \n\nAnd exhaustion means you need more physical help with chores or whatever. More sleep. More rest. You accomplish less in terms of work or school or childcare or chores. \n\nI am just honestly trying to help any and everyone prevent what my family has had to go through this past month.\n\n\nEdit: also: that dad might just not have social skills. He might not have been being passive aggressive. Like he could have meant it nicely and just botched the delivery if he is awkward or weird like 90% of dads. Or was just randomly babbling because he is awkward and trying to make conversation. I would at least talk to them. Get out of your lease and look for a new place.  The logistics are something you will need to work out. Find a quick sublease. Stay with the parents. \n\nThe more reactions you have the worse they will get ( generally). \n\nMy advice for getting along with bf's parents:  \nstay on the same or similar enough sleep schedule, spend as little time in the bathroom as possible. Help out whenever possible, and find ways to be out of the house as much as possible.   \n\n\nBut the first one is the most important. When you live with other people, the number one thing that drives people to irrational hate is differing sleep schedules.", "Has anyone done a FMT? Im convinced that my MCAS has been caused by years and years of antibiotic usage and was wondering if anyone has undergone FMT and if it helped in any way? I have wondered the same thing. My mcas really started to show after having to be on antibiotics for months. Gut pro is something I have been supplementing lately to see if that makes any difference. I was considering flying to a clinic in the U.K. last year to have this done in a professional setting, seems like it could be a huge help. I found this video that goes into the microbiome and food allergy connection. Definitely has a connection!\n\n( I think MCAS is genetic, could be wrong, but I have had it since infancy. Now it can be aggravated by stuff, so it is not crazy to work on improving your gut health.\n\nIf you think your gut was damaged there are a bunch of things you can try:\n\n- Zinc l-carnosine (PepZinGI). This worked for me when almost nothing else did. After a couple of months I felt so much better.\n- Good Belly probiotic drinks. This also helped my gut issues immensely. I have tried a lot of probiotics, this was the only one that worked.\n- Quite possible you have candida, even though this is considered a quack diagnosis. I did the whole candida thing decades ago, back then I took pau d'arco capsules and they worked really well for me. There are more options now. This is a big topic, I will not go into it here, check into it on your own.\n- L-glutamine powder, an important nutrient for healing the gut. Not sure that it helped me but I did take it for a couple of months.\n- I tried a bunch of natural things like aloe, slippery elm, marshmellow, DGL, etc... did not really help.\n- Bone broth and gelatin and collagen are supposed to be good, I have not really noticed that they help.\n\nCheck out /r/HumanMicrobiome, FMT is discussed there quite a bit.", "Looking for brands of varied vitamins/ supplements that people have used and like I am hoping for some help in finding vitamin brands that are suitable for us MCAS people.  I see a lot of recommendations on vitamins but I am looking for specific brands for those vitamins that people have had good luck with, and do not trigger mast cell symptoms.  \n\n\nI have some mainstays that I love.  Doctors Best Q Vitamin C is fantastic.  I love Jarrow Formula\u2019s Krill Oil for inflammation.  Ancestral Supplements kidney/ DAO.  Country Life Rutin is decent but I would rather find a Quercetin or EMIQ that would be a better mast cell stabilizer.  I use to love Natural Factors Quercetin / EMIQ but it gives me a bad reaction now, and I noticed they added microcrystalline cellulose.  Which is not tolerable for mast cell people depending on where it is sourced from.\n\nI have been losing too much hair lately, thinking from not having as good and varied diet which I am trying to change.  But looking supplement with these vitamins to seem to help loss:\n-Zinc\n-Vitamin A\n-Vitamin E\n-Biotin\n-Any of the B vitamins\n-Iron\n-Selenium\n-Keratin\n-Magnesium (threonate sounds like the best form for MCAS)\n\nI am also looking for a new Vitamin D as Nature Made changed their ingredients on it and now gives me a bad reaction.  \n\nI also am looking for supplements good for MCAS.  I came across this website that has supplements and mast cell stabilizers ranked on how well they help MCAS patients.  Recommended from Dr. Brian Bouch, \u201ca leading integrative medical doctor from California\u201d.  I do not know enough about him but the recommendations seem solid. \n\nThey recommended in their main A group: \n-Quercetin  (looking for this or the better absorbed/ bioavailable EMIQ form)\n-Green Tea/ EGCG (I guess green tea extract could have EGCG?)\n-Curcumin \n-Chamomile tea (I had a bad reaction to one before, I might try Chamomile extract someday)\n-Resveratrol \n(They also list DAO and Vit C in the best supplement group but I do not need those)\n-Luteolin (in their B group but I have always wanted to try this one as a compliment stabilizer to Quercetin)\n\nHere is the website I found with above info if anyone is interested:\n\n\nAnd also looking for Glutamine to heal possible leaky gut \n\nIf anyone has specific brands of any of the supplements above that they are able to tolerate well I would very much appreciate any suggestions.  \nAny other supplement suggestion/ brand not above I would appreciate as well.  \n  I have read some MCAS people on one of the subreddits have decent luck with a multi vitamin or even a prenatal vitamin, if any of you tolerate those and can share the brand that would be awesome.  I appreciate any info or tips, thanks! Superior Source is great. They have a whole range of specially formulated lozenge format supplements that use no additives and absorb in your mouth so do not require absorption in the gut. Pure Encapsulations is a brand that I trust and use for a lot of supplements.  I do not believe I have ever reacted to anything by them.  I regularly take their Zinc, Biotin, and B-Complex.  I am sure that they would have some of the other vitamins that you are looking for as well.  I do also take the Magnesium threonate, but the brand of that one is Double Wood Supplements.  I have not tried anything else by them besides the magnesium. Thank you for the suggestion.  They almost seem perfect, though I did see that they have acacia gum.  Which is a liberator according to the histamine diet list (on the bottom by food additives):\n\n\n\nI wonder if taking it sublingual helps avoid that trigger?   I might give it a shot to test.  Thank you Thank you.  I am going to go check those out.  I appreciate it! If it is just acting as a liberator I would imagine that is quantity specific, unlike mast cell triggers - so I would think it would be OK.  \n\nI have never had a problem with them - but I cannot say for sure nobody else would. Its probably worth a shot to test one out and see how it goes.  Thanks for the suggestion \ud83d\udc4d", "Unpopular opinion about masks triggers an explosion of hate So I decided to comment on a sarcastic cartoon about covid spreading because some people do not wear masks.\n\nSimply put shortly, stating that ANY disease, illness or disability exists that can give an individual the right for medical exemption to wear a mask is met with extreme hatred, demonizing and of course, being told no such condition exists, and if it does we who have it should be confined to our houses.\n\nDo any of you have medical exemption in your country, and does a mask cause you problems?\n\nIts so different for each for us and we do not all have the same reactions or allergies. I for one get very sick wearing a mask, however there is no medical exemption in my country so I often DO stay at home.\n\nHow are you doing during this pandemic? I am not quite sure what your point is. There are very few medical exceptions to avoid wearing a mask in today's pandemic and anyone arguing that they do not \"need\" one or \"cannot wear one\" should absolutely be home and away from others until the CDC states otherwise. There have been tons of idiots out there throughout the pandemic getting others sick through pure negligence of not wearing a mask when necessary, so I can see why many strangers on the internet are adamant about wearing one - even if the discussion is through a joke or cartoon. Unless your lungs are literally failing there is no reason you cannot wear a mask. I get what you are saying. I do not have a medical exemption but I do have MCAD, which causes severe shortness of breath at times especially during a flare. I do not have the option to simply stay home, and still have to wear a mask out which sometimes makes me gasp for air and I suck the mask into my face so hard. It really sucks having to wear a mask, but I just minimize going places to avoid this. Check the comment history. They are just looking for validation after being heavily downvoted for saying masks do not work. \nThey edited their first comment, but I remember the sentence being (slightly paraphrased)\n\n \"If the employees are wearing masks but the customer is not, they should not be able to get covid.\" \n\nWhich is of course patently false and shows a fundamental misunderstanding of how masks work. Wow some people are asses. Not here for validation, but did actually want to enquire who else has struggles with the same conditions. And if you quote one part of my conversation out of context why not just quote all of it? I believe I did correct the misperception most of you got from my initial post on a meme subreddit by explaining what I meant.  I am not going to have you come here and throw your accusations and punches again. I have already removed the post since it was misunderstood and I got pounced on like I was a murderer. &gt;And if you quote one part of my conversation out of context why not just quote all of it?\n\nBecause you erased it, dummy. \n\n\n &gt;I believe I did correct the misperception most of you got from my initial post on a meme subreddit by explaining what I meant.\n\nYou keep harping on a misconception but no one misunderstood you. We just vehemently disagree with you. \n\n\n &gt;I am not going to have you come here and throw your accusations and punches again. \n\nWell you cannot really stop me, can you? \n\n&gt;I have already removed the post since it was misunderstood and I got pounced on like I was a murderer. \n\nGoing around in public without a mask can spread deadly diseases like covid to those most vulnerable to it, and covid can kill these people. \n\nConsidering the fact that many people have had loved ones die of covid, it is pretty understandable that they might have some anger or disdain towards someone who excuses people who do not wear masks. \n\n\nIf you have so many medical issues that wearing a mask would potentially cause you death, covid definitely will; so I do not know why the fuck you would go out anyway. \n\nYou claim bullshit like that it is your God-given right to walk in a grocery store without a mask, and it is not.  Stop trying to play the misunderstood victim. You are the well-understood, and thus disliked, asshole. Was I supposed to \"have a point\"? My questions were clear and simple and not attacking, why am I getting this attitude?  Do you have mask exemption in your country and does your mcas cause difficulties or problems for you when you wear a mask? It is called a conversation, it does not need a political agenda. Forgive my anger but Im done getting bullied for stating there ARE cases of medical exemption for mask wearing. &gt;ARE cases of medical exemption for mask wearing\n\nAccording to who? Like what public agency has listed real, excusable reasons for not wearing a mask in a public place? &gt; Was I supposed to \"have a point\"?\n\nNo, clearly not.\n\n&gt; My questions were clear and simple and not attacking, why am I getting this attitude?\n\nYou are not. I mean, now you are but it is clear you are just upset that I did not say \"omg you are so right and smarter than all those other people!!!\". Get over yourself.\n\n&gt; It is called a conversation, it does not need a political agenda. Forgive my anger but Im done getting bullied for stating there ARE cases of medical exemption for mask wearing.\n\nI literally said there are medical exceptions, albeit very, very, very few. Stop acting like no one believes you that there are exceptions. The issue is that people are blowing it out of proportion as an excuse to not wear a mask at all in public, which to be honest is what it looks like you are doing here. Pathetic. And it is not anger, it is just pure ignorance. You are forgiven, though... just this once. What a dumbass this person is. Antagonizes a bunch of strangers with anti-mask rhetoric and then runs off to a rare disease subreddit for technical validation regarding us as \"exceptions\". Disgustingly dumb. What is your damn problem? For someone stating he is not attacking or having an attitude towards me you are not very convincing. Going so far as to call me pathetic? I was not the one who started the conversation with \"what is your point?\". My god, the delusion is strong with you. How about this - do not reply to my original comment like a fucking babysitter telling me to watch my attitude and reminding me what a \"conversation\" is. Keep your ego in check and you will not be so \"confused\" why people are giving you \"problems\". I also said I do not understand your point, I did not say \"what is your point\" to antagonize you like you are disingenuously implying. No need to lie. Hope that helps.\n\nOh, and please wear a mask. You are the one who got offended by me RESPONDING to your comment. And how I interpret what you say is not up for your conclusions and namecalling. I think you mistook the comment reply button for a mirror.

I think because it is not sliding around like the smaller masks it is far less irritating and it does not aggravate my mast cell as much. \n\nI put that sucker on before I leave the house and I run out to do errands for hours without taking it off. I also have panic attacks that are debilitating as well so that also causes a lack of feeling like I can easily breathe but it is just a matter of finding a mask that works well for you. I started off the pandemic custom making all kinds of them at home by myself and I cannot even sew- I just kept using pipe cleaners to line the edges so I could frame it to my face and then safety pins to clip the edges instead of sewing, and really only cotton works for me because everything else I find very aggravating. \n\nI feel like a year into this already, if you have not found one that works for you, you are not really trying. You just do not want to wear one. I was literally pulling apart towels, t-shirts, sheets (because I am poor and could not afford a good professionally sewn cotton mask for months) inside of my home to figure out what worked for me. Once I did I went through all of last summer with no problem, and my heart rate skyrockets and I pass out in the heat, so that is really saying something.", "Has anyone had any experience with Dr. Anne Maitland? If so how was it? Do you think it helped? Would you recommend it to others? What all was involved? i have seen her all over YouTube she seems very smart.", "Tryptase? Is Tryptase the only measure for Mast Cell? Mast cell what? MCAS, SM, CM, mastocytic enterocolitis?", "CT Scan dye I just had a CT scan for my abdomen/pelvic area and when I was leaving to my car, I had two very large hives that swelled on my face. I also was recently diagnosed is MCAD so is this normal for others? Or should I be worried? My blood pressure skyrocketed 2 seconds after the dye injection. A nurse was called in and and she checked my blood pressure. It was very high and would not go down. They called an ambulance which took me to hospital. I was having rigors (like smaller epileptic twitching) from it as well. This was what I now know to have been an anaphylactic reaction. I was told 'no one ever reacts to this dye, I dont know why you are reacting maybe you are nervous' by the staff of course as they like to play that card. I am an incredibly calm individual when not having a mast cell attack. This was before I knew I had MCAS. People DO react to dye. It is well documented. Its a toxin and not everybody can handle the load especially with immune issues like mast cell.", "Burning, splotchy hands amd feet, indentations in the skin...does anyone have this? Hey everyone.  I have been working with doctors for months now trying to figure out what has happened to me.   After a injury in August while lifting weights and coming off pepcid after 3 months I started to get violently ill.   I had the worst abdominal pain of my life and it felt like I was going into shock.   Went to ER, had colonoscopy done and endo and everything was basically clear besides some reflux.   Went back on the pepcid per doctors and GI at 30mg in the evening. \n\nI seemed to stabilize and went to see a GI doctor.  He said I was basically somatic and had ibs and gave me some probiotics.  I tried taking the a few times but they made me feel absolutely awful (kind of like the flu).  I brought this up to him but he basically said it was impossible.  I never had a issue with probiotics in the past.  At this time I also could not eat yogurt without immediately having a bowel movement.\n\nFast forward a month and I started to taper the pepcid down this time... The first time I just stopped taking it because the doctor said there would be no issues.  I started having weird symptoms of burning in my hands, dizziness, and now my hands and feet get all splotchy which looks like dysautonomous dysfunction.  \n\nCurrently my hands now hurt so bad and get indentations in them like socks on an ankle with anything I touch or hold.  My feet are splotchy unless I put them up and so are my hands.  My HR is all over the place and I have had some episodes of my face turning completely red.   Does anyone share any of these symptoms?  I have seen every specialist in the book and have gotten nowhere over the last few months.  I do not know if my illness is related to neuropathy from something or what is going on.   If anyone has experienced anything similar it might help me seek the proper treatment and help a lot.   Sorry for the long post. The flushing, fast heart rate, abdominal pain, and reaction to yogurt/certain probiotics are all things I have experienced, but I personally have not dealt with burning hands, and I usually only see splotchiness when I am exposed to heat. \n\nIs your blood pressure normal? If it is running low and you have not seen a cardiologist for possible POTS/dysautonomia, that might be a way to get at least some of your symptoms dealt with. Yea this sounds like Some form of dysautonomia. I have POTS and get the same symptoms but there are a few forms of POTS. Have you gotten a COVID test recently? Might want to run this by your doc cuz Covid can present in odd ways and it is better safe than sorry. Also do you have a connective tissue disorder or no? I injured myself weightlifting in July and around the same time i stopped taking pepcid which was given to me after my gallbladder surgery in March.   I got really sick with yellow bowel movements for like a month and then in September all this stuff started.   My Injury actually still persists and wonder if its partially to blame.\n\nI have not been diagnosed with anything and have been to specialist after specialist.   My hands hurt so bad i can barely hold a pen.   \n\nIve been tested for covid a few times and some docs suspect long covid as well because i had a very weird mild illness in February Anyone that I know that has had their gallbladder out takes Pepcid on the regular. Have you had your inflammatory markers checked? Have you been to a rheumatologist? Can you ask your doc if you are able to get an antibody test? This will show if you have had the virus and I think the antibody test is more widely available. You would at least have a better starting point. Do you know why you have MCAS? I hope this is helping, sometimes I think constant migraines has killed some brain cells. Ive had so much blood work in the past 3 months it is insane.  Ive seen cardiologist, rheumatologist, neurologist, etc.   I just keep getting passed around.    \n\nI do not even know if i have MCAS or not.  I am just searching for people with similar symptoms.  This has been an absolutely awful ride that i want off of.   I do not know what to do. Have you been tested for common autoimmune diseases? I am so sorry you are going through and I feel like I can relate. I have seen so many specialists at 33 they have decided to let me into pediatrics out of pity. Well honestly it is sounds like to me that you are looking in the right direction. When it is something that effects the whole body it takes a long time to get proper diagnosis. So the reason I have suggested a connective tissue disorder is because most of the time it is missed because they do not ask simple questions. Doctors do not know everything that why there are sub specialists. They are also told to look for common issues first and rule out things until they land on your proper diagnosis. Insurance coverage also plays a factor on how they will get you to your diagnosis. For me knowing why it was taking so damn long and why it seams like they are not trying to get me answers and just sending me for another test was somehow a more softened blow when I realized they had to work in the system. That being said if any provider refuses to do a test or scan that you feel like you need, push for it and if they refuse ask them to put it in your chart that they refused if you can afford to lose that provider. Most of the time they will write the order. It is terrible that that is what is take to move things a long but I got this advice a few years ago that I do not use that often but when very necessary. If I can offer any answers to some questions you may have I am here. I would definitely look into POTS, specifically the ( which can present with nerve pain that is aggravated by the lack of blood flow. \n\nIt is not uncommon to develop it after an injury or illness, and weightlifting is a great way to keep the symptoms in check, so it could have even been something you had earlier that did not become an issue until you had to take time off your routine. \n\n(This is something that happened to me--I have most likely had POTS since I was a kid, but when I used to squat heavy, having a muscular abdomen and legs helped my circulation be more normal. Whenever I stopped for a while, I had to start wearing compression stockings to function.)\n\nPOTS is also often co-morbid with many other conditions, like MCAS, autoimmune disease, post-viral syndromes, etc., so if you do have it it does not necessarily mean it would explain all your symptoms or that you do not also have MCAS or something else. It is just something that might be a little simpler to diagnose and treat than the others (assuming you can find a cardiologist familiar with it).\n\nIn the meantime you could also just try a pair of compression stockings and see how that makes you feel, if you have never done that before. I have.  Lots of bloodwork.  Im terrified because my hands are in bad shape I have been wearing them on occasion.   My hr rises a bit when i stand but does not seem as drastic as others with pots.   I am honestly terrified because it is like the tissue is wasting away in my hands.   Doctors just shrugged at first and said i was normal even as i get worse and worse.  I could deal with the feet stuff but my hands is awful Thanks so much for all your advice Well, you are almost certainly not \"normal\", but I know from experience it is very normal for lots of doctors to try to say you are anyway. \n\nHave you been tested for small fiber neuropathy? I know lots of times they just do an EMG and call it a day even though that will not detect it. \n\nOne thing that can help when trying to work out your own personal medical mystery, if you have not already done so, is to keep all your tests and charts together in a binder you take to appointments that is easy for new doctors to flip through. You can also include lists or short descriptions explaining your current symptoms and what the onset was like. \n\nIt is also sometimes helpful to think back over your life and make a list of anything that may have been low-key \"unusual\" about your health since *before* these symptoms started--e.g. you have always been double-jointed/super sensitive to heat/needed a humidifier to breathe comfortably, etc.--just for random examples.\n\nSorry, I know this is not really MCAS advice. All I have on that front is keep seeing doctors, and if you are in a situation where insurance/finances/location permit, if you see a doctor who acts like everything's fine and you should be happy even though you are in pain because a test they ordered came back normal, do not waste any more time with them--go find another one. I have similar symptoms (but no diagnosis- in process of hoping to get some definitive answers though)\nI have burning blotchy patches, especially on feet and knees, chest, face and shoulders sometimes too. Blood pressure issues, high readings, extremely high pulse- 120+ at times. Feeling out of breath. GI issues, constipation, nausea, heartburn, etc. extreme. Sensitivity to scents that cause major migraines. I have different triggers. \nWarm temps outdoors will trigger me and standing will make my feet get red hot and blotchy. Certain foods I eat bother me. Alcohol. Look up Erythromelalgia I am pretty positive I have that. You might also based on symptoms. \nMy mother has a mast cell disorder &amp; other auto immune issues, and my sister has MS. I am sorry you are suffering. I hope you get some answers soon. Best of luck to you. Do not give up", "Is sugar anyone else\u2019s main trigger?  No. That is really unlikely. Do you have diabetes? No. As soon as I eat sugar my skin itches and gets dry. I also get headaches and general inflammation &gt;No. As soon as I eat sugar my skin itches and gets dry. I also get headaches and general inflammation\n\ndefine sugar for me. What exactly are you eating and having reactions to? Any sugar natural or processed. I cannot tolerate sugar alcohol either. That means no fruit too. &gt;Any sugar natural or processed. I cannot tolerate sugar alcohol either. That means no fruit too.\n\nSo  sucrose, glucose, fructose everything? Do you notice anything when eating high carb foods like rice pasta or bread?\n\nThere has to be some underlying condition that triggers mast cell degranulation as \"sugar\" itself is usually not a trigger by any means Yeah. Refined carbs all hurt my stomach but do not effect anything else. Have you been tested for fructose intolerance? You should do a glucose tolerance test aswell just to make sure. Seeing a new md soon. I had a food intolerance test that said I cannot have cane sugar and fruit combined but it seems more than that so I will probably have to go for a more targeted test. Yeah if it was an IgG test it is not trustable. For fructose you can do a hydrogen breath test after drinken fructose and for glucose its a blood test after drinking a solution with glucose in it i think most doctors can do these tests Yes sugar can be a problem for me Which test makes a big difference.  There are tons of people willing to take your money. How quickly after eating it?  Like you taste it and react?  And does it happen if you do not know you are eating sugar?\n\nNote that starch is just a chain of sugars too.  Sugar/starch is normally digested one way (insulin tells cells to absorb extra sugar), and sugar alcohols a different one (in the liver first into glucagon).  So a bit of corn starch or potato starch should also trigger this if it is sugar.\n\nPretty sure insulin can trigger itching and drying out of your skin, but do not know precisely when/why. Mind expanding on how/when?  I know we are all different, but I have felt crazy a lot of my life and people's stories matching my odd experiences have really helped. Minutes after consumption I can feel my head start itching. I do not really consume things with corn or potato starch as most my food is either meat or non starchy veggies because those react the least for me. If I eat potatoes, carrots, etc I get a small reaction. I have had those kinds of reactions only rarely.  It is usually been apple flavoring like in candy but can also happen from salads with granny smiths.  Apparently if you are allergic to birch pollen it is really similar to apple in structure, and it is not unusual to react to both.  I would never get hives, but at times I would suddenly feel hot, sweat a bit, and then my head would itch.\n\nBest guesses have been allergies or hormone oddities like night sweats, though I am a man.  Insulin is a pretty important hormone, and I think testosterone can be affected by insulin.\n\nI would still test this out with something more precise and pure, like cane sugar in a pill you just swallow.  It is hard to narrow down reactions otherwise.\n\nWhey protein can trigger insulin release too.  That might be a non-sugar way to investigate if it is that hormone somehow causing issues.\n\nI will say I have worried that sugar might triggering things for me.  But honestly I would probably just give up on life if that turns out to be true.  I am already down to almost nothing to eat that I want (no wheat, peanuts, corn, or A1 cow dairy), and nothing fun (no alcohol, marijuana, or kratom...all seem to trigger joint issues the next day).  Everybody is different like u said. But with me I can tolerate sugar in small amounts. Too much and i get dizzy, upset stomach and shortness of breath. Im sure u know mast cell problems can come with things like histamine intolerance. In which case u want to avoid too much sugar. One rule i have is only have something sugary after I have already eaten. Never on an empty stomach the thyroid has a relationship with blood glucose and histamine sensitivity. low levels of thyroid hormone will cause\nhistamine sensitivity.\n\ntoo much sugar or processed carbs can impair thyroid function. more accurately, hypothyroidism has been linked to decreased insulin sensitivity or pre diabetes and diabetes.\n\nalso artificial sweeteners may do something similar.\n\nso basically it may be that sugar can cause or be correlated with histamine sensitivity. this is all very new research by the way but you can find it published on google scholar Thyroid function can be impaired by sugar. Hypothyroidism is a known cause of histamine sensitivity Dry skin is a known symptom of hypothyroidism. Talk to your doc about getting tested It is believed that artificial sweeteners can impact thyroid function\n\n In my case my thyroid is fine. Had that checked a few times Any history of diabetes or prediabetes in the family? Yup. Had all that checked several times as well what levels did they test? a lot of docs do not properly test for hypothyroidism. Ive definitely been tested properly. I have got two grandparents with it. Ive been tested numerous times over the past 10yrs Just a thought here. Is the sugar organic or conventional? Sugar is a GMO crop, and all GMO crops are glyphosate ready. They are also heavy sprayed throughout growing. Could you be reacting to glyphosate in the sugar and not the sugar? Or both? Best of luck to you. Always buy organic Does this happen with a spoon of sugar or is this happening with items like baked goods?\n\nETA: I see this was asked below. Disregard.", "Please tell me if you think this is MCAS  To me personally this sounds like mold toxcity. Otherwise known as biotoxin illness. \nWhich in many individuals can cause mast cell issues. I know from personal experience (hearing it from dozens of people) and my own research. Let me know if you would like me to share instagram accounts that have helped me with connecting the dots. Yes please thank you! Following because I am interested If you wake up feeling hungover or have visible mold or know of water damage in your home, then i would really consider it. These accounts helped me connect the dots. \nPjharlowwellness \nMoldfinders \nDr.jess.peatross\n25% of the population cant detox mold spores, being able to smell mold and mildew is a big sign of this gene. Feel free to DM if you want to chat.\nMold has kind of become my thing much to dismay. Curious if your hypermobile in all your joints. This kiiind of sounds like Atlantoaxial instability. Yes I am! But it is not noticeable.  I am just super bendy Hey can you share more about why the feeling of being hungover? Is there any specific reason/mechanism for that? (Other than like...obviously, mold making you unwell). Just curious! did you have mold exposure and if so how did you treat it? Sure sounds like MCAS to me. Also, if you are very bendy, that sounds like possible EDS. It often goes along with MCAS, as well as POTS. The \"doctors find nothing wrong\" really hits home.  \n\nSome of your symptoms may be side effects of medications.  Allegra D causes some people more symptoms than it treats.  Have you tried Claritin?  Some people tolerate it better.\n\nSomething in your environment could be bothering you.  Spend some time away from home/office and see if there is improvement. It is been like this since child hood and I have lived all over.  I have tried all the over the counter allergy meds I agree with other commentators about the POTS, MCAS, EDS. I have them as well and basically a lot of crap goes wrong and yes it is genetic although there are some spontaneous mutations, it seems as though yours could be genetic. You will blended to find specialist. Do you have access to healthcare? Live in a place with easy access to EDS or POTS specialist? Antihistamines should have helped more. Look into mold or Lyme or other environmental toxins Mcas can be really common with Eds. Google beighton score and tell me how you score! I got a 2 lol Update:  I found out I have porphyria!

Louis at specialists in gastroenterology. His focus is, obviously on the gastro side of things but he is a specialist in MCAS and afaik the only one in town really. He has done a TON of research and studies. I also have an appt with Barbara Jost next week, who he referred me to for help in managing the more typical allergy symptoms of mcas. \u201cI think I saw his name on the national website for MCAS experts in MO. There was another one listed name Dr. Wedner an allergist at Wash U. Heard of him? I tried to appointment but they require new patients to come into the clinic for the first visit and I do not want to travel from where I am I center Missouri during covid. I have an apt with allergist in town who agreed to see me over video but I am unsure of her level of knowledge about MCAS. \n\nThank you so much. Good luck with your new allergist.\u201d\n- my wife", "Any suggestions on how to stop a reaction? I have been doing my best to follow the low histamine diet but different sites say different things and the pain and inflammation in my knees was going down but it is getting worse again, I can barely walk or stand. I am taking h1 and h2 blockers, magnesium, vit d, b12, and cucumin. Please anyone any suggestions I would say do an elimination diet rather then follow a set diet. We all ready to different foods. Also keep in mind we starting allergy season. It is hard for people with mild hay fever, and it always feels like I hit a brick wall when it comes around. Everything is worst. I do not know what to start with, what is definitely safe... I am only eating asparagus herbs, chicken, egg yolks, activated almonds (skin scratched off) , and frozen blueberries. And you are still getting gastro type reaction? Then most likely something in there is affecting you. So start there. Are you using oils? Try switching oils see if that does anything for a bit. Then maybe switch chicken for turkey. Do that for a while. Write down how you feel. Better? Worst?. Then switch asparagus for another vegetable and repeat. Etc etc. \nIt will take a while but it is worth it to get it under control. \n\nMy starting diet was rice, chicken, brocolli boiled to death. I also used a tiny bit of grapeseed oil. Thank you I will try this And to give you some positive thinking. It took a couple of years but I eventually got better and I started reintroducing stuff in my diet once I seemed to have it back under control.  So this is not necessarily a forever thing! Think the other post has a good plan, and just wanted to say the same.  I think your goal is wrong...there are only so many things we can do to calm things during a flare...the real fix is to add in also \"not triggering\" in the first place.  Then the calming stuff can get us out of the cycle.\n\nQuercetin (mine adds bromelain to aid in absorption) is OTC and a mast stabilizer.  I take mine 20-40 minutes before every meal, and I think it helps.\n\nKetotifen (if in US, from a compounding pharmacy) has been a godsend to me.  It is a combo mast cell stabilizer (like sodium cromolyn) and h1/h2 anti-histamine (blocker).\n\nHistamine is in what we drink too.  Coffee, alcohol, tea, kombucha...  Anything fermented has increased histamine.\n\nMany react to egg yolks.  Seems like an obvious target to try skipping.  Chicken seems like the other.  But honestly whatever you have eaten lots of is likely to be a problem.  For me that meant wheat, peanuts, corn, and cow milk have all come up somehow as bad.  I am honestly amazed animal meat has not seemed to trigger something more obvious, but I also do not eat tons anymore (now 1 meal a day is meat, 1-2 are Huel vegan shake stuff, and often some carb snack like things with gluten free oats or whatever).\n\nI have always heard of turmeric (the active ingredient is curcumin) as being a wonder drug.  My PCP had me stop anything with it.  He said it can cause a reaction similar to sulfur intolerance.  It does seem to sneak into a lot of stuff.  I have a fish oil capsule with it, and a protein powder.\n\nVitamin C (doses like up to 4g/day) help eliminate histamine.  Be careful as too much can cause symptoms too...might mix up the forms too.  I do not think buffered with calcium is a great option for me.  I am really low on magnesium still.\n\nSadly leftovers have more histamine too.  As a single guy, my solution has been the Huel mix.  I can make it just before the meal, and it does not have time to sit and ferment.  Protein bars and shakes are go-to's for the same reason.  I know many people prefer less processed...have fun preparing your meals from scratch then. Thank you I will stop the cucumin for a couple days, and try turkey instead of chicken while dropping the eggs, see if there is any improvement. One question how much vit c is too much? I have been taking 500mg every other day but, am wondering if the brand, nature made, is a problem as it has other ingredients. I have had a suggestion of up to 4g/day if you build up to it. Normally you pee extra out easily. I am still finding a safe amount and source type.  It is best to spread out those doses though like 3-4 through the day. \n\nRosehips increase or release histamine (I believe), and is often included in vitamin C supplements. Or is a natural source of it too. Thank you, while searching I did encounter products with rose hips and was questioning if it was a safe additive, do you have any info on tapioca? Seems fine for me. I think it must be processed to remove cyanide or something, but after that it is safe.  Or I am mixing up cassava and tapioca (thought they were basically synonyms).\n\nThe rosehip warning was from a histamine diet list I found through Google. \n\nI have worried about lectins in our food. You might investigate low lectin diets as another thing to experiment with. Lectins are special protein carb complexes that protect the plants from bugs and animals (like humans). Gluten is one. Peanut has another. Most of the typical IgE food allergies seem to be one of those (shellfish, strawberries, etc). There was a book about curing inflammation with a low lectin diet. I just want my knee to go down, my left knee has been swollen twice and each time it is more painful from then on out, now my right knee is swollen for the first time and I am so worried I live on the second floor and I do not know if I can afford to move. I am literally trapped inside while my knees are like this Familiar, but mine was feet. Still hurting but improving. Sucks I know. My feet were last year, I spent all summer unable to put weight on them while the inflammation moved from joint to joint. I did not know about mcas or the histamine diet then. Almonds are high in salicylates so are blueberries. Those could be causing problems. The almonds themselves? There is different info on every site, but i got the overall impression that the skins were the problem, its so difficult to prepare food when you can barely stand, almonds were the easiest thing, I will cut them out too, see what happens. Thank you How do mast cells cause knee pain? Is your doctor telling you that this is the cause? If not, I would see a doctor and not attribute everything to a mast cell disorder. There are far more likely culprits and much more helpful treatments depending on the ultimate cause of your symptoms. I have had my knees aspirated 5 xs, they never reveal a cause, and I have other mcas symptoms and comorbidities. My tryptase and histamine levels were elevated in my urine, I have not yet been able to get a anaphylatic response tested. The dr I saw suspects systemic mastocytosis but I still need the reaction blood serum results Systemic mastocytosis is diagnosed by bone marrow biopsy. Tryptase is not a urine test. Having \u201cMCAS\u201d symptoms does not equal MCAS. The symptoms are non specific. If they think you have mastocytosis, they should do the bone marrow biopsy and get you on a treatment plan. Swollen knees does not sound like MCAS to me. The danger in attributing everything to mast cell is actually missing something. Could be why the typical MCAS treatments are not working in this situation. I know, it is unpopular to question these things, but I am a skeptic, even in my own diagnosis. I did not even believe it myself until after my biopsy and blood tests came back. Good luck! I do not recall the specifics of the urine test only that I was high in 2 levels that typically indicate mcas, the dr I saw told me that I did not need to get the bone marrow biopsy unless having that specific diagnosis was important to me because the treatment is the same and the Meds that the biopsy might indicate would work are a last resort. I did have what appeared to be a noticeable effect on my knee when I took montelukast without lactase but I experienced horrible side effects and had to stop, while taking it my knee swelling reduced and upon stopping it just hangs out in limbo. I cannot seem to get it to go down any other way but it is definitely triggered by certain foods, I am suspecting oxalates and surprisingly turkey. Anyway I have been navigating this trail for over a decade  and this is the closest I have gotten to an explanation. Also my feet went through a similar process last year and ten years ago. Swollen joints are unfortunately a symptom of systemic mastocytosis that can lead to masto sarcoma and result in amputation so I am not eager to accept this or the extremely restricted diet but I am learning my triggers. Now I just need my insurance to pay for an experienced Dr instead of the one I am left using until then. Ok-you went from swollen knee to amputation which tells me there is an anxiety component here. If they did not find mast cells in the knee aspirate, then that is less likely the cause. Oxylates contribute to gout. All I am saying is, do not hang your hat on Mast Cell involvement. If you met criteria for SM, they would be recommending biopsy. Urine studies would not meet criteria. They are not even the gold standard for MCAS. No harm in trying a variety of dietary changes, but also check back in with your doctor. They may be missing something. My insurance refused to pay for that dr and I got approved to see another at Penn med but they only authorized one with no tests and Penn med refuses to deal with that and I am forced to resubmit. The reason the mentioned the amputation possibility is because you are saying you are not aware of knee swelling being a symptom of mastocytosis, if you research mast cell sarcoma you will see how mastocytosis inflames joints and that it turns to cancer 30% of the time resulting in some gruesome amputation images. As for gout, they definitely checked for crystals with each aspiration. No gout, no psuedo gout no arthritis etc, it is been very frustrating. I do not even want to schedule a biopsy without having an experienced Dr order it because I do not want anything missed, I do not want to repeat it.  Have not had an anaphylatic like experience since the beginning of Covid lock down and then I was too scared to go to the er and have it tested, so the waiting game continues... Mast Cell Sarcoma is exceedingly rare and you do not even know if you have mastocytosis! I see this a lot on this forum. No actual diagnosis-which means you do not know what you are even trying to treat. Some people, often in a similar boat of self suspected or undiagnosed, then chime in with what \u201cworks\u201d for them. Meanwhile, nobody is actually addressing anything because no one knows what they have or what you have. I have no recommendations for you, other than to discuss all of this with your doctor when you get the chance. The experienced Dr suspected systemic mastocytosis, not me. I see you point however about diagnosis and advice, that is how asking for information on the internet works though, my problem is I am between drs until my insurance allows me to see an experienced one and the meantime my knee is swollen and painful, not just my knee but I have periodic Stinging sensations in both my legs,from feet to thighs. The best I can do right now is seek advice from others with similar experiences and restrict my diet. All I need for an official diagnosis of mcas is the reaction blood work. According to the Dr I saw, my urine indicates it, as do my symptoms and there is a reaction to medicines I just may not be on the right ones yet. It sounds like your experience is different than mine and that is not unusual very few people have the soft tissue involvement. If you have another explanation for the bone marrow edema I would welcome it because from my reasearch and my other drs my options of cause are either mast cell disease or crmo and there are no tests for crmo Just to clarify: Knee swelling does not equal bone marrow edema. The inside of the knee is covered with a synovial membrane that creates synovial fluid. I cannot comment on bone marrow edema in general, but specifically I am not hearing anything that indicates you have that either. The bone marrow edema is evident on multiple mris in both knees and feet, I am not sure why you are so sure I do not have what the drs suspect I have. I also did not ask for a diagnosis I am looking for suggestions to stop the reaction I am experiencing currently. You were saying soft tissue swelling and bone marrow edema as if they are the same thing. I was simply clarifying. I highly recommend trying a elemination diet the zerocarb / carnivore way. It changed my life and that of many others.\nThe foods you listed (asparagus almonds, berries, curcuma...)  contain salycilates, lectins, oxalates etc. Not good. Thank you for responding, I realized that and soon ended up eating only cauliflower, chicken, carrots, garlic, sage and rosemary, Evo. My knee is improving and I have slowly introduced mangos which have helped maintain my sanity. Still extremely frustrated it took 2 - 3 mos for the bulk of the fluid to disapate but relieved I am finally able to lower my leg without increased pain. I feel like there has to be a quicker way, a trick to stopping all the damage from progressing and lingering. Yes, it is indeed hard to find good that does not trigger the body. It is nearly impossible with plant foods unfortunately. (I was a vegan for nearly my whole life, so I should know, lol)\n\nGood luck, I wish you all the best!!!!\nKeep us updated how it goes :)", "Getting more fats... Ideas Please I do have a dietician but I cannot afford to see her again for a little while yet.\n\nMeantime I have noticed that my diet is quite deficient in fats. Especially as I am in a flare and unable to gain weight. \n\nI think dairy would be an easy option but since I am somewhat lactose intolerant then I limit my intake of it. Currently I have a bit of cream or butter or cheese a few times a week.\n\nAvocados. My dietician said they raise overall histamine levels but I keep eating them fairly often despite that, because I do not react severely to them in the moment and hey I need to eat fatty stuff. .\n\nOil... I like to add a bit of oil to my rice for example. I usually buy olive oil but I am not sure if that is the best one for fats. The cheaper ones are supposedly not good for MCAS. \n\nEggs, I eat them often. \n\nNuts, I do not tolerate too well, eat a portion a few times per week \n\nSalmon, a couple of times a week. I do react hence the limitations. \n\nCoconut, can basically not do anymore, creates a lot of issues for me. Would on only be able to have it rarely and in very small quantities. \n\nThat is everything I can think of right now. Let me know if you have any thoughts! You can find frozen avocado, which might help as freezing foods helps slow down enzymes. \n\nDo you pre-dose with an H2 before you eat? I am just on H1, did not find an H2 that works well for me. Frozen avocado is a good suggestion. I did not know that about the slowing down the enzymes. Does that theoretically work for any food? That is fair. You can also try stuff from here: \n\n I am having the same issue. I try to get little bursts of fat in when I can in ways that I tolerate...extra butter, mayo, fattier cuts of steak, hemp hearts in everything, a little cheese. I wish I could tolerate avocado! I would love to eat extra butter, but I already spend enough time on the toilet \ud83d\ude02. I stopped having hemp because I was not tolerating it but I have been meaning to try again to see if my body has changed its mind. Trying to get more fat on meat cuts is definitely a possibility, thank you. MCS, MCAS, ME/CFS, fibro all seem to lead to weight gain.\n\nThe hard truth is calories absorbed through intestines minus calories burned in muscles equals calories added/removed in fat.\n\nAdding exercise with these illnesses is hard.\n\nThat just leaves calorie restriction and the hunger that comes with it. I see macadamia nuts listed on there. I wonder if that might be a new possible safe food for me. I started reacting more to Almonds during this latest flare so it would be good to try macadamias. I think you misunderstood my post. For me the issue is being physically unable to gain weight. For some people with mast cell disease, weight loss is the issue not weight gain. Even though I have been eating a lot, I am hovering just a few kilos above underweight. Ahh, the dairy thing is tough. It is technically on my food sensitivity list but I do not feel myself react to it, so it stays! Hemp is a great source of protein, definitely give it a gentle try. \n\nAnd yes to the meat, luckily ribeyes are my favorite cut anyway so it works well! I have been in a terrible flare for a few months because I stupidly stopped taking my ketotifen after a mixup at my pharmacy. I am 5\u20195 and got down to 95 lbs at one point so I feel your pain! Yes I love dairy and would happily eat it multiple times a day if not for the after effects. I was drinking hemp protein regularly for a while until I started get bad reactions from it. But it is been over a year since then so who knows. I might cope with just a bit now and again or I might not. Trial and error. Haha yes I should ask for the fattiest bits of meat when I go out too. \n\nAh that sucks. Fortunately I am not down that low yet but I hate it when rude people comment that I am 'skinny' and need to eat more. Maintaining weight with this disease is a real issue, just as legitimate as the opposite (unwanted weight gain). I have to wonder where all the calories go though, it is like they just disappear into thin air. Missed that, but same advice applies.  I have been ill for 30 years.  In the early years, my symptoms were mostly in my GI track.  I lost a lot of weight.  The same statement held true: Calories absorbed through intestines minus calories burned in muscles equals calories added/removed in fat.  I just could not absorb everything I ate.  I only ate once a day because I knew I would experience symptoms after I ate.  I ate a lot in the one meal.\n\nI built a diet for myself from the bottom up.  I only ate single item foods while looking for foods I could tolerate.  Eventually I had a list of foods I could tolerate that I constructed my meals from.  After 4 years on that diet my GI track improved and I started gaining weight.\n\nNow, the opposite is true.  In my last multi-year flare up mostly involved fatigue and muscle weakness. I gained a lot of weight.  Now I probably need to calorie restrict to get back to a reasonable weight.  Maybe I missed your point because I was thinking about myself... Ghee is dairy free and according to this article has more fat than butter and is considered a healthy fat. You can make your own too since it can be expensive. ( Ghee is a good one to suggest the OP. The process of making it strains out a lot of the irritating proteins. Even so, if you have issues with cow dairy, you may react. But! If you cannot do cow dairy (even for ghee), you may be able to tolerate goat ghee or yak ghee. I have been able to find both of those on Amazon. Properly made goat ghee does not taste very 'goaty' at all. Yak is a bit earthy tasting, but it may be an option. Of course, those non-standard options are comparatively pricey, but they are options. Thanks for that. I did not realise it is lactose free. I had always steered clear as I assumed it was just like other dairy products. Although I may have the odd bit by eating naan bread. I am keen to give it a proper try and see how I go. You are welcome. I hope it works out I would really suggest trying leaf lard, or tallow from grass fed pastured animals. It is a healthy source of fat (fat soluble vitamins most fats dont have) but did take me awhile to get used to flavor wise. Without lard and ghee I would have had no fat at all when i was at my worat. Butter is extremely low lactose. 0.1 gram in 227 grams of butter. I am lactose intolerant and I eat tons of butter. Also, have you tried digestive enzymes for lactose intolerance? Enzymedica makes one called Lacto that is excellent. I can take that and eat whatever dairy I want.\n\n Kirkland Organic olive oil is one of the best, according to something I read about the olive oil scam. I do not understand why some people think it is OK to comment on someones' weight when they are thin. They do not usually go around calling large people \"Fatty\". Have you tried macademia and pecan nuts? They should be low histamine.\n\nI also reccommend fatty meats. I used to not like it until I adapted to a keto and carnivore diets. Now I love it. Exactly. Somehow social norms have gone wrong, where its considered inappropriate to call someone fat, but perfectly acceptable to call someone skinny. Really grates on me. Thanks for the info. But I think the issue for me is not just lactose, but also casein. As I just do not do well if I have more than a tiny bit of butter.\n\nI am keen to keep up with the olive oil and will watch out for scammy brands. Can maybe look into leaf lard. I had never heard of it before Olive oil brands to avoid:   (\n\nSorry, I meant to mention that Lacto digestive enzymes also handle casein. I am not pushing it, it is just that it made a huge difference for me.\n\nI wish you good luck on your healing journey. Oh I did not realise that about lactose enzymes. It would be interesting to give them a try and see if they help, thanks. Haha well no cure on the horizon but hope to at least get out of this flare and back to my baseline. Just make sure to get Enzymedica Lacto. They are the only ones I have tried that really work for everything. The regular Lactaid and the like are only for lactose.", "Is it possible Cromolyn Sodium works by constantly activating mast cells and keeping them empty? From my reading nobody really knows why it works as a mast cell stabilizer. I just started taking it and to my surprise it causes a minor flush all on it is own. I have used high doses of niacin in the past to cause a large flush before my trigger which I assume works because the mast cells are pre-activated and drained. I am wondering if taking sodium cromolyn daily does the same thing and just keeps the mast cells empty? Any thoughts? Did anyone else get this reaction when starting the drug? My understanding is that they block degranulation by stabilizing the mast cell membrane. Apparently cromolyn works by blocking calcium channels so that histamine cannot attach to the cell membrane and degranulate. Anyways, I flushed the first time I took it but since then, I never reacted to cromolyn and rarely flush anymore. Having a reaction to cromolyn the first time is super common, which is why it is recommended to slowly increase your dosage over time. That is good to know the flushing will go away eventually. For me it is been two days it is occurred at a dosage of 200 mg per day. I am prescribed 800 mg per day. I was started on a lower dosage. I was directed to take 100mg/5 mL once a day for a week at breakfast, then add a second vial at 100mg/5mL at lunch the second week. So by week 4 I was taking 100mg/5mL for times a day. Then I started doubling up, so by week 8 I was taking 200mg/10mL 4 times a day. So yeah, seeing so much flushing at a higher dosage would be expected. If it is rough on you, you may want to dial it back to the dosage schedule I was given and then slowly move back up. My mast cell specialist gave me my dosage schedule and recommends it because people have fewer adverse reactions.", "Do any of you get neurological symptoms? If so what types of symptoms and what triggers it?  Yeah, it is super common. Fatigue, attention issues, memory issues, concentration issues, \"brain fog\", mild dizziness or wooziness, lightheadedness, blurry vision, trouble finding words, anxiety, depression, etc. Bipolar 2 Fatigue and brain fog. The brain fog is usually my first symptom during a reaction. It is very noticeable to people around me. I cannot come up with the right words for things and I cannot explain what is wrong with me or figure out what meds I need to treat the reaction. Yep I have gotten all these also! The brain fog is awful and seems to always come along with migraines Fatigue and migraines are my worst symptoms Fatigue, brain fog, forgetfulness, coordination issues, dyslexia, attention problems, anxiety, depressive mood, mood swings, migraines, and more.\n\nFor me they appear :\n\n1) not taking my meds\n\n2) my periods\n\n3) triggering food stuff (gluten, fruits, mushrooms, shellfish, etc etc etc)\n\n4) tabacco\n\n5) not sleeping enough\n\nEdit : format and words. Words are hard Have not had any mood issues like others have mentioned but extreme wooziness and lightheadedness (not vertigo), blurred vision, ocular migraines, feeling like I am on a boat, probably more I am forgetting now. Oh and during episodes where I was experiencing all of this at once - smell-o-vision - I could smell things I saw on TV, ie. an ad with grass in it, I could strongly smell the grass. It was wild lol. :-O I have never heard of mast cell-induced synaesthesia. That really is wild. I get migraines too but those are separate from my brain fog. I get the classic flashing lights in my vision before the migraine. I had a spinal migraine after I had my first baby and started getting migraines after that. I used to just wait them out, but they last three days, so now I take prescription meds for it. They make me feel awful for about an hour, then they get rid of the migraine. I get similar symptoms.  Do you take B-12 supplements?  Just want to reply to everyone in this thread that has brain fog that I think taking B-12 will help at least a little bit. Triggers that activate anaphylaxis generally set me off, but I also get brain fog and fatigue after focusing on problems for a long time.  \"Problems\" could be a work, personal finances, hands-on projects, or a tough video game level/quest/blah-blah-blah.  I have found B-12 daily helps me focus, and quick-dissolve B-12 tablets under my tongue and/or an anti-histamine during times where the brain fog sets in help a ton. Lol - yeah, you should have seen the looks I got from docs, they thought I had a brain tumor. Have not had that in a few years now - it was at the peak of my challenges with ocular migraines which were triggered somehow by my unhappy mast cells. Since the ocular migraines stopped, I have not had further smell-o-vision. I also have not met anyone else yet who is had that with a mast cell disorder, but I did just get the name of a mast cell disorder savvy neurologist, so maybe they have seen it before. Lots. Brain fog, sometimes my right hand stops working and I drop whatever\u2019s in it, trouble with depth perception. \n\nAny reaction triggers it, or enough reactions. I take palmitoylethanolamide and ketotifen when it is acting up. Also b12 and magnesium for recovery. I do not at the moment, but thank you for the recommendation! I am going to try to again.", "Questions for those that take ketotifen 1. I know Ketotifen has the side effect of drowsiness/fatigue. If you experienced this, how long did it last?  \n\n2. If you started on a lower dosage and worked your way up and also had the fatigue mentioned above, did upping the dosage make the fatigue last longer, or once you got through the initial period of fatigue it did not matter? \n\n3. If you started on a lower dosage and worked your way up, how quickly did you increase dosage?\n\nThanks. I have not experienced fatigue, I think my mast cells always keep me up honestly. I started at .25 and VERY slowly increased doses because I would react for a week every time I increased at all. Listen to your body and go as slow as you need, my doctor would prescribe .25 then .5 then .75 then 1 mg. I eventually started taking less because of weight gain after two years. 1. Yes. 1-2 weeks. \n2. Each time I increased the dose, I experienced the increased fatigue for 1-2 weeks. \n3. I started at 1 mg 2x/day and that was too much for me. Then, I scaled it back to 1 mg 1x/day for a couple of weeks until I got used to it. Then, I increased it to 1 mg 2x/day for a couple weeks. Then, increased to 2 mg 1x/day along with 1 mg 1x/day for a couple of weeks. Finally increasing to 2 mg 2x/day. \n\nA couple of months ago, my doc bumped me up again to 3 mg 2x/day.", "Stabilizers as antivirals? So I was researching to see if I should increase my mast cell stabilizers if I get infected with a virus like, say, coronavirus and weirdly enough it seems like most mast cell stabilizers have been tested to see why they help against viruses? Nothing conclusive seems to have been turned up but it seems odd. \n\nQuercetin is being studied as a potential antiviral right now in China. It has mechanisms for potentially preventing entry of virus into cells but a short length of time it is useful as I am sure many people here know. \n\nThings like ketotifen and cromolyn sodium have been shown to help by reducing release of inflammatory mediators in mice but not directly as antivirals. \n\nThings like xolair and chloroquine have been studied for antiviral effects but are pretty intense and do more than stabilize so that could explain them doing both. \n\nZinc can weakly help stabilize mast cells I think from a quick google and can also help shorten the length of a virus by a day or two. \n\nThere are studies that suggest inflammatory mediators from mast cells cause problems, but that some late-release stuff from mast cells can help fight viruses. It does not seem to be black and white as to whether mast cell activation helps or hurts. \n\nI am confused but intrigued. I think my answer might be increase quercetin if I get sick \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nTl;dr stabilizers were studied for antiviral effects, I will probably increase the most promising one if I get a virus from here on out Links to these studies? I may be wrong here, but my understanding is that your body creates all this inflammation in order to fight the bad guy (virus, whatever).  It seems to me like decreasing your inflammatory response would mean that the virus had more power over your body.\n\nAre not overactive mast cells our best friends in a time like this?  I feel like we should let them do their thing during a plague, because things like plagues are the entire reason that mammals have mast cells. Quercetin- most studies not done on humans but mice. Seems to be helpful against a wide array of viruses. In Petri dishes, helped stopped further infection even when cells were already infected by viruses. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKetotifen- weaker antiviral, paper suggested benefits may be from antiinflammatory effects\n\n\n\n\u201cKetotifen targets mast cells and prevents their degranulation. As these cells are strongly activated by DENV, targeting them may reduce vascular leakage in DENV patients .\u201d \n\nCromolyn- also mice, also due to decreasing inflammatory response probably?\n\n\n\nMeanwhile this article suggests that increased release of interleukin-1 and some other mediators in mast cells could be helpful in ending viruses early\n\n Thank you so much. Got the Japanese link for ketotifen? Yes, that is why it is mixed I think. Too much mast cell response and it can increase the damage the virus does- like this coronavirus, flooding interstitial spaces in the lungs can lead to pneumonia, and mast cells can increase that. But mast cell response also ultimately stops the virus. I think it will vary on an individual basis what mediators your mast cells contain and whether them being overactive will help or hurt.  Some people might have to deal with a \u201ccytokines storm\u201d and those should focus on stabilization I bet. I have never had anything like that though. \n\nThat is why I am planning on mainly using the stabilizers that also have antiviral effects. Best of both worlds, reduce inflammatory reaction and hopefully boost antiviral to make up for lost natural antiviral effect. \n\nThis is all pretty theoretical and untested though.", "Swollen legs Have you ever experienced fluid retention or swelling of your legs as a symptom of your mast cell disease?  Just saw a medical professional again yesterday about this. No answers and no one seems to care that it is uncomfortable or painful, it varies. Is your blood pressure high? Nope u mean during anaphylaxis?  yah the whole reason blood pressure drops is bcuz all the fluids are leaving yr bloodstream to go into the tissues.  which ofc in addition to hypotensive shock causes water to accumulate in the tissues.   but once u take the epi and start reversing the anaphylaxis and yr pressures go back up, the tissues should stop hoarding all yr body's water.\n\nif it is happening outside of anaphylaxis, it is prob not related to mast cells.  \n\nthere is a bajill causes for edema in the legs.  assuming u dont have shit like kidney, liver, heart disease, most common just dependence.  having yr legs dangling.  and not having good vein valves to pump that shit back up.\n\nhave u tried compression socks?  keeping legs up?  doing foot pumps if u have to keep legs dangling to floor? I get swelling in my abdomen and my back during reactions. It seems like fluid gets trapped there and does not go away when my other symptoms clear up.  I am using DMSO topically to treat it. I have lost 4\" from my bra band size since I started it three months ago. The downside is that DMSO is smelly and it itches while it is being absorbed, but it decreases my back pain along with the swelling. If I meant during anaphylaxis I would have said during anaphylaxis. \n\nMy main symptom of flushing has not happened since this last episode of swelling started and I have tracked where my symptoms flip flop. If my bladder symptoms are worse, my skin symptoms are not as worse, etc. \n\nYou must mean another word besides dependence. Compression socks are not helpful. I do not dangle my legs I rest them on a foot rest if I am sitting at a desk. I do not have a good answer for you, but I just figured something out that I am going to try for myself. I seem like I retain a lot of water sometimes, like in my hands feet and abdomen. I think maybe mine is related to dehydration from antihistamines. I am going to try to drink more water around the days I feel swelling and see if that helps me. My legs do not swell though, but just thought I would share my theory in case it helps you. I had been debating taking a second zyrtec when I am really swollen to see what happens too. Sure does not hurt to experiment with drinking more water. That happened to me a lot when I was pregnant, and then for years afterwards any time I had more than a tiny bit of salt. This definitely did not play well with my chronic low blood pressure that requires me to have a higher than normal electrolyte intake. Lots of fainting or nearly fainting. Yikes I also have POTS (often comorbid disease with MCAS) and get swollen legs from that. I also get swollen legs when I eat too much salt. Yes. I get swelling in my feet and ankles (also no high blood pressure), and sometimes my hands and face. \n\nMy MCAS is mostly triggered by food and heat. I have done some personal experiments and have noticed that, if I overheat at all at any point in the day, my extremities are swollen at night. \n\nOverheating for me can simply be just bending over to pick something up off the floor at times. Other times it is exercise, going outside when it is too hot, etc. \n\nMy skin flushes and feels like I am trying to hug a bonfire, and it is painful to be touched. If I cannot escape the heat or if I push myself too hard, I will develop hives and little \u201cbubbles\u201d (like bumps under the skin) that, if I do not cool down quickly, can become lesions. It is horrible\u2026 \n\nNo meds have been able to assist with the heat aspect yet, sadly. \n\nNext, my other swelling trigger which has now been handled was caffeine, actually. I know there are several of us who have issues with coffee (not just caffeinated coffee), but in my case switching to one cup of decaf coffee per day (although decaf still does have some caffeine in it) took care of that. If I have two cups, I am asking to swell. \n\nI have considered the possibility that drinking the warm beverage could be the actual trigger for the swelling, as it does increase my body temperature, but that would mean the caffeine part was psychosomatic, which does not seem to be the case. \n\nAnyhow, I do not know if that specific information can help you at all, but my point is that there may be a very specific trigger that maybe you did not think of that is causing the swelling. I am mainly confirming through my own experience that, yes, I believe through many months of experimenting and monitoring my system reactions, that the swelling I have experienced is actively triggered by heat, and formerly by caffeine\u2014all MCAS-related triggers for me. I left another comment just a moment ago, but I am right there with you with compression socks not working to reduce the swelling. \n\nWe can discuss on my comment, if you would like, so I am not repetitive. But I see you wrote \u201cflushing\u201d as a symptom, and that is a major part of my experience with MCAS also. We are talking my skin gets *HOT,* almost purple-red, swells, and that, in turn, increases my body temperature which contributes to my main trigger for MCAS: heat, which seems completely unaffected by meds and a low-histamine diet. \n\nAs an aside: my doctor has been researching this, and we have an appointment mid-December to discuss what I might be able to do moving forward. I will bookmark this and try to remember to come back and share, if you are interested, what she comes up with. It is interesting you mention heat since this started with shorts weather - as it was warming up. I also have developed cold intolerance at the same time. And I am still swelling in November. \n\nI am definitely going to keep tracking because it cycles. I am not the same amount of swollen all the time. Does yours get better if you move around or does only time help? I just have to prop my feet up for the rest of the evening (generally only get the \u201celephant feet\u201d later in the afternoon / early evening), and when I wake up in the morning, all the swelling is gone. \n\nI end up overheating in the cooler months too because of jacket-wearing and people cranking the heat up indoors. So I just wear (mind you, I am in mild-climate Seattle) a 3/4 sleeve cardigan beneath my winter coat, and take the coat off as soon as I start to feel a little warm once entering a building. \n\nBut I also cannot handle the super-cold temperatures, however, I have not noticed swelling from the cold \u2014 I just hate it. \ud83d\ude05 Do you think it is related to mast cell disease or something else? I think it is safe to say it is. \n\nI am so far from diabetes and heart disease, and through my observations and \u201cexperimentations,\u201d that heat is for sure my swelling trigger, and heat is absolutely a mast cell trigger for me. \n\nAt this point, my doctor is collecting data from me on my observations and trigger-collecting. If she requests more tests after our appointment next month, I will come back here and update. But for now, I am feeling confident that it is due to MCAS. Thank you for sharing. You are very welcome!", "Please Help Me...Its Just Getting Worse, Could It Be Mast Cell Disease? I have significant throat and tongue swelling that gets worse after every meal. Its been going on for over 6 months, but in the past month its become a living nightmare. Almost everything I eat, will cause swelling of my throat &amp; tongue where food &amp; water will start to get stuck in my throat. I have only been able to eat boiled potatoes &amp; plain oats.\n\nMy other symptoms are shortness of breath, hoarseness of voice, heart palpitations only after eating, and congestion of the nose, eyes, and throat. My throat swelling gets worse after eating, and the higher the food is in Histamine, the worse it will be. heat &amp; humidity also makes everything x10 worse.\n\nI have been Diagnosed with POTS. Also, I got an upper Endoscopy done and they did not find anything related to acid or anything else wrong, which is a little funny cause they make you stop eating 12 hours before so of course your not going to see any significant swelling if food is the main trigger.\n\nI am now down to 97 pounds and am wondering if this could be MCAS. I know that its somewhat related, having pots and MCAS together and am trying to get tested, but I am in Canada and my allergist is only willing to do a tryptase blood test, which I read in a lot of POTS patients shows up as negative who have MCAS and also is no where near the depth of testing that needs to be done in order for a diagnosis (they also do not think I have it). I have tried to ask multiple doctors about Mast Cell Disease, but every doctor says that I am either crazy and its all in my head or that I have anxiety.\n\nAt this point, I am scared to eat anything because my throat swells to the point where I cannot talk, eat, or drink and no doctors will take me seriously, let alone give me an epi-pen (not sure if that is something I should have).\n\nI also seem to have a problem with water and swelling in my throat, wondering what to do?\n\nPlease leave a comment, any information and advice means a lot! I fully understand what you are going through and the very justified panic you are having about this! It is so hard to guess at diagnoses online because there are a lot of variant things that can cause the issues you see in MCAS, including straight up allergies and other things. However, what you are describing certainly sounds like some of the elements of MCAS. The trick is finding someone willing to do the proper testing, but as I have learned, that can be very hard. And you would want someone willing to fully look into all that you are experiencing in case it is something else!\n\nI want to mention briefly what happened to me, as I had literally never heard of MCAS and my doctor surprise tested me for it and diagnosed me with it because he is outstanding. I suffered with many of the things you did and other unexplained symptoms for 16 years. I primarily suffered from gastro symptoms and horrific joint and muscle pain that came and went, along with rashes, stuffy nose related to food intolerance, and other strange things like repeated iritis. Randomly I would get swollen glands and my tongue/mouth would swell as well. I was diagnosed at various times with ulcerative colitis, microscopic colitis, Crohns, Lyme disease, gluten intolerance, dairy intolerance, and other food intolerance's. Many of my other symptoms got shrugs or ignored entirely for those 16 years. Last fall my food intolerances randomly expanded from 5 things to everything, and it started causing me heart palpitations and weird problems where I would wake up gasping at night, terrifying! But I focused on the nightmare gastro symptoms and changed to my 6th gastroenterologist at a top research hospital in Boston to see if he could help. \n\nHe was immediately alarmed by my medical history and current problems and requested I go in for a endoscopy and colonscopy as fast as possible. These procedures and the biopsies invalidated all of the gastro diagnoses I listed above, but the biopsies for the lower procedure were positive for MCAS! How? The amount of cells in my 4 biopsies were 3x - 5x a normal persons. I think a normal person's biopsy has 25-30 cells in it, my lowest was 90 and my highest was over 135! The diagnosis in that case was MCAS and I am being treated now and am awaiting clinical trials for a future treatment. I also had he tryptase and urine test after my positive diagnosis via biopsy and they were negative, so that test is not great! \n\nHope this helps, do not stop fighting until you find a doctor willing to check EVERYTHING. They exist, but they are not easy to find, took me almost half of my life to get diagnosed! Sorry to hear about your symptoms. I do not know of docs in Canada that will do the testing but Anne Maitland is an allergist in NY that could test for MCAS if that is possible to see her. I am sorry this is happening to you.\n\nIf you inhale air that passes over an item of food, without eating the food, do you feel anything in your throat?  \n\nI have to test everything before I eat it in this way.  If I feel a little pain in my airway when I inhale a little air off food, then I know I cannot eat it without severe symptoms.  I could get a bag of carrots, and two thirds of the carrots will bother me, and the rest will not.\n\nI do not have an MCAS diagnosis.  The only diagnosis I ever got was \"reactive airway\", which does not really mean anything. So, I am forced to figure out my own solution to the problem.  I experiment a lot.  I discovered bread yeast neutralizes whatever triggers the reactions in my airway.  So I eat a lot of homemade breads.  Maybe you can experiment and discover solutions that work for you? hi, thank you so much for your comment! I am sorry you went through that, but am happy you finally received a diagnosis. since I live in Canada, I cannot actually switch doctors to find a new one (I think it may possible, but just extremely difficult). and my main doctor does not believe me, which is not great. \n\nif you do not mind me asking, what medication are you taking? has it helped specific symptoms or just in general helped? \n\nalso what foods did you find \"safe\" to eat when you were undiagnosed (the 5 things you mentioned you were down to eating)? hi! thank you for your suggestion. do you know if she takes international patients? Not sure - you would need to contact her office interesting! thanks for your suggestion, I am sorry your having to go through this too. I will definitely give these things a try.\n\nAre there specific foods that seem \"safe\" for you to eat, even without these techniques? Not really.  A key substance in creating my trigger appears to be produced by a microbe (possible an acetic acid bacteria), is water soluble, and can often pass through plastic.  So it is ubiquitous right now.  I tried buying things over the internet from around the world and they all have this stuff in it.  Before I knew as much as I know now, back 20 years ago, I could not test foods at the store.  I would buy large bags of single item foods.  20lb bag of rice, 10lb bag of beans, lentils, dried peas, etc.  If a meal from a new bag of food bothered my stomach, I would donate it or give it to family/friends.  If it did not bother me I would add it to my collection of what I could eat.  My airway was not as bad back then. I remember having more luck back then than I do now finding safe food.  Not sure if I am worse or if the world got worse. That is too bad about the doctor thing. As you can imagine, I have racked up some incredible health care bills over the years because of our private system, the only advantage I guess has been changing doctors to find a good one, which again, took 16 years and 10+ doctors! \n\nAs for medications, I am on liquid Cromolyn for only the past 2 weeks, it takes a month to show results, so jury is out there. I was also placed on Cholestrymine to control GI symptoms and it works really well. In addition to that, I was already taking H1 and H2 blockers for other issues, allegra and pepcid, so I just decided to keep taking them, neither is prescribed but I have read they can help.\n\nAnd my safe foods during my worst episode were eggs, a gluten and casein free pork sausage by Applegate, gf and df plain corn chips, rice and bananas. It was brutal and only started to ease up after eating only that for over a month and taking the Cholestrymine. I expanded my diet more after, but was still more limited than what I was 8 months ago, so we are trying Cromolyn to help that. I started to get sick maybe seven years ago and nothing really made sense to me. I took pictures and tried to document things that were happening to me. I would take pictures of food labels when I reacted, write down dates of when I reacted to something new, and I would take pictures of my mouth if I had a reaction that caused a visible difference. This helped my doctor believe something was wrong and established trust. That same doctor diagnosed me with MCAS over five years after I started going to him, mainly because I had been seeing him since before he was even aware of what MCAS really was. \n\nYour doctors seem to not be believing you, so I say document everything you can and open your mind to other possible diagnoses. Focus on the symptoms, and maybe your doctor will be more open to doing tests and exploring options for what is wrong with you. It took a while for my doctor to realize I was not just another patient with adult onset allergies. An MCAS diagnosis often takes ruling out a lot of other medical conditions, including things like Celiac Disease and autoimmune issues like Lupus. I have normal tryptase levels on tests, and the only way we were able to find something different about me on tests was via an endoscopy with staining for mast cells. I do carry an epipen, which he gave me after the first time my throat swelled up. I understand other patients have not been as lucky. I know this is not the helpful answer you are looking for, but it seems like with your position in your medical system, establishing credibility and trust is probably the most important step right now. Good luck. The journey for a diagnosis for many of us was long and full of scary incidents of throat swelling and always feeling sick from food that should be nourishing us. I would be careful about long term pepcid. Long term antacid use has caused mast cell- like sensitization issues in some Are the potatoes and oats your eating organic or coventially grown?\nI personally react to pesticides (with mouth and throat swelling) on foods and have had to resort to growing a lot of my own food and other complicated ways to purchase foods. Happy to chat more if this feels like something you would like more info on.\nI was once down to 3 foods. I am now almost up 40, there is hope! \nIf your living in a water damaged or moldy home thay can cause increased mast cell reactivity. This is my big thing, when I moved into a mold free home my reactivity went down considerably. If you have POTS and what sounds like MCAS, you may want to look into Ehlers Danlos Syndrome as well. I am not saying you have it, I just did a cursory read of your post and it sounds like you do have MCAS as well. They are often found in a triad so I just wanted to put EDS on your radar since it may explain something MCAS does not, either now or in the future. \n\nI know it is difficult, especially when you have been shot down so many times, but go into your doctors appointments with as much confidence as possible. Narrow your symptoms down to top 3 complaints, and then 2-3 more of your most severe. Do not include symptoms that can be explained by POTS or any other formal diagnoses you have, since the doctor will know you have those when they read you have POTS. Most importantly, go in with a plan. When I practiced saying \u201cThese are my symptoms. I have been tested for X, Y, and Z and they were negative. I am hoping you can help me get to the bottom of this because all I know is something is wrong. I have looked into MCAS and it resonates with me, and I am hoping to ______.\u201d \nGo in with a goal. Whether it be getting some specific testing, trying cromolyn sodium for one month, whatever. But asking something specific of them can be helpful.", "\"Mind your own business\" syndrome (social pressure) Does anyone else have to deal with people kind of bullying them as they try to deal with their symptoms?\n\nSome major triggers for me are secondhand smoke, dirty shower water (and the mold it creates), and even the vapors of certain foods.\n\nSo when I am in an apartment or hotel, I spend most of my team cleaning up, patching doors as shut as I can, vacuuming in case anything drifts in, and of course lots of medication.\n\nBut now and then I get some jerk who basically says \"mind your own business!\" or \"I am trying to sleep!\" because my coughing and sneezing and moaning in agony at the full-body itching disturbs them from their precious Mary Jane session. \n\nSometimes I get someone coming to my door while I am dealing with max-volume symptoms and *veeeerrryyy* passive-aggressively saying in front of the door, to no one in particular, **\"Gee,** ***now*** **what is it?\"**\n\nDo any of you deal with this sort of thing, and is it socially acceptable (if I ever find I have the energy) to burst out of my door and scream \"I *AM* minding my own business!\", do you think?\n\nFor me the peer pressure to shut up and sit in my corner is and always has been the worst symptom by far, I have had a lifetime of it, more importantly I have had *enough* of it, and I would rather get a broken nose from annoying the wrong person than pretend I am subhuman. My husband buys food I cannot be around, with the understanding that he will eat it at work or at least in a different room. This is not food that has to be heated up, a different room will not work for that. Then he forgets and eats his food near me. I try not to say anything because I do not want the conflict, then I end up with symptoms I cannot hide. Last time, it was so bad I was not able to take my inhaler and I was trying to get my nebulizer started and he was running around gathering up all of his junk food instead of helping me. Then he stood there and bitched about how much he spent on his junk food and how he had to give it away because i could not be reasonable. I was too short of breath to explain that wanting to be able to breathe in my own house is a reasonable expectation. That sounds pretty mean... Did your symptoms get worse or has he been around you the entire time with this? Yeah, exactly that kind of thing. From what I have seen, some people are kind of trained to believe that allergies and other \"invisible\" maladies are overstated, do not exist, or have some amount of choice involved.\n\nI used to see it a lot in the children's ward of the hospital when I was really little. Most people would see a kid with a nebulizer and think that they were having a bad time. But occasionally someone would shake their head and react like it was primarily a way to get attention.\n\nNo matter what symptoms you show, some people just seem wired to believe that you could be trying harder.\n\nI am not convinced it is intentionally mean or cruel, it seems to be a regional/cultural/political ingrained belief. My symptoms started five years ago. We have been married 23 years. Recently I have been too tired to cook dinner a couple nights a week, so he is been buying sandwich fixings and I cannot be around his bread or mayo. We tried having him eat at restaurants when I am too tired to cook, but then I react to his farts. We were both abused as children. I think we are not over it as much as we thought we were. He wants to \"get our story straight\" before I go to the doctor, even though we are not doing anything we need to cover up. He will also ask if I need to go to the hospital as if it is some kind of punishment for not being ok. I know those are echoes of his childhood. \n\n He goes to my doctor visits because I want him to feel like he is part of the team working on my health, although I have never told him that is why I ask him to go. One of our kids also has MCAS. Oh ok, I can see that being difficult I am sorry You are reminding me of my life a lot. One of my closest friends acts like they are sneaking around and have to say the right thing or they will be hurt.\n\nI hope that in the future you and he are able to have a more open sort of communication, if you think that would help. Have you considered that mold toxicity is the root cause of your mast cell problems? I mean, I will consider anything, test hypotheses, etc. I think a lot of people with MCAS/co are used to being their best advocates and doing a lot of self-research to figure out what their problems are.\n\nSo far, though, while mold is definitely an extreme trigger for me (as it is for most), my actual hospitalizations and \u201cspontaneously vomit on the floor\u201d episodes have been from animals/industrial cleaning agents/etc entering professionally-treated \u201cknown good\u201d environments, occurring quickly enough that I was pretty sure it was them.\n\nI do agree that mold is one of the invisible killers of our time though, and that the lax attitudes past generations of humanity have had about mold should be left in the past.\n\nOf course, my original rant applies. :) I did not have a fun time convincing a friend\u2019s parents that the black mold they had in their house their whole lives was anything bad. Mondo \u201cmind your own business\u201d response there.\n\n\nSomewhat related, I ran across this and found it to be a fascinating read: \n\ntl;dr: Researchers found that for every PM 2.5 10 ug/m3 the mortality rate goes up slightly over 1% for people &gt;65 years old and 1 ppb of ozone takes it up about 0.5%. (So theoretically almost anyone has at least a little more risk.)\n\ne.g. Between 50 and 100 AQI is a multiple-percentage increase in mortality rate - regardless of other influences - as far as I can gather.\n\nExplains why one of my triggers is simply \u201cbeing alive and within 50 miles of a developed city around rush hour\u201d, ha ha.\n\n\nThere is a lot of stuff to keep track of, unfortunately. The more I live with this diagnosis the more I see the air for what it is - a lightweight chemical soup that anyone can add to, and most people do not care what they add to it. 50 miles is 80.47 km Mold toxicity can be the underlying cause of MCAS, and multiple chemical sensitivities is one of the big symptoms of it, which it sounds like you have. You could look into treating and detoxing mycotoxins, and get your home tested for mold with a ERMI test As alluded to, I test and treat already, this is not my first rodeo :) But good advice for anyone! I did not understand that is what you were saying", "Arsenic in rice So my diet became limited to oats, rice, and flash frozen chicken as my stomach became more and more sensitive over the past few weeks. I recently realized that it got so bad when I started eating rice again, then it got much, much worse when I switched from white to brown rice. Today I have been learning about the high arsenic content in rice, especially brown. I had been eating 3 servings a day, long grain brown rice from Target. Now my stomach is so flared I cannot tolerate my meds, cannot get any Vitamin C or magnesium in, which help my symptoms a lot usually.\n\nFor as bad as it is and the time frame, plus the amount I would been eating, I am pretty sure it is the arsenic content. Has anyone else ever had a problem with this? My system is so sensitive I just react to everything. I also cannot tolerate Pepcid or Tagamet so I have been taking up to 60mg of Zyrtec a day to cope with the severe GI pain. Do you wash your rice? If you wash it thoroughly you mitigate any problems the arsenic might cause you. I rinsed it off twice, but perhaps not well enough? I was reading you should cook it in 6x the amount of water then drain the excess. I do really wonder if these things are enough to fully remove the arsenic though. I believe that most rice is also sprayed with corn, but that you can buy specialty versions without it. Good to know - thanks. I am sorry you are going through this.  \n\nI was on a diet high in rice for many years because it was one of the few foods I could tolerate at the time.  I ate white jasmine rice that I rinsed 4-5 times before cooking.  I had not special reason for doing this at the time.  It just seemed to agree with me.  Though, supposedly white long grain rice that is rinsed has less arsenic.  Who really knows.\n\nThat all being said, there are lots of low concentration contaminants in foods.  Some are known, but most are unknown.  Focusing on things you read about like arsenic is not the right way to go.  Listen to your body.  Use your body's feedback to construct a diet that is right for you.\n\nBest wishes. I have this same problem. But I did not ever think it was arsenic, but phytic acid.\nWhite rice is all I can eat. You mentioned you washed the rice, however, do you actually rinse it, let it sit and soak in water (for up to 6-12 hours) , drain, rinse, then cook it? Same for the oats. You can look up more information on phytates, and how to do this method. Worth a try as I believe this would help! Lundberg California rice has the lowest arsenic. I get the organic white basmati. \n\nYou could try millet. I ate tons of millet for years. \n\nQuinoa is another option. \n\nNote that apple juice also contains arsenic. Who knows how much arsenic is in our food chain.", "Decreasing Cromolyn sodium I think I have been reacting to Cromolyn, probably because I went up on it faster than I should have back in January. I was on 8 vials/day. There were times where I felt it bothered me, gave me a stomachache or headache. Other times it fine. Actually most times. It was not a super obvious trigger like a high histamine food. But I was not getting better, and I thought it may be the culprit.\n\nSo since the end of February, I have been trying to taper off it. First time, decreased two vials, got horrible brain fog, flushing, and acid reflux. Took a week of returning to original dose to get back to baseline. Second attempt, I decreased by just one vial and it was, well, half as bad, but still horrendous. Then, three weeks ago, I began tapering at a rate of little less than half a vial a week (2 mL). In that time, I have gradually gotten worse to the point I can no longer tolerate Benadryl, Famotidine, or even Zyrtec. I notice I am more reactive to Cromolyn itself, too.\n\nSo I am going to slowly increase to the 8 vials a day of Cromolyn again. Should I just stick it out for a couple months and see if I can \u201cforce\u201d my body to 100% tolerate it? I know medicines can sometimes both help and hurt me, that is, they do their job, but I still react to them. Example, Famotidine could really help my GI pain and occasional reflux, but also gave me intense migraines, tinnitus/misophonia, and mood problems (and yes I even got it compounded).\n\nI am just afraid because if I cannot tolerate Cromolyn, then I want to get off it, but it seems getting off it is totally impossible, and now I am in the worst shape I have ever been in. I feel horrible all the time from brain fog, misophonia, tinnitus, GI pain, and fatigue, and I can only eat 6 foods :(\n\nLooking for any input or advice, or anyone with similar experiences. My allergist has not been the most helpful. Thank you. Unfortunately I have nothing, I am just curious if anyone else has advice. So, at my worst I could only eat four foods and one of them doubled as the only thing I could put on my skin (olive oil). I could not tolerate any OTC medications except Zyrtec (no idea why this was ok), even Benadryl was a problem. My doctor prescribed me famotidine and dipenhydramine without fillers. I introduced them very gradually one by one and they were fine. My issues turned out to be with the fillers. I did not react well to cromolyn so my doctor prescribed ketotifen without fillers. If you have not tried things without fillers, you might want to. If a medication is causing you a reaction, there are usually alternatives. According to my doctors, continuing to take things that cause reactions is not good. I hope you start feeling better soon. So sorry you are going through all of this. It sounds like you were doing better on 8 vials more often than you were not doing well. And decreasing the dosage has increased your symptoms. So I think you could conclude that this medication is not causing you harm.\n\nThere are so many possible triggers in MCAS. I think you have ruled out (to some extent) that Cromolyn is triggering your symptoms. (If something is triggering me and I am exposed to it everyday, I do not have good days and will get increasingly worse. I am not diagnosed yet and know my experience is not true for everyone.) \n\nSo there are two other paths to follow here. One is to look for other triggers\u2014diet, environmental, etc. The other is to consider other treatments that might help alleviate the responses to those triggers. Yeah, I would agree overall I was doing better on 8 vials \u2013 able to walk outside (though that was before the pollen hit), cook a meal once or twice a week. I was not exactly in good shape, but the difference between then and now is night and day...\n\nI am still on Motegrity for constipation actually, and I definitely know that is a trigger but I cannot really get off it. Think the constipation is from POTS, which I am working really hard on treating so hopefully I can stop Motegrity.\n\nThanks for your input. So I know I have reacted to fillers but I have also reacted to drugs themselves. When you have been reactive to a drug due to its filler, were you reactive the whole time the drug was active? Sometimes I feel like I react to a drug for maybe an hour or so then it kicks in and I am fine, which I assume means I am reacting to the filler but it could also be that the drug itself (say, Zyrtec) overrides my reaction TO IT?\n\nAnd thank you :) Constipation is super common just in MCAS, too. It sucks. I hope you find something that works. \n\nLast week I stumbled on this chapter about GI issues in MCAS. I have not plowed through it yet tbh, but there might be something useful in it for you.  Happy to help! So, the only way to figure out if you are having an issue with fillers vs the active ingredient is to try the regular formulation and if you have a reaction to try it with only the active ingredient. What I mean by try it is gradually introduce it in a way that minimizes the risk of a systemic reaction. This is what my doctors have me do - no more than one new supplement/medication/food per week - day one make a paste and put it on your forearm and if there is no reaction after 24 hours move on, put a little on your lip and wait 24 hours and if no reaction move on, touch to your tongue and if no reaction within 15 min try ingesting 1/16 of a dose and if no reaction after 24 hours move on, try ingesting 1/8 of a serving and so on until you reach a full dose. If something was going to be problematic I would generally get a rash on day one or feel weird on day two. Thanks so much! This is really helpful. No problem! If you have any other questions, happy to try and answer them or point you in the right direction. Hope you start feeling better soon! Ah this looks like a really informative read! Printing it out now, thanks so much Hi Op,  \n\nFor what it is worth, cromolyn lowers stomach acid by 40%.  \nThis is no joke. I was similar to you where the list of foods I could tolerate was down to a very slim one.  \nIt turns out that it was the cromolyn that was the cause of majority of my food intolerances, as well as other sensitivities as low stomach acid leads to dysbiosis and undigested food getting into your gut, as well as IBS, SIBO, constipation, malnutrition.  \n\nYou should expect an initial reaction when you stop cromoyln - the gastric environment will rebound after having acid levels suppressed - hence the over-production of acid and reflux.  \n\nOver-production of gastric acid means over-production of gastric histamine.  \nHowever for me it got better with time, but it is still getting there.  \n\nI was on cromolyn for 19 months and it seriously damaged my health.  \nI have been off it for one week and I feel WAY better.  \n\nI am still battling the histamine/MCAS problems I was put on it for - which I plan to start taking quercetin for.  \nBut all in all my general health is improving.  \n\nSee my other threads about this:  \n  \n Yeah, I saw your post, and it is definitely given me pause. I am not totally confident in this med, but I am going to give it another go just because decreasing just two vials was so unbearable I was totally dysfunctional. I am terrified of getting off it but realize I may need to at some point.\n\nI really hope your symptoms improve while off of it. So sorry to hear about its impact on you, but your insight into this med has given me some helpful perspective, so thank you. I mean, if one is not prone to lower stomach acid in the first place, maybe one can handle cromolyn fine - otherwise this side-effect would be much more wide-spread and well known.", "If you have this and got the vaccine - are you having issues? I am over a month out.  I had moderna. Shot 1 was not bad, fatigue for most of a day. Shot 2 was terrible and after like 3 days of symptoms I was still having trouble with my endurance for normal type stuff did like 2 weeks. Did not notice any specific mast cells being angry symptoms. Shot 2 was yesterday. Both times I had a low fever and considerable arm pain. This time it looks like there is an egg under my skin and it is bright red. Brain fog too. My mom just got her second Pfizer today; she waited an extra week (got dose two at the 4 week mark instead of 3) she was worried it increased her BP but she did not start checking her BP until 2 weeks after dose 1 so she is not sure if the vaccine caused her high BP or not. She went on beta blockers now for 2 weeks and it is definitely lowered. She was worried about getting the second shot but honestly her getting Covid being high risk already was worse odds than reaction from the vaccine. Plus she is now on BP meds and it is controlled so she felt better about it. She got the shot 5 hours ago and said she has a headache and is getting a stomach ache and nausea right now. She is going to try and eat and lay down. I will update if anything changes I got both shots of Pfizer as directed. The first shot I felt headachey and tired, and the next day I had a very sore arm and a lot of fatigue. For the second shot I actually felt fine until the next day, then I got hit with a headache, fever, aches, chills, fatigue. But those symptoms resolved by the third day. I previously reacted in an autoimmune fashion to vaccines years ago, so I went into this very cautious, but so far I am doing great and have not had any issues.\n\nFor what it is worth, I did pre-medicate about 1 hour before both shots (1500 mg quercetin and 1 cetirizine) and then took a repeat dose of quercetin about 2 hours after the shot. This may have helped. I generally only take quercetin and cetirizine now to control pop-up allergy symptoms because my mast cell activation is fairly well controlled now. I am over a month out on J&amp;J. No issues from the vaccine Hi over a month out on J&amp;J, I am Dad! :) So far so good over here I am fully vaccinated and 2 weeks after my second shot, my stomach symptoms went from awful and consistent to almost nonexistent. I was so happy and hoping I was cured, but after a month or so I had a relapse. I still think the vaccine helped my immune system out though. Unfortunately not a cure \ud83d\ude22", "I am so happy! ", "What can I do to reduce full body itching whilst in self-isolation? I am a long ways away from seeing a dermatologist or allergist, and I am unsure if I can go to my GP anytime soon for some reason...  \n\n\nFor the past few months my arms, legs, and some of my trunk has been itching. It gets worse at night but it is not insect bites. (I can tell based on the time the itching starts - usually soon after sunset while I am still awake). I am taking a high dose of Benadryl and certrizine and I am using a Betaderm cream on the most itchy spots but I am still tearing my skin apart. (I mean that literally. My arms and legs are covered in scabs from all the scratching.)   \n\n\nAny tips besides trying to wash things more frequently? Some dermatologists are able to see patients via video conference, and it is covered by insurance. Just see a doctor that is in-network. Colloidal oatmeal baths. \n\nEpsom salts baths. \n\nBaking soda baths. \n\nKeri oil baths. \n\nCool or lukewarm water. No hot water. \n\nNo soap! Bathe less often. Or give the dirty spots a sponge bath and leave the rest alone. \n\nI do not know why it gets worse at night but it do. Usually I have eaten the wrong thing and I wake up with neuropathy at 3 am.  Being careful with My diet lets me sleep. I am not in the US, thank goodness.\n\nNo worries about \u201cin network\u201d anything here. Just a small annoyance getting referrals. It is worse at night due to Prostaglandins are usually elevated at night. \n\nI eat at night only because I do not like reacting during the day... Hives are typically worse, along with flushing. Pruritis at night is worse because Prostaglandins are elevated at night due to your skin going through repair at night. Lack of sleep will also cause a disruption of Prostaglandins. In addition, stress will elevate Prostaglandins. \n\nCox 1 and Cox 2 inhibitors will reduce Prostaglandins. Moreso, CoX 2 inhibitors will be better at this. \n\nIf YOU DO NOT REACT to aspirin. I would try a low dose to see if it helps. Zyrtec seems to be especially effective on itching.  I would suggest increase that.  From my reading the 10mg/day value was just \"effective and generally not sedating\" not that it was dangerous or something to do more.", "What is going on with the Mod of that other group? I feel like people are going to do a search for this once they find out that they might have it, and they are going to want to find answers and now, one of the main things that you would think a group like that would be about, the moderator of that group is banning because he does not like it despite the fact that many people are disagreeing with him.\n\nI do not get it. Is it supposed to be a social club? Is it supposed to be a sub where we talk about the adventures, fun and experiences of having this disease? (Sarcasm)\n\nSome of that moderators on Reddit...\n\nThat guy is pure selfish, and it is actually sad for me to see that he is interested in what he wants over wanting to help people who are searching for answers for something that is causing them great suffering. What an A-Hole.\n\nIf this post is too controversial, feel free to remove it. Sorry, I cannot stand people like that though. Hi the mod over there is actually female, and idk she just snapped that is why I created this sub. I am honestly not sure she even has the disease, and from seeing her post history I am much more knowledgeable on the subject I have a confirmed diagnosis and have been dealing with it for 10 plus years. But yea it is got really bad over there I made this sub so people can freely talk. And so I could help people out and answer questions since I have been dealing with It for a long period of time. \n\nBut the mod over there went off the deep end and it is just not a very friendly place. And Seriously if you look through her post history it is like all SkinCare Addiction, and beauty stuff. Plus it does not even sound like hes on a mast cell regmine and only takes a few things like H2's. I would like to know if she actually had a diagnosis or she just self diagnosed from reading the internet.  \n\nBut no pls leave this post so others can see what is going on. Well yeah, but when people do a search on Reddit they are going to see that other group and see that there is more members and then there is about four other Mast Cell groups that have only a handful of members so there has to be a way to advertise so that people know that they need to come to this group instead of the other one. I will keep posting on the other sub links to this one, but what is going on over there is awful. This should be a place where people can freely talk. People can ask all the questions they want and I will try to answer them and I am sure the bigger this sub gets the more people can answer also. Moderation is thankless work. I think it is pretty wild that you made an entire sub out of spite and did not even know the other mods gender. I doubt seriously it is out of spite, because you want to know what? I had to post my question here to get answers as well and she did not remove my question about diagnosis of symptoms, and the other mod did even though it was upvoted several times and several people were commenting on the post.\n\nBesides, the moderator from the other group literally said, go make another group if you do not like this one so I do not think there is anything wrong with this person starting this group at all and I think that you are just virtue signaling or maybe friends with a moderator of the other group. But your comment is completely off base. I am the one that actually made the sub and it was not out of spite the other does not allow diagnosis questions and I think that is wrong. Plus she was banning people left and right. And she said go make a new sub if you do not like it so I thought that was a good idea. It is fine to start another sub but I think it is gross to trash the other mod.\n\nEdited to add: wtf is virtue signaling?! I did not start this and I do not even know the person who did, but unfortunately I think it is gross to delete my post that I spent a lot of time working on, when I am literally suffering and trying to get help, even though a ton of other people were up folding it and commenting on enthusiastically, just because the mod is selfish and wants things to be the way she wants it to be and screw everybody else.\n\nWhat the hell does she have a group about an illness for when no one is allowed to talk about the illness?\n\nWhat is it a Mast Cell Activation Syndrome fan club? Smh I do not know the other mod but I have gotten a lot of value out of her sub and I also think the diagnosis questions make it so hard to get help with the day-to-day challenges of living with mast cell bullshit. ( Thanks for not answering my question What was your question? You should look at ( comment history. Here is a direct quote:  \n\"Because it is my sub and I say so. I made this for people to discuss their lives not spend their lives discussing others.\"\n\nThe whole \"my sub\" thing does not seem like the right attitude for building a community. I agree being a good moderator is difficult, thankless work. Being a bad moderator appears to be a powertrip for some. You obviously have not paid attention to how the mod is acting we are not trashing her. Not only that i have personal doubt the mod even has a mast cell disease I do not see a history of her using much medication outside of Zantac. Mast cell people are on handfuls of meds and have to get them compounded a lot of the time. And also her saying this is \u201cmy sub\u201d is really bad I just want people to freely talk and ask questions and help each other. Yeah... That will do it. Subs with mods like that will eventually wither away and die a slow death. Thanks for making this sub that took me off guard when that rule came up since I found it to be very supportive preciously. Its incredibly hard to get diagnosed so I dont understand why the gatekeeping is necessary, Ive had doctors that could not diagnose but tried the medication regime to see if symptoms improve.. which is something I know Ive suggested people to request when they cant find a doctor to diagnose. We have to look out for each other. Yeah, my doctor thinks I might have MCAS so, went to Reddit to try and ask some questions and saw that I cannot post those in that group. Disappointing but glad this one exists! Why would she delete anything she \u201cfeels\u201d is a diagnostic question? The most helpful advice there is pointing out resources to help people who do not have a diagnosis yet ask the right questions! Mast Cell diseases are so rare it is complete bullshit to ban people from essentially asking questions. She just took down a post I made asking about COvID and MCAS....my son has an official diagnosis and I was just curious if anyone had experienced the virus....wth!", "Looking for input  Might be a silly question, but are you on H2 blockers? I take a pepsid in the morning and a Claritin why is that bad? Could it be making me worse? No, not that I know of. I asked because mast cell patients often find that H2 blockers, in particular, help with symptoms all around. I found one particularly helpful for pain.\n\nStabilizers can help too... I have the same issues. \n\nTry wearing a **mask** if you cannot avoid inhaling the fumes from those products.\n\nTry putting about a tablespoon of ground **chicory** in a cup of hot water or a pot of coffee every day. I have been doing that since someone in this group mentioned chicory a few months ago and I have not felt like bugs are crawling on my skin since. I do not have any reason to believe that. Sorry if I gave that impression. See my other comment for details. I have those issues. I have accomodations at work and avoid any place with fragrance. I wear a filtered mask and I am on cromolyn sodium oral and Xolair. Also it is usual to take H1 and H2 blockers at 12 hour intervals but you should really see an allergist. Good, solid blog. By a scientist. Who has Mast Cell Disease. Start here. \n\n(\n\nIf your symptoms are MCAS, you need better medication.", "Are muscle relaxers a mast cell destabilized?  Not that I am aware of. I have taken them without issues. They are typically mast cell stabilizers but any drug can affect any person with mast cell disease differently.  Hell, the same person can have different reactions to the same drug on different days.", "Is tingling all over for hours on end an MCAS symptom? I know I have some form of MCAS/histamine intolerance based on other symptoms. However, I also likely have chronic infection and some other complex health stuff going on, so it is hard for me to parse out what causes what.\n\nLately, my symptoms have gotten worse and I cannot pinpoint why, but one of them is after eating certain things, my entire body starts tingling. Sometimes including my tongue. Last night it was because of a lentil soup, which I know can be higher histamine so I thought maybe that is why. \n\nI read somewhere that it could be moreso due to autonomic/nerve dysfunction but I have no idea. There is a hypothesis - a very highly speculative hypothesis.  Certain strains of acetic acid bacteria, AAB, produces a substance that interacts with a certain type of catalyst and with electromagnetic radiation.  This causes tingling sensations in the body.  Depending on the quantity of these three things (the product of the AAB, the catalyst, and the electromagnetic radiation) these sensations can become very profound. They can even become excruciatingly painful.  This theory was created as an attempt to explain electromagnetic hypersensitivity syndrome, EHS, and multiple chemical sensitivity, MCS.\n\nThe symptoms will begin in the stomach after ingesting vinegar produced with a certain strain of AAB.  Then the symptoms will spread to the abdomen and extremities (arms and legs) as the product of the AAB is digested into the bloodstream.  Eventually the symptoms will fade, and may reappear in the kidneys and bladder before the AAB substance is excreted from the body.\n\nIn this hypothesis, lots of people are experiencing this effect and being diagnosed, or self-diagnose, with all sorts of other illnesses. So you are saying that in this hypothesis, folks do not really have the syndromes you have listed, but instead they are experiencing the confluence of AAB+catalyst? \n\nMy tingling is often immediate, food does not even have time to reach the stomach. But I am also realizing I might just have low level tingling all the time so it is hard to say. Sometimes it will start with my tongue though, which is not too far off since it is first point of digestion. \n\nIs there a theoretical solution to this hypothesis? I used to experience localized tingling when my MCAS was first flaring - it was in response to eating high histamine foods, like banana. But it would usually only be in my face and neck, not anywhere else.\n\nThe only other time I experienced tingling like that was when I was having a lot of autoimmune thyroid flareups, which were causing pseudohypoxia (\"air hunger\"), in which my body did not have enough thyroid hormone, so my circulation was wonky. This would normally be accompanied with feeling short of breath, dizzy, flashes of being hot or chills, or sudden bouts of adrenaline that made me feel shaky and awful. \n\nI resolved both things by keeping to a strict low-histamine diet (with a few high histamine foods like arugula retained because I tolerated them well), and by having my endocrinologist adjust my thyroid dose to get my thyroid hormone back to a healthy level. \n\nSome more ideas to investigate: POTS (post orthostatic tachycardia syndrome) and vasovagal responses, see if either of those seem to align with your experience. I also had a friend that experienced days of full body numbing and tingling, and discovered it was caused by the estrogen hormonal pills they were on, so that can be a cause too. Unfortunately with the unusual symptoms MCAS and its related conditions can cause, a lot of it is researching on your own and bringing medical journals to your doctor for further evaluation. Hmm, thanks for sharing. I am starting to think it is not really a mast cell thing because while the tingling seems to start after food, but it just goes on for hours and that is not the usual, flushing for an hour type reaction I normally have. And does not match up with the episodic nature of the illness. I am also already following a low histamine diet and it has worked quite well for me up until this point. \n\nI have considered and thought I ruled out POTS in the past, but I might re-visit it. Not taking any pills like that but a good suggestion! The weird thing is I have not changed anything in my routine really regarding meds. That is why I figured it might be a histamine or mcas reaction because I might have eaten some higher histamine foods by accident, so I was curious if it was a common experience amongst others. The fact that it is not actually makes me feel better because I keep worrying the mcas will get out of control.\n\nThankfully I am working with an integrative doc who believes in and has heard of all this stuff so I am in good hands, but she is super busy and scattered so I do not get to ask her in detail stuff like this. Thanks again for your input! Yes, tingling is the symptom that alerted my doctor to MCAS. My tingling gets worse with sugar and goes away with chicory. High histamine foods never made a difference for me. Full disclosure.  Its my theory.  After 30 years, this is the best theory that can explain everything I experience with my health.\n\nThe treatment is to avoid triggers.\n\nThe catalyst is in my bloodstream. So, maybe it is bioaccumulated into the body.  Maybe the body or a microbe produces the catalyst.  If the catalyst is bioaccumulated, avoiding the catalyst may have long term benefits.  However, the catalyst appears very common and is hard to avoid.  If the catalyst is bioaccumulated, an attempt to desensitize from the catalyst would have the opposite effect.\n\nIn the theory, the catalyst and sufficient energy (heat, EMF, etc.) changes the nature of the AAB substance.  I have no idea what happens next.  It could be a plain old fashion immune reaction that happen next.  However, since the allergen would be the modified AAB substance, the allergen is probably too complicated for an allergist to come up with a way to desensitize a person.  Also, what happens next could be any number of biological processes.  The modified AAB substance could bind with a receptor in cells setting off a chain reaction.  It could interfere with a metabolic process.  Take any theory for poorly understood illnesses and this modified AAB substance could be the trigger they are missing from their theory. One more thing.  The EMF.  To get the body tingling you need more than cell phones and wifi.  You need the types of confined high energy beams that come out of large dish antenna on satellite communications ground stations.  Try to find large satellite dishes in google maps in a 20-mile radius around your location.  If you find them, draw a line between the dishes and your location.  Mark some street locations that cross the line.  Eat some food that causes the tingling.  Then get in the car and drive to and away from the points you have marked on the line.  If you are experiencing a reaction involving the EMF in a satellite communication beam, you will figure it out this way.  The tingling will get worse along the line and get better away from that line.  Keep in mind they turn on and off and move those beams.  Sometimes it takes a few tries to convince yourself what is happening. I developed small fiber sensory neuropathy and the cause were my borderline B12 level but I also had a folate deficiency. The neuropathy would present mainly as numbness and it would come and go mainly on my legs, but the tingly sensation was mainly on me back. It was a really creepy sensation. I see your B12 levels are fine, but what is your folate level? Good point actually. I definitely think it is some form of neuropathy, it is a pretty unsettling sensation for sure. I have been barely eating anything because I get reactions so much, but because I never lose weight and bloodwork has been fine every time I check, I always assume my nutrient levels are fine but I do not think I have had folate checked recently. That said, I probably actually should get b12 levels checked again too since it is been a few months and I am eating even less now. \n\nDid you do the thing where you figured out if you have the mthfr mutation, and if that contributed to your deficiency? No I did not check for the mthfr mutation. My rheumatologist ordered the folate tests when the neuropathy results came back positive, in addition to something like 20 other tests, as he felt that I did not hit any of the usual causes for neuropathy, so he was very thorough. I am glad because it was not on anyone's radar! I can absorb folate just fine, I just was not getting enough. Very interesting! Yeah I am thinking my folate was not checked actually. I am working with an integrative doc who I am hoping will order that for me. Thanks for the tip :) \n\nIf you do not mind me asking, did you notice your neuropathy was 24/7, or had any triggers specifically? I am noticing mine when I wake up, but also mostly after I eat, which is why I thought it might be the mast cell stuff. It was really hard to notice a pattern since I had so much going on at once. But the different symptoms would come and go either daily or weekly. I never have any of those symptoms when I have a mast cell reaction now. Yeah I know noticing patterns is so hard. It is taken me 2 years of illness to find certain patterns, whereas it all just seemed like a shit show in the beginning. Well thanks for sharing!", "Recommendations for dietary changes and supplements for leaky gut symptoms and MCAS Experiencing digestive symptoms (D more than C) when eating many different foods - even those considered low histamine. Looking for supplement recommendations and dietary change recommendations. Already avoid gluten, dairy, most meats except chicken and pork and nearly all fruits and veggies now. Are these prescription I am guessing? Which mast cell stabilizer? I have tried Quercetin and H1 antihistamines like Ketotifen Have you tried organic corn husk (psyllium husk) for fiber? Also I am on a very (and I mean very) limited diet, but for fiber I eat about 4 slices of Canyon bakehouse gluten free bread - the 7 grain (but they also have mountain white too). So I usually intermittent fast until about 11am and eat 4 eggs and 2 slices of toast. I do not react to this bread which is nice, so at about 3pm I have two more slices of toast. Then at dinner time I eat chicken. honestly it sucks so bad, but my IBS is under control now in regards to bloating and D. \n\nThe only other thing I can think of to help bloating and cramps is Natural Calm - a powder supplement you can get at sprouts or order online. This helped quite a bit when I was having very severe IBS and D several times a day. \n\nGood luck! &gt; Canyon bakehouse gluten free bread\n\nThanks. I will give that bread a try. How do you prep your eggs just curious? Sure thing. \n\nI buy organic or better quality cage free/free range eggs (I am assuming most of us MCASers do for pesticide and preservative reaction mitigation). I use olive oil to cook them in. It is crazy that I am very allergic to olives but not olive oil. Every other oil I react with, and was using coconut oil for the longest time, as I reacted to it the least amount. Then one day I was forced to use olive oil and found I react to it very little and less than coconut oil. Quercetin is not prescription but yes, the one I take is a prescription. I take Cromolyn Sodium oral solution. I was taking them with nettles, awhile ago but was having reactions. I was taking some other supplements with them at the time as well, so they coulda been the culprit. I will do some research and maybe give them another go here soon. \n\nThanks for the reply! I am working with a dietitian who ordered this test for me: \n\nI have sensitivities to foods that I never would have guessed and now I am following a staged plan to reintroduce foods weekly. \n\nI cannot recommend it enough. I would have kept eating bland chicken and rice, but chicken was the food causing me the most issues. I never take new supplements or medications with anything else unless I have already vetted it and know its safe/I dont react. Otherwise I never know what is causing side effects. Same reason I dont take multi vitamins or B Complex. Too many things involved to know what Im reacting to. These supplement helped to stabilize my MastCell issue:\n\nPerilla extract pure one\n\nBaicalin powder Life mode \n\nNeuroProtek\n\nAnd LDN( prescription) I think the only way to get that over the counter were I live in US is nasal spray If I did not eat chicken I do not know what I would eat without reacting. What is LDN? Have you changed your diet at all? Low Dose Naltroxone. I have been on a low histamine diet for many years but nothing helped till I started LDN. It has changed my life. Talk to your Dr. LDN is a compounded medication you cannot get it from a regular Pharmecy.\nGood luck! Correct. Im in the US. Its a prescription but worth it. Does that help with more than just respiratory symptoms then or mostly those? That is how I felt. Taking that test gave me a customized weekly plan of foods to eat. Sounds like chicken is safe for you! That is awesome Cromolyn Sodium is in a prescription medication called Gastrocrom which is an oral liquid solution and stays local to the GI tract only - and that is the purpose of oral dosing. \n\nGastrocrom is hella expensive and my health insurance, Medicaid, did not cover it.  I understand many others have health insurance that covers it no problem.  I get it in pill form from a compounding pharmacy.  It is expensive, about $150 per month for me.  (if i paid out of pocket for 'Gastrocrom' it would be over $1000 per month)  I take two 100mg caps at least 30 min away from food and with at least 6oz of water.  I dose two or three times a day.  \n\n It has helped me quite a lot in tolerating food (though my diet is still rather limited) and generally calming my digestive system and now I do not want to be without it. There was a dosing curve for me (and many others, I understand) however and I had a real immune system flare during the approx 12 days it took me to slowly ramp up to recommended dosage.  I am glad I stuck it out. Something I realized recently is that the age of the good makes a difference. Leftovers are high in histamines, so the same meal that I am fine without one day will give me a reaction a couple days later. Low dose naltrexone is what got my similar symptoms under control, without major diet changes. Same, ldn was the game changer for me It also helped my neurological issues from MCAS in addition to the GI symptoms. \n\nI had a dosing curve, too. If I went too fast on dose increases I get migraines. It doesnt help my asthma but helps my anxiety, photophobia, and migraines (in addition to diarrhea, bloatibg, stomach cramps) Im sure there are others but those were the major issues I had. Well make sure it is not truly an MCAS issue if you are primarily having GI issues. Could it be FODMAPS for example? If so, onion and garlic and lactose are big culprits and are in everything. \n\nIn terms of triggers for those with mast cells issues, make sure you really figure out the culprit. I originally thought it was gluten since everyone said to avoid it. And I did feel better. Turns out the real culprit was yeast. I can eat gluten just fine. The reason I had troubles with pasta a lot of the time was the added wine in the sauce. Oops. I also react to specific food dyes. That took a long time to figure out. Try the carnivore diet. Only thing that has helped me.", "Face Masks save my life: Thank you MeO AIR! Hi all,\n\nThis is going to read like an advertisement for MeO Air masks - and well, it is of sorts. But I am not being paid anything.\n\n  \nI feel I owe them some gratitude because they have helped me so much - so here is a copy of an email I just wrote them.\n\n  \n( \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Hi Team,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I am just writing with a big THANK YOU.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I found and purchsed your product before the pandemic even started.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I was suffering major mast cell activation which means I have been becoming allergic to an ever-growing list of things, as well as having multiple chemical sensitivity.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This issue continues on to this day, and I honestly did not know how I was going to cope.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Imagine what it is like when you are\u00a0afraid of the entire world, because any small trace chemical, fragrance, or food you catch a smell of unexpectedly might set off a huge reaction and ruin your day for four to six hours.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Before long the anxiety associated with being in any kind of uncontrolled environment where you could be exposed to anything at any time is just as bad as the exposures themsleves.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;You start to recluse because you do not want to risk an exposure.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;There are days I dreadded even getting out of bed because every day was a gauntlet and gamble that I would get exposed to something, and carrying that worry all the time.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Winter was especially hard. People burning fires - one whiff and I am done as if a flash-bang grenade went off next to me, my senses overloaded and dulled.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Or if someone turns a heater on and it burns off a minute amount of dust which has settled on an element, same thing.\u00a0  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Sometimes I might not even smell it. For example a flat-mate heating up a wheat-bag in the microwave in the kitchen, then all of a sudden I am having a panic attack and I do not know why.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Anyway - that was before I found your masks.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;They have given my life back to a certain degree! And given me confidence that I am safe in certain situations.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;They really do work to shield me from whatever it is in these exposures which can set me off.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I do find that because they do not seal very well on the face, I need to constantly adjust them to ensure there are no air gaps under my eyes etc.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;If I am going into a situation where I know there is something that might affect me, I hold the mask on tight with my hands.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;But I cannot imagine life without my MeO masks now.\u00a0  \nI use them every day, and make a huge difference to my anxiety levels and rate of exposures.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;So thanks MeO!

So I talked about it with some of you guys the other day and a couple of you said that atarax would calm me down, and I had two separate doctors, a psychiatrist, that is a fill in for my regular psychiatrist, and my new Doctor Who does not know much about my history, and here is the problem with atarax..\n\nIf I have something in my system that is making me more tired, more tired than I usually would be which is already tired enough, I am going to freak the f*** out I am going to freak out and I am going to have a panic attack because I am tired and then the pressure to fall asleep is going to get more intense!!\n\nBut I need something to help I am in a dead panic right now because my sleep has been falling apart over the last week, and I am actually ready to just give up I am ready to give up and commit suicide honestly. I cannot go through another bout of f***** up insomnia for however long it takes to fix.\n\nSo I am stuck, last night I woke up in the middle of the night and I was having f****** problems, all sorts of problems, my eyes my brain is focused on my f****** eyes which hurt when I wake up in the middle of the night, even a slight bit which did not used to bother me unless I kept my eyes open for like an hour or more, I used to just be able to wake up, no problem and know that I was going to be able to fall asleep.\n\nEven on the roughest nights, but now, my brain is f***** and for some reason it is stuck on not being able to fall back asleep and that is a horror show it is an absolute horrific event.\n\nI would throw myself in the hospital right now, go in and have them keep me there until I can get through this, but, that is not going to happen because the beds there and the hospital are going to make my body feel toxic and worse and kick up my restless leg to high heaven, all of a sudden have body aches and pains and stiffness and weird toxic feeling, and I will not be able to sleep anyway.

I have had a good experience with hydroxyzine, but I do not take it for sleep or a mast cell disorder, but rather for anxiety. It can make me feel drowsy sometimes, and my anxiety is very health and body focused so I understand where you are coming from when you say it might make you panic. But the thing is, it is calming down the panic too; that is one of its prescribed uses, and what I use it for. If I take it when I am actually having a panic attack it does not make me feel sleepy, just calmer, and helps my physical symptoms of anxiety. But everyone is different. Also, when I took my first one (25mg) it did make me start to freak out a little and I called my mom in tears. She advised me to take another one, which the doctor told me I could, because 25mg is a very low dose for anxiety. After I took another one and talked to my mom longer I felt MUCH better and relaxed. That continued to be my experience.\n\nIt is clear from your post that your anxiety is very severe, to the point that you are contemplating suicide. You say you have a psychiatrist, so PLEASE reach out to your psychiatrist and be honest with him or her about how you are feeling. \nI finally started on Lexapro for my anxiety disorder 3 weeks ago and think it is starting to help already (it takes while to work). There are a LOT of medications to try, as well as non-medication strategies. I have found that a lot of my physical symptoms such as gastrointestinal problems and allergy symptoms are getting better as my anxiety gets better, and the symptoms I still have do not bother me like they used to. Treating anxiety and depression can not only help insomnia, but also help you not be so upset when you do not sleep well. You can definitely get through this! Thank you, on a side note I tried lexapro, and all that did is make me gain a ton of weight. Pay attention to the scale a little bit since you are taking it, because I have sleep apnea and it did not do me any favors. That is just my experience, but as you can see I have a lot of problems with medications whereas other people seem to do just fine.\n\nI was thinking tonight since I am already familiar with how it is going to make me feel that I will take 1 mg of Ativan and go back to bed and hope that I can carry myself through the night.\n\nAnd then maybe tomorrow when I am a little bit more clear-headed I can possibly mess around with the atarax. That sounds like a good plan!\n\nLexapro is actually the second daily medication I have tried because the first one, which I tried several months ago (buspirone) made me feel awful and worsened my panic attacks and overall mental health status for a few weeks before I went back to baseline, even though I only took it for a few days. My reaction was quite unusual, but yeah, everyone reacts differently to everything. It took me months to get up the courage to try something new, but my reaction to the Lexapro has been very undramatic. So you never know until you try.\n\nI am not a doctor but from what you have written, you would probably really benefit from continuing to work with your doctors to find a daily medication, and not use only benzos for anxiety which are best used infrequently as \u201crescue\u201d medicines, to my understanding. People can react differently to different SSRIs (there are quite a few besides Lexapro), which is only one of several classes of medications available.\n\nThe thing that helps me most in daily life with anxiety is exercise! Just 10 minutes of raising my heart rate high really calms me down and improves my mood. (I am trying to remind myself of that right now so I go exercise...)\n\nIf you continue to struggle with insomnia, I would recommend taking a look at CBT-I therapy (CBT for insomnia). I found all I needed on the internet when I was struggling worst. I signed up from a free email course by this coach Martin Reed, never paid a cent for the other materials he charges for. The techniques helped me a lot, and now I will always have them in my toolkit the next time I start falling into insomnia. I am looking up the Martin Reed right now.\n\nThank God I busted out of my attack tonight but we have to see how my sleep goes. I am sorry you are struggling right now. Please reach out to someone close to you or to a professional if you are feeling suicidal. Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem, of even if the problem feels severe at the time. Remember how many people you would hurt forever if you took your own life.\n\nI mentioned this to someone the other day, but have you had any cortisol testing done? High cortisol at night can cause sleep issues, but there are a few natural options to lower it if that is the case. Also, your adrenals need to be supported. Histamine is broken down in the body by adrenaline. If you are having a histamine overload, your body produces more adrenaline to process it. This can cause an excess of adrenaline in the body and tax your adrenal glands to the point where they are in constant overactivity. Too much adrenaline will keep you awake and make you anxious. Your tiredness will partially go away if you will take enough hydroxyzine. For example i take 200mg per day, 100 twice daily. I am starting Cromalyn back up today. I was worried it was giving me muscle weakness so I need to go slow this time. I could not handle Cromalyn, it flared my symptoms too much. I heard it is good to start very slow though. I take ketotifen with little to no side effects and it has changed my life, so that could be an option too. That is good you are starting something though. Sticking to a low histamine diet is also really helpful! Awesome, I hope it helps you! I liked getting the emails for 2 weeks because it is in bite-sized sections. I ended up compiling it all at the end for easier reference. The material will help you not be as concerned about whether you have a good night of sleep or not on a given night (because the anxiety about sleep perpetuates the insomnia) and you just follow the techniques and trust that they will work in time.\n\nIf you like reading self-help stuff in general (I really do!), my highest recommendation for anxiety is the book \"Hope and Help for Your Nerves\" by Claire Weekes. It really helps you cope with physical symptoms and panic feelings. The first few chapters alone helped me SO much. It is from the 60s and there is some old-fashioned outdated stuff about meds, as well as traditional gender roles in the examples, but the core material is FANTASTIC. I have been struggling with falling alseep and staying asleep for over a year. If you do not want to take the atarax just take some benadryl. Atarax is basically super benadryl and I personally do better with benadryl. I get the children's liquid benadryl because I can take smaller doses, equivalent to half a 25mg pill or I can take the equivalent to a pill and half if needed. It also helps with my anxiety. Liquid is faster acting as well. Try that and also listening to guided meditations. This is one that is been helpful to me:\n\nTry not to put so much pressure on yourself to sleep. Search YouTube for other types of guided meditation to help you rest if nothing else. Hopefully you will relax enough to fall asleep.", "A Guide to Mast Cell Stabilizers **Disclaimer**: While this information is as accurate as I can make it, I only have a bachelor\u2019s background in medical research and while I think I understand this stuff better than most, I am not a doctor. That being said I hope this is useful to the community. I am very concerned about how the pandemic can trigger MCAS in post-covid survivors. I expect those people will need help navigating this difficult condition. Plus it is hard to find good information about this condition.\n\nIn general, I would say MCAS patients tend to have tons of allergic triggers and they can also acquire (and sometimes lose) new allergic triggers. For example, for food allergies, normal people without MCAS often only have allergies limited to the top 8 most common food allergies and Oral Allergy Syndrome. For those with MCAS it is not unusual to have a rare allergy such as being allergic to say, mushrooms, chicken, red dye 40, preservatives, anything really. It is also not uncommon to have Multiple Chemical Sensitivity type reactions to airborne triggers.\n\nMast Cell Stabilizers do what it sounds like, they prevent Mast Cells from activating and causing immune reactions that comprise the chronic condition that is MCAS. As a general rule of thumb, most Mast Cell Stabilizers come in two kinds. There is the Histamine related kind that helps with IgE related reactions. And anti-inflammatory types that help with IgG and the other types of delayed hypersensitivity reactions.\n\n**Histamine/IgE reactions**: The most obvious thing about IgE reactions is that they will typically show up on allergy skin prick tests. Someone with a lot of IgE reactions will have rows and rows of itchy bumps after the test. Also as a general rule of thumb, IgE reactions will happen immediately up to some hours or even up to about a day after exposure and often involve symptoms such as hives, sneezing, watery eyes and post nasal drip, swelling of lips or tongue. Of course this includes anaphylaxis as well. Another sign of Histamine mediated reactions is a poor tolerance for naturally occurring histamine in foods. The inflammation caused by Histamine reactions tends to be short lived, but it is entirely possible to get into an almost permanent reactive state where an onslaught of constant histamine reactions causes more serious, long term health issues. \n\n**Xolair**: this is the most powerful anti-IgE treatment that exists currently. It is extremely strong and effective for stopping IgE mediated reactions, as it binds to IgE directly and stops reactions from being able to happen. That being said while this can be highly effective for someone who mainly has IgE type reactions, it is not uncommon for MCAS patients to have both types of reactions (IgE and IgG/long term inflammatory), and Xolair only affects IgE.\n\n* Pros: Extremely powerful for stopping IgE reactions. Can stop a dangerous downward spiral towards anaphylaxis of unknown causes and stabilize a highly reactive patient.\n* Cons: Cost if not covered by insurance is extremely expensive. Medicaid and Medicare do not qualify for the discount plan.\n* Most doctors will hesitate to prescribe it unless you have one of the known qualifying conditions (moderate to severe asthma that is not controlled by inhaled steroids or chronic idiopathic (of unknown causes) urticaria. To have it prescribed specifically for MCAS often needs a specialist doctor for MCAS.\n* Also it is unfortunately possible to be so reactive you can develop an allergy to Xolair as well. Xolair also has some mild to moderate side effects, but generally if you need Xolair, there is not much substitute. \n\n**Benadryl and other antihistamines**: Benadryl is the strongest antihistamine, and a benadryl IV drip is sometimes used for extremely reactive patients who are hospitalized. That being said, while large amounts of antihistamines can have a mild mast cell stabilization effect, benadryl in particular tends to cause extreme drowsiness. \n\n* Pros: very effective for stopping IgE reactions, many different kinds are readily available OTC medicine \n* Cons: long term usage can result in becoming allergic to the fillers, dyes, or even the antihistamines themselves. Compounded antihistamines are safer overall. Rotating different antihistamines if possible is recommended, but it is also common for some types to be more or less effective for someone than others.\n\n**Ketotifen**: while technically this is an antihistamine as well, Ketotifen deserves special mention for having some stronger mast cell stabilizing effects than the other antihistamines, an effect that has been backed up by research. Ketotifen still mostly helps with IgE type reactions, but is also used for some chronic conditions like asthma, allergic rhinitis, urticaria, and dermatitis as well. \n\n* Pros: Does not usually need a high dosage like benadryl and other antihistamines for most MCAS patients. Not difficult to get prescribed and easily available compounded with prescription at most pharmacies. Decent (mild to moderate IME) mast cell stabilizing properties. Not very expensive. Also can be ordered online (not compounded) without a prescription. Generally less side effects than Benadryl, but YMMV.\n* Cons: May not be effective for some people. But worth trying for most.\n\n**Quercetin**: This is a natural supplement that is proven to have some antihistamine properties. It is thought to have mast cell stabilizing effects too but is still the subject of a lot of research.\n\n* Pros: Available OTC from most supplement shops. Can be very effective for some, worth trying for most.\n* Cons: May not be effective for some people. In addition, a lot of the \u201cnatural\u201d forms of Quercetin are not extracts but pure powdered plant matter, which has naturally occurring mold/pollen etc in it which may be bad for some.\n\n**Anti Inflammatories**: A lot of the other chronic effects of MCAS are slower, longer type inflammatory reactions. These reactions can be hard to figure out, because they are often not immediate. Inflammatory reactions can build with repeated mild exposure and accumulate the effects over weeks or even months, causing many different health issues depending where the reactions are being triggered. For example, mast cell inflammation triggered in the stomach can cause GERD and gastroparesis. Mast cell triggered inflammation in the inner ear can cause dizziness and excessive ear wax. Inflammation in the gut can cause malabsorption of micronutrients, internal bleeding, constipation and/or diarrhea. For a full list of possible MCAS symptoms, please check out ( and feel free to ask if you need any help with the medical terminology, although a lot of it can be looked up.\n\nBecause so many possible MCAS reactions can be delayed, I recommend keeping a journal of symptoms, along with food, medicine dosage and other possible exposures. Then review this journal from time to time and look for patterns. Also, it is best to only change one variable at a time, so it is more obvious what the effect is. Also keep in mind many anti inflammatories also build over time, so the effects might be worth trying for at least a few weeks to a few months before giving up on them.\n\n**Palmitoylethanolamide**: This one is a hot new supplement that it seems like everyone in the medical community is researching right now. The most excitement over it is actually as a non addictive pain reliever that is strongly being considered as an alternative to prescribing opioids, as it is safe and well tolerated by a lot of people without side effects. But if you dig for it, there is also some research being done into it as a mast cell stabilizer as well. Palmitoylethanolamide is totally safe, it is a substance that is naturally produced in the body by most people, but it is thought that many MCAS patients do not produce enough of it. That being said this is such a new mast cell stabilizer that even many MCAS doctors have not heard of it. \n\n* Pros: If it works for you, it can change your life. Available inexpensively as a supplement online. No known side effects. Whether this works for you depends on what biological mechanisms are responsible for your inflammation. If it works, it can totally disrupt the pathway at its source. Otherwise it will do nothing. If it works there should be some immediate benefit (within days). Otherwise discontinue it.\n* Recommended to take the Ergomax Optipea brand, made in the Netherlands with FDA oversight. Other brands manufactured in China may contain dangerous fillers or have lower potency.\n* Cons: Anti Inflammatory and Mast Cell Stabilizing effects do not work for everyone. Pain relieving effects possibly somewhat broader. Definitely recommended for Pain Relief, especially since most MCAS patients are not recommended to take NSAIDS.\n\n**Montelukast Sodium**: Technically an asthma drug, but has also been proven to have mast cell stabilizing properties.\n\n* Pros: Inexpensive even without insurance. Not difficult to get it prescribed 10mg/month for seasonal allergies or other on label conditions (ex. Exercise induced asthma). Can be a strong mast cell stabilizer for some. Fairly safe to take long term, but a small minority may develop heart issues.\n* Cons: Dosage can be finicky, too high dosage can give ill effects. Also, it is recommended not to start with high dosages, but start low and increase slowly. Go back down or stop if any adverse effects appear. Any prescription over 10mg/month and your insurance will fight you to cover it. Many allergists will also refuse to prescribe higher doses and question why you need it if your asthma is not severe. Common side effect is a dry throat.\n\n**LDN: Low Dose Naltrexone**: This one is a real mixed medicine. It has received a lot of attention and research among other chronic immune related conditions, particularly Crohn\u2019s and Multiple Sclerosis for possible strong anti inflammatory effects. Most famously it put some Crohn\u2019s patients into full remission for their digestive inflammation. \n\n* Pros: Naltrexone is cheap and not too difficult to get. It can be diluted at home with bottled water, and a medicine syringe (no needle needed, taken by mouth) and kept in the fridge. (search LDN water compounding.) There are communities out there with lists of doctors who are willing to prescribe LDN and also some willing to prescribe it over the phone. If trying it might also worth trying getting it prescribed and compounded to minimize fillers. (recommended: Gelatin filler is probably the one the least people react to). LDN if it works for you, can be pretty powerful, but it is not easy or convenient to take. But you can ask those in the community for advice. Fairly safe to take long term.\n* Cons: Not everyone gets the anti-inflammatory effects from LDN. May even be harmful for a small minority (pro-inflammatory). If you get the benefits, it may take a lot of trial and error with dosage and time of the day to find the sweet spot. It can take up to 1-2 years to get the full benefit of LDN. May take months to feel any benefit at all. The most common side effect of LDN is sleep disturbances and vivid dreams. Sour/bitter taste.\n* Also, for better or worse LDN has been highly embraced by Naturopaths to the point where regular doctors can assume you are into natural healing or alternative medicine if you mention it.\n\n**Cromolyn Sodium** (Gastrocrom): Cromolyn is most commonly used for gastrointestinal MCAS issues, but it can also be prepared and used as a nasal spray or as eye drops as well. Gastrocrom can be very effective for general mild all food reactions and can help with absorption of nutrients in the gut as well. That being said, Cromolyn is a strong liquid medicine that usually needs to be eased into with low dosages from the start. It is usually diluted in water and taken 30 minutes before eating. (If you have gastroparesis or slow gut motility/SIBO this may take much longer than 30 minutes) \n\n* Pros: Can be highly effective for gastrointestinal symptoms and abdominal pain. And also can be effective as a nasal spray or eye drops. However effects are somewhat short lived and basically reduce reactions for a short time. For long term effects, it needs to be taken forever.\n* Cons: extremely expensive if you cannot get insurance to cover it. (List cost about $1300/month) Can be poorly tolerated by some. Effects disappear once you stop taking it. Some people describe Cromolyn as tasting like spit and hate it, personally I do not mind it. \n\n**Hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil)**: While this drug is most well known as a Lupus and Rheumatoid Arthritis drug, it can be beneficial for MCAS too. But honestly I felt a little queasy about it as it can cause retina (eye) damage in some people, it is not known how it works, and there is not a lot of research on long term side effects.\n\n* Pros: Not too difficult to get it prescribed by a rheumatologist as it is thought to be overall fairly safe. Dosage is dependent on weight. Can be very effective for some people.\n* Cons: Need a special eye exam every 6 months while you are on Plaquenil, not all insurances will cover this special eye exam. It is possible to get retinal damage from Plaquenil. \n\n**Methotrexate**: I do not know much about this other than that it is a strong medicine used for treatment of some cancers, rheumatoid arthritis and severe psoriasis. It is possible to get it prescribed for MCAS but personally I have never tried it. Just including it on the list as an option.\n\n**Probiotics**: If your immune system has ever gone weird after either a bacterial infection or as a result of taking antibiotics, then I highly highly recommend trying a Probiotic. There is definitely a connection between immune disorders and gut bacteria, although research has yet to figure out exactly what the link is. In any case I recommend Probiotics 100% for constipation/diarrhea, but not if you have SIBO. If you have SIBO you will just overload your system with bacteria. Get the bacteria lower first (ideally with Gastrocrom and an elimination diet) and then start Probiotics. There are a ton of different brands, but I personally like RenewLife the best. Also note that many probiotics are lactose/casein free and contain way more live strains than found in yogurt, and also that dairy is a common allergic trigger. \n\n**Steroids**: I am putting this on here as a warning. Many many doctors will push steroids, particularly Prednisone, for whatever chronic immune related inflammation you might have. While a short course of steroids can be useful to get your symptoms under control, DO NOT TAKE THESE LONG TERM (years). The chance you get nasty long term side effects from steroids goes to 100% the longer you are on them. And the whole time doctors will shrug their shoulders and not suggest any alternatives while you accumulate permanent damage in your body. And meanwhile your natural immunity is suppressed which becomes increasingly dangerous as you get older. **AVOID LONG TERM STEROID USE AT ALL COST**. And if you must take a steroid, opt for a locally acting one over a whole body type steroid. And try and use it sparingly or find a non steroid alternative. Thank you!! It is nice of you to write all of this and try to give an overview but there is alot of misinformation provided. Im going to point out a few things i saw upon reading for the first time and will edit this comment with more tomorrow.\n\n&gt; The most obvious thing about IgE reactions is that they will typically show up on allergy skin prick tests. Someone with a lot of IgE reactions will have rows and rows of itchy bumps after the test \n\nSensitivity and specificity of skin allergy tests are pretty bad so this is not really true.\n\n&gt;As a general rule of thumb, most Mast Cell Stabilizers come in two kinds. There is the Histamine related kind that helps with IgE related reactions. And anti-inflammatory types that help with IgG and the other types of delayed hypersensitivity reactions. \n\nThis is just flat out wrong and misleading. I dont think you understand the connection of Mast cells and their granulates. If mast cells degranulate they release their granulates. It does not matter if the degranulation is IgE mediated or not -&gt;histamine and other inflammatorys get released \n\nNon IgE mediated mast cell activation is usually not from IgG. There are soo many other receptors that play a role in this.\n\n(\n\n&gt; Benadryl is the strongest antihistamine \n\nYikes. There are 4 different histamine receptors that are currently known. Benadryl is a first generation H1 antihistamine. Saying that benadryl is the strongest  antihistamine does not make any sense. It may be the strongest H1 antihistamine but im not sure about that. It works well in emergency situations because it is fast acting and passes the blood brain barrier.\n\n&gt; very effective for stopping IgE reactions \n\nAgain, i dont think you really understand what this means. It does not stop the allergic reaction it just blocks the H1 receptor from being activated by histamin.\n\n&gt; **Probiotics** \n\nYour whole take on probiotics contains waaay to less research. You have to be really carefull with probiotics as most multi strain probiotics on the market contain atleast one histamine producing strain. Your really dont want to have more bacteria that possess histidine decarboxylase in your intestines. What your advising here is dangerous and wrong on so many levels. There is a number of problems here. Off the top of my head, benadryl is not the most powerful and zyrtec has been said to work better. You missed Accolade. You should probably specify for people in different countries. Like I am on Accolade in the US but you cannot get it in UK? There is more but it is late for me. Alright, so I might have oversimplified too much, but honestly I was just trying to give an overall idea, not give a crash course on the immune system. I can take it all out if that would make you happy.\n\nI honestly do not see any issue with saying that benadryl is strong, it is a bit of a short hand to say it can be used to stop reactions quickly. I was not trying to imply anything else. And it is 100% true that they use benadryl IV drips on extremely allergic patients. \n\nAs for stopping IgE mediated reaction pathways, I thought it was less of a mouthful than blocks the pathway from activating. I see I should have just avoided that.\n\nProbiotics: there is a ton of research into the immune system gut bacteria link. I do not see what is so harmful about that. If you want to recommend a type that has less histamine producing strains in it, then by all means, go ahead. All I can say is that I tried almost all the major brands on the market and most of them did not help me at all. If you would like to include other research I would be happy to include it, just please give me a link to the paper and I will read it. \n\nAs for Accolade and anything else I have not mentioned, it is because I am not familiar with them. Do NOT use cronolyn sodium oral solution as eye drops or in a nebulizer. Theyre made differently and have different standards. They can be prepared and used as it, I did not recommend using it straight up. Unfortunately the eye drops and nasal spray have been discontinued officially, as least as far as I know. Cannot get them where I live. It is not about me being happy I just do not want people that do not know better to take everything they read somewhere as it is without questioning which may lead to misinformation being spread further and further. This can become harmful for some people very quickly.\n\nProbiotics:\n\nAgain from your answer I can tell you have not done more than a few hours research on this. You probably do not even know the difference between a bacteria species and strain so there is no real point in arguing. You recommend a high cfu multi strain/species probiotic that does not even list individual strains. Single probiotic strains have been evaluated for certain conditons ins humans that is true. Non of them have been evaluated for MCAS patients. Your recommended probiotic has not been evaluated in any legit scientific study. \nStrains matter: \n\nIt absolutely matters what causes the mast cell degranulation. I was not saying it does not matter just how you explained it was completely wrong. It is important to differ between mast cell stabilizers that stabilize IgE dependent degranulation and IgE independent degranulation. Your explanation just did not make any sense.\n\nYou also totally missed one of the most important mechanisms of reducing continuous mast cell degranulation. The combination of H1 and H2 antihistamines. Mast cells itself have histamine receptors which means histamine can activate mast cells which then release histamine again which then can activate mast cells again. This positive feedback loop can be toned down by this combination. This also leads to a reduction of other granulates such as prostaglandins, interleukins etc..\n\nThere is more than enough free information on this and about all the things you listed online. I do not think we need to dilute this information with badly researched and partially false information but that is just my opinion. I know you meant good. RenewLife, it does list individual strains, what are you talking about?  Maybe not on the online listings, but it does list them on the bottle itself. Again, if you want to recommend a particular probiotic, go ahead. I am merely pointing out that they can be useful.\n\nAs well, if you want to wait years and years for someone to specifically test MCAS patients for a specific probiotic, it is literally going to be a long, long wait. There is so little research funded on it in the first place. A lot of studies that do exist have like 20 people each. I heard about probiotics from my MCAS doctor, if you want to discuss it with him, you are welcome to do it. \n\nAs well, the point was to divide the medications and supplements into rough groups. Antihistamines are absolutely included as a possible mast cell stabilizer, that is why they are on the list in the first place. I do not know why you insist on nitpicking everything I wrote. The point was to point people in the right direction, and they honestly need to figure out what works for them and what is available to them. If I tried to hyperlink every single paper I read it or would literally be 50+ pages and I am writing this on my own time for free. Not to mention does anyone here really want to read that? I sure as heck do not. Do you even read my whole answers? You clearly do not know the difference between strains and species. You are ignorant and not even trying to understand or learn anything. Go ahead and keep spreading bullshit im done here. Man, you are just spending your entire time nitpicking a few phrases I used about pathways and probiotics and trying to imply because I made a few word choice mistakes then I must have zero idea of what I am talking about. Who is being ignorant here? Both still available in the US, eye drops Opticrom require a prescription, Nasalcrom is OTC. There is also cromolyn for nebulizer use which is expensive and difficult to find, it is a different concentration than oral cromolyn. Alright cool, thank you. I might have been thinking of the nebulizer type. Updated and fixed. Long list of sources here saying why Benadryl should no longer be used so I will not google more.   \n\n\n( Cromolyn sodium contributes to far more than just relief of gastrointestinal symptoms.  Given that the *majority* of the entire body's mast cells are in the gastrointestinal tract, (yes you have more mast cells in your GI tract alone, than the rest of the body combined, by a significant margin), the sheer volume of mast cells who is degranulation is inhibited by the cromolyn makes a significant dent in multiple feedback loops.  The most relevant is likely the histamine feedback loop, as the mast cells themselves have all four known histamine receptors.  So histamine ends up functioning both as a mediator that regulates effects and as a trigger for the further degranulation of other mast cells.  (This is a large part of why high histamine foods can cause symptoms that can be traced back to other mediators such as elevated PGD2, or symptoms consistent with the release of say TNF-a).  Interrupt a lot of histamine that is being released from the intestinal tract, and you see results elsewhere. \n   \nA lot of people on cromolyn notice it significantly helps symptoms such as reducing itching, or helping with insomnia, or other symptoms that are in no way GI related.  The common metaphor is \"It helps a ton by lowering your histamine bucket.\"  A more accurate metaphor would be comparing it to lowering the control rods in a nuclear reactor.  As the mast cell histamine feedback loop better resembles a chain reaction.  However histamine is not the only mediator that mast cells  both release and have receptors for.  It is only 1 single feedback loop of many. \n\nAlso, on an aside note, Luteolin is often used, much like Quercetin.  Sometimes combined with quercetin (as in the supplement Neuroprotek).  Just a FYI that quercetin is not alone.  Hey you did a great job clearing up misinformation and I learned some stuff too. Thanks! Thank you for taking the time to write this, it means the world to our community! :) It is an amazing guide, and anyone who was nitpicking you in a rude manner was just trying to show off their intelligence. I am highly educated in science and medicine and still knew exactly what you were trying to say when explaining things and did not get caught up in tiny details because for the average reader it is great. Especially after you put a huge disclaimer saying you are no doctor, there is no reason for anyone to take your advice without doing their own research. It is a quick summary of the major medicines we are on which should inspire further research by the reader. Thanks for this! Just wanted to say thank you so much for this post. Has anybody here got any experience with ketotifen, is this a medication that can be taken indefinitely? Hi! I am taking ketotifen, as provided by a compounded pharmacy. I have been prescribed it indefinitely, 4x per day. Afrin suggests it can go up to as much as 6mg per dose, but my prescriber tops it out at 2mg. I have no noticeable side effects (but I am often lucky that way).\n\nI have not seen anything that suggests it cannot be taken long-term, and I do recommend trying it if you have the opportunity. Ketotifen crosses the blood-brain barrier and helps me with generalized pain, brain fog, and weird sensory issues. It also seems to help with dysautonomia - fatigue, temp regulation issues, etc. Ketotifin has made it possible for me to exist in the world outside my safe little home without being in a state of olfactory assault. My joint pain\u2014which I could hardly walk from after never having a history of joint pain before MCAS flared hard this year\u2014is down 80%. Anxiety down about 80% (still terribly depressed). Headaches few and far between. Able to tolerate far more low-histamine foods I was formerly flaring from. No more terrible eye hives. The feeling of my lower face, neck chest and back being scalded by steam 24/7 for the last 3 years (and intermittently in the past, always attributed to anxiety vs. histamine until now) is totally gone. I can usually get two 4-hour pot/benzo assisted sleep sessions a night without waking up every hour from histamine worms crawling in my GI system. It is been a godsend. I started with 1MG and worked up to 3MG with zero side effects besides the 10lb weight gain I get from every antihistamine. I take an extra dose with my quercitin and Vitamin C when I flare.", "Few questions about anaphylaxis Hi!\n\nThis is my first post here, so hello everyone! And thank you to a good soul, who help me after being banned on the other mast cell sub and who recommended me this place.\n\nSo I wanted to ask you guys about your experiences of anaphylaxis. Are there any differences in symptoms between anaphylaxis in mastocytosis or MCAS and other anaphylaxis types? \n\nI wonder if this is common to get some long-term complications - like dysautonomia or gut damage - after anaphylaxis?\n\nI am asking because I had such an episode three years ago, after dehydration and long work in the garden. In that time I did not know I would had cutaneous mastocytosis. So... it was a miserable state, in which I was vomiting, pissing and defecating a lot, my pulse was very weak, I coudn't feel the temperature of the room and I had also a very dry skin. I was feeling so awful, I was just counting every second and that was really all I could do. Everything was happening so fast. I had this \"impending sense of doom\", and I was feeling so unwell, I wanted this to end so much. At the begining I had feelings of warm and flushing on the face, but later I was very pale. All this lasted about five hours. I also coudn't stand words my boyfriend was talking, sunlight in the morning and movements near me.\n\nThough I would had some food intolerances earlier, since this attack I could only eat rice and drink water. I have had gastroparesis, intestinal inflammation of some kind, reflux and many dysautonomic symptoms. Also CFS/ME together with sound and movement sensitivities. I mostly layed in bad, feeling constant closenes of \"fight or flight\" mode.\n\nI wonder if anyone of you had similar reactions after anaphylaxis? I assume it was anaphylaxis, though doctor did not want to send ambulance, because according to her it was \" intestinal flu\". Well, I really doubt it.  \n\nI wonder, do you think Epi Pen would help me in this case, if I was already so hype and in \"fight or flight\" mode? Maybe it is a stupid question... but I have read so much about anaphylaxis and I think it was not typical picture of it.\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading!\n\nPS sorry for any grammar mistakes, I am not from English-speaking country. To start, I think it is important to point you to the evidence that adult cutaneous mastocytosis is likely actually an indication of systemic mastocytosis. (\n\nThe incident that you are describing definitely sounds like it was gastrointestinal anaphylaxis. And you are probably right to think that using an epipen would have helped you recover from it. This post is also quite helpful in understanding anaphylaxis in MCD: \n\nHowever, I think it would be inaccurate to say that anaphylaxis itself causes dysautonomia. Mast cell disorders *are* highly associated with dysautonomia for a number of reasons. Any mast cell reactions (anaphylaxis or not) can either cause or worsen dysautonomia including things like gastroparesis, other forms of dysmotility, and dysautonomia. So, yes, those could be symptoms. I have dysautonomia, but my symptoms get much worse when I am reacting. I actually do not have gastroparesis, but I do suffer from some sort of dysmotility during a reaction.\n\nIt is also common for anaphylaxis to cause the onset of a particular mast cell flare. It can cause an increase in inflammation and sensitivity that may explain your new issues with so many foods. After I first went into anaphylaxis I became sensitized to fragrances and honestly any strong smells, and more sensitive to my already known triggers. \n\nSince your symptoms are primarily gastrointestinal in nature, you might consider asking a doc about oral cromolyn to help calm down your GI mast cells. It is also probably worth getting some other rescue meds in addition to the epipen too. I have had episodes like you are describing but I also have dysautonomia and hashimotos. I think sometimes the mcas triggers dysautonomia and vice versa. I have also had gastroparesis and developed a lot of vitamin deficiencies. You may be low in thiamine and other b vitamins. That can really make you sick and make dysautonomia worse. I am dealing with low thiamine levels right now. Here is a good video about thiamine deficiency and dysautonomia.  Thank you so much for such an in-depth answer and information. \n\nA propos cromolyn, unfortunately, though I have had so many hopes related to that drug, I did not tolerate it well. After few weeks of very low doses I have developed sensitivities to even those few safe foods I could eat. But I think about trying different mast cell stabilizer, ketotifen. Although I am not sure how it works on GI symptoms. \n\nThanks for the links, I am going to check them right away :) Thank you for your reply :) Oki, I definitely have to check vitamins B deficiencies, I did not know it can be so important factor in such intense reactions. Vitamin deficiencies also cause anxiety and panic attacks.", "What triggered your MCD? I was wondering about the events/stressors that caused your mcd to break out/to start in the first place.\n\nDo you think you were born with it and it just got progressively worse or did it switch on after/during a period of some sort of stress?\n\nFor example:\n\nA lot of exercise?\n\nA strict way of eating (or a not so strict way)?\n\nLack of sleep?\n\nEmotional/social stress?\n\nTrauma?\n\nAccident?\n\nOrthostatic issues like back or neck pain? \n\nOperation?\n\nDrugs? (legal or illegal, basically anything from anesthetica, digestion aids, pain killers etc. to cigarettes, alcohol, coffee, psychedelics, party drugs etc pp....)\n\nEnduring extreme weather, not getting enough sunlight etc.\n\nAlso: were you born by c-section?\n\nAnd what systems are affected by mcd in your body? \n\nThank you :) I have EDS so I am pretty sure that is just the comorbidity that caused it for me. Mainly my GI system but also my reproductive system and skin. And yup - C section but only because I wrapped my umbilical cord around my throat. What I believe trigged my MCD was an unidentifiable virus. I had a low grade fever for 3 weeks, general malaise and feeling of doom, body aches,bone pain and dizziness. Went to the doc 3 times during it and had many tests including lyme and everything was negative. Right after that my MCD showed up. Still trying to get a proper diagnosis but i have been following all supplements and H1 and H2s and it is been helping. Black mold exposure Mold exposure I think. I was not a C-section. I was in a high speed auto accident which resulted in a lot of physical trauma,  a brain injury, and PTSD.  Lot of research now linking traumatic brain injuries and PTSD to MCAD and eventually AD.  Yay!  Something to look forward to.\ud83d\ude1e\n\nAs to systems effected by it, I have systemic MCAD so... everything? Central nervous system, organs, circulatory system, respiratory system, vascular system,  digestive system, muscular skeletal, para sympathetic nervous system, autonomic nervous system, u name it.\n\nIt are not fun. Can mast cell diseases really be caused by/triggered by random things? Like too much exercise? People just get diseases randomly, unfortunally, I am not sure how someone can get a mast cell disease because of lack of sleep, eating a specific way, or not enough sunlight. That sounds very fishy and pseudoscience-y me...\n\nI have EDS. Every other family member of mine that has/had EDS (there are six of us over three generations) has MCAS in some varying degree. None of us were born by c-section. Dang, wishing you all the best. I have got a similar systemic distribution. Truly are not fun. Are you male or female? Female Me too. How does it affect the reproductive system? Is it related to ovarian cysts? Not to TMI but I get allergy symptoms in my vulva like raw spots. I actually found out that was happening from an article I found on reddit. Want me to find it and send it to you? I would think we were genetically predisposed but certain triggers activated it. You do not think too much exercise and a lack of sleep could do the trick, but imagine exercising hardcore for 7 hours a day outside in the cold and only sleeping 4 hours a night (in an environment where you feel very, very anxious and uncomfortable) for 7 out of 7 days a week. Over months or even years. Plus disordered eating and having a BMI of less than 13, which is severely underweight. Plus extreme social stressors, chronic spine issues and chronic pain. I do think that would aggravate the situation enough to activate MCAS. Do not you think so?\n\nAlso I do not think people are getting diseases randomly. Even if we were born with it there has to be a biological reason for it. Our bodies are designed to be healthy. Ouch, that sounds like agony! If you can find it easily that would be nice. Would be an interesting read. I really want to understand this disease, it is driving me mad. Also I am really worried it affects fertility :/ \n\nI do not know anything on the fertility front - I am planning on a hysterectomy due to my genetic issues but here is the article! It only mentions on seasonal allergies but I would assume of a seasonal allergy can cause this any other type could too (not a medical professional just my own theory) Genuinely asking, can you give more details? Because I have hypothiroidism without an apparent cause (no antibodies, no thiroiditis), chronic fatigue, lots of digestive symptoms (sibo included, lots of antibiotic rounds), and this last year been having \"breakdowns\" after certain foods or heat exposure: feeling exhausted, numb and breathing difficulty, feeling my throat narrowing and difficulty swallowing. A strict low histamine diet has helped me a lot in just 2 week, it was like night and day.\n\nAnd casually, I have been exposed daily to black mold at home as the shower was unproperly constructed and keeps filtering humidity so we have just given up on cleaning the mold every day. Tons of black mold in the awning aswell. Ouch. Thank you. Hysterectomy affects hormones a lot, does not it? How old are you? Yeah. I am 30 this month but I actually just started pre-menopause a few months ago. All the women in my family started early and had to have full or partial hysterectomies by 40. Between that and a strong fear of passing on my genetic material I am pushing to be preventative. Wow, very interesting! I think i had it my whole life. It started getting worse when I was a teen. It got bad to the point of needing doctor intervention 3 years ago when I moved to a place where I am allergic to everything. That Is what my mcas flares look like. I think I had always had it, but it was not as severe and would disappear for years at a time. Then I had a large weight loss and some really stressful family problems, and I have been stuck in a severe flare for four or five years. Same to you.  Wish all the best and hope they get it managed.  Mine was for awhile until more trauma last year and now it is worse. What helped you back then? Yup me too suspect eds at this point. I also have endometriosis and used to get cysts constantly in my ovaries before the meds for endo stopped my period. Really that is so interesting. I have not had anything to that level since so maybe there was some other trigger and that was just my first flare. There was a lot going on in my life around that time - missed miscarriage w/ d&amp;c and drinking too much. So far everything about this has felt like a huge guessing game. &gt;So far everything about this has felt like a huge guessing game.\n\nI feel that. Even with doctors...they just kind of guess. It took a long time to figure out what is mast cells vs Hashimoto's vs pots vs allergies. I still do not know most of the time. I have more educated guesses, though.\n\nI know bone pain, joint pain, and severe GI issues are almost always MCAS. I also get really cold but that can also be the Hashimoto's so I have to look at all synptoms. What primed my system - different types of childhood trauma starting from birth (CPTSD)\n\nHistory - I remember going to doctors as a kid and they had no answers for my symptoms and like I had a lot of GI problems growing up\n\nPossible trigger for my system - bad virus. I went to ER with terrible abdominal pain (TERRIBLE), fever and a few other symptoms and was eventually just told rhinovirus. I think. \n\nMy getting-worse-symptoms started after the months of GI issues following the ER visit started out as histamine intolerance. \n\nI think my system was primed and waiting and already a little weird and then went off like a bomb when I had the virus. \n\nI was adopted but happen to know I was born premature. \n\nSystems affected: Skin, GI, neuro, lungs, urinary Better meds and managing stress better and an amazing service dog.\n\nStress is a big trigger, no matter what kind it is.  Physical, mental or emotional,  it is all bad. \n\nI adopted an Austrian Red Doberman schutzen dog who had been turned into the shelter during the financial crisis as the people who imported her as a working dog could not afford her any longer.\n\nWhen I adopted her I also had cancer and the treatments and surgery almost did me in.  I could hardly stand up.  I had no idea what a schutzen dog was or what I was bringing into my home and to be honest she almost killed me.  Not because she was mean in any way but because she was an extremely large strong animal with an over abundance of enthusiasm. Lol. But she made me step up and learn how to get control of her.  So many of us chronically ill people lose our authority and people stop listening to us.  Doctors do not listen.   Family does not listen.  Friends do not either.  And when you have a brain injury they do not understand it is so much worse.  It is like you become invisible.\n\nThat dog literally saved my life.  She made me step up and regain my authority to get control of her.  She taught herself to alert for syncope and seizures, for when I forgot to turn a burner off on the stove and so much more.  She without hesitation put herself in harm's way to protect me and always had the best judgement on people and how to handle situations and was afraid of absolutely nothing.   She was my fitness trainer, my cognitive trainer, my constant companion.\n\nShe woke me up every day bursting with joy and love excitement about the day.  When she died my whole neighborhood mourned her.\n\nI cannot afford another dog like that.  They cost a fortune and even then to get 1 like her again would be a miracle.  But she took me from wheelchairs and rehap hospitals to living on my own and was 1 very special animal.  I owe everything to that Doberman.\n\nI did really bad for about a year after she died and eventually adopted a Greyhound.   Could not be more different than the Doberman.  She does not alert to anything and will never be a service dog but she is sweet and is a good support dog and companion.  But I have gone downhill since my Dobie died.\n\nThat is not to say that a schutzen dog is for everyone.   I have owned dogs my entire life and several AKC Dobermans, and I never knew that animals like her existed outside of movies.  That level of intelligence and drive and energy is a lot for any person to deal with let alone anyone sick.  But the bond we had was  something amazing. You do not get it from that.  You would have to already have it.  That would just be a trigger that activates your mast cells.\n\nAnd too much exercise can stress your body, just like lack of sleep can, causing your mast cells to activate. Yeah you need to get out of there, it is most likely the root cause of your symptoms is due to the black mold Definitely will, I am looking for it this fall or early next year as much late. I just hope getting away from the exposure improves my health (along with diet and healthy lifestyle) as it is been going downhill the last 4 years Oh wow, what a heartwarming but also heartbreaking story. I knew dogs could make a big difference, but I did not knew they could be that awesome. \ud83d\ude3b Thank you so much for sharing this \ud83d\ude4c Damn. CPTSD sucks. Have you tried combating it in any way? There was something that helped me personally. You could look into MIND, MAPS, the third wave &amp; ICCers to research, maybe it could help you too dealing with it in a healthy way. \nAlso: do you happen to have high gastrointestinal inflammation marker levels? Like calprotectin? \ud83d\ude14\nThey also detected a cyst in my ovaries. I am really worried. It is over 5 cm. \ud83d\ude10 I think EMDR has helped. Like I have been significantly less hypervigilant. I do not know anything about GI inflammation markers but I do know I have GI inflammation and my GI symptoms got better when I started low dose prednisone (given by rheum for joint pain). I heard about EMDR before, nice concept. Did you do it at home or with a trained practitioner? How frequently?\nPrednisone sounds very interesting, I will have a look into it. EMDR can only be done with a trained professional. I was seeing a licensed therapist trained in EMDR. Prednisone has a lot of possibly bad side effects. Oh no, did they say what if anything they plan to do? They never did anything for mine and they always eventually dissolved on their own. I am not sure about size most of the time but I remember one being almost 4cm they said. I hate how they can be really painful and take you to your knees suddenly. Made me cry writing it.  I owe that animal so much. If you are on Facebook join healing CIRS, mold, Lyme group... very helpful! You will need to move away, and make sure you clean your clothes with vinegar and borax to not bring the mold spores with you. Also getting rid of certain things that may have mold spores (I know it sounds crazy but just join the group and you will see just how bad mold is for many people) I used to think \u201cthere is no way mold could cause all of this\u201d but sure enough I found out it was. I did not realize there is a gene that makes it so some of us cannot detox mycotoxins (mold toxins) like other people. So some of us can live in a somewhat moldy environment and be fine, while people like you and I can get mast cell activation, food sensitivities, mental illness, etc, just from mold \ud83d\ude14\ud83d\udc90 Not yet. I did not even knew i had this kind of issue until they did a ultrasound for my guts and detected it by incidence. And I do not know yet what they will do, as it is complicated and expensive to get an appointment... Ok, thank you for the warning. Did you experience any? It is a long list that depends on your dosage too. Like you can develop cataracts. Uuh I also have EDS and have always had allergies but my mast cell disease symptoms started after I deployed to Iraq. I was exposed to burn pit smoke,dust,fumes,etc. And it got really bad after I had my hip replaced. I have systemic mastocytosis, so I have a somatic mutation that happened completely randomly in the KIT gene. The number of reasons that lead to mutations are infinite, so no real rhyme or reason people get mutations in this particular gene. Oh, that is interesting \ud83e\udd14 When and how did your symptoms started, did they slowly became worse? Oh shit! Yeah they eventually got worse and I was having anaphylaxis almost every day. For years I would have hives daily. It was uncomfortable but I could deal with it. But once the systemic reactions started I knew something else was wrong. I had a severe allergic reaction to a bee sting. I went into anaphylactic shock and was hospitalized for 2 days. Interesting What age did you were back then? I actually misunderstood the original question. That was what lead to my diagnosis, I was not too allergic after the allergy tests so they sent me to a specialist. Apparently it is common to find out by having a severe allergic reaction Thank you for sharing your story with your service dog, it made me feel like someone understands, people really underestimate how much a bond with a pet can mean, especially when chronic illness is so isolating. \n\nWhen I first started to get so sick I could no longer live alone, I had no choice but to go an environment that is very unhealthy for me mentally.  I adopted a Bengal cat (could never afford one) to keep me company, she got PTSD from riding in the cargo hold of planes for cat shows, and while I do not think there is any cat that does what a service dog can, having her in my life has been the only thing that has kept me going through all this. Now that she is getting older and starting to have arthritis and pain herself, I am so worried all the time, I cannot imagine going on without her.\n\nThanks again for sharing, I am so sorry for your loss, but I am glad that you had her in her life and that she had you. Cats can have amazing bonds with people also.  I have had both cats and dogs most of my life, and the bond you can form with a cat can be very strong.  I have had the good fortune to have had some extraordinary cats as well as dogs in my life.  Most notably a Russian Blue.  She was something.  And a stray wild cat I caught while still fairly young with whom I had an amazing bond.\n\nI feel your pain.  Losing a trusted friend in that kind of situation can be devastating.  I would make plans to find another special cat to be in your life when her time comes.  Do not make the mistake that I made and wait and give yourself time to grieve.\n\nHad I gotten another dog sooner I might be in better shape today.  Partly for me the reason it took so long was I tried to get another dog like her and found out what it costs for those dogs. ($30,000 to $40,000).\n\n Then I tried to get a service dog.  Also not an easy process and a very expensive process.  And no one on the West coast trains them for syncope and seizure unless they are training for Veterans.  Everyone on the East coast demanded that I go out and train with the dog and a trainer for a minimum of 3 weeks, on my own and at my own expense, for 6 hours a day.  If I could sustain 6 hours a day of working for 3 weeks straight plus all the travel I would not be disabled.  So it was all very discouraging and ultimately undoable.\n\nIn the end a woman training Borzoi for Veterans in California recommended I get one and she would help me train it via social media.  She said they are naturally good at detecting syncope,  which is not a trait most dogs have.\n\nOn the journey to looking for a Borzoi, this gorgeous Greyhound came up for rescue  and they asked me to take her.  So that is how I would up with her.  She cannot detect anything that I can tell, and she is not even close to my Doberman, but she is sweet and funny and I have done better since I have had her.\n\nSo do not wait when the time comes.  Find yourself another companion, one that needs you as much as you need them that you feel that connection to.\n\nI am sorry about your situation.  I am not sure I would survive long in that kind of environment and I am lucky I do not have to, although I was in a lot of rehab hospitals for extended periods of time.  Without my Doberman I might be in your situation, unable to live on my own.  She was an angel gifted to me when I  needed her most. I think being prepared is good advice, I just always feel so guilty about it even though that does not really make any  logical sense. Hope for the best, but prepare for the worst is my tactic for most things, but it is harder to do with something like this. I am really hoping that I can start volunteering at the animal shelter again now that I have started taking cromolyn. It is something I really enjoyed before I got sick, and they have opened one up closer to my house. Sitting around in a pile kittens for a couple hours sounds pretty nice, especially considering my living situation. I had always wanted another Bengal (not so hard on family's allergies, more \"dog-like\" personality), but mine is not a fan of other animals, and they are not cheap. Also, getting a pet that you reserved before they were born is not ideal if your personalities do not click, so I think being in a situation like that one with your Greyhound is often the best. They seem like really sweet dogs\n\nThose requirements for training a service dog are absolutely insane. It is like that with almost everything regarding disability/chronic illness. I got sick in college, so I did not qualify for anything other than $15 a month in food stamps lol. You have to work for 40 hours a week for 10 years to qualify for Social Security, and they said, \"cannot you just tough it out for a few years?\" It is like, if I could do that, why would I go through the exhaustion and humiliation of coming here?? I was never one of those people who thought people on disability/assistance had it easy, but the reality of it was still really shocking. \n\nI am glad you such great companions to help you out when you needed it, I definitely could not make it without mine. That is awful.  I did qualify, but not for much, as I was disabled early.  It is really not enough to survive on.  \n\nAnd I agree.  The amount of hoops and expense one needs to go through to get a trained service dog is insane.  That is where a dog like my Dobie was such a gift.  Trained for personal protection work and bite work she would not have ever been a candidate for a service dog, but I just adopted her because I really needed a dog, and I felt something with her, and I had prior experience wirh Dobies.  They did not want to let me have her and after I got her home  I understood why.  Those dogs really require someone experienced with Schutzen dogs. In the state I was in she was a dangerous animal.\n\nI hired a trainer to help me out for the first 6 weeks and he was unnecessary after the first week.  She never left my side. Talk about a Velcro dog...  but man, she was smart and did not miss a thing.  She taught herself to do all the things I could ever have asked of a trained service dog and so much more I did not realize a dog was capable of. \n\nAnyway, did not mean to carry on about her.  My greyhound has been a good dog.  Happy to do stuff when I have the energy and happy to lay around and sleep when I do not.  Sight hounds are pretty much cats in dog's bodies.  Lol. And greyhounds have the lowest energy of the lot.  I  had Afghans and Pharoah hounds before I was disabled.  They are pretty high energy dogs.\n\nI think for cats with dog like personalities my Chartreux was exactly that.  Probably not as eye catching as a Bengal but I do not think anywhere near as expensive either.  A Chartreux  might be a good choice for you if she was any representation of the breed.  By far one of the best cats I have ever had. So sorry for the late reply, I think I accidentally marked a bunch of comments 'read' when I was half asleep the other day.\n\nIt is so awful that that we are penalized for becoming disabled early, not just in government/healthcare stuff, but socially \u2014 the amount of times I have heard \"you are too young to feel bad\" or \"just wait till you are my age\" \u2014 it is like I would actually rather not think about how much I am going to hurt then lol. It is so frustrating.\n\nAnd no need to apologise, I love dogs but have never had one, so I find all of this really interesting. I would always planned to get a dog as soon as I moved out, but it is good that I did not since I really could not have taken care of one properly \u2014 it tires me out when my cat wants to play fetch, of course it does not help that she is most energetic at 5 or 6am lol. Greyhounds do sound like they might be a good option if I ever get healthy enough/into a better housing situation, although after calculating the monthly cost of my medicine, I think I will need to win the lottery before I can make that happen.\n\nI would actually never heard or Chartreaux cats before \u2014 they sound a lot like Bengals in personality, and they are gorgeous, remind me of a mix between a Russian Blue and a British shorthair.  :) I have had a lot of dogs that were cats in dog's bodies,  and that cat,  who was like a dog in a cat body.   I took my male Afghan hound in for grooming and they had her by herself in a cage; the last of the litter about 9 weeks old.   She was exactly the same color as my Afghan.  When I came in, she climbed up the walls of her cage, and undid the latch, which was at the top of the cage, and climbed out.  She ran straight over to me, climbed up my jeans  and sat on my shoulder, where she stayed the whole time I was in the shop.  No fear of my dog whatsoever, and he was a huge male.  The owner had to remove her when I left.  \n\nWhen I came back to pick up my dog, the minute she spotted me she was opening the latch, climbing out, and running up my body.  Well, who could not take her home after that?\n\nI had 2 Afghans at the time and she instantly let them know there was a new Boss in town.  She would follow us when we went for walks, and try to go to work with me everyday.  My neighbors used to laugh themselves silly.  She would jump into the car at the last second  and hide, and then halfway down the street I would have to put her out.   Then she would jump on top of the hood and spread eagle, determined to hang on, and I would have to stop and remove her and try to get in and take off before she got back on.\n\nShe was not afraid of anything.  Chased off stray dogs who wandered into the yard, and lived a long life with no health issues.   \n\nShe was an indoor outdoor cat though.  I am not sure what behavioural problems you might face with one indoors all the time. Plus she had two very playful dogs to keep her entertained and my son. I would maybe research that. \n\nThey seem to be above average cat intelligence and they are fierce hunters.  I was constantly being left \"gifts\" at the foot of my bed to find when I woke up.  Some of her \"gifts\" were bigger than her. You might not find that a desirable trait.\n\nShe was naturally clean.  Never once soiled the house.  Always calm, always affectionate. Aw, sounds like a perfect match. Afghan hounds are so beautiful, I cannot imagine the grooming tho.\n\nSounds very much like a Bengal, my little it is fearless and also indoor/outdoor \u2014 all the a relatively safe land for her she would never seen the outside before. She killed a copperhead in our basement and attacked a fully grown fox \u2014 though thankfully that experience made her a bit more cautious, now that she is 12 she just lays on the porch and does not pick fights with anything bigger than a lizard. I do not like the strong prey drive, and I have saved all of her potential victims this year \\*knock on wood* praising her if she brings me something unharmed. I know I might not get that lucky with another cat, but I do feel like it is not really fair to keep them inside all the time.  Finding presents is not all that wonderful but I do not think you get the courage and the dog like qualities without a strong prey drive, as most breeds of cats that have those qualities tend to be working farm kinds of cats kept because they got rid of pests.  I tried to think of it as her bringing me her equivalent of a box of chocolates and some flowers.  Expressions of love from a cat.\ud83d\ude0a\n\nYou are oh so right on the grooming of Aghans, but they are the clowns of the dog world and the most entertaining animals.  They are their own special breed, to be sure.  I have a special place in my heart for sight hounds.\n\nYour Bengal sounds wonderful and I  bet she is gorgeous. Yeah, it is not all bad \u2014 I definitely prefer my house free of copperheads, and as long as she catches the lizards without hurting them, it is a helpful service. I have had cats growing up and been around a quite a lot of them for volunteer work, and the strong prey drive does seem to be connected to the more dynamic, dog-like personality \u2014 not that I have all that much energy myself lol, so I am chill with a cat who just wants to lay around, not to mention one who did not go outdoors would give me far less anxiety, but it also seems to be connected to a better ability to communicate (or maybe just desire to lol) and understand human communication \u2014 of course, there are a lot of factors, not the least of which is the internet with all it is cat to human translation guides, hah.\n\nBengals are amazing cats, I love their personalities, and I know everyone thinks their pets are the best, so of course I think she is a (\nI had planned to get a standard Bengal, but Lily is a snow/seal point (mixed with Ragdoll and Siamese), and from what I have heard they tend to be a bit more relaxed while still having the Bengal personality, she does the ragdoll flop ( so it is the perfect balance for me. :)\n\nSorry to go full cat lady on you, she is got a (hopefully benign) lump but I am still all emotional. She is a beauty! \n\nI hope it is benign too.  That is always worrying when a cat is already aging.  Lots of animals do get fatty lumps though, especially in old age, so do not stress until you have too.  Not good for you or the cat.\n\nI had a lot of Manxes also, and 1 that was colored like a Siamese except with longer hair, with bright blue eyes.  Gorgeous animal.  Most of the others were black with green eyes like their mother, my first Manx, but he was the standout in the litter.  I kept 1 black 1 and the Siamese looking 1 out of the litter.  I like the Manx personality also.  They were always good cats. \n\nA good snuggler that likes to lay around all day is a Persian mix,  but the hair.... I have had 2 half Persians and both were stay at home snuggle cats.  By their choice. Thanks for your kind thoughts. &lt;3 apparently it is pretty common, so I am trying not to worry too much, but her current vet is super slow to make an appointment with all the covid restrictions. :/\n\nAnd yeah, the hair is actually a problem with the seal point Bengals too, which I did not really consider at the time, the started Bengals tend to have a really short coat that is not that about shedding. If I do not spend at least half an hour grooming everyday, everything is white, I cannot imagine a Persian. Persians are great lazy indoor lap cats with sweet personalities but that hair is maintenance daily.", "Pain when gently pressing just to the right of my tailbone First injured it getting out of the car. Now the same pain a few inches higher, but do not remember injuring it. No marks on skin. Very weird. The slightest touch to my skin is painful only in those two spots. My daughter said might be mast cell. Thanks for any ideas.", "Muscle twitching I just recently started getting muscle twitching mostly on my legs but I will also feel them randomly throughout my body. Is this a sign of a trigger or just part of the MCAS package? I also noticed really strong aches around the interior side of my ilium is. These all just came up recently so not sure if that means I am not stabilizing my MCAS or a new trigger happened. Sometimes that just indicative of hydration.  In my case this was a symptom of a nutritional deficiency because my GI system was so inflamed it was not absorbing many foods or vitamins from before I knew I had MCAS (and then because of my fear of eating/taking vitamins and supplements afterwards). For several months I had what you describe combined with (a) a feeling like their was a piece of tape stuck behind my knees, (b) the need to initiate movement from sitting to standing by lifting my legs with my clothes, (c) a deep but not too painful bone ache, (d) loss of coordination and balance, and (e) crazy cramps where my legs muscles would just seize up, and once when my right hand became locked in a claw while driving. Once I found a safe B6, B12, C, and D3 things got a lot better. Oh, yeah, and Ketotifen. Oh goodness, that sounds like debilitating symptoms to have for months! I am glad you were able to figure out what to take to help. How did you know you had nutritional deficiency? Did you have specific bloodwork done? Thanks for the link! I feel like I am pretty hydrated (urines are pretty pale/clear) so I do not think it is due to hydration in my case. Appreciate the thought! Many nutritional deficiencies show up on complete metabolic panels (I think it is called a CMC?), but your doctor can run separate bloodwork for vitamins and minerals if it seems medically necessary. In my case insurance covered all of it except $46.", "Do desensitization procedures ever work for MCAS? TL;DR I want to do a desensitization procedure for a drug. Does this ever work for MCAS patients? \n\nI had an injection in March which triggered MCAS. (Though I probably had a mild case for years before that.) I got the injection while in a flare from some other health problems and while in a flare from what was probably mild MCAS. \n\nI did allergy testing to one of the ingredients in the injection, and reacted to it. (Trouble breathing etc.) Though I ended up being off antihisamines for 12 days prior to the test, so I was reacting to just about everything. (We did not know I had MCAS yet...)\n\nI am looking to get the same injection again. I am hoping a desensitization procedure may help me tolerate it better. (And also lots of premedication.)\n\nAny thoughts or experiences welcome. Very short term, if I take a hot shower I flare up and \u201eburn out\u201c so to speak. I sometimes have a bit of normal time afterwards. (Training included) \nNot on medication yet or diagnosed but we\u2018re sure I have a extreme form of something mast cell related which causes permanent flushing and tachycardia/ heat disregulation. Desensitization is interesting.  It is both accepted and controversial at the same time.  The general idea is a patient is exposed to ever greater doses of an antigen to stimulate tolerance to the antigen.  The controversy comes in when other substances are paired with the antigen to speed up the effect.  For example, in the UK, enzyme potentiated desensitization was used in desensitization by adding Beta-glucuronidase to the antigen.  Supposedly the  Beta-glucuronidase convinced the body to tolerate the antigen with smaller concentrations of antigen.\n\nFrom the little I have read.  Drug immunotherapy either does not work long term, or few attempts are made to make it work long term.  Drug desensitization protocols are used in patients that needs a drug, there is no other drug available, and the patient shows an immune mediated response to the drug.  The desensitization protocol is administered to acclimate the patient to the needed drug.  Then the drug is applied like normal.  Then the patient no longer needs the drug.  So no one cares if the patient continues to react the the drug. Thanks!\n\nWhat do you mean by immune mediated response? Like difficulty breathing, brain fog, heaviness, etc?\n\nI just need to get this injection once or twice a year - so it is ok if the desensitization effect is not permanent. I just wondered if desensitization works for people with MCAS? Yes. It is possible. However I do not know what the substance is or if you could have it supplied in the doses you would need to desensitize, or have it compounded somehow to desensitize. If it is something you can just buy, that makes it easier. Finding out tomorrow from my allergist!\n\nYou can probably guess what the thing is but sometimes forums are weird about talking about it.... Immune mediated responses involve an immunoglobulin (IgE, IgG, etc.).  If your reaction is caused by an immunoglobulin that binds to the medication and stimulates an immune response, then desensitization protocols may work.  If the reaction does not involve an immunoglobulin, desensitization may not work.\n\nMCAS is a poorly understood syndrome that is diagnosed by the following criteria:\n\n1. Recurrent abdominal pain, diarrhea, flushing, itching, nasal congestion, coughing, chest tightness, wheezing, lightheadedness (usually a combination of some of these symptoms is present)\n2. Laboratory evidence of mast cell mediator (elevated serum tryptase, N-methyl histamine, prostaglandin D2 or 11-beta- prostaglandin F2 alpha, leukotriene E4 and others)\n3. Improvement in symptoms with the use of medications that block or treat elevations in these mediators\"\n\nAs far as I know, desensitization is not considered a treatment for MCAS.  The main treatments are antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers, and NSAIDs.  So, I can only speak about desensitization in a general sense.  I am not up to speed on studies involving desensitization MCAS. Ah, I see what you mean. I do not know if I have an IgE reaction to this substance, and there is no way to test for it.\n\nI was diagnosed with mast cell activation (not syndrome, as we never ran the tests to confirm). I was down to zero safe foods, among other problems. Mast cell stabilizers (Cromolyn, ketotifen) and antihistamines (H1, H2) help me *so much*, so I do not really have any doubts at this point that is what is going on. But it does make things tricky.\n\nThanks for the info. If you had allergy testing of the ingredients in the injection, the one you reacted to will be an IgE reaction, which is an actual allergy. MCAS reactions are not real allergies and therefore do not show up on allergy testing. I have not come across desensitisation in relation to MCAS, but if you are lucky maybe it would work for this one ingredient. It is difficult to tell, but it might be that one ingredient is the only issue? It was an oral allergy test, unfortunately...not blood. They tried doing a prick test, but everything was negative, including the histamine control. What happened?  He can do a six-hour desensitization procedure for PEG, and then I would have 24 hours to get an mRNA vaccine. \n\nUnfortunately my allergist can only administer Moderna in his office, which I am inclined not to get due to the higher PEG content. So I may just go to a pharmacy to get Pfizer and hope for the best.\n\nOn the other hand, my allergist said that none of his patients who had the desensitization procedure reacted to the mRNA vaccine \ud83e\udd73. So maybe it would be safe to get Moderna after all. I do not know if any of those patients had MCAS.\n\nMy allergist does not know enough about MCAS for my liking, and the MCAS specialists in the area are not affordable to me. So idk if this will go well. I am just going to load up on antihistamines and hope for the best! And consult my ND, who knows a little about MCAS. My doctor told me that allergy shots for environmental allergens would work for mastocytic enterocolitis. I have no other source for any info at all on it, but they knew enough to do the special stain on my biopsies, so they must have some experience. I think immune mediated is wider than simply immunoglobulins. There are cells and complement and lots of other things involved in the immune system. The OP was diagnosed MCAS and wanted to know if desensitization will help them. Desensitization changes the immune system such that allergen exposure  triggers CD4+ cells to produce inhibitory immune mediators like IL-10.  I was saying for desensitization to work, a patient's symptoms must be caused by something suppressed by an increase in inhibitory immune mediators like IL-10.  Desensitization often works for IgE mediated allergies. Desensitization does not appear to work on everyone that experiences symptoms triggered by an environmental source.  Suggesting some people are responding to environmental triggers with a mechanism in the body that is not silenced by inhibitory immune mediators.", "My 0.02 (rant) Maybe it is because I live on the outside edges of society. I am excessively queer, I am completely nocturnal, my skin color is in the 99th percentile of dark/light tones, my height and weight are 99th percentile as well. Fitting in was never an option. Having a normal life was never even *briefly* on the table.\n\nBut do you ever wonder if we are right and the entire rest of the world is wrong?\n\nWhenever I think about it for more than a few minutes, I cannot help but notice everything that bothers me is actually pretty bad stuff. \n\nTriggered by grass, an invasive species that is overplanted and makes a comfy home for all manner of disease-carrying microscopic monsters? Boo hoo.\n\nMaybe I have a hospitalization episode because a car splashes a puddle of pond water on me. Oh my god, how is that bad? Feeling like you are dying SHOULD be the reaction to getting splashed with post-industrial trace amounts of who-knows-what.\n\nPerhaps a custodian sprayed way too much cleaner. Well, GASP! My body freaked out at carcinogens that nobody's supposed to breathe. Basically, it called out someone for being a careless jerk. Oh no!\n\nAs they say, many people with pet allergies are not allergic to pets, they are allergic to what is *on* the pets. And every year there is a little bit more icky stuff for pets to hop around in.\n\n**I reject labels like \"disease\" or \"environmental sensitivity\".** People should call our issues \"Sensitivity to Psychotically Bad Environments\", or \"lacking the illness that makes people able to ignore emergency-level danger\". If you want shorter ones, how about \"Evolved Mast Cell Owners\", or simply (this is my favorite) \"Cancer Resistant\".\n\nWhen I think about it, almost everything I lose a weekend from is a known *potential* carrier of **pathogens** or **carcinogens**. So my body is *protecting* me and giving me the honest truth about the horrors I am surrounded by. *Why on Earth* should we have to medicate our bodies to be able to accept mass delusion, when what we *should* get to do in a perfect world, is make the gutless insane 99.9% of people stop being filthy and disgusting?\n\n(Well, it cannot be too perfect if we are all still sick, but you get the idea.)\n\nSorry. I know that is not the whole story and there are perfectly safe things that can cause a world of pain. Some carrots absolutely slay me. I have had bug stings that turned into very long drawn-out family \"say your goodbyes\" events. It is not all caused by people, and I know it is not normal, and of course I wish it would go away. But every now and then when I am seeing stars from a rollercoaster of going in and out of anaphylaxis, I try to remember that just as fear warns the brain to be on the lookout for trouble, maybe this has a good side.\n\nMaybe if I live through this, I will live longer than most. My body is so sensitive it almost kills me, but also therefore logically, it is an amazing danger detector. And sometimes instead of hating myself I wish people had better standards. \n\nThat is my silver lining. I get the privilege of seeing the world in a way almost nobody else does and having insights very few people get to experience.\n\nSometimes at the darkest moments, that keeps me going. I have referred to myself as a canary in a coal mine, which I believe is quite similar to the excellent point you have made. I first started reacting to \"foods\" that were obviously bad for everyone, if anyone took the time to think about it. Of course, I later had trouble with cleaners, fragrances, etc. That shit is toxic, man! No one should be using it. \n\nRemember, you are not alone. Some of my views would be considered extreme if I ever told anyone about them. I do not understand why humans insist on poisoning everything, including themselves. Unfortunately, I do not think the likes of you and me are going to have much impact. Maybe in a few hundred years the survivors will figure it out.\n\nI do not know about being cancer resistant, though. I have already had skin cancer twice and probably have it again. It is not related to sun exposure.\n\nI have never really fit in anywhere either, although I look like a lot of other people. I believe it is best not to fit in. The people who invent things, change political systems and generally get worthwhile stuff done NEVER fit in. Gah, sorry if you felt disrespected! Deep down I kind of knew the bit about cancer was a little weaselly and not really accurate to say. I hope yours stays in remission! That must have been really scary to go through. Being allergic to the entire world is one thing, you can just strong through it (sort of - for me, \"strong\" is more like \"crying like a baby\"). But the idea of a potentially malignant, potential \"game over, you lose\" event coming out of nowhere, that is terrifying. And for you to be so kindly spoken and considerate after all that, I immediately thought you must be an incredibly amazing person. \n\nQuite curious about your views! I have definitely thought that the kind of observations you and I are making are simply \"right\" because they are calm, observant, rational. Of course that is very unscientific and I would be happy to be proven wrong about my darker feelings, but in general I believe that looking at society and asking \"Why do we do any of what we do?\" is a supremely important job. And I have definitely assumed that it is a matter of waiting for some future where people are cleverer. Born at the wrong moment in history. :)\n\nAlso I love your username, haha. Keeps making me smile. Please do not worry about being disrespectful! The kind of skin cancer I have had is the \"best\" kind to have. You just cut it out and it does not spread, so no worries there. I have not had the full cancer experience of being scared, having chemo, etc. I actually think the skin cancer was related to MCAS or EDS.\n\nThanks about the username. It is just a silly thing. \n\nI have come to the conclusion that why people do what they do is.....well, it is not very flattering to humans what I think. To quote a great movie, Men in Black,  \"**A person is smart**. **People** are dumb, panicky dangerous animals and you know it.\" \n\nAnyway, if you would like to continue this conversation, send me a chat message.  I do call myself an indicator frog as I feel like that is kind of what we are in some ways. Someday others will react to higher concentrations of some of the same stuff like city smog. And we will be like lol take a mask. \n\nBut idk I mean. I react to pretty much all food. Unprocessed food is very bad for me. Dust mites are normal and very bad for me. So I do not think there is a hidden meaning to my immune system being annoying. I just react to pretty much everything.", "Is it possible to lead normal life? If you have MCAS, is it possible to lead normal life if you take your meds? Also, is it possible that MCAS just goes away on its own.\n\nI had eczema for 10 years, and one day it just vanished on its own with no treatment whatsoever. What my doctor told me : if you have MCAS and take your meds regularly for several months/years, the body can sometimes calm down enough for you to be able to need less medication. In other words, to get closer to normal.\n\nI honestly do not know if it can ever truly go away, but I know that by avoiding all triggers and working only part-time, my mom is able to have a lot more energy, and a good social life, compared to before.\n\nAs for me, with my meds (when Ranitidine was still available, *sigh*), I had a lot less anxiety, brain fog and pains. I had never felt so good. I do not know, but I am hoping for it. My doc told me he could make me feel a lot better with the right medication, but he never promised a normal life. We all just have to keep trying. I think it really depends on what you consider to be normal. But no, it is unlikely for it to actually simply go away on its own. Yes and yes. \n\nIt is possible to have partial remission for years at a time. Strictly Avoid the things you react to. Take your meds. \n\nIt is not easy but it is possible. That is sad af. It is. I am sitting in bed right now, having had to give up on a family beach and pool day after a few hours. They are still going strong. I got some fun in, though! Thanks for the info. You should check back with your doctor about ranitidine, I am taking it because my allergist said it was a temporary discontinuation due to a bad batch. I know for sure at least as early as March 2010 (when I started it) they have been able to prescribe it again.\n\nEdit: I should say I in Canada though not sure if different for other countries It still was not available in July in Belgium. Aww boo hopefully soon then. I know I feel much better on it too. What are ur main symptoms my friend. Migraine and fatigue are the most prominent. I also get rashes, itching, IBS and interstitial cystitis, heart palpitations. Brain fog almost disappeared with the right meds. As long as I am careful and do not overdo it or get stressed too many days in a row, I can function quite well. Right now I am recovering from 2 or 3 weeks of unavoidable stress and activity. I am trying to get diagnosed as having MCAS rather than allergies. As a last resort they threw some Montelukast at me since my Fexofenadine was dealing with the dust mite allergy but did not touch the brain fog or fatigue. I took that for 3 months and along with exercise and reduced stress all my symptoms went away. Did not take a single Antihistamine for 2.5 years. Even low level things I would had for years (urticaria in a hot shower) disappeared. Except this year they came back! So going back to immunologist to get a formal diagnosis and at least get them to prescribe the same drugs! Hi trying to get diagnosed as having MCAS rather than allergies, I am Dad\ud83d\udc68", "Help in France? Hello! Fellow French Redditor here, I come to you because my wife needs help. She is unfortunately sick and we are having a hard time finding what could be the cause of it. We believe it could be MCAS.\n\nShe has all the symptoms but I would love to know if someone out here has had a diagnosis in France (or Belgium). Or maybe just someone who speaks French and can talk about it with my SO.\n\nThank you so much for your time, I hope this helps her. You could always just try common mcas treatments and see if it helps your wife. Many people take H1 and H2 antihistamines twice a day (zyrtec, famotidine). Supplements like quercitin,high doses of vitamin c and theanine can help stabilize mast cells. Ketotifen is another good medicine that is available in some countries. CBD can also help calm mast cells. Nasalcrom is nasal spray that stabilizes mast cells. I believe in France the equivalent is called cromabak. There should be eyedrops as well. I did find this clinic in Paris that is supposed to treat mast cell disease: \n I am sorry this is happening.  I am 30 years into my own personal war.\n\nThis is my super high level \"illnesses that cannot be diagnosed by doctors\" list with simple diagnostic criteria:\n\nMCAS - Multiple GI, airway/lung, muscle, and neurological symptoms.  Environmental triggers seem to be the cause.  Allergists not willing to diagnose an allergy.  Symptoms improve with anti-histamines and mast cell stabilizers.\n\nFibromyalgia - Numbness, tingling sensations, muscle pains, but test show nothing.\n\nME/CFS - Main symptoms is severe fatigue.  There can be many other symptoms too. Exercise seems to make everything worse.  This is called PEM - Post Exertional Malaise.  PEM is also a major symptoms of ME/CFS.   There is often a bad virus before symptoms started.\n\nLong COVID - Similar to ME/CFS, but an antibody test shows a COVID infection before symptoms started.\n\nChemical Sensitivities - Many symptoms, GI track, lungs, fatigue, sore eyes, brain fog, muscle weakness.  All symptoms are triggered by an environmental source.  There are reactions to cleaning products and artificial fragrances.  Over time reactions to more and more common substances such as gasoline, plastics, etc.  Nothing seems to help with symptoms except avoiding triggers.\n\nThis is clearly not all that scientific, and probably upsets some people who have very precise criteria for these conditions, but there is too much to put in one post.  You need to work with  doctors and rule out everything diagnosable.  After that we all just tend to classify ourselves with something and then following research and look for treatment ideas. I want to add Lyme disease to this list.  While there technically are test, they are pretty crappy and should not be relied on.  If you test positive, you can be pretty confident in that result, but false negatives are incredibly common.  It is really hard to make a symptom list though because most people with Lyme have more than one infection so it is different for everyone.  But the most common, simplest presentation would be something like: first symptoms feel a bit like a flu, sore muscles, headache, fatigue, maybe a slight fever.  Swollen and painful joints are really common.  May escalate into neurological issues if left untreated. Hi ! I am (28F) belgian and french speaking, so feel free to PM me :)\n\nI was diagnosed by a hematologist in H\u00f4pital Erasme in Brussels. They were really understanding about everything, and I do my yearly checkup with them. The ceresmast does not treat people directly, they partner with local doctors. That is how I found mine. If you do not find someone in France or Belgium, I believe the faceboook page \"Canadian Masties\" has some French speaking members. Thank you so much for your time, this helps a lot!! I am officially in holiday starting tomorrow meaning that I will have all my time to be contacting doctors for appointments all over France for my wife. This disease looks like a complicated one to have. Also I want to add, it feels nice to not feel alone in this. :)", "Protein powder or other protein supplements? Anyone have any luck with low histamine proteins powders or am I just stuck with the meat? I really need help gaining weight here. Im sorry, I do not have any recommendations. I am still looking for one myself. All that I do know is to avoid the plant based ones that use soy as their protein source. For me, most soy products are a no go. Absorb plus is the one I use. The last thing I did was plain egg white protein. If you can do artificial sweeteners there is lots of options, you are going to need to go shopping and label reading imo I just need to gain weight this is not sustainable, Im not really underweight,  I just do not like to be skinny Before anyone says eggs are high histamine: A lot of online guides say that eggs are high histamine because they cite a study from 1952 where they injected raw egg into animals and detected a histamine reaction. Well nobody eats eggs that way. OP should gradually introduce them the old fashioned way and monitor for reactions. Eggs are a good suggestion. I personally love fat and do better with things when I do not restrict it, so I would eat the yolk. And in fact I have eaten freshly cooked eggs when I need safe bland food. The dietitian I am working with recommended the Vital Proteins Unflavored Collagen. She said that due to all of the sensitivities I have, that I would have to get an unflavored whey protein, but it would taste horrendous. I am not sensitive to whey, which was lucky. Collagen. Bone broth powders. These even come in flavors or you can get plain ones. \n\nHemp. Spirulina. \n\nCan you tolerate whey?  That is supposed to be the best. Whey makes me hurl. Meat is the safest for me. Unfortunately. Dairy/whey may or may not work for you. Rice protein is available, I have starting using it recently. I think it is ok but not sure yet. Otherwise everything will have either soy or pea protein (neither of which I can handle).\n\nIf you are trying to gain weight in general, you should be looking at fats not protein. Afaik oils are low on histamine, and they are high in calories. And oil is actually healthy if you are trying to gain weight. Bone broth is high histamine, &amp; hemp is high Oxalate, which a lot of people have issues with as well as lectins. Rice is high in both. I have found that high histamine foods do not bother me, but a lot of \"safe\" foods do. I do have to avoid oxalates because I am prone to kidney stones. I have issues with oxalates so rice is unfortunately a no go, I will have to try the whey now that my diet is low histamine.\n\nI drink A2 milk and coconut milk. It is just usually not enough for me to gain weight. \n\nMy days usually egg yolks no egg white, meat, bell peppers, onions, milk and mango shakes \n\nThose foods just are not enough to keep me gaining weight each day. I will try the whey and see what happens thanks! Same. I typically have low histamine days that include eggs. Give Drink Wholesome a try. They use minimally processed real food ingredients (no dairy, no added junk), and their flavors are quite tasty. Hey I will. On a side note I started drinking A2 2% milk with frozen mangoes. That with egg yolk and protein like chicken or beef so far seems to be doing the trick. Thanks for the suggestion No problem.", "New to the community: any advice? Hi there, I recently found out about MCAS and a lot of my symptoms line up. I am now trying to get a diagnosis and find out everything I can about how to improve my quality of life. \n\nDoes anyone have any tips about food, environments, and on how to deal with the mental/emotional strain of living with this condition? I have already started to change my diet based on histamine lists I have seen online, though I am still very symptomatic. Any insight is appreciated :) For me it was two parts to improving my quality of life. One was learning and avoiding my personal triggers including drastically changing my diet. Two was getting the right medications at the right doses. Took me about two years altogether from first symptoms. Sometimes I almost felt normal, and then they took ranitidine (Zantac) off the market and I have just been getting slowly worse ever since I switched to something else. \n\nAs for how you can cope with the disease? I would like to know the answer, too. I have medical PTSD from all of the anaphylaxis and also severe social anxiety because every adult social interaction revolves around food and activities that I just cannot do or be around and it is extremely isolating because no one really gets it. I cannot even have a glass of wine to loosen up from the stress anymore. So I guess I would suggest you find an outlet for yourself and someone close to you for support, if possible. Thank Dog my wife is so sensitive and supportive. I do not think I would have made it this far without her. Thank you for your response! I am so sorry that the mental strain of this condition has been so taxing, and I am glad that you have a good support system in your wife. Hang in there!", "Anyone actually feel better after the vaccine? Took Janssen and feel a lot better. The same thing happens when I am sick with a cold or flu, my bladder pain disappears. I still feel bad, because I am sick, but the horrific bladder pain disappears. I do not think it matters which vaccine I has as long as it made my immune system flip. \n\nJanssen gave me chills, body ache, mind fog, and an arm that feels like it was hit with a hard ball, but I prefer all this over the usual bladder pain. Symptoms only lasted that night and the following day. I feel great right now aside from a sore arm. \n\nI noticed the covid long haulers, who believe it is MCAS related, also felt better after the vaccine. But I am assuming just like when I am sick, this is only temporary. Yep, had the same thing after the first dose of pfizer. Day one I had some minor mast cell issues, the next day felt better than I had in ages, the day after that I was back to normal though.", "What to do when you cannot figure out a trigger? My wife (bed-bound) has been having symptoms and attacks since Sunday but we cannot figure out why. The biggest concern is that she is having a really hard time breathing. \n\nShe says that there is something in the air, but neither of us can figure out what it would be. Aside from the time change and the temperature change there have not really been any other changes around the house. How can we figure out what is going on? Temperature change will absolutely trigger this.\n\nYour body uses the same process that causes inflammation in order to match your internal pressure to atmospheric pressure.\n\nAlso, if she has a menstrual cycle, certain points in the menstrual cycle can cause flares in many folks with mast cell disease.  I literally started transitioning to male because my cycle was making me so sick and there was no other way to avoid it - even if I had gotten my organs removed, I would have had to continue to take estrogen and progesterone, and the concept of the menstrual cycle is built into these hormones such that, even without those organs I, would still experience a bad flare every single month Anyway it warms my heart to see a partner caring! Most of my partners have not believed me about mast cell disease, so thanks for taking care of her &lt;3 Thanks so much for your comment. \n\nAre there any things we can do to mitigate the effects temperature change might have? Or is it just a \"tough-it-out\" situation? If she can get away with taking more meds, that is probably the main solution you have here.  Obviously there are limits to how much antihistamines you can take before you start uh, you know, falling asleep and forgetting everything that happens haha.  \n\nThere are also many, many OTC mast cell stabilizers that you could get through Amazon etc so that she would not have to go see a doctor to get more meds prescribed.\n\nKeeping your home a little colder *might* improve symptoms, but it could also worsen them, since we each have a unique inflammatory response to every trigger in the world. Thank you! Also in terms of the burning face, if she is on cromolyn, i would mix that into a face cream; if she is not on cromolyn, you can buy Nasalcrom spray without a prescription.  I spray that stuff on my face a lot during flares. Just to be sure. Have you checked her temperature? Yeah, it is 98.1, so we are in the chear there :)", "Nasalcrom, how helpful is it? Hello, my doctor just started me on nasalcrom and I was curious how helpful people have found it to be. It is one of the frequently used mast cell stabilizers that I have not tried yet. I did not do well on gastrocrom, which is the same ingredient, so I am not sure how this is going to go. Just wondering if it helps with any mcas symptoms other than nasal ones. Thanks. Works for me, the spray nasalcrom works temporarily and last about half day per apply. I also use the ampoule as well in conjunction. Thanks for the reply! I take gastrocrom (well cromolyn sodium) but I also take nasalcrom because I still have to deal with bad seasonal allergies and it helps a lot with that. I do not think it is anywhere near as effective as the oral version. \n\nBy the way, did your doctor have you ease in to your gastrocrom dosage? I was told by  my doctor to start with one vial once a day for a week before adding a second vial. It took 8 weeks to get to the full dosage. I think that made a big difference. Some people even start with half a vial to start to get used to the medication. Sharing in case it helps- a lot of people start at a full dosage an will generally have a bad reaction at that amount to start. Its OTC in the US so Im guessing does not affect the system as much as gastrocrom. Its likely similar to a stwroid free nasal spray like flonase. He started me at 1 full vial twice a day, which too much for me. I need to try it again at a lower dose and see if I can handle it. I had varied luck with over the counter cromolyn nose spray.  What really helped was when I got mine compounded at a compound pharmacy.  The only additional ingredient other than cromolyn is distilled water and I think it helps a lot.  I hear from experts \u201cget cromolyn in you in as many ways as possible\u201d and it helps me a lot.  \n\nOn another note, I was unable to take cromolyn sodium and gave up on it until my doctor suggested I get it compounded in a pill with rice flour gel.  I had to go to a special pharmacy that had it, but those things probably saved my life. Once I got that cromolyn in me, I felt a lot better within weeks.  So, if you cannot do the sodium, get it compounded w rice flour and you will likely have better luck. Oh wow, I did not know that was an option, thank you! Believe me, I basically thought the dr was a waste of time, but that one suggestion he made saved my life.  It is expensive but worth it! That is a much higher dose than what my doctor had me start. So the basic guidelines is 1 vial once a day for a week (I started with my breakfast dosage). My doctor told me that I did not need to dilute it in 8oz of water but could do 4-6 oz instead if it did not bother me. In your case, perhaps diluting it in more water may help. In week 2, I added a second vial (the lunch time dose). So by week 4, I was taking 4 vials, 4 times per day. Then by week 8, I was on a full dose of 2 vials, 4 times per day. The guidance originated from the Brigham and Women's Mastocytosis Center. \n\nLike I mentioned before, some people start with an even lower dosage at 1/4 or 1/2 a vial to get used to it. \n\nI started noticing some improvement about 2-3 months in but even after a few year's I have noticed other improvements. But if it does not work for you, you may want to look into ketotifen but you will have to get it compounded. I am going to ask my doctor about it today. He is trying his best to help me but he is still learning about mcas. Thanks again! Thanks for all the info. I recently tried ketotifen and I reacted to it even when we tried a super low dose. If you do not mind my asking, how much is your prescription? I think it is around 180 for 2 months supply I do not understand this. Could you explain further?", "Vision problems? Does anyone else have vision problems associated with their illness? I seem to have ocular inflammation, dry eye, and problems wearing my contacts. Is this common? I had a really bad reaction last month. Even my forehead was swollen. Once the swelling went down enough that I could open my eyes, I realized one was painful when I touched my eyelid gently in one spot. I looked under my eyelid and I had a clear, fluid filled bump on my eyeball. I am really sure it came from the reaction. I went to the walk in clinic because they were open on the holiday, and the doctor I saw prescribed antibiotic eye drops and said I could not wear my contact lenses for at least two weeks. By the third day, the bump was gone.\n\nMy daughter and I also have trouble with spatial perception during reactions. I also get blurry vision.\n\nI think the large dosages of antihistamines we take cause dry eye. I have heard that using a warm compress over your eyes for 15 minutes twice a day will help dry eye, but I have not tried it. I have had such severe dry eye these last two years. I got punctal plugs and they have not helped. Doc said my ocular surface is inflamed, too. This can be a symptom of DED, but could be a function of inflammatory symptoms of MCAS. My contacts cloud up constantly and I was told I was allergic to my contacts when I was younger. Now I am just getting stys left and right. So aggravating. Have you tried a mast cell stabilizing eye drop? I am using Pataday. I used ketotifen eye drops before, but I could not find any that did not have at least one ingredient I react to, so they did not help. There is also a cromolyn sodium eye drop, but it is prescription. No, I have not tried those. I will have to ask my ophthalmologist what he thinks when I see him next. I am also going to the Brigham and Women\u2019s clinic in November so I might just suck it up until I can see them. Have you been checked for Sjogren's Syndrome? It can cause those symptoms and is often comorbid with MCAS. I have not been able to wear contacts for years, they just dry out too quickly. I have tried several types that are meant to work better with problem/dry eyes but still no luck. \n\nI also find that on bad days my eyesight can get blurrier, and I especially have trouble with bright sunlight on those days. Its otc stuff, you could buy it anytime and try it. I have had the typical dryness like everyone else. Blurred vision sometimes, but also kind of a static/neural snow (I forget the actual term). Also have had one eye dilate briefly while the other is fine. Even have it dilate in an oval shape known as tadpole pupil. Ketotifen drops help. If you are still trying to wear contacts, be aware that taking ketotifen eye drops with them in will make them unnaturally stiff. I take the ketotifen drops at night after I take out my contacts or an hour before I put them in in the morning. The more I react the worse my depth perception gets. And I get more dissociated so I feel sort of disconnected from the world. I do also have some amount of brain damage so maybe it is just worsening that though. Dry eyes from antihistamines. I have urticaria and I get ocular migraines I cannot even explain. It is like a roller coaster of flashing circles followed by migraine pain on one side of the head. I get daily chronic headaches, too but they are in the base of my head. This is like my contacts glazing over and becoming too opaque to see out of for how dry they are.", "Joint pain? Anyone have any research or insight on the mechanisms for joint pain in MCAS? My autoimmune markers are negative but lymphocytes are elevated. Following. I recently had a flare that I am unsure is related to MCAS, but I was increasing my cromolyn at the time so it is suspicious. But my knee actually swelled which is unusual for me, usually I just get pain with minimal visual inflammation. Here is an article linking mast cells with osteoarthritis. Arthritis runs in my family and I have MCAS. I have only had few flare-ups of joint pain though.\n\n Thanks for this. I have had increasing joint pain in the last month or so. Before it was only my knees and hips that bothered me (old injuries) but now my feet, wrists, and elbows hurt all the time AM-PM. I thought I could be expressing some osteoarthritis from sports or because of MCAS. I will look at the link and see!  I was diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome years before I received my MCAS diagnosis. I had a lot of widespread body pain and joint pain that I always assumed was EDS related. My doctors at the time also suspected fibromyalgia. But I got dxed with MCAS last year and started taking cromolyn sodium, and realized about two months in that my body and joint pain had been drastically reduced! I guess I just assumed that the MCAS connection to EDS was common knowledge, since I started there too. I assumed every comment was going to say what yours did. \n\nSpoke to my MCAS specialist for the first time today, and so excited to find out oral cromolyn can help with joint pain! We have unfortunately been struggling to find it available anywhere. I definitely only know about MCAS because of EDS - a friend of mine got diagnosed with MCAS, and knew I had a lot of GI issues that dovetailed with hers. She also knew I had EDS, so when she learned they were comorbid, she urged me to get checked out. I was actually in the middle of what I know now was a massive MCAS flare. I started a low histamine diet and saw some improvement, and I brought it up to my primary care doctor. He has a few EDS patients and once of them has MCAS, so based on my presentation of my symptoms and them seeming to respond well to a low histamine diet, he wrote me a prescription for the cromolyn sodium immediately. We did a med check recently and I told him it was basically life-changing for me, so that was enough to confirm my diagnosis for him! Wow! That is great! Went from 0-60! \nThey say if it works for you, then you get an automatic diagnosis. My allergist made me spend months ruling out everything. Including an endoscope and colonoscopy at the same time. Ha. Wish I could have started sooner. It is been 10 months. \n\nDid you ease into the medicine or just all 4 doses a day at once from the beginning? Of it makes you feel better, I have had to have an endoscopy in the past and have an appointment with a new gastroenterologist tomorrow because I have been dealing with abdominal pain and blood in my stool. They already sent me for an abdominal CT, but I suspect there will be more scoping in my immediate future!\n\nI was able to start all 4 vials a day from the get go with no I will effects besides maybe an increase in diarrhea for a few days. I am generally not super reactive to medications, though. My triggers tend to be food, skin-related, and environmental. Like, I am crazy reactive to any adhesives on my skin, sensitive to lots of foods, completely intolerant to alcohol, and have violent reactions to certain smells (especially incense and air freshener). You sound a lot like me! Maybe I will just go for all 4 at once. The idea of medicine 4 times a day is super overwhelming though. Do you just set phone alarms?\n\nMy symptoms have helped a lot by doing intermittent fasting, and starting at dinner. When I told her that today she was shocked. I said I honestly prefer that over diarrhea all day long from eating all day! She thought the not eating was worse. I disagreed. Yes, phone alarms are my friend! I also was basically doing intermittent fasting because eating pretty much anything would set off diarrhea. I also have gastroparesis, so I never really felt hungry. When I started the cromolyn, I was mostly just existing on smoothies and a small dinner, so I just set my alarm for equal amounts of time throughout the day. After a while, I realized I was beginning to develop an appetite again! So now I have it first thing in the morning, then a half hour later I take my other meds, and then I can have breakfast. Then I do a dose around noonish and have a small lunch or snack. Then I have one in the evening before dinner - you just want to give yourself about a half hour before you eat, so I usually drink it before I start cooking. And then I do my last dose at bedtime. It seems to help a little with my night sweats and itchiness. Hmm. I am genuinely never hungry til dinner, honestly. Never assumed that could mean more. Will look into that!\n\nGastro never found anything. Even did a small bowel follow through study, which as SO interesting. Found I had a super sonic transfer time, only 45 min from swallowing to the end of my colon. But no diagnosis of anything. I have a handful of diagnoses - GERD, IBS, and the gastroparesis. To diagnose the gastroparesis, they did a gastric emptying study where I ate radiated scrambled eggs and then did scans over the course of several hours to track my digestion. There were still eggs in there like 5 hours later. But everything was kind of deemed idiopathic/probably related to EDS. I have learned now that a lot of MCAS patients also get diagnosed with IBS and gastroparesis and some doctors think MCAS may be the underlying etiology in a lot of those cases, but I do not think it is necessarily been confirmed yet. Realizing that I was experiencing GI anaphylaxis and not the more well-known anaphylactic response in the airways was so enlightening! I do have some airway issues, but it is mostly adult onset asthma and sometimes my oxygen saturation gets low, - I have never had the airways close fully. I do still think there is also connective tissue stuff that could be having an effect on my GI tract - hence the gastroenterologist visit tomorrow! Radiate eggs! Who knew! Every knew test or procedure are so interesting! The barium they made me drink was so disgusting! Thick, chalky, and tasted like a shitty fruit flavor lip gloss tastes. Like wannabe fruit, but nowhere near it. It revealed a single diverticulum, but also no dx. \n\nMy colonoscopy noted spastic colon, but still no IBS diagnosis. They also said it took them 3 times the amount of the \u201ctwilight\u201d anesthesia. They said I was putting up a fight. Well, they should have bought me dinner first! Ugh, I am SO glad I did not have to drink that! It sounds like the kind of thing that would make me instantly vomit. When I had to do a glucose test to check for gestational diabetes, I had to drink this horrible thick fruity liquid and could not keep it down. Just kept gagging.\n\nI have the opposite problem with the anesthesia, where I do not want to wake up after! They had to take out my gallbladder a few years ago, and I ended up being in the recovery room for like three extra hours because I kept falling back asleep and my oxygen kept plummeting. Now I am nervous to get sedated again! Gallbladder free club, here too! Yeah, the barium was way worse than that stuff!\n\nThat sounds like a great nap! Ha! But that is interesting, any chance you could have sleep apnea? Just read on another post about it being common among \u201cus\u201d. I did one of those overnight at home sleep monitors a few years ago and they said I was borderline for sleep apnea - I should probably get tested again for it! I honestly need to get in for a monitored sleep study, probably. My insomnia is out of control lately. At least two nights a week I just do not sleep at all. Ambien does not work for me unless I take twice the prescribed dose and a benzo (I did this under medical supervision). All my doctors in Florida were pretty useless, though. I loved to Colorado about a year and a half ago, and my medical care has VASTLY improved here. So maybe they can figure out why my brain says no to sleeping. I do not know about medication but I have found that eating an apple a day really helps with my joint pain. I can always feel it in my knees the next day if I forgot to have one the day before. Might be worth a try for you", "Even on 3 anti histamines and benedryl I am coughing up phlegm, my nose is running, and my bladder is flared It is probably hormonally triggered right now.. but does this mean I need a higher dose of meds?  We were going to add stabilizers in a few months after seeing if I could get balanced on levoceterizine and cetirizine twice a day with famotidine, but I feel like it is not doing enough now. Should I wait for the stabilizers? Do you use nasal sprays? That is the thing that helps congestion and phlegm for me. Cannot speak to the bladder issues. No. Ultimately the phlegm and such is just an annoyance and my canary in the mine, but the bladder pain is absolutely disabling and what I need to get under control, so I am looking for systematic suggestions. \n\nAlso I just hate nose spray When did you start taking your medications? Can you get on Hydroxyzine in lieu of the Benadryl. Benadryl long term will cause a mast cell rebound effect thus making things worse.\n\nMy H1 / H2 protocol:\n\n5mg Levocetirizine - Morning\n\n5mg Levocetirizine - Night\n\n10mg Cetirizine or 10mg Loratadine - Morning\n\n10mg Cetirizine or 10mg Loratadine - Night\n\n20mg Famotidine - Morning\n\n20mg Famotidine - Night\n\n300-400mg Cimitidine - Night* as needed\n\nHydroxyzine OR Cyproheptadine, OR any other OTC H1 - Night* as needed\n\n_-------_------------_--------------------\n\nSupplements: \n\nQuercetin - 800mg x 3 daily\n\nVitamin D2 - 50,000iu weekly\n\nVitamin C - 1000mg daily\n\n_-----------_-------------_------------------\n\nCox Inhibitors:\n\nAspirin - 81mg x 2* as needed \n\n(I cannot take aspirin too much due to being on anticoagulants, but I take low dose aspirin on Interstitial Cystitis days)\n\n_------------_----------_------------_-------\n\nAnti-Leukotrines:\n\n600mg x 2 - Zileuton - Morning\n\n600mg x 2 - Zileuton - Night\n\n_-------_----------_-----------_--------_\n\nOmalizumab - 150mg x 2 - Monthly\n\n_------------_--------------_--------------\n\nI recognize some of these meds are prescription. If you cannot obtain an RX for the ones listed, there are definitely a lot of OTC regimens you could use. Use caution on aspirin though due to being sensitive to Mast Cell Disorder patients. 2 months ago I have been on hydroxyzine before but it did nothing for me. Plus it being prescription it is hard to adjust the dosage. My doctors have been very reluctant to prescribe me much. I do not take the benedryl everyday, only as needed. \n\nI take 1500mg of quercetin a day that I forgot to mention. I cannot take aspirin because it flares me.\n\nSingulair and alegra flared the hell out of me so badly I could not leave bed, it was very painful. I am kind of scared to try Xolair.\n\nWhat do you feel helped your bladder pain the most? Hydroxyzine and aspirin helps the IC the most for me.  Hydroxyzine is technically prescribed for it as well. \n\nIf I have IC during the day. I do aspirin and add a small dose of Amphetamine (which I take for ADHD + sluggishness / brain fog). \n\nStimulants are technically also approved off label for IC. \n\nIf you are sensitive to medications maybe going the compounding route would help if you have not already. Technically my aspirin is filler / dye free because my doctor and I were concerned about reactions with it. I do not take a lot either. If I do, it is only for IC and I am still wholly cautious with it. ...also because of me being on anticoagulants. \n\nZileuton is the alternative to Montelukast. If you are in the US, for MCD patients, Zileuton is pretty much a superior drug to Montelukast since it is blocks the synthesis of leukotrienes altogether without the additional side effects that Montelukast shares.\n\nLow dose naltrexone would be another alternative and my doctor has floated that idea if I wanted to try it out. \n\n-------------\n\nTo be honest, and please do not take offense,  it really sounds like their is an issue with your doctor?  My perception of the numerous doctors I have seen that are more holistic practicing are hesitant to prescribe medications to their patients. Or they are not wholly empathetic to you the patient or willing to give the time themselves to do their own research. That does not mean that you the patient should just leave things up to just the doctor either. You have to be willing yourself to be your own advocate if your doctor is not willing to go the extra mile for you the patient. \n\nMast cell disease whether it is mastocytosis, MCAS, HAT... Can be pretty debilitating to live in a capitalist functioning society.  I am a guy with mastocytosis and IC \"alone\" can be pretty debilitating to me and whole heartily impedes my ability to function at work ...which I need to do to be able to afford medications to function altogether since I am so young. \n\nI would probably try seeking out another doctor willing to assist you more who follow the hippocratic oath of medicine to a T. In addition, I understand that if you tend to be a difficult patient ...which really, anyone with an orphan disease like MCD is considered \"a difficult patient\" doctors are not going to take the time to research and empathize with you to try out what works and what does not work. If you are located in the US, just remember that there are doctors who do take the time and try out different things and to research their patients issues and concerns. I have seen way too many doctors in my 33 years of existence to see this happen and I know that the US healthcare system does not really allow us difficult patients for adequate care. I have to drive 4 hours one way just to see the only doctor in my state who believes MCAS is real. Ditto for my IC specialist. Louisiana does not have healthcare, just delayed dying.\n\nI have struggled for 10 years, bitched out my insurance company, contacted my governor, just trying to get help for my pelvic pain. There is no options here and because I am more or less disabled but not enough for disability, I am stuck on Medicaid. \n\nMy PCP said she would not support a disability case for me because I am \"too young\". She is the only PCP I have had who partially listens to me. \n\nI might give Zileuton a try. Thanks for the suggestion. I had been on hydroxyzine for years with no improvement, but it is also possible I was under dosed. I have ADD too, but if I so much as side eye a stimulant my bladder explodes. For IC pain I previously added amitryptiline to my antihistamine regimen (only somewhat helpful), and currently use pyridium and a benedryl for flares. I also drink a ridiculous amount of water and use a heating pad. The pain from IC alone is disabling.\nI am 27 and after a few years of appeals I got approved for disability and now my health is okay enough I could go back to college. Mast Cell is a bitch, you deserve a doctor who will advocate for you. Took me many tries to find one, so stay away from the New Age alt-health types while you are searching. I wish you luck with this confusing disease Thank you. The only medical professional who supports me trying for disability is my physical therapist..", "Missed Cromolyn dose For those of you on Cromolyn, and who have missed a dose, what side effects have you had from missing a dose? I missed my first dose yesterday morning. Had no side effects yesterday but today I am horrible. I thought Cromolyn had a short half life, anyone know if this is a normal response or if I am just flaring for some other reason? One dose might mean I get more diarrhea from whatever I eat. I take it morning, 30 min before eating lunch and dinner and then befofe bed. \n\nYea its short acting. Its likely a flare from something else. About to take my first dose in the next 30 mins, a bit nervous to be honest.... Hopefully you are increasing slowly. I flared bad when I first started, then my Dr had me go slowly and it was more manageable. It does help so much with the symptoms, it is just a rough medicine for some to start. 1 ampule before every meal and then before bed. About 5 mins after taking noticed a bit of an throat numbing sensation. Will be monitoring closely. Goodluck! You can always go down if you need. Some ppl are fine, others are more sensitive. I upped one ampule every 4 days until I got to the 8/day. This is pretty normal for me, at least. It is not so much about the Half-Life as it is about your mast cells not receiving the expected dose of Cromolyn. I get reactions when I change my dose both up and down. And usually a day later like you are experiencing. Thank you. That is what I am thinking, I messed up my bucket. Do you eat four times a day? Twice a day usually. How do you take cromolyn? Every 4h? Yep, 2 ampules 4x day. I have troubles remembering. Can you advice me how to achieve such discipline? I set alarms. I take meds 7 times a day, no way I will remember without alarms. Haha, true. Something specific or generic alarms?\nI use Repeating Timers, works good to remind me The Cromolyn ones are generic. The other 3 I label, sun, mid and moon meds. I get horrible flares if I miss any doses this is the only way I have found to help stay on top of them all.", "Does h1 and h2 combo deal with IC? If I take h1 and h2 antihistamines will it get rid of IC symtpoms (Interstitial Cystitis)? Anything else useful? I am currently going through slight ic symptoms this past year. I had a UTI last December that was treated with Bactrim and I had an severe allergic reaction to it which included hives for a month straight! I have never been normal ever since. It really only happens when I eat or drink something that I am sensitive to (still working on figure out what those things are). I take Claritin in the AM along with Quercetin, Pepcid, and occasionally Benadryl at night. Which are all OTC and usually the first line of treatment for MCAS. For me, It helps my symptoms a lot most days. Every now and again I will eat/drink something and it makes me think I have a UTI and usually the Benadryl helps but leaves me with residual symptoms for about a week or so. I found that using a squatter potty to pee and poo (TMI sorry) and pelvic floor stretches helps. I think when I get a bad mast cell flare up my pelvic muscles lock up which gives me the IC like symptoms. I am actually going to a urologist and Allergen that specializes in MCAS and EDS. I am hoping to start a mast cell stabilizer to help keep the IC symptoms at bay. The IC diet never helped me. I continue to drink coffee and all that fun stuff with no issue. I just avoid gluten, soy and dairy and I have been a lot better. Hope this helps. xx\n\nTo clarify, I never had frequency or bladder pain. It was pelvic pain and urethral burning-ish that was constant and during urination. \n\nEdit: more info I do not know how helpful this is because I only ever had IC on and off occasionally and it was not one of my main issues. But personally I never had much luck with antihistamines doing anything but helping with hives, watery eyes and post nasal drip. In large amounts sometimes antihistamines would take the edge off my other inflammatory conditions, but I hated the drowsiness and it did not seem worth the trade off for me.\n\nPersonally I think any anti inflammatory mast cell stabilizers might help you, but it is hard to recommend one because somehow they all affect different people differently. And it is hard to predict the area they might help without trying it. If you want to try one that is readily available though, I would try ergomax palmitoylethanolamide. It might not help, but it is safe if it does not. I have symptoms like IC but it ended up being diagnosed as over active bladder. I get the urgency feelings, pain with onset or urination and general discomfort borderline pain in my bladder. It would make sex quite uncomfortable too. Since starting h1 &amp; h2 blockers this has improved significantly for me! I also take cymbalta for chronic pain that I started a few months before the others so I am not sure how much influence the cymbalta has with the IC type symptoms. Personally I suspect it is mostly the cetirizine and ranitidine making the biggest impact because it improved within 2 weeks of starting them. The ranitidine in particular and increasing the cetirizine doses. IC sufferer here and yes! I started claritin (2 at night) and it helped it so much. I still got issues, but much less. I pair it with myrbetriq for frequency issues. Also, I found that my triggers are not the IC diet list foods. I had to find the food that made my MCAS flair up and cut those out. That helped a lot too. It did more good then any other IC treatments. I take Quercetin. Will this IC symptoms last forever or will it subside eventually? Hey, do you think IC will last forever or will it subside naturally like every mcas flare. I had many flares like hives and cramps and it went away even without treatment. Mine come and go. I will go a good amount of time without IC symptoms as long as I watch what I eat (avoiding triggers if you know what triggers you). But i will get flare ups that last for a couple days or couple weeks. It really depends on what triggers your IC whether its hormones, foods/drinks, ect. About it lasting forever, i really do not know. I doubt it will go away without treatment. Im hoping once i get the MCAS in check i will not get as many flair ups as i do. I mean, I heard that IC is drived by MCAS, so I thought that it would go away as the flair comes down. Not saying it will go forever, I am just hoping that there are periods where symptoms are not present. Unfortunately I do not know any food triggers. One night, after eating everything as usual I realizied I had to go to bathroom every 15 mins, then my urethra started burning. It has been 2 weeks. This is the worst of all symtpoms I ever got. I am not diagnosed with MCAS, but benedryl and getting off birth control helped my IC the most.\n\nI suspect MCAS, but not a single specialist in my state accepts my insurance.", "Initial cromolyn sodium oral dosing \u201cFor those of you who have taken cromolyn, what was your starting dose and how did you increase it?\n\nAny advice for starting it? What can I expect?\u201d\n\n- my wife who cannot look at screens due to photophobia  First trial was 10 ML 4 times a dat. I had to stop a week later for worsening symptoms. I then did it with 2.5 ML 4 times a day and added 2.5 ML every 3 months. Probably did not need to be that slow but that is what my doctor was comfortable at. 1 vial (5ml) 4 times a day. I started with half of 1 vial a day and slowly worked up from there. Im sensitive to meds and had just come off a bad flare caused by a new med so I was scared. Starting out 1 vile a day (5ml), if tolerated. Some people start out at .25 for one vile. Up dosage once a week, call doctor if unable to tolerate. My first dose was 200mg (2 vials/10ML) three times a day. That got bumped to 300mg (3 vials/15ML) three times a day and now I am at 300mg 4x a day. Honestly the biggest things for me where getting used to taking it so frequently and the taste. Both of which I definitely got over. I know people that literally needed to start with one drop as the first dose. Take it easy. I did a half vial in 8-10 oz that I nursed for hours for my first dose. My doctor's recommendation, and they are a mast cell specialist, was to start with a single 5mL vial in about 6o-8oz of water once a day for a week. Week 2, you do a second 5mL vial (so do the first one in the morning for a week, then in week 2, do one in the morning and a second one 30 minutes before lunch or 12ish) for a week. So by week 4, you are doing 4 5mL vials spread over the day. The in week 5, you add a second vial to your 1st dosage of the day, so you are taking 10mL, but just take 5mL for the rest of the day. So by week 8, you are on a fill dosage of 10mL 4 times per day. \n\nYou should take it 30 minutes before eating and wait 2 hours after eating for your next dosage. That can be a pain but I have made myself little windows in my day where I stop eating after a certain time. It is gotten easier over time. \n\nI will also add I had a minor reaction the first time but never since. Symptoms started improving after about 2-3 months, and 2 years later I am still noticing improvements. So it is a medication that pays off in the long term for those that respond well to it. \u201cThank you\u201d \u201cReally good to know. I will discuss with my provider.\u201d \u201cI am super sensitive to medications also. So I will go slow. Thank you. \u201cThank you.\u201d \u201cThank you.\u201d \u201cThat is really good to know. Thank you.\u201d  \u201cThank you for the detailed response. I am glad you found a specialist!\u201d You should follow your doctor's instructions, but I personally started with 1x100mg a day working up to 4x100mg, then switched from 400 to 800mg per day immediately when dose was changed (and now take two vials, 4x a day.) \n\nNo side effects whatsoever that I have noticed, except that *maybe* I have more insomnia if I take my last dose too late. Not really certain if that is the cause though. \n\nAlso, for the issues using a computer, have you guys looked at high-strength sunglasses (like the ones NoIR medical sells) or using a screen reader (like NVDA/NVaccess) which requires no looking at the screen whatsoever? on iOS there is Voiceover and on Android Talkback as well.", "How long does alcohol flare you for?  It is not worth it, avoid it if you can. If you have POTS and MCAS you can get in cycles that are that can be difficult to break. Get some fizzy water and whatever juice or citrus or flavoring you tolerate and make yourself some mocktails and stay hydrated. All of the histamine blockers are very dehydrating. Any way you can avoid flares, do that. Minimum 24 hours. I have not had a drink in 14 months now. So worth giving up. I have not had a beer in a year and last time it was 2 sips. I got a migraine almost immediately. Before then it was probably 18 months at least. I would maybe try gin again since that is the least likely to bother me but it is just not worth it anymore. I would rather not feel sick in any capacity. I had to give up alcohol years ago. It got to the point where just one sip triggered a flare up. Could not even catch a slight buzz... Well I have both and am miserable right now that is why I ask :( is the flare permanent then? Well it depends on how well you bounce back and some factors you cannot predict. Some people recover. I have not recovered but I have gastroparesis as well as EDS so those complicate things. Stay in the mindset you will recover, it helps. It is like having a bucket and with every trigger it fills your bucket. If you overload that bucket it is going to spill over and it is harder to manage an overflowing bucket when you are trying to mop the floor. You got to keep that bucket manageable so it is not a crisis. Wine is great! I miss it! I also miss coffee A LOT! But I do not do either one anymore. I do 2 bags of IV saline a day and if you can avoid that, I highly recommend trying to do so. I hope this helps. I know it is difficult. Depends on the kind of alcohol.  Half a day for every shot of something like whiskey. One week for every hour in a place where something like Purell or Lysol is used. Usually around 24 hours. I have less trouble with spirits than wine or beer.", "How rare/uncommon is this disease? I am not diagnosed and I have been to my allergist and he is stated multiple times that I do not have it. He knows what the disease is and is familiar with how you test for it, but he is stated that he actually thinks it is quite rare and it is becoming like lyme disease in that it is popular on the internet to diagnose yourself. The AAAI website itself states that it is rare and is well defined. There is also multiple experts research talking about how rare it is and that it is well defined. These doctors being Dr. Akin, Dr. Valent, Dr. Metcalfe, etc. All are leading experts in the field. So why is there websites talking about how common they believe it to be and describing it as an unseen epidemic? It seems like the experts disagree with that notion. It is not common and if it was how would we know? There are varying classifications of mast cell disease. For example, they consider allergies to be more in line with mast cell disorders than previously though. Mast Cell Activation Disorders and Mastocytosis remain difficult to diagnose and more rare than other diseases that are potentially mediated by mast cell activity. When you get a broader definition you encompass more patients. You have to be extremely specific with laypeople because it is easy to over-general a mast cell disorder to mastocytosis (very rare) and mast cell activation (less rare but still uncommon). Additionally, there is more awareness of the disorders so more diagnoses may be occurring. I am willing to bet that it is like severe vs mild allergies. Some people just have mild allergies or MCAS and it might not even show up on tests. And so probably is not worth a diagnosis. \n\nThe people with severe symptoms get a diagnosis, easy. Wellll maybe after years of trying but they can possibly be diagnosed. \n\nAnd then you have got the moderately sick people who cannot prove it but benefit from some of the treatments. Are they treating this illness? Maybe. I am definitely not a doctor but I say if the cheaper treatments help why not? Some of these people get clinically diagnosed or get worse and test positive. \n\nPeople who are moderately sick, who the basic treatments of mast cell stabilizers and h1/h2 treatment does not work... they are unlikely to get diagnosed even if they do have it. Some of these people are reacting to fillers in the meds so that is why treatment does not work. I am concerned about that group but I have no idea how big or small it is. The discussion of how rare a disease is often ends of being a largely academic one. That is because the patients with the rarest of rare diseases, the unicorns, do not appear during every relevant doctor\u2019s practice at the same rate. That would be impossible. \n\nIn most cases, this is a very subjective judgment. The studies do not have a large enough sample sizes to calculate statistically significant probabilities. As you read batches of studies about mast cell issues, you do see a variety of viewpoints on rarity, diagnosis, and more. Over time they will tend to converge, but we are still in early days.\n\nAnd, as with all \u201cnewer\u201d diseases, the diagnostic standards are continuing to evolve, including characteristics of presentation.\n\nUltimately every doctor who sees patients in an adjacent field needs to come to terms with how they will diagnose and treat mast cell disorders and diseases. \n\nAs a person who has had three relatively rare diseases, I struggle with doctors who rule things out because they are very rare. If the clinical presentation fits and there is no better explanation (or those have been ruled out), then why not test for the rare thing? I am on the modest end of the scale, developed allergies and after I complained that my fatigue and brain fog were still so extreme even with Antihistamines reducing the rhinitis they threw Montelukast at me and it worked and after 3 months I had zero symptoms. I never had a follow up appointment, I was just so pleased to be free of it and now I have been discharged from the immunologist. After 2.5 years it is come back so and I only learned about MCAS after I learned about POTS so now I am starting to navigate getting my allergies investigated again or at least get someone to give me treatment similar to what I previously had as it worked but I am treading the fine line of advocating for my health and turning up with to the GP with yet another idea/issue, especially when you are turning up with triggers like sneezing fits caused by hot showers and POTS symptoms of a HR of 150bom brushing my teeth. Rarity is not a reason to avoid going through the diagnostic process. If your doctor will not help you figure out what is going on, find a new one. \n\nI had a \"rare\" childhood cancer. I have other rare conditions now. That is not a reason to avoid diagnosis.\n\nAdditionally, as others have pointed out - mastocytosis is quite rare while MCAS/MCA is less rare. My allergist also thought it was highly unlikely that I also had MCAS. But my doctor also wanted to exclude it just in case. I think it also helped that my doctor witnessed a reaction at that same appointment to albuterol (I flushed really bad after given a dose) so he got to witness my flushing in action. Anyways...guess who got a diagnosis of MCAS. I was sent to a mast cell specialist for a second opinion. It is been about 5 years since my initial MCAS diagnosis and it still feels tentative because I have never been tested for mastocytosis and now I am starting to develop little freckles and my tryptase is starting to go up so who knows. \n\nAnyways, the issue as I understand it is that there are different types of mast cell diseases. Most recently, Hereditary Alpha Tryptasemia became a thing but it is not clear if it should be considered a mast cell disease or not. Different doctors/researchers have different opinions. Mastocytosis is definitely ba rare condition but MCAS is not currently considered more of a syndrome and there are different diagnostic criteria depending in who your doctor follows.\n\nInterestingly, I have seen dermatologists, including my own dismiss MCAS as no big thing. I have also come across scientific articles where a patient was diagnosed with cutaneous mastocytosis and sent home cause it is just a skin issue. Except my mast cell specialist informed me that most adult inset cases of cutaneous mastocytosis will develop into systemic mastocytosis. But they are being diagnosed in some cases by dermatologists who do not realize that. So yeah, research and concesus is all over the place. And it does feel like it is still early days on that front with mast cell diseases. MCAD is underresearched and underdiagnosed. If someone says to you  \"it is rare\", it is time to see another doctor, they are not interested in helping you. If you really want to be tested you can ask the doctor to make a note in your chart that you have requested testing and it was denied, they will usually run the test then, however testing is unreliable for MCAD. \n\nI had an ER doctor tell me that someone reacting to many things is \"rare\", and that I would not die from anaphylaxis.  Less than 3 months later I went into anaphylactic shock. I guess I am \"rare\" though. I asked for his name, so I would have it if I needed to file malpractice.", "Neurological problems after taking any medication and eating and drinking anything Hi. I have not been diagnosed with mast cell disease, but I have severe medication sensitivity. At first it was just antibiotics, but fastforward to today and I have severe neurological side effects from over the counter eye drops, my eczema lotion, ibuprofen. After I take these things I taste the medicine in my mouth and experience visual and hearing disturbance, disorientation, muscle tension and weakness, metallic taste in mouth.\n\nTo complicate the matter, I suffer from neurological symptoms after I eat or drink anything, including water. Has anyone ever experienced this? The symptoms slowly subside with time, but they come back after I ingest anything. Medications cause the worst problems. I have been slowly worsening for the past year. I blame the keto diet I was on for 2 years, but I could be wrong. \n\nMy neurologist has ordered an MRI on my brain and spinal cord but he thinks my problems are immune based. He suggests I get my allergies tested. All bloodwork always comes back normal. I am 34/F with eczema and endometriosis. These were my dominant issues prior to taking Vital Proteins Collagen September 2019. I have been struggling with neurological problems since. Any insight is much appreciated I often get neurological symptoms, they tend to come up with bad flares, not necessarily to a certain trigger. Mine are usually numbness, tingling, decreased sensation, stuffy ears, seeing spots or lines of light, sometimes odd tastes, and weakness. \nI have also had reactions to water, drinking it or just skin issues. My MCAS specialist said that some ppl are just very sensitive to what is put in water, such as chlorine &amp; fluoride. \nAllergy tests may or may not reveal anything.I was tested for all food allergies, tests came back negative, but I am so severely reactive to food. \nI do hope you are able to figure out your cause, mast cell disease or not, the unknown makes it very hard to feel any semblance of control. MCAS is immune based. The common test is tryptase.\n\nIt is called sometimes pseudo-allergy. You have allergy, but unlike true allergy MCAS reactions are dose-dependent. More cheese you eat the shittier you will be With MCAS all your bloodwork will come back text book normal, it is so frustrating. There is a specialized test for it now. You need to see an allergist/immunologist to get evaluated and tested. \n\nI take the same collagen powder and I do low carb as well. Never got to the point of ketosis. I definitely feel better on low carb, I am sensitive to wheat. \n\nStress can be a trigger.\n\nMy allergist used to joke that he had to treat me with 18th century medicine since I was allergic to everything else. Thank you for the comments. This is the closest I have come to making sense to anyone at all. People just think I have anxiety problems. What does the collagen powder do for you? Protein supplement. Supposed to be good for other hair, skin, nails, gut repair. Check on the tingling and odd tastes.\n\nFor me, the former is more hot hands/feet, followed by burning, followed by stabbing pain if it is a bad one.\n\nIt is funny that you mention water--I figured that one out after a looooong time.  I had my diet pretty clean through the summer, then went back to campus.  My stomach got bad.\n\nI was so mad--I said to my partner \"the only fucking thing that I have eaten that is different is the fucking water at the school!\"\n\nThen it clicked: I am reacting to water. lol\n\nI am allergic to nickel on the skin. 20% of people who react on the skin also react if they consume it (I am guessing it is way higher than that, but that was the number I saw). \n\nSo yeah.  The wrong water can do you in.\n\n(Also, if you have a skin nickel allergy, consider that it may be systemic as well...look into a low-nickel diet.  And if you do react systemically, look into calcium disodium EDTA.  It helped me a whole bunch!  My raised, itchy skin thingies all went away!) Interesting. How do you rest of you are reactive to nickle? I do not have one day go by where I do not get hives, I would love to get that under control. I had hives on my hands a lot...\n\nI am a dumbass, so it took me a while to realize that they were all where my hands touch my electric guitar strings...which are nickel-plated.\n\nBut I only realized that nickel was causing me issues elsewhere on my body when I realized I was reacting to the water.  (I am guessing it was nickel in the waterfountain/cooler at school).  From there, other things made sense...like getting sick whenever I cooked acidy foods in stainless steel pots (I use glass cookware now).\n\nSo, long story short, there are a lot of things that have nickel in them.  I would find one that you can access easily and just rub it on your skin and not wash it off for an hour or two.  If you break out in that spot in the next day or so, put nickel on your shitlist.  If not, try leaving it on for longer--in some tests, they will put a patch containing the possible allergen on your skin for a day or so and see if you react.  You can ask your MCAS/allergist doctor if that is a service they provide, but otherwise you can go low-tech and do it yourself. That it is so interesting. My hives are always on my hands, always! Alright. Looks like I will be strapping a coin to my arm tonight! Thank you for the info. Haha, no problem.  As I am sure you know, there are lots of things that can cause contact dermatitis.\n\nI have also had to go to pure glycerin soap (the regular stuff tears my hands up fast)!  So like Pears or whatever.  \n\nI would also think about everything your hands come in contact with regularly--we use an all-natural dish soap, I only use pure vaseline as a moisturizer, et cetera.  When I made the above changes, I went from having to put moisturizer on my hands multiple times a day to only having to do it once in a while in the winter after they would been exposed to the bitter cold of the rust belt.  \n\nDefinitely worth the effort for me! :) I taste medicine/vitamins in my mouth too. I assumed it was due to silent reflux. I have to drink bottled spring water Have any off you had neurological issues from contrast dye dye to mast cell?", "I do not know for sure that I have this disease or it is something else and it is tearing me up inside. List of symptoms:\n\nGI - My stool almost never comes out normal. Almost comes out like it in curls or something like that, so I have been diagnosed with IBS in the past. I am here usually constipated, or on the flip side, I have diarrhea. Once in a blue moon I will have what I consider a normal bowel movement.\n\nSores - I have sores on the top of my scalp. They will not go away. They just keep growing back or staying there, and I do not know what the hell they are. I went to a dermatologist and they told me something I cannot remember what it was, I guess some common disease of the scalp, but I cannot help thinking that all these things are connected.\n\nBrain Fog - as I write this, I have brain fog. I am sitting here with brain fog, and this is the one that bothers me the most. I do not even care about some of the other stuff as much, I feel like I can handle it, but the brain fog absolutely drives me up a f****** wall. It is the most horrific prison-like experience I have ever encountered or could even think of. I actually think it would probably be worse than being in prison because I am trapped in my own body and my own head and I can never actually do the things I want to do. Life is passing me by... I am in bed all the goddamn time with brain fog or trying to get rid of brain fog.\n\nI do not know what is causing it. Is it the alcohol use that I have done in my life, is it something else? What the hell is causing the brain fog? The other day I woke up after a particularly restful sleep, it seemed like. For the first two minutes or so, the brain fog was not there, not even a little hint of brain fog I usually have when I wake up that grows worse in about 45 minutes to an hour.\n\nI thought maybe somehow I had had a miracle breakthrough or something. But sure enough, after about one minute or two minutes of being awake I started to notice the brain fog creeping in. What the f***?\n\nThat is how my brain fog seems to work. It seems to be not that bad when I first open my eyes, but then as the hour progresses into like 45 minutes to an hour, all of a sudden I have full on brain fog. Then I have to just push through for a couple hours maybe until I eat something, and then try and meditate so I can try and clear it out.\n\nAnxiety/OCD/Depression - I am depressed, probably because my life f****** sucks but I keep optimistic as much as possible and I do not fall very long into bouts of depression. However the anxiety, the mania, and especially this is really horrible OCD hyper focus. I mean my brain hyper focuses on stuff to the extreme and that will ruin my sleep. So hyper focus on wanting to make sure I get enough rest so I can try and eliminate the brain fog. Hyper focus on trying to meditate to eliminate the brain fog. Hyper-focus on the brain fog. When I am trying to fall asleep, hyper-focus on all sorts of things from anything from an itching in my nose, to a sensation in my mouth, like the last couple of nights where I felt like I had a crumb or something stuck under my tongue and I literally could not sleep for an hour or two hours trying to figure out how to get rid of that feeling and as I am talking about it now I am half worried that it is going to creep up again tonight when I am trying to sleep again.\n\nI have calluses on my heel that keep growing back, and I have to shave them off on a regular basis and if I do not, or even when I do actually, I will tend to get an itching sensation on my heel almost every single night and if I try to ignore it, it usually grows into restless leg. I cannot fall asleep even if it does not do that, I will sit there and just hyper-focus on my heel. The only way to stop the itching sensation is for me to rub my foot, on the carpet until it actually Burns.\n\nIf I get something like a sensation of a hair in my nose that is causing my nose to tickle, I have to literally find tweezers and try and get rid of the sensation. I have to have a back scratcher because there is no way that if my back starts itching which is almost constantly while I am trying to fall asleep, that I can do that. I have to get rid of the itch.\n\nIf I hear a sound, that does not seem familiar, or if I get a weird smell, even if I am laying in bed, and 95% of the time I do not smell anything weird, but every once in awhile I just get a faint with on an inhale of something that does not smell normal, I cannot f****** fall asleep my brain hyper focuses on it.\n\nRestless Leg - As I said I have restless leg. Self-explanatory. It does not usually happen during the day but for some reason like some weird biological clock that wants to make my life f****** miserable, it looks to creep up just as I am starting to get relaxed and want to fall asleep.\n\nWhen I have been to my allergist, immunologist, when we scratch my arm, I get the red marks that show up a few seconds later. I guess she told me that is not normal.\n\nSleep - if I do not get absolutely a perfect night sleep, I am a disaster within an hour. like if I fall asleep too late, the next day I wake up and my fatigue and brain fog and just my head feeling like absolutely terrible s***, is ever-present and horrible.\n\nI still have a stuffy nose even if I am taking h1 and H2 blockers.\n\nI do not know for sure. I really just do not know for sure what is going on. We been a lot of tests that my doctor, I do not imagine we have done every single test in the face of the Earth, but her suggestion is it very well could be Mast Cell Activation Syndrome and when I looked up the symptom list, pretty much all of these things fall into it.\n\nSo now I am on the cromolyn I am taking an h1 and H2 blocker every single day, but I do not f****** know. I just do not know if that is really what it is. What if it is just all the f****** partying that I have done over the years going out to bars and getting s***-faced and now I have brain damage or something? I ran that by my doctor and she said, probably not. You would be having trouble speaking and things like that. But I do notice that when I am drinking which is a way that I alleviate these symptoms on some days, that my brain fog seems to be slowly getting worse. I do not know if that is my imagination, actually I am pretty sure it is not. I used to be able to snap out of the brain fog a lot quicker through meditation, but now it seems to be very sticky and I am worried that maybe this is not Mast Cell Activation Syndrome at all but, but that I have gone out and drink a lot in my life. I do not drink everyday, but I definitely will drink a lot especially when I feel like s***. having a buzz, is way preferable to the absolute horrible feeling that I get sometimes from this illness whatever the hell it is.\n\nBut then that makes no sense. I know people who go out and party and put me to shame and they are fine. \n\nI do not know what is going on. I just really need to have an answer to this so I can know that what I am doing is going to work. That is the biggest thing is that fear in the back of my mind. I do not even know if I really have this disease. that fear that I am spinning my wheels treating something that is not going to be treated and I am just going to get worse and worse and worse and worse...\n\nHelp. You are obviously having immune issues have tried any supplements just to see how that works. Also how effective are the \"mast cell\" meds do they help with your symptoms. People that get diagnosed with idiopathic MCAS are people that respond very well on H1's H2's etc... But nothing shows up in there blood test like elevated tryptase or PGD2. \n\nThe scratch marks are not normal and those are signs of urticaria.\n\nAre you leukotriene inhibitors? such as singulair those were a HUGE help for me. I take singualir twice a day and that almost put a stop to my diarrhea I might get D once in a while but it is rare.\n\nI would go back and ask for your tryptase levels to be checked also plasma prostaglandin d2.\n\nAlso ask for a complement c3c and c4c it is complement panel that will check for inflammation in the body. And to see if you have lupus or angioedema.\n\nI am going to make a post about supplements i have tried that have helped and did not. Thank you. Once you post it please link me in appreciate it. No problem. *link me in... Will Do! Alcohol makes MCAS worse, so that could be what you are experiencing when you drink. I have had to cut alcohol out entirely since it takes me 3 days to recover after one glass of wine. \n\nI am going to be honest, the symptoms you listed here could fit a wide variety of diseases, including MCAS. Do you have specific triggers? Allergy like symptoms besides stuffy nose? In my opinion though, no harm trying a mast cell stabilizer and seeing if it helps the brain fog. \n\nEither way, it is so awful not knowing what is happening in your body and just treating symptoms. I lived that way for a long time so I am glad you are looking for answers. \n\nDisclaimer, none of us are doctors (I assume). I personally cannot tolerate alcohol from mcas but there are very odd presentations with this disease so you very well could have it. For me, I would need a response to medication to prove it was right. I would start experimenting with antihistamines while you do not feel well to see if it improves your symptoms. No, I get none of you guys are doctors. And I know my symptoms could fit into other diseases which makes it so damn frustrating.\n\nI will have to ask my doctor about that, why she thinks it could very well be Mast Cell vs. Just some other disease that has similar symptoms. Very little of what you describe sounds like MCAS to me and you have not found relief in traditional treatments.\n\n70% or more will have flushing episodes. The brain fog is not diagnostic. You have to have 2 or more body systems involved + brain fog for it to be considered. Was your tryptase elevated? Any mast cells on colonoscopy (assuming you have had one). \n\nHope you find answers.", "IgE allergies, and MCD contradictions This year I developed about 30 IgE-mediated food allergies. Multiple times a day, my skin flushes and often itches. Every few weeks for a few days I have joint pain, fatigue, bloating, etc, though these spells have usually coincided with the development of a new food allergy, and thus those symptoms can be explained by that; the skin flushing has a mind of its own, though. And of course with the daily skin flushing it can be very hard to tell if I am developing a new allergy, accidentally ate something I should not have, or if there is something else entirely going on.\n\nMy doctors think that, despite my negative tryptase/24 hour urine test/etc tests, some sort of mast cell disease is at play here. Though, \"think\" is maybe a strong word -- in reality they are baffled by the absurd number of food allergies I have developed and are grasping at straws. At this point it feels like they are trying to prove a mast cell disease just so that they can have a diagnosis, rather than are going after it due to any really strong evidence. The only symptom that might truly point to a MCD is the skin flushing; as I said, the other stuff seems to be explained by allergies. The skin flushing might be as well, I do not know. I have so many allergies that at this point I would not be surprised if there is something regularly setting me off that I am just not aware of yet.\n\nAny GI symptoms are the least severe and rarest of all my symptoms, and I have never had anaphylaxis -- though I think I have been pretty close a couple of times (with clear and obvious IgE allergies as the cause -- for example, one time I accidentally ate almonds, which I am very allergic to).\n\nPut it all together and I am not really seeing the mast cell diagnosis as all that accurate. I know the tests are unreliable but in the absence of anything else conclusive, the fact that the results were totally normal aids in my suspicion that I in fact do not have a MCD. However, my doctors still pursue it, probably because it is the only lede they have (besides just throwing up their hands and saying \"you are one unlucky motherfucker\").\n\nSo, in the interest of coming to *some* sort of conclusive answer, here is a question I do not see posed all that often:\n\nWhat would *rule out* a mast cell disease? What sign or test or symptom would make it so that you *know* that you *do not* have one? \n\nOr is that not a thing, and I am doomed to live in this purgatory, slowly developing more and more (IgE-mediated, always) allergies with absolutely no answers? I am in a very similar situation. I have not been officially diagnosed with a mcas, but I have a ton of ige mediated food allergies. My understanding is the treatment is pretty much the same. Got the flushing really badly. Really bad. Permanently.\nAnyone know if anomalties in brain or head can cause Mcas symptoms ?\nI had a full MRI of body but not head yet. The reason doctors do not like the idea you developed so many IgE mediated food allergies is because it does not fit their understanding of how the immune system works.  I really cannot say if that is what is happening or not.\n\nThe following is from the mast cell disease society website:\n\n*Mast cell disease(s) (MCD) is the term used by mast cell specialists in the U.S. and internationally for all mast cell diseases. This covers each variant: systemic mastocytosis (SM), cutaneous mastocytosis (CM), smoldering mastocytosis (SSM), advanced disease variants, mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) and hereditary alpha tryptasemia (HaT). Since MCD covers all variants of mast cell disease, it is inclusive of every patient suffering from any type of mast cell disease.* \n\nIf mast cells are not behaving right, then as you can see, there is a long list of conditions to rule out.  No one on the internet can give you a simple sign or test to rule out everything mast cell related.  Primary doctors direct patients to specialists.   It sounds like your doctor wants you to see a mast cell specialist.  If so, that may just have to be your next step.  There are bad doctors out there.  It does not hurt to get a second opinion.  If there is a consensus from multiple credible doctors, then you need to follow the doctor's advice.\n\nHonestly, \"go see a mast cell specialist\" is better than I ever got with doctors back in the 90's.  I was having reactions to what appeared to be a long list of foods.  Multiple doctors rolled their eyes at me and told me I was a hypochondriac.  I have come to believe I never had an allergy to any food. Rather, something not normally in food dissolves into food and causes my symptoms.  However, that is just a conclusion I came to about myself after years of trying to figure out what was wrong with me.  It is something for people to consider for themselves when all other options fail. u need **much better immunologists.**\n\nif they know for certain that yr 30 new reactions are all mediated by ig e, then why tf are they blaming yr mast cells?  to suddenly develop 30 new ig e mediated allergies means something has gone totally kablooey in yr oral immune tolerance.  but yr mast cells are not doing anything wrong.  mast cells are **supposed** to go off when the ig e coating them meets their allergens.  the problem is not in the mast cells.  it is in the b cells making all that ig e to foods.  that does not mean the b cells are **the ultimate source** of the dysfunction.  it could be a failure of tregs (  but they should be trying to chase down *that*.  what cytokine from which type of source is generating all this dysfunctional ig e creation.\n\nit is ridiculous to blame mast cells or mcas here.  also, tryptase testing does not distinguish mcas from ige allergies.  tryptase can be high anytime mast cells go off.  high tryptase just means 'mast cells went off'.  it tells u **nothing** abt the reason they went off.\n\nit sounds like yr occasionally having reactions that yr not sure are tied to any allergy?  but yr not really sure?\n\nthere is no way to positively rule out dysfunctional mast cell reactions.  there is actually no way to positively rule them **in** either.  idiopathic mcas is a diagnosis **of exclusion**.\n\nthere is actually no proof that mcas is even caused by hyperactive mast cells.  it is just a new name for 'idiopathic anaphylaxis', when someone is having anaphylactic reactions and nobody can figure out why.  tryptase testing provides strong evidence that mast cells are going off.  and then they rule out all the explanations they can, **including ig e allergies**, as the reason for the mast cells going off.  if tryptase shows mast cells going off and they cannot figure out any other reason for it, then mcas is diagnosed.\n\nbut it might not be correct.  many of the people believed to have idiopathic anaphylaxis 20 years ago turned out to have allergies that nobody knew how to test for then.  allergy testing is not anything close to comprehensive.\n\n**you need better immunologists.  an mcas diagnosis is not accurate for yr situation and will not help u at all.  u need someone who understands immunology to try to get to the bottom of why yr suddenly making all this ig e to food proteins** &gt; if they know for certain that yr 30 new reactions are all mediated by ig e, then why tf are they blaming yr mast cells?\n\nTHANK YOU. I have felt like I am taking crazy pills, with every person on Reddit as well as my doctors immediately jumping to mast cells.\n\n&gt; high tryptase just means 'mast cells went off'. \n\nTo be clear, my Tryptase levels were low, i.e. normal.\n\n&gt; it sounds like yr occasionally having reactions that yr not sure are tied to any allergy? but yr not really sure?\n\nCorrect, but also, since my initial development of about 20 allergies back in January, I have developed about 10 more. So whenever I get a reaction to a \"safe\" food, I am usually assuming that I have developed yet another allergy, and quite a few times that theory has been proven right. That said, I have also had a few times where I have done my best to narrow down to a few potential culprits and all of them came back negative; what is stranger is that later I stop reacting to those same ingredients or meals. I have just chalked that up to my \"histamine bucket being full,\" but it is just so hard to tell.\n\nThank you so much for your reply, it was very validating and helpful. \n\nIf anyone knows of a super amazing immunologist in Southern California, I am all ears... &gt; It sounds like your doctor wants you to see a mast cell specialist. If so, that may just have to be your next step. There are bad doctors out there. It does not hurt to get a second opinion. If there is a consensus from multiple credible doctors, then you need to follow the doctor's advice.\n\nI have seen a dozen doctors already, including mast cell specialists. I have two allergist/immunologists working on this and they both have arrived at the mast cell thing, but they themselves have admitted that I would be a *highly* atypical case, in that perhaps I both have dozens of IgE allergies *and* mast cell dysfunction. At a certain point, though, a person is so \"atypical\" that the diagnosis simply does not make any sense, and I think I am in the category. Interesting. I have had two concussion in the last year, wondering if there is a connection.\n\nI cannot get an MRI due to my hyperacusis though :( What are your allergies and symptoms? Did the allergies appear as an adult? What sort of treatment have you been doing? Most likely not but I am getting a MrI anyways when we get further. \nAlso I have these weird point in my legs that grt warm sometimes. Just like a heat feeling in a specific area. Really? I have hyperacusis and I get an MRI every other year to check my liver because I have hemochromatosis and have had iron overload since my late teens. I wear really good foam air plugs and that makes the experience totally tolerable. I think they will provide over ear protection that is free of metal if you ask. Though my last one was pre-Covid, so I cannot confirm that for sure. Last year I got an MRI just as my hyperacusis was starting and it made it *so* much worse, seemingly permanently. And yes I wore both ear plugs and over-ear protection. Hyperacusis is a vast thing, some people have it much worse than others. I got no where with doctors.  I had an allergist immunologists say, \"there is nothing I can do for you.\"  I have had primaries say there was no specialist to send me to because there was nothing wrong with me.  Some doctor suggested CFS to me because I get fatigue.  CFS criteria sort of fits me, but CFS seems like a catch-all syndrome waiting on researchers to make sense of it. \n\nHonestly, I am impressed that you are getting some feedback from doctors at all.  Maybe times have changed since I have been to doctors.\n\nThere comes a point where, after getting nowhere with doctors for long enough, it helps to take a break and accept the condition without explanation.  You can always  start the search back up at some point in the future. I mean, it sounds like your allergies are not IgE-mediated, no? That would explain the difference in responses \u2014 in my case, there is at least something objective that the doctors can sink their teeth into. Without that, all they have is your testimony, which like it or not is not something a doctor will use as a basis for science. That is awful, I am so sorry! \n\nYes, I understand that, and my symptoms definitely wax and wane. I had a city bus release the air brakes right next to me the other day and I am still having such a flareup of pain and noise intolerance because of it. I probably could not deal with an MRI right now even with both earplugs and over ear protection. Actually, because of the pain I could not even wear earplugs last night. \ud83d\ude16 God, bus breaks are the WORST. Cannot tell you how many times they have fucked me up. \n\nBetween hyperacusis and rapidly developing more and more food allergies, I am honestly finding myself wishing to die. It is impossible to live something even resembling a life with these two conditions combined. And no one in the medical community cares or can help. After a year of only getting worse I am just not seeing the point anymore. My once awesome, normal life is a distant memory, and yet because on the outside I look fine, hardly anyone I know even cares. This is a living hell. &gt;I mean, it sounds like your allergies are not IgE-mediated\n\n4 skin tests.  Results were inconclusive or failed.  There were reactions to virtually everything they tested me with, but no reaction that was as strong as the control (histamine). So, maybe there is no immunoglobulin causing the reaction.  I have since learned that a complex interaction of a few common substances trigger symptoms.  So, maybe it was immunomodulated all along, but their samples were contaminated.  \n\nIt has been 30+ years.  I have reached the point of not looking for answers many times only to return to the hunt again.  \n\nKeep posting as you learn more.  30 different IgE reactions is interesting. Yeah, it definitely sucks. Yeah, you definitely sound like a textbook case of a mast cell disease. Tons of reactions without IgE is a hallmark of it. Hope you did not think I sounded flippant before, just saying that, as shitty as it is, it makes sense that doctors would dismiss it and/or not be helpful (until recently, that is, since MCDs are gaining more traction and understanding).\n\nThat is the thing about my case -- I literally cannot find anyone like me. I can certainly find people like you with tons of reactions, but none of them ever are IgE-mediated. So far I am a sample size of one. I have seen a ton of doctors and tried contacting loads more (such as authors of scientific papers) and people either do not get back to me or they chalk it up to, like I have said elsewhere in this thread, a \"highly atypical MCD,\" which is clearly the diagnostic equivalent of them just throwing up their hands.\n\nI would tried and get used to it but the rate at which I am losing foods is honestly scaring me. At this rate, in a year it will literally be a choice between eating foods that cause reactions, or do not eat at all. How can I live, let alone have a life worth living, when that is the choice presented to me? Just this time last year I was eating like a totally normal person, albeit minus wheat (my only allergy at the time).\n\nI just have absolutely no idea what to do. No answers, no one to help me, no one to even trade notes with. At this point I am fighting to not just end it myself.", "Biopsy results I saw a doctor last month who suspected MCAS and ordered additional testing on a biopsy I had during an endoscopy. When I spoke to his office they said the results were positive and did not change anything just made it a definitive diagnosis. \n\n\nI guess I am confused because everywhere it says you need repeated tryptases and 24h urines and all this other stuff. There was nothing wrong morphologically with the mast cells on the pathology report just said 70 per hpf. Anyone else been diagnosed like this? I just had a colonoscopy/endoscopy and had similar results. No morphological changes, but an abnormal proliferation of mast cells. They indicated this was indicative of MCAS and supportive of my GI activation during flares. Just supporting data nothing more. Thanks for reply. I only spoke to the receptionist so not too sure how sure she was. I do not really want to go through doing all the lab work. I have a diagnosis of Mastocytic Enterocolitis with Secondary Mast Cell Activation Syndrome from 70-ish mast cells per high powered field. I do not think this is a common diagnosis, and my guess if my diagnosis will change as mast cell diseases are better classified and testing gets better. Seems like mast cell stuff is pretty understudied. I have some GI problems (why I had an endoscopy at all) but I went to this doctor for help with EDS joint pain so it surprised me when he wanted to work on mast cell stuff and said that was what caused the gastritis. Fingers crossed something helps and I hope you are doing okay. Thanks! I am actually making a lot of progress with my medication about a year and a half after diagnosis. I ate chocolate ice cream for the first time in years with no reaction! I do not have IBS-type symptoms that are common with an ME diagnosis, but my understanding is that it is mainly character by extra mast cells in the GI tract. My MCAS is primarily triggered by foods, so it kind of all makes sense. Hopefully you get some straightforward answers that lead to lessening of your symptoms. The diagnosis is not as important to me as the increase in my quality of life is. Congratulations on the ice cream! I agree about the diagnosis not mattering but it does seem to matter to doctors. If it was just the joint issues I could wrap my head around it but adding other stuff in is too much. I cannot live my life if I am playing symptom whack a mole all day. I just went through a year and a half of hip and joint pain to figure out that I have an actual injury in my hip (bursitis) that felt better after a couple of weeks of physical therapy. It was an instance of where doctors thought I was a zebra, but I was in fact a horse. It was the most normal, least exciting explanation after a year and a half of testing. I did not think I had EDS, but I needed answers. \n\nAnd yes, a diagnosis does matter for doctors. Some still do not take my MCAS diagnosis seriously and try to ignore the precautions they should take with me. Those are not the doctors for me. Biopsy is more definitive than the other tests you listed. It is just harder to do so the other tests are more common.", "Integrative doc seems correct with mcas dx based on labs and symptoms, but says it can be caused by mold, lyme/other chronic infections, low vitamin d root canals, gut dysbiosis, etc. Is this true? Where do I focus treatment? I need help. So based on my symptoms and labs mcas seems like a pretty dead on diagnosis, but I have all (or at least positive tests) of the things listed in the title. The only thing that has helped is ativan which unfortunately I have taken daily, I am so hyper reactive to sound (SEVERE sound intolerance and pain) light heat cold stress medicine food, I cannot tolerate literally anything or even going outside. I am so sick and getting sicker and very scared and do not know what to treat or how. Cromolyn causes a vary bad flare even a drop when I try it, which I have 3 times and had to quit after a couple days all three. Most meds but especially antihistamines seem to hurt my damaged ears and make them burn, ketofifen did as well even compounded. Quercetin caused a reaction. Dao seemed ok actually I should order more. Antibiotics, ssris and nsaids have all been responsible for HUGE flares and worsened baselines the past several years as I have gotten much sicker. Vitamin d is SIX but supplements are hard to tolerate.\n\nI only take ativan, nexium and my doc has me taking cholestyramine in case of mold (my house is very moldy, and my urine mycotoxin test had two toxins 7x the reference range. C4a is also 6 times the reference range). They had me leave my house to see if I felt better elsewhere which I sort of did but the sound hurt my ears badly and I seemed MORE reactive when I DID react to something.\n\nI just do not know if I should try starting low dose DSF for lyme, antifungals for the dysbiosis (candida again 4x reference range on gut map), mast cell stabilizers again, try to find a new less triggering home without mold/chemicals/offgassibg, try to lower my ativan more (was 1.25mg daily now 8.75mg) and get through withdrawal, raise my ativan back up, try to supplement vitamin d (its SIX right now, 30 is start of low)... I am seriously so sick I cannot go outside and every day is hell.\n\nDo I listen to my integrative doctor and try to treat lyme and mold and infections in hopes that will stop the mcas, or should I just focus on mcas treatment? Did relocating to a less triggering home help anyone? Even if it seemed to make you MORE reactive at first? Or should I try to get back to \"mainstream\" medicine that has been so dismissive and unhelpful until now (only integrative dr actually ran tests and looked for things) and try to find a mcas specialist?\n\nI am in maryland if it matters. Please I need advice and help. I am so sick and so desperate. Stay away from this doc\n\nMCAS is genetic issue. Do not eat high histamine/tyramine foods, take antihistamines. You may try xolair in the future. That is all Try a sun tanning booth. Yea, most of that stuff (eg Candida, root canal) is pseudoscience. I would go to an allergist to confirm the MCAS diagnosis. Get rid of the mold, or move away. Mold is my trigger for this crap MCAS is not genetic.  It is a protective state any body can enter into if it is sufficiently stressed.  It is an evolutionary adaptation to survive plagues.  \n\nHATS is genetic - same symptoms. what? Any long-term stressor can cause MCAS.  PTSD is a form of MCAS.  \n\nIt sounds like your only option is to focus on MCAS treatment.  If you are reacting to even antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers, it seems like suicide to try to tackle lyme.  \n\nIs your life stressful?  Stress worsens MCAS.  Your mast cells *are* your emotions.  Mast cells are how your feelings happen in your body.  Different emotions involve inflammation in different parts of the body.  \n\nIt could be that you are reacting even to antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers because you have really bad leaky gut (which is NOT pseudoscience - it is fact that tryptase, a mast cell mediator, destroys connective tissue).  Stuff coming through your gut wall when it is not supposed to be can trigger an inflammatory response, because the body is confused.  Either way, you are going to have to find some way to knock all these inflammatory responses back before you can start introducing new meds into your system.\n\nIf your insurance will cover it and/or if you can afford it, I definitely recommend acupuncture.  It is less invasive than these meds that are going through your entire system.  \n\nCryotherapy also might work - it improves vagal nerve tone and function.  Since MCAS is a form of dysautonomia, that means making your vagus nerve happy will improve your symptoms.\n\nI am skeptical of the lyme business, though.  I am sure some people have lyme, but I think it is possible that some people are getting told they have lyme when they do not.  I had never heard of Disulfiram before, but it sounds honestly like the absolute worst thing you could possibly take right now.  I would stay far away from that business, as it seems to literally trigger a mast cell response in people who do not already have MCAS.  \n\nGet tested for HATS if you have not already just because it is much easier to rule out than MCAS (it is a pretty affordable genetic test) I was literally thinking maybe to try and focus on the gut and see what happens since the gut seemed to start all this. I am not sure how to handle that though since food seems like a trigger but fasting also seems to be a trigger... and I bet trying to take glutamine, glucosamine or collagen would also be a trigger? The huge candida in my gut could be directly triggering and causing \"leaky gut\" but how do I get rid of it without being triggered by taking antifungals... i feel like i need an expert beyond experts for even a chance to figure this out.\n\nWhat if the long term stressors ARE the infections? How do I clear them without causing further damage? Mcas is habitual name. There is tens of different mast cell disorders actually, already classified. If biotoxin illness is an issue or possible DDX then take a VCS study. And you will get an answer with 96% predictive value. Then proceed accordingly. \n\nSure chronic infection can make your immune system go crazy. Do you know if you have SIBO or candida? It is super trendy to say you have these things but unless you have taken a breath test, had an upper endoscopic series or have white fuzz growing in your mouth then do not believe you have them. Demand data not trendy hypothesis or you will stay sick for years. Hell, you might get data and still be sick but at least you will have goal directed therapy. \n\nYou are going to have to control the mast cell dysfunction first before you either kill an infections or detox from mold. It is the only safe chronology.  \n\nYou might want to look up Zach Busch MD (sp?) out of Virginia he makes a product called restore. \n\nI would get your KIT tested and TbAS1 tested. See tms for a cure for more info on testing. Vcs study was already positive. But the only research on that for biotoxin illness comes from integrative/functional/alternative medicine too does not it? I have 6 positive lyme tests, a massive history of mold exposure, very high mycotoxin urine levels, and I react very strongly to organic/living material (mold, bacteria, algae, probiotics, forests especially by water, fruit/vegetable/salicylate intolerance). Plus I had a gutmap analysis done and my candida albicans is 5x normal, while most of my normal gut flora is low or even undetectable. To me that is pretty huge, my gut and digestive health are insanely bad and have been since this all started. It feels like a lot of this stems from my gut, a non functional infected permeable gut can cause extreme systemic symptoms.\n\nBut I have no idea how to fix this since prescription antifungals (or any antimicrobials), herbs and oils have all caused a huge negative reaction when I take them, even in tiny tiny doses. Allicin seems to be the thing I have the least reaction to, I just started taking that again yesterday.\n\nCromilyn, quercetin and even vitamin d cause a huge flare when I try them, again even in small doses. Ketofifen I am not so sure but I definitely react badly to all other antihistamines I have tried taking.\n\nMy doctors say try to find a new place to live that isnt so triggering (moldy and dusty basement right next to the magothy river in the moods = trigger central). But disability is not a lot of money and people renting dont really want to work with people with chronic illness and health issues.\n\nLike I know I have massive inflammation and mast cell hypersensitivity, that much is clear by labs and symptoms, but I have a list a mile long that might be triggering or even causing it (lyme, gut/candida, mold/environment, my teeth, very low vitamin d) and how am I even supposed to start addressing anything when I cannot move, cannot tolerate mcas meds so far, and cannot tolerate treatment for anything that might be triggering or causing it.\n\nThis feels hopeless. And it is sad because I feel like if I had more money, I might have a chance at surviving. I have been stuck at \"find somewhere else to live\" for over half a year now. I am going to say mold is the overarching problem. It can cause the immune system to degrade and become dysfunctional. It is profound at causing dysbiosis. It turns immunity from outwards to inwards so bacterial or fungal overgrowth is likely. \n\nVCS came out of NIH, it is not quackery - most doctors do not know what it is therefore they are quick to dismiss it which is a dangerous mindset. \n\nI would try to get CSM. I did while living in a moldy environment and it helped. It got better in a new environment as well but it does take years to recover. \n\n\nIf there is mold in your place then you will probably need to hire a lawyer to help you relocate. Some states have landlord tenant acts which advises on mold remediation. Just make sure who ever tests your place has legal experience and uses a certified lab. I would check on the lab yourself especially if you cannot afford to pay for mistakes. \n\nIn the mean time try to eat protein. The best quality you can afford. Eggs and whey are really great. Amylose is the devil and only going to make your belly worse. I personally am a fan of a zero carb diet. Just have some charcoal on hand if you start detoxing. Hot baths are an easy way to get similar benefits of a sauna which is a great detox. \n\nI am sorry you are in this position. It is really awful and I have been in your shoes somewhat. I am married and we both were working so we could move. Any long-term stressor can trigger MCAS.  But, given that you are reacting to antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers, I do not know if it will turn out  very well if you try to tackle the lyme and candida right now.\n\nMoving can ABSOLUTELY be helpful, especially when you have evidence that mold is an issue.  Even just staying somewhere else for a week or so might be hugely beneficial.  It is a tough one when you are talking about that making you more reactive, and I absolutely do not mean to imply that I know what is going on better than you, but in my experience, when I feel like I am having more reactions in response to a med or some  other change, it is actually usually that I am having the same amount of reactions, but I am dissociating less.  Mast cells can cause dissociation...having a reaction is going to FEEL worse when you are cognitively all there than when you are in la-la land mentally.  Just something to keep in mind.\n\nI absolutely do NOT recommend mainstream medicine at this time, as most of these people do not believe that mast cells play any role in any form of malady, and they will most likely put you on meds that are  very dangerous for you.\n\nI always recommend that everyone join a MCAS Facebook group specific to their geographic area, as that is often the only way you can find doctors who will help.\n\nIf you have not tried cannabis, I definitely recommend giving it a shot, but of course, it can trigger a reaction for some people, so be careful.  If possible, I recommend trying a strain of cannabis that has as LITTLE limonene as possible, as that is one of the few terpenes that are immunoSTIMULANTS, not immunosuppressants. Ok?  and MCAS *proper* is not genetic.  HATS is. Oh, yes KIT D816V mutation lost and forgotten \u201cI started taking Ativan because I found it helped a visual tremor and some other symptoms that I had. When I tried to taper of off it after a short period of time I developed the symptoms you are describing including: severe sensitivity to light, sound, and basically everything else and a whole host of other symptoms. Upon completing my taper most of the symptoms left, however the pain and sensitivity to light continue after three years to a lesser extent. My new neurologist who thinks I may have MCAS has mentioned benzos as a treatment which scares me due to hell I went through before with them. \n\n- I am wondering did you have the sensitivities that you described before you started Ativan? \n- Has Ativan helped them? \n- Or are you saying they started after you began Ativan thus the Ativan seems to be the cause? \n\nHang in there. I sure understand how rough it is to be so sensitive. I went through it but I am able to go to stores and stuff now.\u201d - my wife \n\nI transcribe her messages because using backlight screens gives her headaches. I did but my condition has been progressive and I think long term benzos have probably made it worse, they helped a lot at first and maybe they still do, but any attempt to lower dowe makes everything so much worse. Having had that reaction to benzos before I would NEVER take them again if I were you. I am so sorry you are going through that. \n\nIt sounds a lot like what happened to my wife. They helped a ton at first and then getting off of them was so bad. We switched her to Valium and did a slow taper over the course of a few months. She could not leave a darkened room and I quit my job to take care of her. ( on withdrawal from benzos was really helpful for us.\n\nAll of her sensitivities came down besides the photophobia. It has waxed and waned since.", "Can the lab tests for MCAS be done at the normal lab companies (quest/lab corp)? I heard that they need to be done at the hospital for some reason, is that true?  \nCan I have them done at quest? I think I had to go to labcorp for the 24 hour urine collection test. Or maybe it was quest. Only one of them did it. Doctor should be able to give you codes and then go to the lab and ask. Yes. I used Quest. My doctor said I need to stop the famotidine / zyrtec 3 days before the tests are done, but I could stay on the cromolyn.   \nDoes this sound right? I wasnt on cromolyn at the time of testing but since cromolyn only works for a very short while, maybe? I would personally stop all of them. Its hard to get a positive result anyway because its so sensitive. But I am not a doctor. I am assuming you are in the US but here in Canada testing is not covered unless you meet very specific criteria and even then your sample is priority shipped to Mayo labs. I was under the impression it was proprietary testing by Mayo but from some of the replies that does not seem to be the case. If you are doing regular allergy tests via skin etc. then yeah but really any other MCD test like Tryptase, Methylhistamine, Prostaglandin, you absolutely can still be on antihistamines. \n\nI am not sure about Cromolyn since it is a mast cell stabilizer. If anything is be more worried about it throwing off tests vs antihistamines. You would have to be off cromolyn and anything anti-inflammatory (my doc included vitamin C, D, and E on that list) for one week. Antihistamines were fine to stay on. This was for blood tests but not skin punch/derm biopsy. It depends on the test. I had to get a bone marrow biopsy to confirm mine and that was done at the hospital. If it is just the tryptase test then that can be done anywhere. I had most of my tests done at Quest and they were OK except for the 24 hour urine. The person handling the sample did not understand the importance of keeping the sample cool. :o would a doctor's office be better equipped for this? I believe it has to go to a lab.", " Mast-Cell-Activation-Syndrome-June-2020 ", "Experience with antihistamines and tryptase test? Hi all,\n\nI know it is common to tell people to avoid cromolyn in advance of a blood tryptase test, but were any of you told not to take antihistamines beforehand as well?\n\nThanks! No. As long as the antihistamine is not a mast cell stabilizer aswell there is no need to stop taking it Thanks! No need to stop antihistamines. They block the action of histamine, but not its release. So, we are still releasing histamine (and tryptase), just are not suffering the symptoms (or not as much anyway). Thank you! Basically the action is the release ) Oops, I mean it blocks the effect of histamine. Histamine and tryptase will still be released. Antihistamines block histamine from attaching to receptors, but they are still pouring out of the cell. This is why antihistamines have zero impact on measuring tryptase.\n\nAnd-our bodies are not reacting to the actual degranulation. It is when those mediators attach to a receptor that causes symptoms. So, all meds we take (unless mast cell stabilizer) are for symptom management and do not change the actual degranulation process. I have a difficult time detecting when I am in a flare if I have been taking my medication. This could mean that I miss the right time frame for catching an elevated tryptase during a flare. I wonder if this is why so many people get low tryptase values. Timing could be off. Good luck! Thanks for this. What you have outlined here lines up with my understanding and is congruent with the MCAS resources that I have read. However, it contradicts several studies from the 2000's that (1) identified H1 antihistamines as also having MC-binding and MC-stabilizing properties, and (2) identified cetrizine as lowering baseline serum tryptase levels.\n\nThe more recent synopses that I have seen agree with what you have said, but none of them provide citations to contradict the earlier studies or at all substantiate the newer understanding. So, I was just left scratching my head a bit :) Interesting. I would have to look into it further. Is it safe for you to be off the antihistamines for the test? \n\nIf there is any question of whether or not they will interfere with results, and it is safe for you to be off of them for a couple of days, then...something to consider. My reactions are not anaphylactic, so it would be safe (although uncomfortable) to be without the meds for a brief period of time. Nope I never stop my medicine for tests. Cromolyn and antihistamines and my tryptase is still always high Yes, that is why i moved to Ketotifen in my stack. It actually improves something, everything else is like hanging on the cliff. Missed dose? Take a punch! &gt;I wonder if this is why so many people get low tryptase values. \n\nI am sure that is part of it, but also, there are 220+ mast cell mediators in total so you could conceivably have hyper-responsive mast cells without having elevated tryptase, as that is only one of 220 things you could potentially have too much of As many others have said, antihistamines should not affect tryptase, but also just in general, mast cell disease patients are advised never to go off antihistamines for any test.\n\nFor example, I have a vestibular disorder, SCDS, and need a vEMP test - but antihistamines skew the vEMP test, so I would have to go off them for 72 hours beforehand.  I go into anaphylaxis if I go more than 4 hours between antihistamine doses.  So i am just not ever going to take a vEMP test, ever! Agreed, but they only asked about tryptase and is one of the markers most doctors check for. My flares are controlled with antihistamines H1/H2 and Singulair, so I am guess I am mostly flaring from histamine and leukotrienes. I actually did have an elevated tryptase with flare, but was speculating on why others have difficulty catching it.", "Continuous nightly facial flushing that is driving me nuts For background in may of 2020 I unfortunately acquired alpha gal. A tick borne allergy to dairy and red meat. It is been not great. I have also adult onset allergies to birch pollen and shellfish.\n\nI also have GAD that has gotten worse because of food allergies (being constantly on guard for allergens is stressful)\n\nRecently (within the last two months) I have been having nightly facial flushing. Starting at 8pm or so. Triggers (that I know of) are alcohol, stress, focusing too hard, unknown of foods affect it currently keeping a food log.\n\nMy doctor does not really know what is going on and does not have too much to offer. I will need to pick up a new derm at the start of the year and my allergist is equally like \u201cidk probably not an allergy?\u201d. I feel like my body is gaslighting me too. Like maybe it is just anxiety and I should not bother a doc about it. \n\nBut it freaks me out. I am terrified this will turn into anaphylaxis and I will not know the cause. \n\nI do not know if it is as simple as a vitamin deficiency (my eating habits have been out of wack since being unable to eat anything from a mammal), stress, anxiety, or something like MCAS, rosacea or idk what.", "Could this be MCAD Hello! I have just discovered this sub and I would wondering if anyone could help me in trying to figure if this could be the culprit. I have a geneticist diagnosis of HEDS as well as a POTS diagnosis. I have been aware of MCAD for a while however until recently I have never given the condition a second thought. \n\nI have had GI issues for years however last year I started having these episodes of diarrhoea. I have been running hot and cold for years but again since last year I keep having hot flushes, once it was very much this uncomfortable burning heat, no sweating but was insanely intense. This was the most extreme event to date but this can happen multiple times a day to just once a week. \n\nI have also (and this is the most confusing symptom) being coming out in hives, an itchy rash with welts showing up all over my body, the location varies and tends to go within a short while(under an hour). However the rash will just move location and the whole thing will start again! When I take an antihistamine it goes away. The rashes usually come on the evening. At first I thought this was an allergy, I kept a food diary but there wasnt a common denominator that I could see. Then I thought it could be a dust allergy but I vac multiple times a day, I have replaced cusions on the sofa, washed and steamed all fabrics in the house all with no success... if anything the reaction seems to be getting worse. Sometimes my fingers and feet go a little sausage like and I am wheezing by the end of the night but I have never experienced any trouble breathing. The rash element happens daily, some evenings are worse that others. I have looked at all of the bugs and such that can cause rashes like this but no one else in the house is experiencing a rash. I cant see bitemarks, see any bugs on fabrics, see no burrowing marks. Most of the time the rash leaves tiny purple blotches on the skin once the rash has gone.\n\nI recently had my bloods back and hormones and thyroid are normal. Gp chalked it up to lifestyle and left it at that. I get brain fog/ fatigue/ joint pain but I have always just thought that is part of my existing diagnosis.\n\nMy question is does this sound like it could be MCAS, if so what evidence should I try to gather to take to my GP to ask for testing? Will it be helpful to document and take pictures of every rash that comes up? Or will the fact I have both EDS and POTS be enough to warrant further investigation. Lastly if this doesnt sound like Mast Cell issues does this sound like anything else?\n\nThank you for anyone who has read this. Any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated x Evidence? Symptom history is enough. Tests might still be negative, though. Theyre not the most reliable tests. An immunologist is the doctor you should see. Thank you for replying. Does this sound like its worth chasing a doc for a referral for? If so I will definitely try to get a immunologist ref.\n\nI also may have worded it incorrectly regarding evidence, when going through my EDS diagnosis I needed to present pages of med history,  fam history as well as a breakdown of what \"weird\" symptoms I was experiencing just to get past my gp, then again the same process to get to see a geneticist (mostly due to crossover symptoms). Would it be worth taking pictures of the rash for example, would it make a difference? Those are the symptoms I have. You have got 2 comorbid diseases. Its worth looking into. \n\nI told my immunologist I have a eash and explained how it looked and she knew it was hives. If you feel you wont get a referral without this evidence then go ahead and do it. I think its stupid that a doctor requires that and does not trust their patient, but do what you have to do. Thank you for you help! I think it is time to have another conversation with the gp. I have hEDS, POTS, MCAS, and SFN. Your symptoms are very indicative of mast cell issues, especially with your diagnosed comorbidities. MCAS is the biggest trigger for my POTS. I saw an allergist, but she specializes in mast cell issues and was researching the link between EDS and MCAS. It is not an easy diagnosis to make, but sometimes they will go ahead and begin treatment to see if it helps if there are enough symptoms and reasons to believe it is mast cell related.", "Help please I think I had mast cell degranulation from iodine contrast dye Can I recover from this ? Please someone give me some advice I am desperate   You should. You are no longer exposed to it and it passes out of your body relatively quickly.\n\nFor the record, I had contrast this summer and I have heard horrible things about it, and I did not even notice it. They have gotten much better at it now and use much lower concentrations. Also, I had taken montelukast the night before so that probably helped.\n\nYou could take OTC H1 antihistamines. You can even try taking famotidine which is an H2. That works really well for me. I know many people take Benadryl as a rescue antihistamine, but I also know it can be problematic for some. \n\nAnything stronger you need to see a doc. Nobody can give you helpful advice because you refuse to listen to reason.  Your obsession with mast cells as a cause of your symptoms is pathological and preventing you from getting well.\n\nYour symptoms were not consistent with mast cell degranulation.  Your symptoms were entirely neurological and started a day later.  Systemic mast cell degranulation causes symptoms of anaphylaxis - **which you did not have.**  You have no reason to believe this was caused by mast cells and you have been told this over and over.  \n\nThe mediators released from mast cells are histamine, leukotrienes, prostaglandins, proteases (like MC trypase), heparin, and various cytokines and chemokines.  These substances all have short half-lives and their effects are therefore brief.  \n\nIf the iodine contrast caused an inappropriate mast cell reaction (which it did not), the reaction would have been brief.  Iodine contrast itself has a short half life in people with healthy kidneys.  All of the iodine was out of your body long before your symptoms started.  Once a substance is gone, it cannot trigger mast cell degranulation.  Iodine contrast can cause delayed reactions, but those delayed reactions are not mast-cell mediated.\n\nIt is time to see a psychiatrist for your neurotic fixation on diseases you do not have. Well can I ask you are opinion than on adverse reactions to contrast dye? I just have read a lot about neurological reactions to contrast dye due to mast cell,but anyway,are adverse reactions permanent? Great thanks I appreciate it,what sorts of bad things did you hear about it? People have allergic reactions to it, or they feel very hot or other weird feelings, that it is not pleasant. \n\nI really felt nothing when they injected it. They were trying to find a kidney stone and the doc could see the contrast going thru my urinary tract but I did not feel a thing. Once they found the stone they put me under and blasted it out. And I had no after effects. A friend of mine had anaphylaxis 12 hours after her ct scan and developed the burning skin like me,she has mcas,I am sure their has to be delayed reactions even with mast cell activation. I try to take in all the info you give me but then I come across stuff like that so it is all very confusing", "Face flushing/rosacea? Forgive me if this is all over the place but I am hoping someone can give me some advice.\n\nI developed type 1 rosacea last June. It consists of burning, flushing, broken blood vessels etc. I have been to a dermatologist and tried a topical that made it worse. After extensive research I have accepted that the only thing that will help is lasers since even doctors do not know the cause.\n\n...however. After research I 100% think my rosacea is caused by poor gut health/dysfunctional immune system. I have had Crohn's for 7 years. Besides that I have absolutely horrible environmental allergies and have my entire life. I suffer with unbearable sinus congestion every day despite taking antihistamines daily. I have never found anything that works long term and even sinus surgery provided no relief.\n\nAnyways, on the rosacea subreddit I have seen the term MCAS thrown around and after looking into it I wonder if that might be my issue. I have many of the symptoms such as low blood pressure, flushing obviously, wheezing and sometimes I feel like I cannot breathe (I thought it was related to anxiety but now I am no longer sure).\n\nI plan on trying a low histamine diet and getting some cromolyn nose spray which I have never tried. However I have a few questions:\n\n-Has anyone else experienced intense facial flushing/redness/burning due to MCAS? Mine has definite triggers like exercise, heat and alcohol but other times it is completely random and I will even wake up with a red face. I do think I have food intolerances that cause it but I have not been able to pinpoint any yet.\n\n-What should be my first step to seeking a diagnosis? It seems like it is a difficult thing to diagnose. I have been to various doctors and ENTs in the past and none have helped much. I had an allergy test done a few years ago which found I am basically allergic to everything. Should I try an immunologist or allergist?\n\nJust wanted to see if anyone else can relate to my issues. I refuse to accept that this facial flushing is something I just have to deal with/there is no cure for since I am 100% certain it all stems from internal imbalances. So I am no expert. I will start there. Ha. But I found an allergist/immunologist who listened to me. I brought up mast cell activation syndrome and she admitted she did not know much but said she is willing to learn and we can go through this together. I do not know why I was so scared to bring it up, but I was. I think that is the key. \n\nAnd I get body heat and facial flushing also. It is part of my symptoms. Mine is stress related and triggered by food. I have MCAS and get facial flushing. I also have p&amp;p rosacea which I treat with ivermectin.\n\nThere are other things that can cause flushing or a red face. Lupus, carcinoid syndrome, medicine reactions (I had that problem with lisinopril), allergy to skin care products, etc. I do not have a confirmed diagnosis of MCAS but suspected it and am on medications for it (cromolyn, a first gen antihistamine, singular, Prilosec and am taking daily vitamins that are known mast stabilizers) \n\nMy face flushing was thought to be from either THC or my oxybutynin so there was not much I could do about it. Mine would only flare up when it was hot and living in a sub tropical climate even 30 minutes outside left my face red. \n\nI can say the overall redness in my face has gone down since I started cromolyn and the vitamins (not sure the vitamins are working but they definitely are not making things worse) I have only noticed a full red face once but I also do not constantly check it since I have been dealing with it for almost a year. I was diagnosed with rosacea, I get a bright sunburned looking face and the pustules. I found it was related to my diet! When I eat wheat or other high histamine foods, I flush and breakout soon after. I am definitely no expert, I can only speak from my own experiences, but I get mild rosacea from food, cosmetics, laundry detergent, tap/shower water, dry heat, sunlight...  Learning what to do and not to do has been an ongoing process of reading and getting advice online about conditions that I know can cause or contribute to it (in my case, MCAS, and to a lesser extent SIBO), as doctors have not been at all helpful.\n\nCosmetics are the worst thing for me, even most 'hypoallergenic' moisturisers will give me a rash, and I have not used shampoo in over a decade (as anywhere it touches me ends up scarlet and feeling sunburned).  I use jojoba oil for moisturiser (it works as a cleanser and makeup remover too) and wash my hair with an unscented hypoallergenic conditioner as infrequently as I can get away with (luckily my hair has adjusted to only needing a shower twice a week).  My sister (who has the same issues as me) would be someone I could ask for advice on makeup.\n\nAnother thing that made a big difference for me was getting a chlorine-filter for my shower.  I react quite badly to the level of chlorine in standard tap water (in more populated cities, with a higher chlorine water content, I cannot even drink it, let alone shower in it). And I avoid swimming pools with the same fervour that a normal person would avoid a dip in an acid vat. Oh, water that is too hot has a similar effect, I need to keep showers/baths etc. at a cooler temperature than the average person.\n\nLaundry detergent is another big one for me, which I am still working on (there is another post about safe detergents somewhere on this subreddit), as freshly laundered pillowcases always cause me to wake up with a rash on my face.  All I can say is to rinse the fuck out of everything you wash (the less amount of soap and more water the better - I actually wash everything a second time without soap to get rid of as much of the soap residue as I can).\n\nAs for food, avoiding high histamine foods is obvious, but additionally, and I do not understand the mechanisms involved, but for me personally, avoiding sugar and vegetable oil (including canola, safflower, sunflower, peanut, cottonseed, grapeseed, soybean, margarine, and shortening) helps immensely.", "Can numb lips or tongue be a reaction to a mast cell reaction or allergy of a food? I am not sure exactly what is causing it but thinking maybe it was cauliflower or my stevia sweetener supplement. Yes. It could be either... but I have to say that last summer I went into anaphylaxis from stevia, which is closely related to ragweed... if you have ragweed allergies that could definitely be a cross reaction.\n\n(worth disclosing that I do not have a diagnosed mast cell disease - but many of the protocols/precautions people here follow also help with my allergies so I have found it helpful to follow this sub).", "Ketotifen and sweating Has anyone seen an increase in sweating while on it? I have a couple nights a month where I wake up drenched. Could be other health issues I have going on but wanted to see if this could be the cause. I take 1mg of ketotifen twice a day and did not have any side effects but it really seems like it is highly individual how folks react to things, so I definitely would not rule it out.", "Increase in symptoms after sex (first time) Hi you all, get ready for a TMI!! I am a 27yo female with MCAS, EDS, and dysautonomia. (Currently on cromolyn, pepcid, allegra, and prozac)\n\n\nI have started having P in V sex with my partner (male). I have previously had semen reactions from oral or hand jobs with 2/4 people I have done that with so I do suspect I am allergic, or maybe it is something they ate? I swallowed once and got those dark red dots that cluster together on my neck. Another time I swallowed, I had anaphylaxis (this was the first time and I did not for years after). I also have a latex allergy. \n\n\nWe have had protected sex several times at this point in the last week and I have felt more symptomatic than I have in months. One of those times was with a latex condom (I quickly took a couple benedryl immediately after, when I realized). The other times were not, however. \n\n\nAnyways, I have been really symptomatic the last week, like feet and legs more itchy, random hive patches, tired and headache-y, diarrhea-y, and sometimes dizzy. I have also gotten more clusters of dark red dots (not itchy or bumpy, and they go away if I take benedryl). \n\n\nI was wondering if anybody else experiences this? I do not think it is from orgasms as I was doing that before, but something to do with actual sex? I also do not think it is from being over exerted or anything, but maybe?\n\n\nI finally got to a good symptom management spot and was able to start dating and now I am feeling like doodoo again. Would appreciate some insight! I have anaphylaxis from orgasms, but from sex I get swelling and sometimes a bleeding episode. We cannot use condoms and he is not good at pulling out.  I have been thinking a plain water douche after sex might be helpful to me, but have not tried it yet. Oh no that is awful about the anaphylaxis!! I just get super dizzy. Hm that is interesting I do not know that I have noticed any swelling with me, but I bleed the next few days afterwards but I assumed I was from my iud shifting around since I got it 3 months ago. Yea a douche probably not a bad idea, just worried about messing up my ph balance or something. Thanks for the input! It sounds like you are allergic to semen, which I have heard is an actual thing. Have you talked to a doctor about this yet? Yea I suspect that I am. I just did not realize like being allergic to something even if the reaction is over (i.e. I do not necessarily have an irritated point of contact) would make me more symptomatic across the board. But it seems like it might be The whole thing with mast cell is that it is different than allergies. You leak all these mediators like histamine out in much larger numbers than you are supposed to and it affects your whole body, and the mast cells do not have to encounter an IGe protein like in allergies to go off. I am so sorry this happened to you, that sucks. I have had this experience when having sex with people who consumed a lot of the allergens I had issues with (people who smoke or eat a lot of nightshades). It is definitely really difficult to deal with this but as I found partners who did not consume stuff I react to, it got a lot better. You got this Thanks ugh yeah just another extra layer of \"is this person right for me?\" added into the mix. He drinks a lot of smoothies and I have several fruit allergies and intolerances so I bet it is this. Maybe this should be my metric haha My BF (before moving in) had to shower starting from top to bottom and then genitals last using soaps that are safe for me to wash off the crappy soaps he used at home. I am very allergic to the laundry soap and body soap he was using. When he moved in I had to wash his stuff 4x and then thoroughly clean the washer. \n\nIt took me a few weeks after we hooked up to figure out why my vulva was destroyed and I felt like I was extra sick. I tried so many non-latex condoms and my body hates everything.\n\nHe is careful with what he eats because I have a super nose and can smell some stuff off gassing after he eats them (like anything in the allium family which I am allergic to) and to be careful about semen since it is possible to have a reaction to allergens via that route. Thankfully I am ok with his semen otherwise. My ex spouse's semen gave me rashes regularly... I was not aware of having allergies at that time besides soap/perfume stuff so I never looked into if it was the semen or what they were eating.\n\nSome women have been desensitized via controlled exposure to semen but it is a fair amount of work for both people in the relationship and requires upkeep.", "How did you get diagnosed? What were your symptoms before treatment? Share your story here! I had many tests with a functional medicine doctor, and tried some of the supplements and medications to see if they helped, which they did. Finally found a specialist who looked at the test results and we talked for 2 hours and based on symptoms and results he diagnosed me. Symptoms are too many to mention here but occur in head, heart, skin, GI tract, bladder, joints, muscles. Interesting, did you have many allergic (histamine) symptoms? I had hives now and then, and some rashes. Runny nose all the time. Red face when I drank wine. Come to think of it, quite a few! It is funny when you start listing them how fast you realize all of them. I had a tryptase and total blood count and a 24 hour urine test. Based on those results and my symptoms, we know I have MCAS.  Because my tryptase levels were so high the second time, dr wants to do a bone marrow biopsy but we are managing with medications and we are learning what my triggers actually are. I am newly diagnosed, \n\nI was always one of those people \u201callergic to everything.\u201d I do not get hives, but I am almost always in a constant state of some form of allergic reaction. I react to damn near every singe typical trigger: citrus, avocado, banana, shellfish, spinach (I always joked that I am allergic to salad) and other random fruits/berries. The true catalyst for me being tested was testing positive for shellfish allergy and then the next time I did not have a reaction at allergist to shrimp (stick test) so we did a taste test and I went into anaphylaxis right then. Also, I was fired from allergy shots because I had a reaction every time, even at the lowest dose. Sometimes I can eat something and be fine, and another time I can eat the same exact thing and have a reaction. It is exhausting. I am allergic to some of the pollens so I was diagnosed with oral allergy syndrome before MCAS was a thing. We thought I had that for years and then we discovered MCAS and I really just fit right into everything about it, unfortunately. I know! I started making a list for my PCP and it looked ridiculous. No wonder docs think we are making it up. Every system in the body. What sort of bladder symptoms did you get? I was having GI symptoms for a couple of years. I was taking meds that can have those side effects, so blamed it on that. Then I got to the point where everything I ate was passing through undigested, so I stopped the meds to see if I got better. I did not. I started having asthma symptoms, which I had not had since my teen years. My occasional red face started happening more often, but the red patches were raised, with white borders. And then one day I ate my usual breakfast (10 peanut butter filled pretzel bites) and had anaphylaxis.\n\nI saw an allergist after that. He was a grouchy old man. I reacted to the negative control on the skin test, so he said my skin was too reactive for testing. He ordered blood tests for the foods I reacted to. When they were all negative, he said i needed to get help for my anxiety (what anxiety?) before I became agoraphobic, and also to lose weight, but that I did not have an allergy problem and he could not help me. \n\nSo I was at a loss for what to do next. It was embarrassing to be so ill and be told it was all in my head. I felt like I would wasted a lot of time and money. I have good insurance, but that allergist was the kind who always bills for things in ways that insurance does not cover, like $75 for a peak flow test, so my $35 visits were at least $100 each. That would have been ok if I would gotten any help with my symptoms. As it was, I did not want to go to another allergist.\n\nI talked about it in the soy allergy group I belong to, and several people there mentioned MCAS. It sounded like what I was experiencing. I told my husband about it and he called every allergist's office in town and asked if they treated it. One said they did, so he started nagging me about going. I put it off for a year, then gave in.\n\nThey asked a lot about symptoms and sent me for a tryptase test to rule out mastocytosis. Then gave me the diagnosis and started prescribing meds for it. Frequency, incomplete emptying, sore bladder, having to go again a few minutes after I thought I had emptied. I usually get up to go 4 times per night. I have been told it is Interstitial Cystitis. I believe there is medicine for it but I already take a lot of meds and supplements and I can live with it as long as it does not;t get worse. (Also posted in the other geoup) Since I was a teen, I had GI issues. I never looked into it because kids are dumb and I thought diarrhea=weight loss. I had migraines with aura since I was 5 and anxiety attacks as a kid into my 20s. \n\n\nFast forward many years. Figured out that I was getting auras and silent migraines accompanied by panic attacks because I never knew what was going on and it scared me. I try so many SSRIs and SNRIs and I get all kinds of symptoms, cant tolerate a single one. I end up on valium... (mast cell stabilizing properties)\n\n\nSymptoms as teen/now:\nRashes, GI issues, anxiety, migraines, weight gain and loss, horrendously painful headaches, body aches that were totally not growing pains, chronic bronchitis, allergies,tachycardia ardia, syncope, asthma, chemical sensitivity (touch and smell), chemical pink eye... makeup, lotion... anything would set off inflammation in my eyeballs and make my eyelids and surrounding skin dry out and get red. Even my tears can still do this. \n\n\nI also have Hashimotos and a rare spine disease. \n\n\nWe move to PNW 3 years ago and I was miserable to say the least. Went to an allergist and I tested positive for everything. I have food sensitivities, too. POTS was acting up, something I had not had an issue with since I was in my early 20s. I didnt want allergy shots because I felt I would be even more miserable. We went on vacation into Maui and I was totally fine, except for a few issues. Came back and I was even worse than before. \n\n\nMy heartrate was high. PCP sent me to cardiologist. Cardiologist said I have POTS, brushed me off. I finally found an autonomic neurologist for my POTS. HE DIAGNOSED ME.... someone who doesnt specialize in MCAS but knows enough about it because its comorbid with POTS. He had me tested for like 50 blood tests. Everything came back normal. He informed me that 40% of MCAS tests are false negatives. They are not performed correctly and mast cells die quickly if not kept totally cold. So he started treating me with oral cromolyn sodium. \n\n\nIt was like a fog lifted, literally, when I started that med. I feel so much more myself than I have in a long time. I am also doing a low histamine diet, which is helping a lot. \n\n\nMCAS Meds: xyzal, pepcid, cromolyn sodium, quercetin, magnesium glycinate, vitamin  D, vitamin, B complex I am curious, what muscles symptoms you have/had?", "How to best get yourself in an episode for labs? My wife is getting a Tryptase test done soon. In the past we had one done and it came back normal. Our new allergist said it would be easier to get an abnormal read if the lab was done during or shortly after an attack. \n\nGetting an abnormal read now would be **much** easier for us because it comes back normal, then our allergist is going to have us go to another specialist, and we are really tired of getting moved around - and are a bit worried about wait times. \n\nRight now, in order to stave off episodes, my wife is taking Ativan. She also does DNRS and while she has not healed with it, it does help her avoid certain triggers at time. \n\nAny advice on how to safely get an episode going for her to get the best results from the lab? I do not believe any episode is safe, you could expose your wife to the things she knows she is allergic to but that is extremely risky and could go very wrong very quickly That is a good point thank you I just had my doctor put in a lab request that was available for a few months, so I could get a test done when I had a reaction, rather than triggering a reaction. Red wine I have thought the same thing.  Never did try it though (and have no labs that show anything conclusive).\n\nAs we all react differently to things, what triggers you will differ.  I assume you already have a list of things she \"cannot\" do...do one...  Most of the online lists of \"mast cell degranulation triggers\" seem accurate in my experience.  Like I have never known why I tend to not like citrus...now I have a guess (triggers or has histamine).  It is one of the reasons I stopped even gluten free alcohol (always hurt tons the next morning, if not earlier).\n\nThe idea of having a lab order ready to use when you get a natural trigger is not a bad one.  Not sure how \"down to the minute\" the labs need to be.  Like if it happens on a Sunday or 2am.  I have got one for a 12 lead ECG when I notice my palpitations next and can get in to a lab. Depending on the reaction: I have heard of people inducing a flare with known food triggers. For me, that would be chocolate, taco seasoning, tomatoes, and alcohol. My \u201cflares\u201d are mostly flushing, diarrhea, and nasal congestion so I might be tempted to risk it. Tacos and chocolate cake on the way to the lab! I would make sure I was at least flushing before the draw. (I am not suggesting you do this, I am speaking for myself. If the reactions are anaphylaxis, I would not risk it)", "Mast cell reaction to vaccine I have had a reaction to the Pfizer covid vaccine. I got my first shot. My arm and shoulder an part of my back developed a rash. No hives, no pples just a rash. Immunologist says it is nothing to worry about because it is been almost 2 weeks and I am still fine. I am going to get the second shot on the 6th in the other arm. if someone lets me know if it is okay to post pictures on this site I will post a picture of the reaction it does not even itch.  Not to downplay your reaction at all - I have MCAS too and it is terrible,  \nBut in this case, is not it the right thing for your body to be doing by releasing mast cell mediators?  \n\nTheir whole point is to detect foreign incursions and release mediators to fight them.  \nThat is exactly what is happening with the vaccine; and kind of the response I would expect, to differing degrees, from anyone? I think it is the pge. Not if you are on medication to stop that from happening. You do not seem to know much about mast cell Fair point. Given doctors have said to avoid ibuprofen around the vaccine, would quercetin be a problem for the same anti-inflammatory (mitigation) concerns?  Everyone has different reactions to different things. We are not a one trigger lumped together group. I mean, I have reactions to vaccines. But I have worse reactions to viruses and I have deadly reactions to many Antibiotics. So, which is safest?  Personally, the vaccine is a smaller risk than getting the virus for me. Feel free to post the picture. Apparently a delayed rash is common. People at work have had it and there is a slang term \u201ccovid arm\u201d or \u201cmoderna arm\u201d where it is apparently more common. \n\nI had the moderna shot 2 weeks ago and had mild anaphylaxis, puffy lips and a bit of trouble breathing, itchy face. I immediately took a Benadryl, got home, had liquid Benadryl and rested. After that the puffy-ish lips stuck around a few more days but everything was fine, just a sore arm for a day or two. 1 week after the shot I had a sore armpit which is also quite common, and discussed on the CDC website.\n\nI am getting my 2nd shot on the 6th also, we will have to compare notes! I have heard to expect to feel really terrible, and this time I will premeditate with Benadryl (having someone else drive me.) I have never had a reaction to PEG before. Good luck Dont do it. There is no such thing as a 'vaccine\" for a virus. Its the flu, no one ever got immune to it by taking flu shots. Trust me Ive had flu shots and gotten the flu. Both from taking it and afterwards when coming in contact with the flu. You will get covid anyway if you come in contact with it. Dont forcefully inject yourself with a virus + heavy metals/toxins. Your immune system is already overwhelmed. Big Pharma likes to make money. They do not consider your health. These shots can kill and have done so. Do not just believe what the masses say. They are brainwashed. The 'vaccine' is the virus But its not a vaccine. You will get covid anyway if you come in contact with it...again. No reaction to the second shot at all. You are an uneducated, ignorant dunderhead. Go peddle your misinformation elsewhere.", "Histamine Release and IGe blood tests Hi! I am currently going through testing for MCAS. My tryptase was normal while I had a bad case of hives but my IGe was supposed to be under 25 and it was 154. Then my doctor did a histamine release chronic urticaria blood test which was supposed to be less than 10 and it was over 50. Is anyone familiar with these tests and what they mean? My doctor really does not think it is a mast cell issue because my tryptase is normal. I have had chronic hives for for 4 months I did the skin prick test in the office and was only allergic to mold and dust. It may be that you are severely allergic to mold and dust. If your only symptom is hives, then that is more than likely what it is. \n\nBut normal tryptase is not sufficient to rule out mast cell disorders. Hmmm. Typically for MCAS you have to have reacted in several body systems. Have you had anything else other than hives? Unless they are thinking Cutaneous Mastocytosis? There are times when I eat something my throat will feel tight or I will have a runny nose, I cannot find the trigger though. My hives also are not immediate, I only get them overnight. Normal tryptase is normal. Is IGe and histamine release usually normal too? Are you familiar with this? I also got the test when I was having a reaction... I am not familiar with those tests. :( I did the 24 hour urine collection which was probably handled wrong by the lab (do not recommend) and a few tryptase. I have read more than one academic journal article saying tryptase is often normal for MCAS. I requested a tryptase test in the ER and it was maddeningly within normal range. Wow! That is crazy. I really felt like she knew what she was talking about lol", "Someone explain to me why I can feel tired and sick all day then feel better at night... And then the flip side is, that when I get my burst of energy at night time, and I want to stay up, if I stay up too late then I feel like absolute death the next day. \n\nSo I can get my boost of energy after feeling sick all day and laying around all day trying to rest, so I decide I have energy &amp; might as well try and enjoy myself a little bit and so I stay up till 3 or 4 in the morning and if I do that, number one - my restless leg will be worse when I try to fall asleep, number two - I will sleep like absolute terrible. I will wake up probably 5 or 6 hours and not be able to get back to sleep if it is daylight, and number three - even if I do sleep 8 hours I am still going to feel absolutely terrible and horrible the next day, like just overwhelmingly horrible fatigue that will not go away.... What kind of fuckary is this? &gt;And then the flip side is, that when I get my burst of energy at night time, and I want to stay up, if I stay up too late then I feel like absolute death the next day. \n\n\nSame!! I have always been a night owl, though. If I mess up my routine, then I always feel sick. If I stick to my routine, I am good. Yeah, I just want to figure out why this is. In the morning I feel worse just because it is morning but also because meds have not sunk in or adrenaline. At night the histamine from having reactions all night keeps me awake. I have to take multiple mast cell stabilizers and antihistamines before bed to sleep. You know they made a pro-histamine drug to help keep pilots awake while flying. Hmmmm. Yeah I am about to take a shot of cromolyn, Claritin, spray my nose and then go to bed. Cool,did not know ) I can be a pilot! Histamine is a neurotransmitter important for regulating circadian rhythm. Histamine bucket gets fuller and fuller as day goes on.  Histamine = awake.  Adjust your antihistamine dosage schedule so that you are taking less in the morning and more at night.  You got to lower that histamine level if you want to sleep.  If you have racing thoughts, your histamine is high.  If you feel anxious or hounded by memories, histamine is high.  If you have a song stuck in your head, histamine is high.  And finally, if food seems gross and you are horny, your histamine is high.  Dose accordingly.\n\nIt is difficult to get good quality of sleep with MCAS because chronic inflammation = blood pooling (aka POTS) and not having enough blood in your brain from being horizontal all night will make you feel hazy.  I do not know a real solution to this since few (if any) antihistamines seem to last more than four hours and people are supposed to sleep more like eight hours.  But doing forms of exercise that challenge your body's ability to move blood around by putting it in very different positions and doing inversions (so basically yoga) will improve this.\n\nTake magnesium before bed for RLS.  You can also apply it topically Incidentally I always have songs stuck in my head.\n\nAll day it is been Happiness by Goldfrapp even as I am reading this lol. lol crazy i always feel awful throughout the day and the one time i feel decent is at night. Everyone is blaming this on mast cells but this is common in healthy people too. They are exposed to electronic screens at night that keeps them alert. Then because of this when they try to sleep the quality is poor because of the evening light. They feel like crap in the day and the cycle repeats itself. For me personally, direct sunlight is a histamine trigger (luckily I live in Ireland - cloud cover most of the year), but come summertime, I feel sick during the day, and then start feeling better and perk up as soon as the sun goes down. Yeah I always wondered why for years and years springtime would start to make me feel more sick and I absolutely cannot stand summertime for the most part. I googled that pro-histamine drug for pilots and cannot find anything on it - just references to non-sedating antihistamines. Do you have a link? I am intrigued.  Do you take any meds at bedtime? Modafinil I believe is the one they are talking about.  Normally for narcolepsy, but also for ADD/ADHD sometimes. I would guess our circadian rhythm is just wrong/broken.  Wish I knew a solution too.\n\nI can get myself up regularly if I take a 400mg SAMe pill in the morning.\n\nGoing to sleep is much more difficult.  All sleeping pills I have tried wear off after 4 hours and I do not feel rested afterwards. Thanks Histamine and your circadian clock are intertwined tightly with histamine helping to regulate as I understand it. Also it has something to do with sleep I do not understand as mornings are the worst for me too. I read recently that people with diarrhea from it often get woken up early hours of the morning with stomach pain.\n\nI have always had an issue of episodes coming on as soon as I am about to fall asleep or just have. It wakes me up with the burning rush in my face and my heart pounding with nausea and trying to get to the washroom to throw up with out falling over. \n\nSorry no explanation but maybe pieces to puzzle. Same!", "Reactions triggered by anything mildly antifungal - relief? Hi all,  \n\nShort version:  \nWhat is it physically/chemically that happens when you have a mold/fungal infection and it gets 'triggered'?  \nI am not talking about it causing mast cell degranulation - which it may well do.  \nI am saying what is it that the mold inside you does when it gets agitated and 'goes off' ?  \n\n-----\nLong version:  \n\nPosting here because I have tried searching for information about this, but have come up empty handed - it is a difficult thing to search about without knowing the right keywords.  \n\nI have been fighting chronic health issues for a long time now; and along the way I picked up being hypersensitive to environmental and food triggers.  \n\nI have different types of reactions from different types of triggers, and there appears to be multiple illnesses at play - including limbic system dysfunction, multiple chemical sensitivity, and MCAS.  \n\nI have the limbic and MCS ones somewhat understood/under control, and I have rescue supplements, preventative measures, or management techniques which get me through with these ones.  \n\nThe other type of reactions which persist, it took me a long time, but I believe the common thread between all my triggers are that they are all mildly antifungal in some way.  \n\nThis matches up with my practitioners view that I have had some unknown chronic mold or fungal exposure in the past, and paired with my genetically impaired detox pathways, just will not clear on it is own.  \n\nThis kind of makes sense - if there are small amounts of fungus taken residence in my cells, probably in my nose as much as anywhere else if I originally inhaled them, as well as any other issues.  \nAnyway - it makes sense, if I inhale anything antifungal, the fungus reactions by releasing it is own defensive chemicals, thereby causing my a reaction.  \n\nThe reaction is mainly neurological - I get a fight/flight mood response, then my brain feels scrambelled, I can no longer think clearly, and feel like I am 'under water'  \nThis takes a good amount of time to pass.  \n\nSo my question is this - does anyone have any inkling of what is going on here?  \nThere reason I ask is so I can find out how I can get relief from these attacks.   \n\nI have tried all the things you can do to try and quell an MCAS reaction, but they do not help.  \nIt appears this is more of a reaction to the toxins or defenses the fungus releases - and possibly MCAS at the same time.  \nIf I knew more about the nature of what goes on when a fungal infection triggers a neurological reaction, I could get a better idea of what I need to treat.  \n\nIs this part of the Cell Danger Response?  \n\nAnyone have any ideas? I know mold exposure and MCAS are highly intertwined.  \n\nIs there a better place for me to post this?  \n\nCheers! There is a kind of fallacy here. You are asking for information about what is happening \"physically/chemically\" regarding alternative theories for illness that only persist to exist  because no one can figure out what was happening \"physically/chemically.\"  As soon as someone solves those difficult problems, a new name will be created and no one will use those alterative theories anymore. If you have not already, I suggest to read TOXIC What??  \n\nIs this a long way of saying that there is no scientific consensus on how embedded in-vivo mold responds to threats?  \n\nI would have thought it was well understood what in-vivo mold does when activating it is defensive mechanisms in response to a threat. The same as what it does in-vitro.  \n\nAs for what those defensive mechanisms do to the host and how it is perceived, THAT I can believe is not in the collective scientific literature yet. Thanks Now you are begging the question. Oh, you are one of 'those' .  . Ad hominem I cannot address your position because you are not making it clear.  \nUse your words.  \n\nIn any event it is irrelevant to this post. My position is you are trying to solve a challenging problem with a combination of science and gobbledegook.  Then trying to defend the gobbledegook with arguments that defy logic.  Then trying to defend the  gobbledegook by attacking me personally.  I am trying to teach you something.  You are clearly motivated and intelligent.  You appear to need to learn the difference between theory base on a scientific method and theories that propagate from credulity. Right, now we are getting somewhere.  \n\nFirst of all; I am not defending anything. I asked for clarification on your initial reply because it was poorly worded and ambiguous.  \n\nYou have mentioned 'alternative theories' that 'no-one can figure out', and 'arguments that defy logic'  \n\nThese are ideas introduced to the post by you. They are not within the original post.  \n\nSo before we can discuss further, please clarify:  \n - What do you mean by 'Alternative Theory'\n - What theories do you believe are 'alternative'\n - What do you believe is science and what do you believe is 'gobbledygook'\n - What arguments 'defy logic'\n - What is it that cannot be figured out by anyone? Note this is distinct from *me* not knowing the mechanics of something.  \n\nFurther, you appear to have completely missed the point of the post, which is to seek information of any form that may lead to a discovery with regard to my symptoms and suspected mold toxicity.  \n\nPlease also note that many well known currently in use theories are 'gobbledygook' - they are well known to be wrong, but they aid in the quest to find ever more accurate theories. Examples: General Relativity (Gravity), Quantum Mechanics. Two of our best theories. One of them is definitely wrong. Possibly both.  \n\nFurther examples of how 'gobbledeygook' theories advance science and ultimately lead to further understanding and discovery: Phlogiston.  \nPhlogiston is without a doubt wrong and through todays eyes looks like laughable pseudoscience. But we would not have the theroy of chemistry we have now without phlogiston as part of the process that lead us to a better answer.  \n\nIn summary: There are no stupid questions in the pursuit of knowledge. You sound as though you want to provide input on what you believe are useful lines of inquiry contrasted to lines of inquiry you believe are not useful. Answer my points and I will help you convey that more clearly.  \n\nDo not bother rebutting any of the paragraphs in this message except for the points you already raised that require clarification as outlined in bullets above. Fine.\n\n*What is it physically/chemically that happens when you have a mold/fungal infection and it gets 'triggered'? I am saying what is it that the mold inside you does when it gets agitated and 'goes off'?*  \n\n\nThere is good evidence that people can develop a mystery illness in water damaged homes.  Mold grows in water damaged homes.  Mold can cause known illnesses.  Someone once theorized that mold is the origin of this mystery illness.  No one has presented a credible theory for how mold causes this illness.\n\nIf you force me to throw out my best wild guess as to what happens to these people.  Keeping in mind I have no real evidence to back any of this up.  Many microbes grow in these homes.  Not just mold.  The individual's immune system becomes activated for whatever reason - a virus, the adjuvant in a vaccine, an infection by one of the microbes in the damaged home.  It does not matter what activated the immune system. A vast and complicated sequence of immune activation and immune suppression take place, but not in a normal environment.  It takes place in an environment with lots of foreign proteins.  Then people continue to react to only one or two substances.  For most people, the reaction is to uncommon molecules and goes unnoticed.  For some, the reaction is to very common molecules and while it seems like they react to everything, that is not the case.  It is just one molecule, probably a protein, created by a ubiquitous and benign bacteria that follows them everywhere they go.\n\nThat, or there is a neurological limbic cell in a fight or flight from a danger response that has multiple mast histamines feeding on mold. You did not really answer the bullet points I listed.  \nYou kind of just repeated the parts of my post that I said I already understood (MCAS and limbic responses)  \nBut very well.  \n\nYou appear to be explaining general heightened immune response mediated by unknown factors, triggered by exposure to environmental stimulus for unknown reason.  \n\nThis is not what I am asking, and it is known how to deal with heightened immune response in terms of mitigating symptoms as best as possible.  \nThis is where common MCAS relief comes in.  I am not asking about this.  \n\nI am asking if there are known factors mold secretes as part of it is defensive response which is triggered when it detects a threat.  \n\n*IF* there is such a thing as fungal toxicity whereby one is *not* only suffering from immune response due to external mold spore exposure; but has active fungal infections living in-vivo, the supposition is that understanding what these fungi secrete into the host when exposed to stimuli would be a valid line of inquiry as to mitigating the symptoms caused.  \n\nMain point being; conjecture is that in-vivo fungal driven reactions are distinct from mast cell mediated immune reactions and neurologically driven limbic reactions, and therefore should be treated differently. The odds are against any illness working the way you say.\n\nI am not talking about a \"general heightened immune response.\"  I proposed the possibility your adaptive immune system learned to target a particular protein produced by an otherwise benign bacteria, but the reaction only happens under a particular set of conditions. And I have about as much proof as anyone else's ideas. Great. Good for you, but not what is being asked.  \nI suggest you reread the title of the post. I might try charcoal pills if the air purifier doesnt help. It comes monday Tried charcoal.  \nUnfortunately most activated charcoal is made from coconut husk because it is cheap.  \nThat includes pills, the filters in air purifiers, the filters used to filter bottled water, or filters in your home water filter.  \n\nI react terribly to even the tiniest amount of coconut. It is one of my strongest triggers. That, peppermint, and even cannabis/marijuana.  \nAll are shown to be quite strongly antifungal - which is a reach but again the best common link I can find between all my triggers.  \n\nIt could be that antifungals irritate fungus embedded in my nose, which then release mediators that cause an immune response; which over time has trained my nervious/limbic system to react to that substance directly.  \n\nAlso my sensitivity to the triggers is magnified by things that would seem to release trapped mycotoxins into my blood stream.  \nWeight(fat) loss, Glutathione, R-Lipoic-Acid.  \n\nGood luck. . .", "Relationship between MCAS and high BP? Anyone know of any research on this? In my experience, my BP drops and HR increases during a flare. High BP can be caused by stress (and having MCAD is STRESSFUL), so chronic hypertension could be related to the overall inflammatory process. Cardiac issues are common in Ehlers Danlos, which is known to co-occur with MCAD. I have to take daily beta-blockers to keep my pulse under control but they work great. As a bonus is really helps control the sweating and dizzyness i get from MCAD. That is interesting. I always thought I had low blood pressure because I often feel light headed, dizzy, and fatigued, but apparently my BP is high; I just did a tilt test for POTS and it was inconclusive, so it seems my symptoms could be purely cardiovascular manifestations of MCAS (mega bummer). My doctor prescribed life style changes as I cannot take beta blockers because they interfere with epinephrine (natural and auto injected) and I have anaphylaxis. Also, my sister in law is a PA in emergency medicine and she think my BP is relatively normal. I keep getting conflicting information and nothing seems to fit. Good ole MCAS. I worked in a mental health, but have taken probably 500+ sets of vitals. Around or just above 130/40 we often attributed it to \"white coat anxiety\" or other situational factors before treating them for HT.\n\nMCAD is a crazy condition - I have been in treatment for 5 years and I am still learning new things. I have a POTS diagnosis (and get anaphylaxis if I do not take cromolyn) so my physician was more worried about me dying suddenly from cardiac issues than MCAD. Lots of personal factors to take into consideration. The symptoms are so vauge it can be really frustrating not knowing what causes what - best of luck dealing with it all! I hear ya! It is definitely an idiographic disease - each person requires a tailored treatment protocol. Thanks for your reply and well wishes! I do not know about anyone else, but mine has always been on the low side. Last year I had a flare for a few weeks and it was high, then it went back down. Right! I always thought mine was low but my discomfort seems to be due to high bp. Several other docs thought I had POTS but my did not reveal anything. I was about to suggest POTS as I have both and I had a similar issue. Bought a blood pressure monitor because I thought I was getting low blood pressure episodes and that is what led me to find out about POTS. Have you tested at home? My BP in a chair is 120/80 but lying down it is 90/60. My HR and BP are super sensitive to stress, particularly cortisol so my days go up and down depending on a lot of factors so home testing has been vital. That weird feeling I get when I am brushing my teeth, that is my HR hitting 150bpm. I have got certain triggers that would not necessarily show up on a TTT so I would recommend more investigations if it does not seem quite right to you. I bought a monitor and I have been evaluating my bp at three different intervals over the course of the day (1 week into this pattern). All of my mine have been consistently in \u201celevated\u201d ranges (according to the AHS) but my SIL says the readings are normal. I took it again a little while ago and it ranged from 109-114 (I took three readings with 1 minute in between to be sure). That is the lowest it is been in a week. So strange.  I have not tried testing it while laying down, though so I will have to see if there are differences. \n\nMy cardiologist just called and said I have to take a blood test soon, too. I have POTS, normal bp with high pulse. Still after some flares i get high bp and take pressure meds for some period When I had my tilt table test my blood pressure and heart rate were both rising and falling all over the place, They were very erratic. I had accidentally eaten something I would reacted to not long before the test... So I think my results were reflective of that. \n\nAside from TTT I can get only blood pressure cuff readings. My most recent two, a few months apart have been a bit high. Today's came back as mild hypertension. But it is hard to know what really goes on. Probably have just been drinking too much salt. Sorry, these illnesses are complicated. They do different things to different people. Yeah, the TTT is an old test and I am not sure how sensitive it to pre-test conditions. I usually only have hypertension during anaphylaxis. The first few days with my cuff showed some elevated bp but after a week or so of consistir to testing my bp is completely normal. I think, in my case, my doctors may be looking for something that is not there. I think I may just be developing cardiovascular symptoms of MCAS rather than a new disease state. These are very complicated disorders, for sure.", "What were your initial symptoms? How did your mcas start and present itself initially? How has it changed? \nFor me I am not diagnosed and I have had an allergist tell me he does not think I have it, but I am still not completely convinced because I am feeling things that I at least think line up with some of the symptoms. Everyone around me is basically telling me it is all in my head though. My allergist/immunologist knows what the condition is and told me that he could test me for it, but he thinks it would be a waste of my money. I cannot help but feel scared about potentially having this condition though and do not really know what to do. Technically I guess I could go back to severe flushing with exercise and weird unexplained allergy symptoms as a kid.... \n\nBut I would say my symptoms started with GI and learning about high histamine foods and low histamine diets. I had already eliminated all high histamine foods except for tomato and vinegar before I knew about histamine levels in food. Eliminated tomato and vinegar and started getting better. For a little while. (I can eat tomato now, carefully.) What are your symptoms? The problem is, MCAS and a lot of other chronic immune disorders present themselves initially with really similar symptoms. It honestly can take a lot of testing, symptoms tracking and trying out different medications and an elimination diet to find out what you have. As well, take a handful of MCAS patients and their main problems can be very different from each other, because Mast Cells can activate almost anywhere in the body and cause issues there.\n\nBut yeah, it is almost definitely not in your head. Listen to your gut and if something feels wrong, keep pursuing it. But do not be too determined to pursue MCAS, keep in mind any other potential causes and try and follow up on any leads you might have. Get as many tests as you can afford and follow up and ask questions about any abnormal test results. Also doctors- younger doctors are more motivated to help strange cases. Older ones (except research doctors) tend to be less helpful.\n\nFor me, it started out with fatigue that never went away no matter how much I slept. And IBS like symptoms, plus chronic nausea and motion sickness. It was all pretty mild at first, and when I went to doctors, they also dismissed that there was anything wrong with me. I had a ton of symptoms I overlooked but anxiety is the one that got me diagnosed.\n\nSymptoms I have had since I was a kid but I thought were other things:\n\nChronic diarrhea \n\nChronic Migraines\n\nHives\n\nRashes\n\nChemical/medicine allergies and intolerances\n\nDermatogaphia (mild)\n\nFood sensitivities \n\nChronic blepharitis Is this generally a condition you have from childhood? Is this a condition that people generally have from childhood? Coma. Had a reaction to baby formula. Had another one. When I was about 7 I passed out from swimming in cold water. Spent the rest of the summer in bed. Still have the cold water problem. Cannot let cold water get on my head.\n\nAs an adult it was multiple episodes of anaphylaxis. Multiple ER visits. Geographic tongue. Dermatographia. Bunch of other things went along with it. Dozens of food allergies. Multiple drug allergies. Chemical sensitivities. Brain fog, fatigue, anxiety. Getting sick easily. I have no idea. I have got a few variables for my health problems. I believe I had it from childhood, but it was quite mild until five years ago. I always had itching, IBS, fatigue and muscle pain. I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. The change was migraines and heart palpitations, and dysautonomia. It seems to be hit or miss on who you ask. I never realized anything was wrong as a kid. I also did not FEEL bad like I do now. The worst symptom was migraines. \n\nSome people do not notice things until they are in their late 20s or 30s. Better tell your symptoms. MCAS is so diverse, there is a lot of symptoms some people have and others not. &gt;Is this a condition that people generally have from childhood?\n\nYes, it is proven. It is genetic condition with the medium onset of symptoms at 25. Everyone had symptoms from the childhood. It is in your head for sure. Inflammation affects your brain, that is why we have no energy when sick I have been going through hell to get diagnosed and struggling with symptoms so badly. Mild most of life but now out of control. Only got two tests done during times that I did not feel triggered and he basically just gave up after they came back looking normal. Give this a read it is very eye opening and might give you some idea what is going on and how to bring it up to your doctor again. \n\n\n\n\nThis right here really caught my eye because my tyrptase levels came back normal \n\n\u201cMCAS is a diagnosis of exclusion, with primary and secondary mast cell activation disorders (see Box 2) as well as idiopathic anaphylaxis usually being ruled out before a diagnosis of MCAS is made (Picard M. et al 2013). It is, therefore, quite common for patients to have undergone multiple extensive medical evaluations to rule out all other causes before finally being given a diagnosis (Akin C. et al 2010).\nUnlike rarer, but perhaps better known MCADs such as SM, tests carried out on those with MCAS do not show classic tell tale signs of mast cell proliferation and rarely show the \u2018significantly\u2019 elevated tryptase levels that would traditionally alert most practitioners that they might be dealing with a more widely recognised mast cell activation disorder. Instead, tests are likely to show a normal number of mast cells and only a transient rise (or in some cases, normal levels) of tryptase despite all the physical symptoms of mast cell activation being very much apparent (Afrin L. 2014 / Seneviratne S. et al 2017).\nAccording to Dr Andrew White, in these patients we need to look for other clues that their mast cells are not functioning normally. He says: \u2018There are many different chemicals that come out of mast cells which can be measured.\u201d Everyone has common symptoms and rare depending on you since there are different variations of MCAS. If you tell us your symptoms we can probably point you in a better direction as to why your doctor says you do not have it. From there you can get answers and figure out if your doctor is knowledgeable \n\nMCAS has non invasive tests, I do not see why someone would call it a waste of money, it is measures your pgd2 levels in your urine. That seems strange especially if you have symptoms. You either show clear signs of not having it or your doctor is not familiar enough with the disease as it can be mild for some time until it gets worse Cold water reactions here too! They did not start until about a year ago though and before that I swam all the time with no problem. Now I even get them from washing dishes with cold water or having skin exposed to cold rain. This particular symptom was so mysterious.\n\nOP, as a kid I would pass out/vomit during intense exercise, flush easily, often feel faint/lightheaded, have reactions to common medicine and get mysterious rashes plus I had bad anxiety. All dismissed at the time as me being \"dramatic.\" Still had all that through adulthood, but in the last 3 years I started having neuropathy in my hands and feet, anaphylaxis from cold water and high histamine food, major brain fog, fluttery heartbeat, chest pain and a major feeling of pressure/swelling in my liver area. I had exposure to toxic mold about 10 years ago and again about two years ago, but my dad also has a rare blood disorder I still need to be tested for to see if it is systemic mastocytosis. The cold water thing happened to me back in 1962? Nobody knew what it was. It was theorized that I was allergic to chlorine. Then in my 20s I found out about cold angiodema, which they can test for by taping an ice cube to your forearm. Basically an allergic reaction to cold. And there is this  Is this a recent study? I have not read much in the last 3 years. I have got a whole book on MCAS that says nothing about it but it was published 5? Years ago. yes, both 2020", "ISO recommendations for MCAS specialist in/near Cincinnati, Ohio? So far I have just been passed off to dr after dr. Getting frustrated and depressed after living with this for years.  Geesh, that looks miserable!\nI found my MCAS specialist by looking an EDS specialist, since it is a common comorbid condition. Maybe you will have such luck?\n\nYou can also call allergists in your area, many are aware of MCAS. Have you been to the Mayo Clinic ? \n\nAlso try anti fungi shampoo. I will check that out, thank you I have not tried Mayo Clinic but it might be my next stop. The rashes usually go away if I take Benadryl but as soon as that wears off it comes right back. Thank you Does it spread ? \nHave they checked you for parasites? It does spread and cover my whole body in these giant welts that itch so badly I could cut my arm off. The rash does go  away for periods of time and if I take high doses of Benadryl. I have not been checked for parasites, is there anything in particular that you think I should ask my doctor about? We have got a member-submitted doctor list in the FB group Mast Cell \"Activation\" Disorders Forum, and there are some Cincinnati doctors listed.  It is been updated this year. That is perfect thank you so much. I have been to a PCP, dermatologist, endocrinologist, ENT, urologist, nephrologist, and an allergy/immunologist and I have an appointment with a rheumatologist. I just keep getting passed around and I am mentally and physically exhausted. Not a doctor - if these are your primary symptoms has anyone checked you for chronic uticaria or brought up Xolair? Might be worth looking into. I was getting past around and then I got a primary care dr. I found going to the specialist and then discussing with my primary again made it her responsibility again plus I got her opinion on everything. Find an immunologist. \n\nETA: I see you have been to one. With chronic uticaria, they should be able to test and treat. Weird they brushed you off. Id find a second opinion Mastcelldisease.com has a user submitted database with docs and reviews. **I found links in your comment that were not hyperlinked:**\n\n* (\n\n*I did the honors for you.*\n\n***\n\n^( ^| ^( ^| ^&lt;3 Yes, I am diagnosed with idiopathic chronic urticaria. I also have a million other symptoms such as daily chronic nausea, headaches, diarrhea, chest tightness, brain fog, chronic kidney disease, etc. that suggest a more systemic illness but my docs keep brushing me off. I did mention xolair to my dermatologist but she suggested that I just take more benadryl. I am taking around 150mg benadryl, loratadine 10mg and famotidine 10mg daily already. This regimen helps but I am still having symptoms. I am going to a different dr on Tuesday specifically to see if they will finally try xolair. Thank you for your input. What specialty was the specialist that you saw? So far I have seen a dermatologist, endocrinologist and an allergy/immunologist. I do like my PCP a lot but she doesnt feel comfortable diagnosing this type of thing. Thank you for your reply. My tryptase was elevated so I am not sure why they do not think that MCAS is the diagnosis, given all of my other symptoms. The last time I went to the immunologist was 2 years ago and I got very discouraged so I have just been suffering since then but something has got to give. I have an appt Tuesday with the same group but a different provider so we will see. Thank you for your reply. I will check that out, thank you very much. Jeezy by the time I was diagnosed I had a specialist in every area and still no primary. My specialist in order of when I got them gastroenterology, allergist/immunologist, dermatologist, cardiologist, hematologist/oncologist, endocrinologist, and neurologist. How i got a diagnosis was my allergist recommended I be evaluated by a mast cell expert so I fkew to NY for an MCAS diagnosis. After that, neurologist and cardiologist diagnosed me with IST and POTS. I still see my specialist but I bring all of their suggestions to my primary to discuss. Ive transfered all my prescriptions to my primary too. You have to find a good primary for this to work though. Wow! Did any of your doctors mention MCAS before you went to New York? I do not know where you were flying from but having to fly to NY just to see a specialist is unbelievable. That is a shame. I definitely have POTS but by the time I get to my dr I have so many other symptoms that I want to discuss that I always forget to tell them about the almost passing out when I stand up. So frustrating! Was your tryptase ever elevated prior to seeing the specialist? My was, and the immunologist said it was not important. From my understanding that is a main diagnostic criterion for MCAS (albeit according to Dr. Google). I hear ya - definitely sounds like you need new doctors. Sure :) my specialist in NY is great if you ever wanted to travel Yeah I had 3 local drs that said it sounded like MCAS or mastocytosis. I have normal tryptase though so each one of them ran that one test and said they ruled it out. When I lost all tolerance for food though it became pretty obvious to my drs that we needed to investigate the possibility of MCAS again. The specialist in NY was very confident I had it and ran a ton of different mast cell mediator tests and I was elevated on 3 mediators. For tryptase, you have to measure in and out of a flare for it to be helpful in diagnosis I believe. I had 3 mediators show up elevated not in a flare so tryptase in a flare was not needed for my diagnosis. I personally am curious what it would be though in a flare. Interesting information thank you I pray it does not come to that but I will keep it in mind, thank you No problem :) Wow. How are they not diagnosing you? That Is the holy grail test for mcas haha Especially an allergy/immunologist MD. To be fair, when I saw him the rashes were so bad and covering my whole body so I did not really mention the other symptoms, but he never asked either. Basically every dr I have seen thought I had lupus but once ANA came back negative they would just say \u201csome people just get rashes\u201d and ignore the other symptoms. I think it is your diet, if it goes away &amp; comes back. \nI did not get that bad, but tomato\u2019s &amp; onions in any form will do this to me. I will get a rash from head to toe. It took me over a year to figure it out. \n\nHave you gone on a hospital diet? I had to for a month to get everything under control. \nI also use dry white stick deodorant &amp; rubbing alcohol to dry it out. \n\nI would make a list of every thing you eat or drink. \nGo down to a rice diet with no process foods or ready made stuff. \n\nMy allergies keep growing. My list\nOnions, garlic, tomato, cilantro, any hot pepper at all, \nblack pepper. Red pepper flakes. \nAlso meds morphing, cipro, all steroid injections, some anabiotic\u2019s. \nThe meds &amp; onions send me into anaphylactic shock. \n\nOnions, black pepper &amp; garlic are in a lot of things. In many forms, so you have to read lots. \nI cannot even smell onions, cannot tomato juice or will rash out. \n\nI am sending my info to Mayo Clinic in Cleveland.\nI need to be checked for fluoroquinolone toxicity syndrome, this changes your dna. My own research led me to Dr. Alice Prescott Sullivan, at the Cleveland Clinic. I did not end up seeing her, due to them not recognizing my out of state insurance, but her bio states she specializes in patients with chronic illness, especially those without a clear diagnosis, and those who cannot tolerate conventional treatment options.\u00a0 She has particular interest in chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, chronic infection, mast cell activation syndrome, and multiple-chemical sensitivity. Thank you Late to the party, but did you find anyone? I am in the same state as you, but a few hours a way. I can send you my doctor\u2019s name if you have not had luck Well, since I posted I saw an allergist/immunologist who said he does not treat mast cell problems so I was referred to a hematologist. My PCP sent me to a rheumatologist to make sure it was not lupus, he recommended a different allergist. So, $200 and 4 lab sticks later I am still in limbo. I will take a name if you have a good one, thank you. Oh gosh, that looks frustrating. My rashes get pretty bad but this looks rough. Hoping you find the help that you need! I changed jobs and it got much better. My old job had a bad mold problem so that had to have something to do with it. I cannot figure anything else out. Thank you!", "Magnesium supliment Can anyone advise which magnesium is the least likely to cause issues? I have already wasted money on vit c and calcium supplements that I was unable to tolerate. I am not sure if I would be best going with magnesium glycinate, malate or citrate. magnesium often packed with some allergogenic substance. google for it, i do not remember, its ok for me I used to react to plain baking soda. There is no telling what you will react to. And even if you do not react now you may later.\n\nBest thing is to get an unflavored powder that does not have any binders or fillers. Now this is citrate, you might not tolerate the acidity.   Here is another one \n\nHere is a glycinate \n\nHere is malate \n\n I do not think it matters what form it is as long as it is not magnesium oxide, which is hard to absorb.

I need immunity!\n\nThanks in advance if you can supply any info or links about expert thoughts on this. I could be wrong, but I do not think stabilizers work like that. They are not immunosuppressive. They just strengthen the mast cells themselves so they do not leak out histamine. \n\nI would not worry about it but I am not a doctor, so wait and see what others say as well. Ask your doctor, but my understanding is that mast cells are part of innate immunity, not adaptive immunity. Adaptive immunity is what vaccinations activate. my son\u2019s immunologist said okay to take his meds like normal (he takes cromolyn for mast cell stabilization). she said do not add additional antihistamines, such as benadryl, right beforehand, bc that could delay an allergic reaction &amp; she would prefer him have an allergic reaction when we are around medical professionals...but the mast cell stabilizers will not interfere with immune response. Edit TLDR: If a medication could stop a vaccine from teaching the body an immune response.  Then, the medication would probably prevent the immune system from responding to viruses too. \n\nI do not know of any study that shows these medication interfere with vaccines.  If you look at the function of the medications and the vaccines, you will see that they do not really interact with the same parts of the immune system except for one small overlap.\n\nThe vaccine is going to teach the body to make immunoglobulins that bind to a specific protein that exists on the surface of the COVID-19 virus.  This will train the immune system to attack COVID-19 viruses the moment they enter the body, and before they can harm the host.\n\nThe best COVID vaccines are mRNA vaccines.  In an mRNA vaccine, messenger RNA is injected into the upper arm.  The RNA enters cells.  The cells use the RNA to make fragments of protein.  The cells break down the mRNA and the fragments of protein leave the cell and sit on the surface of the cell.  The mRNA was designed such that the protein manufactured inside the cell is the same protein we want the immune system to target in the COVID-19 virus. The immune system then begins constructing the immunoglobulins that target the protein.  White blood cells (b cells) manufacture these immunoglobulins (also known as antibodies).  This process involves the construction of the tip of a y-shaped molecule such that the tip will bind to the target protein.\n\nMast cells live in connective tissue and are full of histamine, heparin, serotonin, and other signaling molecules.  When certain substances bind to the receptors on mast cells, the mast cells release these signaling molecules.  Releasing these molecules (particularly histamine) causes a local activation of the immune response near the mast cell.\n\nKetotifen is an antihistamine and a mast cell stabilizer.  As an anti-histamine, it will block histamine receptors.  As a mast cell stabilizer, it will block the receptors on the surface of mast cells that cause mast cells to activate and release those signaling molecules (histamine, serotonin, typtase, etc.)\n\nCromolyn has similar function to Ketotifen.\n\nQuercetin has a half life in the body of an hour.  If you stop it for a day, it is pretty much gone from the body.  There is debate about if it does anything therapeutic anyway.\n\nSo, the possible overlap between your meds and the vaccine I mentioned above involves recognizing that the protein constructed from the mRNA is a foreign invader.  Typically, an Adjuvant is mixed with a vaccine to make this happen.  The Adjuvant is a molecule that stimulates an immune response.  There has to be an immune response for the immune system to look for the foreign protein and begin construction on those tips for the y-shaped immunoglobulins.  In the old days, these adjuvants were metallic salts like aluminum phosphate.  The aluminum salts stimulated release of interleukins which went on to stimulate the immune response to the protein injected along with the aluminium salts. Back then the vaccine would have been made from the adjuvant and dead or dormant viruses like the polio virus instead of the mRNA we are using in the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.  Modern vaccines often have proprietary adjuvants.  I really do not know what mechanism the vaccine is using to stimulate the immune system.  However, if a medication could stop a vaccine from developing an immune response, then the medication would stop the immune system from developing an immune response to potentially every virus.\n\nIf a medication could actually interfere with the initial immune response caused by the adjuvant, then the immune system may never learn to attack the protein constructed from the mRNA.  Then there would be no immunity to COVID.  However, that is unlikely.  Also, you will know on the second injection.  Your arm will swell a little more than the first shot.  That swelling is the immunity that was developed on the first shot sending blood to your arm in an immune response. I do not get why this post is being down voted. It is a good question and has generated some useful answers. !RemindMe 30 days I will be messaging you in 1 month on ( to remind you of (\n\n( to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.\n\n^(Parent commenter can ) (\n\n*****\n\n|(\n|-|-|-|-| This is a new concept to me, and I am learning. Would someone having an immediate negative reaction to a vaccine be an example of an innate immunity response, as opposed to the adaptive immunity built via the antibodies that develop in response to a vaccine? Exactly. Innate immunity is \u201coh shit, do something now!\u201d and it is indiscriminate. Adaptive immunity takes several days to develop and is targeted to specific pathogens.", "Anyone recovered?  Has anyone recovered from MCAS and get to normal life?\n\n\"Recover\" means able to eat whatever you want including pasta, burger, pizza, bread, instant foods, processed foods, alcohol, cigarettes..everything known as 'bad'.\n\nI do not want to hear \" I am refraining from bad food for my health.\" or \"Eating healthy food is good for your health.\" I want to eat delicious but not good for body foods just like I did before this shit.\n\nI have never been a vegan in the past and I will never be in the future, but all I am able to eat right now is only rice, fish, tofu, lettuce and some vegetables. It is horrible that I might have to live like this forever. Are you on Cromolyn at all? Some people are allergic to it. I am aware. Just started taking it, was warned. I live in Korea and I am struggling to find allergist who are aware of MCAS and can prescribe antihistamine, ketotifen and cromolyn. Maybe an immunologist? Or is that the same thing? The specialist I have, is actually a POTS specialist. The conditions are so frequently comorbid, that he really treats both.  What do you mean I sound like a jerk?  I do not know why that paragraph sounds like a jerk.\nDoes that offend you? What is the problem? I also have POTS!! I did not know that these are comorbid. \nI have an appointment with allergist next week and I hope that appt is helpful :(\nBtw, thanks! My specialist thinks I probably have mild POTS that did not show up during testing, so I asked what type of doctor I needed for MCAS. He said typically an immunologist, however he could not recommend any because most do not know enough about it. So, he is my specialist. I went on an elimination diet and was able to reintroduce a lot of foods and figure out what my triggers are. \n\nYes there is a lot I cannot eat but there is also a lot I can eat. \n\nI would suggest trying some foods you want back in your diet and see how you respond to them. \n\nTreatment also helps a lot Fwiw, soy is one of my biggest food triggers. All legumes actually (peanuts, peas, soy, lentils, beans).\n\nI was vegan for a time before this, but had to start eating meat again when I realized meat (fresh cooked, not processed/ground/preserved) is the only safe protein source o can tolerate. If you have not already, I would try adding chicken to your diet for a week or two then removing soy, and see if you feel better.\n\nAdditionally, when you eat foods that trigger your mast cells, it causes them to be more reactive for the next couple days as well. So if there is something in your diet rn that is not safe to eat, it could be making other borderline foods unsafe as well.\n\nI have a mild-moderate case of MCAS. Definitely not recovered by any definition. But, of the foods you listed as \"bad\", I can have gluten (pizza, bread, pasta) as much as I want and burgers and processed foods occasionally (maybe once or twice a week). I can have alcohol (except beer) a few times a week as well, even up to 3 or so drinks each time. But it is because I stay careful with my other foods. I cannot have a burger two days in a row and then lunch meat the next two days without feeling like shit. Honestly so much of the time you ask a question on reddit and you get useless answers that tell you what you already know/stated in the post, or contradicting what you asked for in the first place. If OP had not said that, they probably would have gotten a bunch of people telling them to just 'eat healthy' and that you can never go back to normal. Which they probably hear all the time and do not need to hear more of, when you are looking for some hope that people with mcas can gain any semblance of normal again. Sometimes you just got to be direct and honest with the type of information you are looking for and it does not make you a jerk!\n\nediting to say that, of course, sometimes you have to hear things that you do not want to hear, like the fact that most of us probably cannot eat normally again. maybe it is reality. but there is nothing wrong with looking to hear from people who have been successful at returning to normal food. I am not in an active flare, so other than my \u201ctrue\u201d allergies I am eating freely. But, flares happen, and when they do I am back to low-fodmap elimination diets again. I would like to add that, for all people looking at this comment, I know multiple people (some personally, some online) who have had severe mcas symptoms, and recovered to the point where they can eat whatever they want. \n\nI am not saying you can 100%, but it is certainly possible. My cousin told me that once she went through menopause, she no longer had MCAS. When I asked my immunologist if that could be true, he said, \"Anything is possible.\" \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude44", "LED / Flickering light as an MCAS trigger Hi all,\n\nI had a period of time where I was much more sensitive than I am lately; and during that time for reasons I will not go into, I had the thought that something that was contributing to my sensitive and even outright triggers was the lights in my bedroom (low ceiling, LED downlights)\n\nI did some research and found out the LED light revolution has been terrible for some people. Most other light technologies (Incandescent, Halogen) have warm-up and cool-down time - when power is supplied, they take time to get bright, and when you cut power, they take time to go out.  \nThis is advantageous because since we use AC power, the power is effectively being cut at 50 or 60 times per second - so these types of lights tend to smooth that out.\n\nHowever, LED lights do not suffer from this 'inertia' - meaning a badly powered LED light will actually turn on/off instantly - leading to a real flicker 50 or 60 times per second - like a strobe light.  \nThis is invisible to the conscious eye - but some cameras can see it.\n\nSo anyway, I replaced my LED's with Halogens, and have not had a problem since - until today.  \nI convinced myself that my entire LED theory was crackpot, because I wanted to buy some smart bulbs that I could connect to with my phone and dim.\n\nBoy was I wrong. I have already removed them as they triggered me nearly instantly.\n\nI found this article with someone else thinking the same thing:  ( \n\nIt does seem plausible to me - epilepsy already tells us that light information, ESPECIALLY strobing, can affect brain systems in novel ways.\n\nAnyone else have any similar experiences? My experience was not with LEDs and probably did not involve mast cells, but I am a gentle person and I went through a week where I was nearly insane with rage. It turned out that it was because of the new SAD lamp I would started using. That thing got yeeted right quick.\n\nThat lamp used a compact fluorescent bulb. CFLs usually flicker thousands of times a second. Old school fluorescents usually flickered at 120Hz. Some LEDs do not flicker at all, but the designers can actually choose what rate they want them to flicker at for various reasons. Dimmable LEDs are dimmed by flickering them at whatever rate is required to produce the desired dimness. Hi,\nI have a sunbox. Have not had the same issue with it as the LED's\nI had not realised the only way to dim an LED was by duty cycling it. That is troublesome. They need to make clear this type of info on packaging, as it is really difficult for a consumer to measure it themself.\nI imagine if I get LED's with high enough refresh rates I will be fine - but I have no way to know which is which. I am sensitive to LED flicker but it does not trigger MCAS for me. It is more like how I am sensitive to dogs barking or loud construction noises. It is disturbing and I cannot tune it out or focus. My mom is the same. It took me awhile to find the right bulbs and fixtures for me. Halogens bulbs caused migraines for me as a kid. I hate bright lights. Store lights, gym lights. Causes me to feel sick. Oh man I thought I was nuts for so long with the flickering light thing. I have MCAD but I am unclear if it is directly linked. I just know I feel bad when around flickering light. Strobe lights and the sun flashing between trees or buildings when driving is bad I have to close my eyes and not look (obviously when someone else is driving). Fluorescent lights have always made me feel bad too, not sure if they flicker at high speed but they are on the list.\n\nEdit: should say I do not like to look at led light either but never noticed a big impact on me, I will watch for this now. Thanks for the post! I always had problems with the old style fluorescents at work, they flicker at about 50-60 Hz. And back then we had CRT monitors. My fix was to turn the refresh speed on the monitor to 70 or more. You can do that with flat screens as well. Assuming your model of monitor supports it. Not all do. Mine only supports 59 and 60.\n\nI do not know what OS you are running, but this is for Windows 10  You actually have to go one level deeper than the article says. \n\nOtherwise use your google-fu to find \"monitor refresh settings\" for your OS.\n\nEventually we went to high speed fluorescents (kiloherz) and I was much happier. Hey thanks for chiming in.\nI doubt my monitor will go up beyond 60Hz - but I agree having both the flickering sources compounds its effect.\n\nI have gone back to halogens, but I wanted the LED's so I could crank the brightness up and down during day and night.\nIts just a pain that there is no clear standard process for LED lighting to slow it is flicker index on packaging.", "I have created a new subreddit for mast cell diseases. Please feel free to come here to talk about mast cell issues when I get time I will be stickying a bunch of informational links for help.", "How important do you find diet to be? I am trying painstakingly to track my flares back to food, but sometimes it can be something completely different. Medication has also gone a long way towards helping me avoid flares. I just wonder if the added stress of fretting over my diet is more harmful than helpful I do not eat low histamine because it did not help. There are some foods I absolutely cannot eat, like soy and corn.  If I eat those, I will have an anaphylactic reaction.   I have been able to add a few foods back since I started xolair, and others do not affect me as severely as they used to. For example, peanuts used to cause anaphylaxis, but now I just get blisters in my mouth and a rash on my ass.  \n\nI think it is important to keep eating as many foods as you can. what are you flares like? what symptoms? I eat nose to tail carnivore diet and have eliminated all potential triggers. It is very hard to track because my reaction to food is dependent on sooo many other circumstances. It is not only food that can fill your histamine bucket. Sometimes it is food that puts me over the top, other times not but I can say it is always a contributor for me. If other things are under control like other triggers, the POTS and EDS then I can tolerate more dairy and enjoy being more lax with the diet.\n\nEdit: what I mean to say is I do not always react the same to the same foods. Doctor told me that is common with mcad. How do you track food symptoms of they change lol? I still cannot imagine trying to record all of everything that goes on in my life to try and see patterns.  Too many variables. Given that I had dozens of food allergies at one point, super critical. \n\nBut they do not follow histamine levels. Plenty of high histamine foods that do not bother me, plenty of low histamine that are bad for me. This is where I am at too. I have a lot of low histamine foods I cannot have and must avoid. Key to survive Diet makes the difference for me between being mostly functional-ish and spending life in a confused fever dream.\n\nEating the wrong food or drinking a bunch of alcohol can trigger a week or two of flu-like symptoms. Doing it repeatedly can put me into a dementia-like fog.\n\nIt is not the only thing that causes symptoms. But hoo boy can it be important. I can eat plenty of low histamine foods just fine. I react very quickly to my food triggers though which helped with identifying potential triggers though they did require some digging to figure out what was problematic. For example, I thought I was reacting to gluten but it was actually yeast (and the wine in the pasta sauce!). If anything, the low histamine diet was helpful as a starting point to consider what was causing issues. Turns out I react to leftover meat, yeast (which includes some really random stuff), grapes (probably a yeast thing), soy, alcohol, raw citrus and two specific food dyes. So a good number if theses things are listed in the low histamine diet and also common triggers. So while I never followed the diet, it was helpful in terms of finding my food triggers which in turn has helped reduce reactions. My reactions to those problem items have gotten more serious over time as well as they not only cause GI issues (abdominal swelling and diarrhea) and skin issues (flushing and spots), but I am now getting shortness of breath. Hi now getting shortness of breath, I am Dad\ud83d\udc68 I react most to fructans and histamines and lectins to some extent. I used to have major all-system reactions, but I am on quercetin Zyrtec Tagamet DAO enzymes and singulair and can avoid reactions.

I do still feel like my mental health Plummets when I get more lax with my diet, but severe restriction is not great either.\n\nI am trying to train my brain to understand that it is not all or nothing, but my doc thought it was celiac for a while so I am going from that mentality to picking and choosing when it is the right time to be a bit more lax.

I think it is normal to have high histamine for IC? Interstitial cystitis is very common in mast cell patients, and mast cell dysregulation is one of several proposed causes for it. Do you have other non-urinary symptoms that lead you to believe mast cells are involved? Yeah. Eating triggers mucus down my throat sometimes. My skin is filled with histamine according to my other allergist, hot showers make wrists and ankles turn hideous red. Nose is always running. And there is some other stuff.  Not allergic to anything. Lots of chemical sensitivities. I have a normal tryptase too. MCD could be part of your equation, but hose are not the only measure to consider. Have you looked at PGFs or leukotrienes? I had slightly elevated histamine in urine but my PGF and LT4 were nearly triple what they should have been.\n\n Sorry to hear.\n\nNo one online is going to be able to tell you whether you have any particular illness. But, my personal feeling is that I would not worry that mast cell involvement is likely to be ruled out solely based on the presence of IC. Thank you. That was my main worry. I do not think these were ran.", "Does anyone have serious environmental issues? Part of my MCAS is environmental issues, if i go into a really old building or a thrift store I will get sick very quick and will get the feeling of my throat closing up. Yes you have multiple chemical sensitivities And a Mold sensitivities. Quiet normal with mast cell. Yea it is rough. I just started on xolair 5 weeks ago im really hoping that calms my body down and starts helping with environmental sensitivity's. All that. The detergent aisle at the store is off limits for me. \n\nThe homes, cars, and businesses of people who use perfumes, scented laundry products and air fresheners as well. \n\nI am so grateful to be able to buy cleaning products on Amazon! Yes. The list of what I am not allergic to is shorter. It is like 2 things.", "What can I do without doctors help I have a great doctor but she is not an expert, I cannot see her often and the stuff she last prescribed will not be stocked in my country til March. The local hospital is a joke and can be counted on for nothing but ridicule.\n\nI meet the clinical criteria for MCAS but no official diagnosis. \n\nI have had some really scary anaphylactic events in the last two weeks.\n\nI am scared to take epipen because the one time I had it, it triggered my first massive seizure and I cannot risk smashing my head like that. \n\nI have some out of date prednisone, some benzos, h1/h2 antagonists...I am looking at quercetin, vit C, Vit D3 but I do not know how to put it all together.\n \nI am on waitlists to more wait lists but what I need is to survive now.\n\nIf anyone's got any suggestions I would greatly appreciate it, and if anyone can point out contraindications...\n\nAny advice would be awesome And benedryl? cetirezine Quercetin, zyrtec, Zantac, avoid high histamine foods (alcohol, chocolate, fermented foods) Be careful with the benzos, some people MCAS gets worse when taken daily. I take 2x a week. Do not drink while on them, do not drink anyways since that is a massive mast cell degranulator. \n\nBlock prostaglandins with aspirin if you tolerate, or another nsaid. Some take lowest dose, some take 300mg morning and night. \n\n Optipea is another supplement that changed my life, it is an otc stabilizer. Umbrellux dao can help if you take before eating food, breaks down histamine. Ashwagandha powder is another gaba mimetic if you run out of benzos and is safer to take daily with similar effect, buy one that is more withanolides. Ketotifen can be purchased otc from japan let me know if you want the website, it is one of the main stabilizers. Only if necessary. It should not be regularly. It is a first generation H1 antihistamine. You want to go more for the next generations. It might be better to have a daily antihistamine from gen 2. Like loratadine. If you have had anaphylaxis I would definitely keep benadryl on hand. Every time I have been treated for anaphylaxis I am given benadryl and zantac along with the epipens.   I carry childrens liquid benadryl with me because it is faster acting for me than pills. When I have severe mast cell flares I will take benadryl along with zantac, and zyrtec. There is some good treatment info here:  ( This is so, so, so exactly what I was looking for. \n\nThank you very, very, very much!! Thank you this is great advice. I am scared of benzos! That is all doctors tried to shove at me for ages while they tried to fob me off as anxious freak. It helps to hear how you take them sensibly. Last thing I need is a benzo habit. \n\nThanks for the OTC advice, I am going to look into all of that. I was not aware ashwagandha had those properties. \n\nThe Japanese chemist! Yes please, I would love that link...I had it saved in my old bookmarks but that computer died and seemingly erased my memory of it. \n\nThanks very much for taking the time for me. Thank you, I am already on zyrtec/zantac but am going to try Quertecin too. \n\nI am mourning chocolate and vinegar but they can prize my whiskey from my cold dead hands! No problem. Haha a 100% low histamine diet is VERY difficult to follow so I feel you. We cannot be perfect.If whiskey is more enjoyable to you than symptom-producing then carry on, friend. I was doing the same with red wine until just one glass would make me vomit...I am mourning that one for sure :( Yeah they are pretty scary, if your body adjusts to taking them daily it decreases GABA receptors that turn mast cells off. I have been taking 0.5mg Ativan 2x weekly for a year and a half though without worsening symptoms. They are also one of the most potent stabilizers once you have got all the h1/h2 and prostaglandin blockers going too in my experience. \n\nAshwagandha is one of many GABAa mimetics and works similarly to the benzos but it is different enough it is a little safer, and it is a lower dose compared to benzos so it is okay to take a little as needed as long as you do not overdo it. I bought 10% withanolides off nootropics depot. \n\nSent you the link. I take 2mg at night and 1mg in morning ketotifen, many start with just 1mg. Best of luck! Glad to help. Oh no I am so sorry to hear about the tragic end to your relationship with red wine. You were wonderful together while it lasted and you will always have the memories of good times. Better to have loved and lost than to have never had a glass of red at all, eh? \n\nI am not kidding. You have my condolences friend! I use a Wine Wand when I want a glass of red wine. It seems to be quite effective. although i was not vomiting after one glass, just getting migraines and rashes. I have seen those advertised but forgot about them until you mentioned \u2014 I might have to get one as a lash ditch effort ! I second the DAO. I take it with every meal that might contain histamines, and before any alcohol. I take zyrtec every day and save the Benadryl for a rescue med. I have noticed if I have to take Benadryl a lot, it affects my short term memory. It is still the best med for some reactions though. These sites have treatment guides. Lots of mast cell drugs are OTC thank goodness. I use phenibut and l Theanine instead of benzodiazepines. \n\nAmerican mastocytosis group\n\n\n\n\nSwedish mast cell group\n\n\nSwedish histamine elimination diet \n\n\nMCAS treatment guide \n\n\nMore GI and General treatment guides \n This is great information, thanks very much, I will read through everything. \n\nCan I ask please, how and when do you use the phenibut and l-Theanine? \n\nDo you know in what stage of a reaction cycle are benzos beneficial? \n\nIs the mechanism similar to phenibut/l theanine?\n\nI would much rather stay away from benzos so your input is super welcome. So phenibut is a gabapentinoid but greatly overlaps benzos effects on the central nervous system (CNS;Brain). This form of GABA could be read as Phenyl GABA or phenylated GABA. It means it has some extra molecules attached creating a phenylated ring on the primary GABA molecule. This phenyl aspect allows it to cross the blood brain barrier better. So the anxiolytic effect benzos provide, phenibut provides as well just to a lesser degree. \n\nL Theanine - preferentially SunTheanine is just relaxing; it is found in tea. It helps the brain go into alpha. Helps you be more chill and less emotional. \n\nSo my interpretation is the reaction cycle is - reacting/ not reacting. I do not find there is a build up, ascent to a crescendo and then gradual coast down hill. Maybe it is the way I am treating it maybe it is the severity of my disease. Who knows. Afrin who is work needs to be read and reread by every person who utters the phrase; \u201cI think I have mast cell activation syndrome or mastocytosis or histamine intolerance (which I think is a bad dx).\u201d\n\nAfrin talks about the gi effects of benzos. I am strongly against there use especially chronically. So I cannot give you dosing or suggestions based on my experience. I think CBD, optiPEA, OTCs and gastrocrom should help you. \n\nI have taken up 1g a day of sun Theanine before. I think it is got a glass ceiling and 300mg-600mg has the same effect. Doctors best is my brand and cheap. I use nootropic depot of phenibut and take 500-750mg at night with 20mg of doxepin because I cannot sleep. This puts me out for a decent nights rest. Without it I find myself up for 26-30hrs and then I get tired. \n\nThings to help the gut would be mct oil and CBD isolate from blue bird botanicals mixed to your liking, I add a few drops of peppermint  oil from plant guru. His EOs are being used in the Lyme study at Hopkins - the EOs had to past rigorous tests not made up ones like young doterra living or WE. Blue bird botanicals offers a 50% discount for those on disability. I just get the isolate. If you vape or smoke or make edibles then check out /r/CBD \nthey usually review flower. I have to vape in order to get food down. It is the only way I do not puke despite nausea medicine. \n\nDo not become to reliant on Benadryl it will cause dementia after 3 years of use at 50mg or more daily. Here is a sneak peek of /r/CBD using the ( of the year!\n\n\\#1: ( | (  \n\\#2: ( | (  \n\\#3: ( | (\n\n----\n^^I am ^^a ^^bot, ^^beep ^^boop ^^| ^^Downvote ^^to ^^remove ^^| ( ^^| ( ^^| ( Sorry you are in this sucky situation.  Hopefully awareness surrounding mast cell disorders will continue to increase so that fewer people have to live like this.  \n\nHere are OTC mast cell stabilizers that are at least available in the US (not sure what country you are in obviously so do not know how easily you can find these):\n\npalmitoylethanolamide, reishi mushroom, bromelain (many people cannot tolerate it) fish oil, l-theanine, vitamin c (especially ( luteolin, resveratrol, and khella (the active ingredient in which was the basis for the development of cromolyn), and lots of terpenes. Ocimene (terpene) has helped me the most. You can buy ocimene distillate and diffuse it, add it to essential oil blends, put it in your skincare products, etc. THC is a powerful mast cell stabilizer too, which is why so many of us love our devil's lettuce. Also, there are a few helpful alkaloids...caffeine is a mast cell stabilizer, nicotine can be helpful for some people but not for others, and then there is kratom, which is a source of *countless* alkaloids with mast cell stabilizing and anti-inflammatory properties (though of course kratom is not legal everywhere). Also, heck, put some baking soda in a glass of water, that is an antihistamine.\n\nAlso, anything that helps improve vagal nerve tone and function will improve MCAS (like exposure to cold and rocking motions such as sun salutations in yoga)\n\nYou can also buy ketotifen without a prescription from Japan (I think?  And/or Australia maybe), but I know some people are not entirely comfortable buying prescription drugs without a prescription from other countries (I certainly am not comfortable with that and have not tried it) But that is available if you ever are that desperate. I personally found that ashwagandha worsened my symptoms so just be careful There is some contraindication for DAO, right?  People always recommend it and then I am like \"why am I not taking it\" and then eventually I remember why but I am on so many antihistamines I cannot remember anything lmao It may reach the point where you literally physically cannot tolerate alcohol anymore.  I could tolerate certain forms of it until I was about 27, but now if I consume it i will just INSTANTLY throw it up\n\nAnd for many people, vodka seems to be one of the easiest forms to tolerate, if alcohol is very important to you (I know it is a cultural thing in some places) Thank you so much Thank you so much Oh no! And thank you, guess I am switching to vodka. Does DAO make anyone feel sick &amp; gross? I have tried Umbrellex DAO twice &amp; both times left feeling belly sick, like I really should not have taken the pill. I improve when lowering my H bucket with H1, 2 &amp; 3 gen antihistamines instead. Is this normal? Everything I read, seems I should be helped by DAO, but makes me feel like I have taken too much med &amp; then have to ride out a bumpy ride with weird sensations of over-med in my stomach for 1-2 hrs till it passes. Could it be a problem with pill ingredients/chemicals? (Not thought about that yet). Sorry,I have only had a positive response with DAO.", "Elevated Tryptase - MCAS, masto, COVID Hi everyone,\n\nI will try and keep my story short, and I will preface by saying I am not even 100% sure I have a mast cell disorder.\n\nI have tested high for tryptase twice in a row. June and September, both times my levels were around 13. I did get the D816V KIT test which was negative.\n\nNow.... I am one of the COVID \"long haulers\" you may have heard about. 32 years old, male, no underlying conditions other than some well-managed functional GI problems. Sick in March, pretty bad (6.5 out of 10?) never went to hospital. 6 months later, I am maybe 65-70% better but still struggling with chest pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and occasional cognitive issues.\n\nPrior history of \"possible mast cell related\" things:\n\n\\- 10 years of what I was told is \"eczema\" on my hands/fingers\n\n\\- 10 years of GI issues (my naturopath had diagnosed as SIBO, leaky gut) for which I am *mostly* better but not 100% after functional medicine treatment\n\nCould I have minor mastocytosis despite the D816V being negative? Cutaneous version given the skin issues on hands (would that have tryptase)?\n\nThere is also a hypothesis gaining support that Bradykinin storms are the cause behind a lot of the COVID symptoms. Not sure if maybe there is a correlation between Bradykinin and mast cells / tryptase. Perhaps prolonged bradykinin is causing my mast cells to react over time too.\n\n(\n\nJust wanted to get your thoughts on what can be going on given my tryptase levels and medical state.\n\nI do have an Immunologist I am working with too - but wanted to post here as you guys are actually more likely the experts!!\n\nThanks all!! Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) is different from mastocytosis. \u00a0It features inappropriate mast cell activation with little or no increase in the number of mast cells, unlike in\u00a0Mastocytosis. You can be positive for MCAS with a positive tryptase serum test (or even a negative one). So you can still have synptoms from mast cell degranulation despite not having systemic mastocytosis. \n\nAs for Covid, there have been studies that show long term inflammation (long term meaning months since everything is still being studied) and it could just be that. Ive also seen articles saying Covid causes cytokine storms, which is a chemical mediator released by mast cells.", "Medication Regime For Mast Cell Activation Syndrome These are the typical meds for MCAS as with everything everyone is different. \n\n- H1 antihistamines,\n First Gen - Atarax, Benadryl, Doxepin\n 2nd Gen - Allegra, Claritin, Ketotifen, Xyzal, Zyrtec\n\n- H2 Antihistamines Pepcid, Tagament, Zantac has been pulled off the market. \n\n- Leukotriene Inhibitors - Singulair\n\n- Mast Cell Stabilizers - cromolyn sodium, Ketotifen, Xoliar If I am informed correctly, as of now, beginning 2020, Zantac has not been pulled of the market per se. It is just that many charges have been recalled due to contamination during the production process. Pepcid (20 mg) has been working really well for me as a substitute. Pepcid is the brand name, the active ingredient is famotidine.", "Dosage of medication Hey, \nI wondered what dosage of MCAS medication you take.\n\nA few days ago I got prescribed following:\n\nChromolyn\nFamotidin (pepsid) \nMontelukast\nand Rupafin (which made me very drowsy, so we changed it to Loratadin, which is much better)\n\nThe doctor got me started with 20mg Famotidin twice a day. _But_ the pharmacy accidentally gave me tje 40mg capsules. I did not realize, but felt AMAZING. So much better. When I noticed the next day I got the 20mg ones and lowered the dose accordingly. They still help, but the double dose was _much, much_ better. Such a _relieve_.\nSo I wondered what dosage you take and if it would be safe to just take the higher dose until I can talk to my doc at our next appointment. 80mg of Famo is quite a high dose but if it helps you and you do not notice side effects it should be fine (at least for short or mid term). What symptoms are improving for you with the higher dose if I may ask? Fibromyalgia pains, muscle cramps, neuropathies, brain fog, depression, _gastrointestinal symptoms(!)_ , extreme heat (I still feel quite warm, could be the weather though), itchy eyes, bone pain and some other stuff.\nI would say the chronic fatigue got better, _but_ this concoction of medication makes me quite a bit dizzy and lazy, so it is kind of a trade off. Time goes by fast, but I work concentrated. I am on 80 mg a day. That is the max. Its always better to be on a lower dose but if you need the higher dose for symptom control there is no shame in that. That is the max dose, and sometimes the docs change their mind when they go to order meds because they look up their reference information and see what the proper treatment is. It is always a good idea to call and confirm. I bet they would not mind. \n\nPerhaps consider trying ketotifen as your H1 blocker if your country has it. It had some cross over H2 reactivity as well being a mast cell stabilizer. What is your cromolyn dose? Cromolyn is 5ml ampules 4 x a day\n\n2 xyzal\n\n4 sprays flonase sensimist\n\n1 omeprazole\n\n\nI used to take 40mg of pepcid but it was not helping. 40mg is the prescription max I think. Id mention it to your doctor. I went from 20 mg famotidine twice a day to 20 mg four times a day and it was such a huge difference! I recommend getting Dr. Lawrence Afrin\u2019s book on MCAS and sharing it with your doc. He has lots of info on dosing. Great to know that is a apparently safe dose :)  I will ask him if he knows it when I see him the next time. But maybe I should first read it myself. :D Glad to hear it helps you with that many symptoms. I take Levocetirizine 5mg twice a day, Montelukast 10mg once a day, and 5 to 15 mg of CBD per day (depending on what I need that day). Also, I used to take Ranitidine twice a day when it was still available, it was so much better with it. Totally. Do you have experiences with those medications? Why is less better? Because of the long term side effects? Anticholinergic effects? Risks for Alzheimer\u2019s? Did you experience what happens when you take more than 80? Great, I will ask my doc for ketitofen, thank you! Do you think you could add it or would you have to take it in place of the other antihistamine? 4 sachets a day, each has 200 Essentially all H1 blockers can be additive, but you are prone to increased side effects, which are mostly related to increased tiredness. My doc had my on 1-4 zyxal a day and two allegras. \n\nI added the ketotifen and then when I was doing well with it I stopped taking the zyxal and Allegra unless my symptoms flair up-- like they do when work is stressful. The h2 blocker reduces stomach acid. Many mcas patients already have very low stomach acid. When acid is low your food does not break down as easily and could potentially cause allergies. It also has trouble killing off pathogens as well so a long term side effect can be bacterial or candida infection in the GI. I am on supplements to increase my stomach acid so there are ways around it. Ah, _that\u2018s_ true. I just increased my Betaine HCL dose. I am not sure _how much_ the difference is though... Oh okay, good to know. Does that mean H2 ones are not additive?\n\nI feel much better with H2 ones. The H1 ones seem vasodilating to me and make me feel sluggish...\n\nGood luck!!! I am not sure if the H1 would be causing vasodilation but likely has a central effect in your brain, causing tiredness and sluggishness. \n\nYou know, I am not sure what increasing the H2 blocker above 40mg/day would do, if anything. It does say clearly that it is supposed to be the max limit. Still, obviously, the therapy that it is for is to reduce gastric secretion and not whatever else you are experiencing with the increased histamine blockade. It does make me wonder if your primary site of histamine release is not your gut because that is where H2 dominates. \n\nHave you tried cromolyn? Yes, I love Chromolyn!!\n\nEven before I started school I always had very harsh fibromyalgia and gut/nausea (accompanied by with anxiety and racing heart) issues. Around 10 the gut issues less, depression and fibro increased, as well as cfs. Last year something happened and my body collapsed. Then my biggest concern was my GI tract. Gastroparesis, extremely high calprotectin etc. Next to other nasty symptoms like blurry vision, sleep disorders, joint issues, anxiety etc. pp\nBut I could not eat anything without heavy symptoms, so GI and Fibro were the two mains...\n\nEdit: I supplement betaine HCL", "XPost - I am currently in the Pfizer / BioNTech Covid-19 Clinical Phase 2/3 Trials. I have S. Mastocytosis w/ mast cell activation. I received both doses of the Covid-19 vaccines back in September-October 2020. AMA  Do you have any other common co-morbidities like ehlers-danlos or POTS? Curious how this full spectrum turns out I do not have a formal EDS diagnosis, however, I suspect that I have a connective tissue disorder. In addition, I do \"currently\" have a dysautonomia IST diagnosis. Thanks so much answering!! Thank you for sharing! Have you noticed any changes in your reactivity since receiving the shots? (New reactions, or worsened ones?) Nope! Nothing really outside of side effects from the initial vaccine! Not a prob! \n\nI figured I would post this on here since a lot of others on this sub and the dysautonomia subs are asking. \n\nIt can be scary at first to try out a new drug / vaccine when you have chronic issues. \n\nEven though all our bodies are different and there is a spectrum to a lot of our conditions, I wholeheartedly feel that it is still okay to post this. I am just here to try to ease some of  that worry.\n\nNote: Keep in mind that I brought my Epipen to both injection appointments for safe measure! My immunologist told me today that we are supposed to carry both EpiPens with us at all times. Because they are called a kit it is an EpiPen kit. Often when a patient needs to use one they immediately are okay but then about 15 minutes later they need another shot before they can get to the emergency room I had a reaction. I have spots all over my arm and each day it is worse and growing. They look like little eraser marks. No itching. Just spots. Igg reaction of mast cells. Hi. I am circling back here because I am due to receive my shot and wondered if you had any updates, or were things still the same? So valuable to have anecdata from someone with MCAS. Thank you! No updates ... Still very much immune ... Still very much no reactions thereafter.  Still very much nothing to really worry about ...just remember to take an epipen in the event something does happen. \n\nHonestly, this should reassure you (\n\n47 reactions out of 10 million is a very good number. Thank you! For clarity, my concern is less anaphylaxis to the vaccine and more raising the floor on my mast cell dysfunction, which happened after my last tetanus booster. Still worth getting as the covid risks are more significant, I know! Yeah nothing much for me other than vaccine side effects. But those went away. \n\nBut I guess we are all different? Yep. Thanks! Need to mention ...side effects only last around 15 hours max! Thanks! Sadly not the case for the dozen or so reports I have seen for MCAS patients, who have a few days to weeks of flares as a result. I still plan to get it, but I guess I will see how my body tends to receive the vaccine! We are all different. I am on Xolair so that has definitely reduced some of my flares overall and probably helped me with my vaccines.", "What kind of doctor/specialist diagnosed you with MCAS? Hello community! After experiencing flares ups involving multi-system symptoms, I have been referred to, and have seen, a cardiologist, dermatologist, vascular surgeon, and a rheumatologist. I am scheduled to see a neurologist in a week to evaluate a tremor that appears during flare ups. All of these specialists have acknowledged my symptoms, but have not been able to attribute them to anything specific.\n\nWhen my blood tests came back negative for autoimmune antibodies, my rheumatologist basically said \u201cgood luck and we can follow up in a year if you want\u201d. I am seemingly stuck in medical limbo at this point!\n\nKnowing that my condition is systemic and my symptoms resemble autoimmune disorders, would it be worth taking it upon myself to see an allergist/immunologist even though my other doctors have not suggested it? Have any of you had luck going this route? \n\nI am sure most of you have been in my position before and any advice is much appreciated!! Many thanks! I saw a functional medicine doctor and she pointed me in the right direction but could not diagnose it. I finally found an internist who specializes in MCAS. Depending on where you are, you might try the Mastocytosis Society - they have lists of doctors. The allergist I saw was zero help. I had one allergist/immunologist diagnose and an internist and another immunologist confirm. A couple of doctors separately diagnosed me. Each of them are in small independent practices in which my doctor or another doctor in their practice has MCAS. Allergist/immunologist It took an actually MCAS specialist to officially diagnose me (though the allergist, infectious disease, rheumatologist, urogynocologist, internist, and emergency medicine docs I saw all entertained the notion once I brought it up) (after all other diagnoses had been ruled out) I directly went to the MCAS specialist after doing my own research. All the other doctors I saw had never heard about MCAS. Dysautonomia neurologist then immunologist A few years ago the average length of time before mastocytosis diagnosis was something ridiculous like ten years. I saw an immunologist who frequently deals with it. Now I am being managed by an autonomic neurologist Same. My allergist/immunologist diagnosed me A neurologist who specializes in EDS, MCAS and POTS. Hey all, thank you so much for your responses! By some major stoke of luck, I was able to get an appointment to see an allergist/immunologist who treats MCAS yesterday. I was lucky to get an appointment so quickly. Anyway, I have already started the testing process, so we will see. \n\nThanks again everyone. I wish you all the best!", "My covid rash is unlike the covid arm they have seen so far according to Nih.  Lucky there is no itch, or puss. Just flat spots. Looks extremely similar to mine, though worse. Mine comes and goes (lasts weeks/months, disappears, starts again) and I was joking about playing join the dots to see if there is some secret message. No mine is from the covid shot Do you always get reactions to vaccines with your MCAS and you are vaguely annoyed so you are posting? I am confused. It is good that you got vaccinated though! I am still waiting. I never get any vaccinations. The flu shot I get really really sick. So I do not get vaccinations pneumonia shot nothing like that I do not get them. But the covid shot My son insisted that I get it so I did. I have been to three different kinds of doctors now and nobody knows what it is so they say it is a reaction to the covid shot.I get my second one this weekend let us hope it does not kill me. And yes I am very annoyed. if it was summer I would still have to be in long sleeves. I posted it so that if it happens to someone else with mast cell they understand that they should report it there is a place you can report it so they get more than one person reporting it. My doctor is researching it with other doctors my immunologist Jesus you are fat as a fucking cow That is a swollen arm. Wtfiwwy Is it swollen or you are a day piece of shit who is ashamed of how fat you are... I have had a swollen arm and it is never looked like a fucking chode I still think your a fucking idiot", "Are we considered immunocompromised? I know mast cells are involved in the immune system, some classify as autoimmune. Does this mean we are immunocompromised? This is my question! \n\nI do not think we are, but some people have elevated cytokines which are impacted by the virus. For example, if COVID-19 causes cytokines to freak out and we have elevated levels, is not that a big problem? I did  some reading on it but I would like a professional (or more educated) opinion on it.\n\nEdit:  There are two immune systems.\n\nMedicine does not care about the innate immune system (mast cells)\n\nSo when they talk about immune compromised, they are talking about the *learned* immune system, not the innate\n\nIf you have mast cell disease, your *innate* immune system is hyperresponsive, but you can still have a *deficient learned immune system* (and it stands to reason that one potential cause of MCAS could be a deficient learned immune system - innate is picking up the slack for the learned)\n\nI personally never get a cold or the flu or literally anything besides allergy symptoms.  But other people do have a compromised learned immune system.  I do not know much about that, because it is not me. cytokine storm is my new band name Kind Of badass, kind of lethal. I like it. yes, this is something i would like to find out more about. i just learned that the spanish flu was so deadly because it caused a hyperresponse in many of the young people who wound up dying during that pandemic. it was the overreaction of the immune system that was deadly to them. at least that is my understanding. Well that is scary, but good to know! Agreed. This is what I have been reading as well. I have resolved to treat myself as though I am high risk. Better safe than sorry IMO. I do not honk panicking is helpful, but being careful is important. I read some research that showed that COVID-19 activated the complement immune system(cascade).  Mast cells are involved in that because they release compounds involved in inflammation.  The good thing is leukotriene receptor antagonists and 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors which are commonly used to treat mast cell diseases helps stop that from happening.  Will it be enough?  Who knows?  I would think it depends on how reactive your mast cells are in your respiratory system. \n\nI am curious about mast cell involvement overall for normal people in this disease.   The more respiratory diseases you have gotten over (or have if they are chronic diseases) increases the number of mast cells in the alveoli area of your lungs.  Mast cells infiltrate the alveoli area of the lungs after/during the disease process, so the older you get, the more you could have built up.  If the research is correct, this could be a way to treat people and decrease the mortality rate in the elderly.  Inflammation in the alveoli area decreases oxygenation in the body. Just spoke to a doctor. We are not typically viewed as at risk but according to him we are. Ever since I have developed this illness I have noticed I never get colds, or sick ever (knock on wood) I feel as if this illness makes our immune systems more ramped and ready to fight things off, however our allergy symptoms are horrid.", "Possible MCAS?  Tryptase is only useful for patients who have mastocytosis or hereditary alpha tryptasmia. It is a pretty bad test overall because believe it or not that tryptase can be unreliable for a number of reasons. \n\nWhy do they test tryptase then? \n\n-It is the only thing we have so far. \n\nYou can very much have a mast cell disorder with a normal tryptase test. Likely all cases of mast cell activation syndrome have normal tryptase. \n\nDoes that mean you should give up on a mast cell diagnosis?\n\n-No! \n\n( If your doctor is willing to listen to you he/she will do everything presented on that website. \n\nIf not, then it is time to go find another doctor. You know your body better than anyone else. Do any of your symptoms align to any of the mcas symptoms? Flushing or food intolerance are very common symptoms. If advanced, tachycardia is a good clue too. Many of us have POTS which can be an easier diagnosis to attain and I think drs are more likely to head down the mcas path if you already have one of the comorbitities. If you feel strongly that this is mcas then I would look elsewhere for answers. An unconcerned doctor is not going to get you answers. Mcas or not.", "General abdominal pain: how much Pepcid can one take in a day?  My dr told me I can take 20mg twice a day. I have seen some literature that 40 mg twice a day can be used, but it seems  that it is reserved for serious erosive conditions. Sometimes I supplement with Pepto bismol. Pepcid only helps me so much no matter how much I take. Oof. I am already taking 20 a day. Maybe I will just swap I am pepto like you do. The supplement slippery elm helps me with burning stomach pain, and ginger helps with nausea. Cromolyn sodium was what really helped, but I developed a side effect and could not stay on it. I could not stay on cromolyn either. It did not really help me much anyway because my digestion/intestinal issues are intermittent. I am just looking for intermittent solutions so I will look into slippery elm! I took 40mg a day. Was not enough. I had to switch to prilosec. I am taking 20mg four times a day and it rules. Are you on H1's and stabilizers? If so, have you experimented with PPI's? I take 400mg of Cimetidine twice a day currently. I used to take 20mg of Famotidine twice a day. Sometimes I will alternate between the two or mix up the to prevent tolerance. I am on H1/2s and Xolair. Failed on cromolyn, have not tried ketof., and I do not know what a PPI is. Most people in the general population take H2s to reduce stomach acid production. Mast cell patients do that too, but H2s also appear to have some other benefits for us as well (like overall mast cell stabilization).\n\nPPI's are a completely different class of stomach acid drug called proton-pump inhibitors. They have become the standard acid-reducing prescription medication for non-mast cell patients because they are very, very effective.\n\nLike all drugs, PPI's are not without potential side-effects, and taking both H2s &amp; PPIs together may have the potential to further increase side effects. However, if you think your abdominal pain may be due to an excess of stomach acid, it might be worth asking your doctor about the possibility.\n\nThere are, of course, other causes of abdominal pain besides excess acid that might be worth looking into. Happy to help brainstorm if that is a road you want to go down. Thank you for the comprehensive reply! I need to look into this more. I take 40mg twice a day. My calprotectin level was ~650 before this and now it is 20. Also went from being able to eat 4 foods to 35 in 6 months. So, it changed my life. I also take 1mg ketotifen twice a day, 20mg zyrtec twice a day. The pepcid and ketotifen I take is compounded with no fillers for me. Could not do OTC pepcid - skin contact gave me hives. But for some reason I can take Kirkland brand Zyrtec. Hope you start feeling better soon! Thank you for this reply! I am so glad to hear that you find something that works for you!", "What to do after cromolyn? \u201cI tried a vial of cromolyn a week ago and it caused a massive flare. I have been getting extreme migraines almost every day since. I have GI issues round the clock when before it was just in the morning. \n\nI tolerated a half vial but we appear to have gone too quick. We tried a quarter a few days after that and I got a bad migraine again. Yesterday I had a terrible migraine but I have not had cromolyn in five days. \n\n- If any of you have not tolerated cromolyn, What did you do next? How long did your flare last?\u201d\n\nMy wife who cannot look at screens due to photophobia. I cannot tolerate cromlyn\u2014I have been having some success with a supplement called camu camu\u2014it is high vitamin C content coming from a non-histamine producing source I had to lower the dose right down and gradually add more. I cannot tolerate more than a couple of capsules a day but it has helped massively in the long run I had to stop cromolyn because it made my period so heavy I had to have blood transfusions. I am taking xolair. It took about a year to really start helping. I have gotten some foods back and I can tolerate smells better than before. I had to get cromolyn compounded into a pill with ricegel and it saved my life!  I reacted to the liquid as well. Of course, speak to your doctor but I would encourage you to not give up on it yet completely. As far as I know, there are two different manufactures of Cromolyn ampoules. For some people, they react better to one brand over the other so maybe ask your pharmacy about the option of trying the other. That was the case for me. \n\nMy doctor and I added one ampoule every week and a half and still, on the day I titrated my dose I would have a lot of flushing and increase in symptoms, (dizziness, stomach pain/nausea, headaches, etc.) but then things would eventually calm down. You could also look into trying it in a different form or having it compounded if you know specific triggers. \n\nIt is one of those drugs that really can take quite a while to work, about 4-6 weeks. I did not notice how much it was helping until I looked back and realized my nearly constant headaches had gone down drastically, my itching was not constant anymore, and my flushing was decreased from multiple times every day to maybe once.\n\n I hope you can find something that works out for you and even if Cromolyn turns out not to be a good fit do not lose hope that something else out there will be. I have had a lot of luck with Quercetin if you have not tried that already it is worth bringing up to your doctor. The second I run out I feel miserable and there is a study that has some promising information on it. If you are interested I tolerate Pure Encapsulations and Throne's formulas best. It is so much trial and error especially with mast cells so I know it can be frustrating and draining to keep trying and having issues pop up. Wishing you all the best. \n\nIf you are curious here is the link to the study mentioned! ( There is ketotifen or xolair. Cromolyn works wonders for me but I flared severely to ketotifen. Honestly, I needed a combination of meds to get mine under control (I am on cromolyn, quercetin, famotidine, Allegra, levocentrizine, and omeprazole) Quercetin.\nStart slow.\n\nYour wife may want to try using a program for blind people which reads out the text for her if she wants to use the internet by herself. :) What is ricegel? Prednisone \n\nfor migraines i would pick LSA or hallucinogen mushrooms just make sure to take a very low dose. Quercetin is toxic in higher dosages and works like caffeine. I think luteolin is much better if its available", "Sleep / waking up / congested nose Sleep / histamine issues\n\nI struggle with sleep (waking up several times a night), also I get congested when lying down at night. \nI often gets quite warm at night/evening (sleeping in a very cool room). But in the first half of the day Im freeezing; nose, fingers and feet are the worst... in the evening these areas get the warmest.. \n\nI have been carnivore (without dairy) for 9 months. For the last week I have been only eating fresh/frozen chicken and pork, suet + some kidney and lamb liver..\n\nOther symptoms are that I have gotten subhorreic dermatitis, nose gets very runny when its cold H1 and H2 blockers together help nasal congestion more than either alone.", "How long does a triggered attack normally last for MCAS? I have been researching MCAS because the PA at my allergist's office suspects I might have that rather than a normal food allergy since I am not reacting in the textbook way, and unfortunately after researching it, I am inclined to agree. I am going to wait on getting the testing until it is safer to go out due to the coronavirus, and just try to be more careful until then.\n\nI am just wondering for comparison to a regular food allergy episode, what the time frame roughly is for a MCAS episode if you are feeling 100% better for months, then suddenly encounter a trigger? Also, does it usually get better, or can it get stuck in sort of a loop? I am allergic to onions and beer, I can tell you within one bite I ate undercooked onions. I also have GI issues related to MCAS and those \"attacks\" are more frequent but I do not get them instantly it is usually around 30 minutes after I eat, I do not get food related attacks if I take Cromolyn. \n\n\nI was stuck in a loop before my diagnosis. I had constant rashes on my arms, severe neck/low back pain, joint pain and IBS like symptoms. I had 3 steroid injections for my spine (orthopedic doctor thought my pain was related to herniated disk) they just made it worse. \n\nI am still struggling some days and fatigue is bad some days (two days at theme parks outside and I am exhausted for the next two days) but that could be due to the lockdowns and me not being active.\n\n\nI am also in the middle of getting allergy tests, I know I have environmental triggers and that is why some my days are so bad. I have MCAS, no IgE allergies except one kind of mold. When I have a food reaction, it is usually after the first bite or two. My soft palate will swell and I will get hives on my tongue. I will usually start coughing. After 15 or 20 minutes, I will have to use the bathroom several times. I have had different reactions though. The last time I ate peanuts, I had terrible pain and pressure in my upper left abdomen after the first bite, then vomiting right away, and hives and coughing. I also run a fever during reactions, and my blood pressure increases. I have other reactions where I fall asleep and feel like I am awake but cannot move and my whole body is shaking internally. When I eat corn, I cough up blood for a couple hours. \n\nGenerally, if a reaction does not stop getting worse an hour after I took 100mg Benadryl, I know I need steroids or to go to urgent care. My doctor prescribes steroids to keep on hand but I am supposed to try to limit them to every four months. \n\nAs far as how long a reaction lasts, usually once the problem food it out, I get better pretty quick. Hives take longer to go away, and so do sores in the mouth. Sometimes if I have a lot of reactions, I will be more likely to keep having reactions for a few days. If I have a reaction, I am not really feeling better until 4 to 6 hours afterward.\n\nThe cognitive effects (brain fog, head pressure, cognitive issues, feeling like I am under water) last the longest, but usually after four hours they start to come right.\n\nI think before I started Nalcrom it was more like 6 hours. Have you ever gotten checked for cci? What is CCI? Craniocervical instability. I say you mentioned the spine issues. A lot of people who have mcas also have EDS or are somewhere on the joint hypermobilty spectrum.

As I can remember. Face, chest, shoulders, down arms, knees, feet. I read about Erythromelalgia and seems pretty text book. Recently more symptoms have been showing up and been getting worse. I have been having to cut out more and more foods, and alcohol\nBecause they are triggering these issues more. Raising my blood pressure, causing my heart to pound and palpitations. Having dizzy spells, feeling my blood rush to my head when I stand from sitting/laying. Feeling out of breath when I am flaring even if I am not doing anything active. Flushing/blotches. GI issues, nausea, stomach pain, constipation&amp; diarrhea, heart burn . rectal pain/spasms. Issues w my bladder, feeling like I am never fully emptying it, dribbling out, peeing all hours of the night, feeling sometimes like I have a flare down there, or like UTI is starting but does not. Chronic sinus infections, polyp in my sinus the size of a grape. \n\nMy body has been in a bad flare for about a month and during this time I was diagnosed w dry eye syndrome after dealing w severe eye pain. My parotid (salivary) gland has had chronic issues for 3+ years swelling and getting blocked causing swelling and pain that leads to ear canal issues.\n. I went to my ENT and he dismissed me and said it is just TMJ. I said could it possibly be stones in my gland or Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome? He said no, and to take 3 Advil 3 times a day during a flare, with no other blood work imaging or anything. \n\nI emailed the Neurologist I just began seeing and documented all my symptoms. She wants me to get an MRI with contrast- however my concern is that if I do have mast cell The contrast could trigger me even worse. \nI have reactions to antibiotics, had a reaction to shrimp (gastro issues, severe stomach pain and diarrheal, itchy throat) but never tested positive w allergy tests, allergic to adhesive in bandaids and paper tape, makes my skin blister/burn marks, and when I get the numbing injections at dermatologist for mole removals that stuff gives me a reaction, swelling pain itching for at least a week or longer. The only allergy I tested positive for many years ago was mold- the apartment I live in for 3 years now has mold but I tested it and it is not the dangerous toxic black mold just regular household mold. However we had a pipe leak through my ceiling twice so I know there have been more mold spores growing and probably in the air because of those issues. Being at home basically 24/7 during the pandemic, breathing the mold, and dealing with stress of my fear of Covid probably has also exacerbated my symptoms. \n\nHas anyone has the mri contrast and been ok? I feel like so many docs have no idea about this, but knowing my body and my hyper sensitivities to everything I am very worried. Do you have EDS? No, I do not think the symptoms associated w EDS are what I have. I have never been diagnosed with anything, I have just been tracking my symptoms that have gotten much worse over the last year.  Based on my own research and other family history I think I am having issues with Mast Cell and Sjogrens. Definitely seems suspicious but no one can say for sure. Have you seen an immunologist? Or dermatologist? \n\nI do have one thing, you usually get lidocaine injections when needing local, which I discovered I react poorly to as well. The reaction made fillings 10x more stressful. Ask for an alternate like marcaine when there is a next time.\n\nDid the neuro say why they wanted contrast? What are they looking for?\n\nIf it is a mast cell disorder there is a good chance your body does not like that much of an NSAID either. I cannot tolerate more than like 200 mg of advil. I was having symptoms where I would go numb in patches, on my leg, face and arm. I would also get these ghost itches where it felt super itchy but I could not relieve it with scratching  and the area would not have any type of rash on it. Numbness in my groin on one side that flared after my last child. Migraines, Tingling on parts of my head and back.  I am definitely leaving out some symptoms that I cannot think of right now. GI issues. She is basically ruling out MS. \n \nI hate the dentist because I always have issues w the novacaine too.  It makes my heart pound out of my chest (I think the epinephrine in it) and because I have red hair and we metabolize it faster than other people. So sorry you are going through this. I have many of the same symptoms minus the dry eye and salivary issues, and I have PCOS as well. Unfortunately I cannot answer your MRI contrast question, just commiserating. For whatever it may be worth, my own symptoms started after exposure to toxic mold in my rental house. I am also dealing with skeptical dismissive doctors and have not gotten any answers. I hope your tests are helpful. Yea that is what I was wondering. You need the contrast to check for active lesions in MS. (I have MS.)\n\nI react to contrast and do what the imaging center calls allergy protocol and take benadryl and prednisone before hand and I do not react. I had to react to find this out though. If you have never had contrast it does not stay in  your body long but does seem to effect me for the rest of the day after my MRIs. Is not it so frustrating? The PCOS started when I went off BC in 2015. I developed debilitating pain from cysts and ended up having an ovarian tumor the size of a lemon removed by emergency surgery. Since then I have had 40-60+ day cycles, extremely heavy painful periods that last minimum 7 days, reoccurring cysts, painful breasts during the time the cysts are present, and no ovulation. My hair is also coming out quite a bit now. Yup, mine revealed itself after going off BC in 2007. I have androgenic alopecia too. Fun times! I rarely take medication like Tylenol\nAnd Advil and when I do it is the lowest dose of it, I have not recognized anything different than normal flushing/bp or heart issues that I have daily but I have not tried to figure out if it is one of those causing it. My mother has a mast cell disorder, and my daughter has had two severe allergic reactions in her life. One to Advil when she was 2 and the other to nuts  when she was 12, that was anaphylactic and required an epipen. She had allergy testing done and it was all negative. The allergist at children\u2019s Boston basically said her immune system is over reacting to things that she is not actually allergic to. The only time I have ever had a doctor tell me that was years back when I had the gardasil HPV vaccine, and then a tetanus shot. Extremely swollen glands, fever, could not move my arm, welt the size of softball. My doc was concerned I would get guillien Barre syndrome but since having a baby in 2018 I ended up getting flu shots now every year and did the tDap. I do think it triggered BP issues and migraines but I was ok besides that. I will definitely ask for something to premeditate. I do not want to risk it. The last mri I had, it was no contrast but my body felt like it was burning during it and I had red patches on my skin afterwards. That is probably the heat from the machine without contrast. I am using red and sweating somewhere after 3 MRIs in a row. ~~I have the same symptoms you do. Ive had contrast before and was fine but I did not get it since my MCAS got really really bad. Just ask your doctor if its fine to not get contrast. You can turn it down at the MRI appointment, too.~~\n\nI saw your comment about numbness. You need the contrast to check for MS. A flare is worth knowing if you have lesions or not. \n\nAlso highly recommended the lip biopsy for Sjogrens over just the blood test. I have had an MRI with contrast 6 times without any reaction, however, I do not react to as many things as you listed you do. I think if you are going as far as an MRI you might as well get it with contrast. It can show so much more and it would help put your mind at ease. If you do react, the iv is already in you and I assume they can quickly give you meds to reverse it. \n\nJust as an FYI, when the contrast goes in you feel a warming sensation go through your body gradually. That is normal, do not panic!  I think it is gone after a couple of minutes.", "Pill to help with sleep but not make me feel tired. I know that sounds weird. I cannot stand pills that make me feel tired.\n\nI already have fatigue issues obviously. What I need is a pill I can take that will help relax me and then I can just stay asleep. I do not know if there is anything like that. I look up pillsand I am trying to discuss with my psychiatrist, which one I can take. Another thing I cannot have is one that is going to make me gain weight by taking it. I am trying to lose weight right now which is like pulling teeth for me.\n\nSo I need to figure out something I can take, and right now I will take the occasional Ativan but, I cannot obviously take that everyday or every couple of days because it is super addictive and I do not want to do that to myself.\n\nBut my sleep suffers a lot with this s***. Just some nights I will get 2 hours Short of sleep (8 hours) or even an hour short of sleep and it ruins my day I feel absolutely horrible.\n\nyes, if I get 6 or 7 hours I feel absolutely horrible, I need to shoot more for eight or nine or even 10 hours.\n\nAnd then I have this problem where it seems like clockwork every night after 4 hours I wake up in the middle of the night and sometimes I get back to sleep and sometimes it is an absolute challenge. I am tired of this because it is so hard already dealing with this every day then I got to deal with my sleep issues too and it is f****** terrible, excuse my French.\n\nAnyway, any ideas? If you get your histamine under control, you will be able to sleep.  From what you are saying, since you do not want to \"feel\" tired, it is probably just going to be a matter of figuring out the right dose of whatever you are already taking to control symptoms.  For most of us, histamine builds and builds as the day goes on, and that can translate into feeling less and less tired and the day goes on. I just stayed up for like 26 hours because I cannot fucking get tired from constant histamine disco party.\n\nAlso, frankly, you know, weed.  Weed is what you want, though I understand not everyone has access and not everyone feels comfortable with that (and some people are flat out allergic) well, one of the terrible things I do sometimes, or a lot I guess I should say, is to make up for lack of sleep I will drink so I pass out, that means lots of alcohol and then of course the next two or three days I feel horrible but alcohol does help me sleep. I have been doing that but now I am taking cromolyn and I am taking Claritin and I tried taking the H2 blocker stuff, what is it called... Ranitidine..\n\nBut ranitidine would make my body feel weird so I stopped taking it. So right now I am basically just on an h1 blocker I guess which is Claritin once or twice a day, twice if I remember, and then cromolyn three to four times a day..\nagain probably 4:00 would be ideal but I do not always remember to take medication very well.\n\nSo I guess I have to cut out the alcohol but that is what I am saying, because after two or three days, it seems like my body starts to get sore and stiff, and then it is difficult for me to fall asleep again and then like I said, if I only wake up even just 1 hour less than 8 hours it seems like I feel like there is sand in my head and it is a horrible feeling that causes anxiety and alcohol seems to fix it.  But then the vicious cycle again. because I know from what I have heard by reading these boards, that alcohol has an extremely high histamine count which is probably not doing me any good which is why I decided to ask if there is something I can do that is not alcohol to help even if it is just temporarily. Ranitidine also made me feel very weird.  My doc just put me on cimetidine instead.  (It is over the counter, in the US at least).  Cimetidine makes me feel *great.*\n\nAnd yeah, the alcohol is definitely not helping in the longterm!  But I totally understand how necessary it can seem when you cannot get tired.  I used alcohol for that back when I could still tolerate it. Also in terms of only being able to sleep for four hours, four hours is precisely how long any med will effectively control my MCAS symptoms.  I have not found a solution around this, but if you are not taking another dose of antihistamines as soon as you wake up after four hours to  try to be able to go back to sleep, I do recommend that.  During flares, I literally make sure I am taking *something* to pacify the mast cells every two hours when I am awake. Where would I get cimetidine if it is over the counter? Just like at a drugstore or something or a health store? Oh, will you just gave me a big explanation of why we dose like we do. I was unaware that we had to keep the mast cells under control, I thought that we just have dosing in the big would eventually get better. I did not know it was this process of continually keeping them in check but now it makes sense...\n\nI would be happy as a lark in the park if I could get rid of the f****** brain fog. That is the biggest thing the brain fog and fatigue. oh, and the restless leg that somehow seems to always want to show up at night time when I am trying to go to sleep. Like clockwork. For some reason, my body knows when I am ready to go to bed, and all of a sudden I will start feeling my whole body fill with that restless leg feeling and then I have to get rid of it and thank God I found a fix but it is not something I always want to do.\n\nWell that is another thing the alcohol increases as the brain fog, so yeah it will help me sleep at the next day or two it seems like my brain fog is atrocious and it is actually been increasing over time where it used to be just kind of bad but now it seems like it lasts longer and longer so I am hoping I have not done any permanent damage.\n\nbut then in other ways my hangovers do not seem as brutal as they used to be. I used to get hangovers for two or three days at a time, and now the hangovers only seem to last maybe a day but the brain fog is more intense it seems like so I do not know if it is because I am not laying in bed for 3 days in a row and maybe.....\n\nI do not know what is going on this whole process sucks LOL L-theanine I have that. Not sure how well it works CBD When I wake up and cannot get back to sleep I take one of these: dramamine, benadryl, weed. They all work, but if I take too much benadryl it can give me the opposite effect - agitation. I take the smaller dose.  Weed - tiny dose. I take melatonin every night as well. I cannot do weed, and I do not know if Benadryl is going to be good for me because it is probably going to give me that shity drowsy effect the next day because for some reason I am sensitive pills like that. Dramamine I thought was her motion sickness... A drugstore?  You mean you can leave the house without having an allergic reaction?  Lucky lmao\n\nI have no clue if they sell it in stores because I have to get everything on amazon.  I would never heard of it before, so it stands to reason that they might not carry it at every store like that.  There are more common h2s that they are probably more likely to stock.\n\nBut calling and asking stores if they have a thing is definitely commonplace right now, they would totally tell you before you drove out there If you are not taking magnesium, that can be great for RLS.  I take magnesium with calcium and potassium together and it is awesome.  \n\nMy understanding is that brain fog is usually caused because chronic inflammation cranks blood vessels open so that means there is genuinely just not enough blood in your brain.  So the good news is that a) controlling reactions better should improve brain fog (unless you take something like Benadryl, which will also make you foggy), but also simple tings like standing on your head periodically can improve brain fog (like if you work at a desk, set an alarm to stand on your head for a few seconds every two hours) Depends on whether your biggest issues are histamine or cortisol, for one. If its cortisol, phosphatidylserine supplements can help. But you need to know if they are safe for you, and the dosing is specific to a person, so you want a doc's assist. When I had crazed adrenal issues and could not sleep, it helped alot. But, you do still need to get your histamine under control. Some other folks here have some good antihist advice. Phosphatidylserine is a short-term fix. Its not supposed to screw with your weight unless you take it for more than three or four weeks. My doc has me use it occasionally for what she calls a sleep-reset. What it does is damp down your body's production of cortisol overnight, so you do not have cortisol spikes keeping you up in addition to your crazed overproduction of histamine. But I would definitely ask your doc if its safe for you first. If you do take it, timing is essential. One hour before bed, then expect to sleep six or seven hours. It does not work right out of the gate, but when I do it, third night I start to sleep better. YMMV. Good luck. Lol ok. \n\nMagnesium always seems to make me worse for some reason. Tagamet is the brand name. I have heard of it. You could try a milder option that boosts GABA\u2019s effects than a benzodiazepine or drinking. Like L-Theanine or ashwagandha powder with withanolides. \n\nI take doxepin by prescription, low dose, powerful antihistamine/mild antidepressant that makes people sleepy usually but I do not feel too sleepy in the morning when I take it. The thing is, side effects all vary by person so it is hard to tell you what would or would not make you feel sleepy. Heck some people take Benadryl as a sleep aid and then others get more awake when they take it. I have doxepin but I do not want to take it because of the fact that it causes weight gain and I am actually trying to lose the extra fat I put on from having a doctor put me on Lexapro before we knew what was going on. You will lose more weight if you are sleeping.  Take the doxepin for 90 days and track your calories. All right I will give it a shot. It is not low dose but it is 10 mg I think pills or whatever and I think low-dose is 6 or something Low is relative - 10mg if very low for doxepin Good because I am very sensitive to meds. Jesus, I do not know if I want to take that stuff anymore. I took a dose last night and I woke up today feeling tired as f*** even after sleeping 8 hours. And I could tell I took a sedative... Yuck It gets better with multiple uses. Got To reduce your histamine load in your brain. Drinking undermines this. Well, I was so shity and tired today I decided to drink so I can fall back asleep for a few hours.. \n\nNow I at least I am awake even though I have a hangover.\n\nMy routine sucks but I absolutely abhor being tired.\n\nI absolutely hate it hate it hate it hate it hate it hate it hate it with a passion.\n\nYou are probably right though, I guess I have to stop drinking, but it has been my remedy so long to deal with this stupid f****** illness I guess I am used to it by now. thank God I spaced it out to every 2 or 3 days before I drink again, otherwise I would probably be an alcoholic to the point where I would have physical withdrawal. But I am smart enough, at least in the sense where I do not allow myself to get addicted to things, so really I could probably stop drinking anytime if I knew there was going to be a remedy for my illness. And then I could just save drinking for being social which is fine with me.\n\nSo assuming I stop drinking, and I continue taking this doxepin stuff, how long is it until that stupid f****** tiredness goes away? Because honestly, I think I read that doxepin is pretty addictive in the sense that it has some nasty side effects when you come off of it, and I do not want to invest a lot of time and energy into something like that if it is going to make me tired all the time and then when I come off at I am going to feel worse... You are asking me questions that no amount of medical knowledge can answer - \u201cwhen will I no longer be tired.\u201d \n\nI think your focusing on a tree and not the forest. \n\nAnalyzing the problem at its core will garner successes. \n\nAre you establishing a sleep routine or passing out?\n\nAre you avoiding blue light?\n\nAre you eating after sunset?\n\nAre you eating enough amino acids?\n\nIs your sleep environment catered to being optimal: temperature, comfort, noise, darkness? \n\n\nAgain - fermentation will just continue to make you ill. You have got to stop the cycle. By focusing on a feeling you will not be able to move past it on to a logical methodology that ameliorates your most contested symptom. Move past your abhorrence of being tired while you establish a routine and it will go away. \n\nTry to be in bed by 1030p Did the Lexapro help you sleep? How did you figure out what was going on? Sorry for the questions\u2014 new here. Lexapro was okay, it did calm me down but I put on way too much weight.\n\nBut also, keep in mind that this is a physical ailment and Lexapro is made to help fix something that would be more like something happening in your brain like a chemical imbalance.\n\nSo, wow it made me feel more relaxed I also was getting extremely unhealthy from taking it, and in the long run what good is it if my mental state is calm down if I am getting physically unhealthier at an alarming rate.\n\nSo, I ended up going off of it and it was uncomfortable for a while, but whatever. Eventually I went to an allergist immunologist and got a bunch of tests done, but this girl went above and beyond the Call of duty, I cannot promise that if you just go to a random person they are going to do all the tests necessary. I would really really recommend that you do a lot of searching around and asking maybe even in these suburbs or other places, where you can find an expert in your area I am things like chronic fatigue or Mast Cell Activation Syndrome, or diagnosing these illnesses. I am sure some of the people here can directly to a way to find doctors who can make recommendations.\n\nBecause I went through hell for years with the medical community and the irresponsible doctors and people that I saw that we are making me worse.\n\nAnd now, I am not a hundred percent certain, but sometimes I feel like I am starting to slowly clean up this mess. I get really relaxed with L-theanine, but cannot sleep.  Think my sister could though.\n\nBelieve it puts you into an \"alpha\" brain wave state, like meditation.  Works good for too much coffee. Anti-inflammatory I had not thought of cortisol issues, but makes sense.  There are other supplements that supposedly damp down cortisol, like Relora or ashwagandha or however you spell it. Alcohol is high in histamine. When my histamine is high, I dont sleep at all. So you are likely passing out from drinking but increasing histamine at the same time so you are creating a cycle of poor sleep habits. you are probably right but I am sick of also feeling like s***. Like I have not drank in 3 days but this is the third day and I am drunk as f*** right now as I write this to you, and I just wanted oh, I just want to feel good come I just do not want to be sick anymore...\n\n\nyou know, kid is this morning after not drinking for a couple of days I woke up, and I had goddamn massive fatigue and brain fog and I am f****** tired of it I am f****** sick of it I am f****** sick and f****** tired of feeling like s*** no matter what I do I totally get it. I felt like I was dying every day. Constant anxiety, feeling sick, tired... it was a horrible way to live. \n\nYou would probably benefit from a consistent routine. The first couple of days will be rough because you are decreasing histamine and not using any sleep aids including alcohol. But taking mast cell stabilizers and eating low histamine will empty your \"histamine bucket.\" Everytime I am around too many allergens or eat high histamine foods or not taking my stabilizers, I have insomnia. I have had it the past 3 days. I havent been taking my cromolyn and had a flare. Okay, that is going to be the hardest thing for me to do, is stop drinking alcohol. And because I cannot f****** stand the way I feel some days. I need some sort of motivation...\n\nAre you saying I can get completely healed from this? No more brain fog no more bullshit? For me, I felt totally f****d in the head. Constant anxiety (I am talking barely able to function, psychiatrist couldnt figure it out), fatigue that mimicked depression...then I had the physical stuff. Rashes, tons of GI issues, daily chronic migraine. If I stay on my schedule with my meds... I actually feel like my old self, something I had not felt for years. Cromolyn sodium (only 1 type of mast cell stabilizer, theres different kinds and people find others might help better) and a low histamine diet have changed everything. Im no longer afraid of losing my job hah Like I said above, I feel like myself. I get stuff done now! Sometimes I get flares but I am not stringent on meds, which I totally should be. When I took cromolyn for the first time, a brain fog that I did not even know was there, was lifted. It was crazy. Oh, you mean you took cromolyn once and your brain fog went away?  Fuck. Well there goes that idea.\n\nI have been taking it 3 or 4 ampules a day every day for a while and I do not think it lifts my brain fog. You might do better with ketotifen. Or even OTC quercetin. Most of my problems are GI. My doctor planned on adding quercetin next if cronolyn was not helping me. Theres options.", "What supplements or meds help you the most? New here and in the process of diagnosing. I need to get on a regiment asap. What did you guys do that helped you the most? You might find better responses by doing a search of the sub, then coming back and asking more precise and informed questions. Ive already actually looked through a few subs and saw a lot of different reviews on different meds and supplements. Its just a friendly question on what has helped people the most through there journey. No need for the negativity or hostility. Thanks! My suggestion was intended as helpful, so that you could get actually useful answers, and not as negative or hostile. Try harder. Your illness has made you bitter. Hope you find peace somewhere along the way. High doses of vitamin c,vitamin d,cbd and theanine. A lot of people have good results with quercetin but I reacted to it. Depends on exactly what you have and severity, but you should discuss with your diagnosing doctor. I get by with antihistamines (Claritin and Benadryl), multi vitamin, and 1-4x 1000mg B12/day. Also vitamin D, folic acid, and iron supplements depending on how I am feeling. That is me for mastocytosis, but MCAS is different. I reacted to Quercetin as well. Looking for the next thing to try. My regimen is montelukast, ceterizine, ketotifen. Use chamomile in high doses for desensitization.Black seed oil for pain relief as I cannot use nsaids. That can be used topically, but I use a lot of lidocaine/menthol rub for that too.\n\nCod liver oil for vitamin d, but you should get at least 30 minutes of direct sun exposure daily.\n\nL-theanine is good.\n\nI used to have great results with sam-e and l-tyrosine but somehow got sensitized to them. Same for vitamin C.\n\nBuy your supplements online unless you can find an independent shop nearby that does not overcharge for mediocre product. Never buy anything from GNC I take fexofenadine ( working well for generalised itching), nizatidine (stopped diarrhoea overnight, and at higher dosage rash is healing), ketotifen (has stopped 3am histamine dumps), quercetin (\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f), vitamin D, lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (supposed to increase histamine munching bacteria in bowel)\n\nit is made a huge difference - I was literally covered with a blistering rash which then would not heal, itched constantly, and had very sudden/ extreme bowel movements. \nI can only take 500mg vitamin C per day or I get bladder irritation  (Dr would prefer I took 1000mg as mast cell stabiliser and it enhances effect of quercetin)\nStill hoping something will help chronic migraines  Could you elaborate on the 3am histamine dump thing? \n\nBeen trying to figure out why I get terrible sleep for a long time now. I have no trouble falling asleep, but never wake up rested. The 2nd half of the night always feels like bad sleep, and I do tend to wake up in the middle of the night feeling very hot (and tend to produce a lot of heat as I sleep according to my partner). \n\nIs this a Mast cell thing? &gt;\tAllergic symptoms exacerbate during nighttime and plasma histamine levels exhibit nocturnal peaks. In mastocytosis patients, peak levels of plasma histamine were observed in the early morning with the lowest in the afternoon\n\n(\n\nanecdotally, many patients with MCAS have difficulty sleeping as their symptoms worsen 1-3am, because of this 'histamine dump'. Thanks for the reply! I will give that a read. I think you belong in the other mast cell subreddit Taking as many mast cell stabilizers as I could helped the most. Because you release hundreds of mediators while reacting, so just blocking histamine is not enough. \n\n ketotifen and cromolyn sodium are strong and prescription. You can buy compounded ketotifen in the US with a prescription. You can also buy ketotifen overseas without a prescription but not all places are reputable and give you a real product. \n\nOther meds: prostaglandin blocker like aspirin, antihistamine\n\nSupplements- palmitoylethanolamide is an otc stabilizer, magnesium for muscle twitching or tenseness and another very mild stabilizer. Ashwagandha works as a moderate stabilizer for some. Technically anything that acts on GABAa receptors is a mast cell stabilizer so I also take a benzodiazepine 1-2 times a week and NO MORE because otherwise it could make MCAS worse. Could, not definitely, but not willing to risk it myself. It is the strongest stabilizer for me though. \n\nOther options: doxepin for strong antihistamine\n\nCheck out Mast Attack guide for treatment.", "How is it possible to keep having anaphylaxis when we take all these drugs? How can my body even have the ability to keep reacting to things when I am taking such high doses of antihistamines and other medications? \nI genuinely cannot figure out how it is remotely possible. Xyzal, Pepcid, blood pressure med, cyproheptadine, singulair, PRN EpiPen and Benadryl, PRN OTCs for stomach aches, topiramate, Prozac, topical meds for psoriasis and hair loss. The list goes on and on. I am constantly putting something into my body to fix one thing while breaking another. \nSo,, despite all these things my body still manages to escalate to anaphylaxis. And, if it is still possible anyway, then what is the point of them if I am going to break through anyway? My meds do not work! Today I was eating lunch in my car to avoid a crowded restaurant, went to my office to work, and immediately got hit with symptoms. All things considered it was a \u201cmild\u201d episode for me. Still, 10 hours later I am exhausted and recovering from getting an EpiPen, IV Benadryl, Pepcid, and steroids. 10 hours later I am having symptoms AGAIN. how?! I took my nightly meds and I am on steroids! No anaphylaxis, but now my cardiovascular symptoms decide to play by bumping my heart rate to 118 and leaving me dizzy upon standing up every time I get up (no, I do not have POTS, my tilt was inconclusive). If, after all of this, I still break through, then what is the point? \n\nI am overloading my body every single day, morning and night, with limited reprieve and this is as good as it gets? I keep trying to make myself ok with the break through episodes and remind myself of how far I have come in treatment, but my doctors keep shoving medications we have already cycled through at me. Tried Xolair - did not work. Went off it for a few months and decided we might as well try again because what else are we going to do? I am 26. I do not want to overload myself with all these anti cholinergic medications and agonize over my brain health or worry about the maximum amount of steroid I can have so my kidneys do not dip out on me. I do not want to use Xolair again when I do not have a single IgE food allergy (I am allergic to one grass type in TX). \n\nI want my old, seemingly healthy body back. I do not want to be sick despite my treatments. I am so frustrated and I have a lifetime of frustration ahead of me. I tried to accept this diagnosis from the beginning and I guess I did not take time to grieve or something because I am so frustrated and tired. I am tired of being tired. This disease is exhausting and defeating. \n\nI am over it and there is not a single person in my life who understands. I get the same stupid questions from my family: \u201cwhat did you eat?\u201d \u201cDo you know what set it off?\u201d \u201cI thought you had ______ last time, is it not the same?\u201d \u201cMaybe you should stick to ____ for a while.\u201d I never know. Not only am I blessed with anaphylaxis but my doctor told me I am truly idiopathic. No triggers. NONE. It does not matter what I eat or drink. It will or it will not happen purely by chance. On Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Friday\u2019s TemperedChaos can eat apples, but on some Thursdays she cannot. No one listens when you tell them that there is no rhyme or reason why you are sick. You just are. Your body just sends you into shock when it feels like the wind it blowing in the correct direction. No one listens. \n\n\nSorry for the excessive rant, but I cannot really say any of this to anyone and have them understand in any real capacity. I do know there are good days. I have had really good periods, but I grieve for the days like today that sometimes stretch into weeks of malaise and degranulation. MCAS kicks my ass and I, for once, would like to feel normal without flushing when I am stressed, excited, or angry. I would like to eat without fear that I will have to drive for work and be too far away from a hospital. I would like to be 26 and as healthy as I was just four years ago. Do not forget to grieve folks or you will get stuck like me. The only thing that finally stopped my anaphylaxis was Xolair I am really sorry it did not work for you. There is a good chance you have underlying problems that have not been found yet. \n\nAlso another medication that helped a lot was lorazepam 1mg twice a day. High dose vitamin C throughout the day, &amp; keeping vitamin D levels in appropriate range have done more for my mast cell symptoms than any of the RX drugs ever did. Bromelin and serrapeptace have been helping some with airborne allergens, but have not tested food allergies (IgE) cause I like being alive.\n\nEdit to say that WHO rehydration salts helped the high heart rate issue for me. Might be worth a try even if it is not pots.\n\n2nd edit - have you been checked for alpha-gal or medicine fillers that could be triggering? I just read about toothpaste allergy :( I hope you figure it out or find something that make symptoms less severe Lol. All my food allergies are 100% normal...my doctor could not believe it. I was not that surprised because the things I need to avoid do not make any sense from a family of allergy perspective.\n\nI will echo the vitamin thing. I have had fewer reactions and seem to recover better since retesting all of the vitamins and minerals and supplementing. I was low on some things that had never been tested before: zinc and selenium, as well as vitamin D and C. \n\nBut I get the frustration. Healthcare has generally been like that....plugging a leak in a big pipe with duct tape, only to find out there are 142 other leaks, some of which are invisible. How long were you on xolair? I was on it for a year before I noticed a big difference. I almost gave up after six months, I am glad I did not. Just a quick note here. Careful with vitamins. I react to vitamin C. I think it might be due to the ingredients they are often derived from. So introduce them 1 at a time just in case you react to one of them. I empathize. I have been feeling the same way. I do everything I am supposed to and I feel like sh\\*t all the time. I wish I had a suggestion for you. In my experience only mast cell stabilizers stopped my major reactions I was on it for a few months but had to go off due to lapse in insurance coverage. I had anaphylaxis while I was on the Xolair, too. I am starting it again next Friday. Maybe it will work this time. Thanks for the empathy. I think that is all I was looking for with this post. I really try to be positive and accepting but sometimes I feel so defeated. I do not want to keep taking steroids or take all these medications that are setting me up for problems later on in my life. I feel desperate. Rx or OTC? I am negative for all allergies including alpha- gal. I have only reacted to medications twice. My reactions are mostly all to foods and some skin contact (recently bandaid adhesives but that is new in the last two months). I feel defeated because my immunologist told me he does not know what else to test for and declared me idiopathic. \n\nI will look into vitamins. I am vitamin D insufficient and tend to have lower potassium levels (once it was dangerously low and I was hospitalized). I just had a CBC drawn at the hospital yesterday so I will reference that. In terms of RX, if I am going back on Xolair I am going to try to down titrate on something and increase vitamins or OTC stabilizers. I could not tolerate cromolyn but maybe something else will work. It is so frustrating. \n\nLet me think...ok, things that might help that you did not mention:\n\nQuercetin\n\nTested for or tried eliminating foods high in oxalates, lectins, or salicylates? (Vs just histamine)\n\nDAO\nBetaine HCL\nButyrate\nEnzyme supplement\nLuteolin\nAspirin therapy (maybe worth trying)\n\nThe only other thing I can think of is that you could be reacting to things other than foods and not know it yet. (Fragrances are one if the worst things for me. I have a reduced sense if smell so I do not notice them until my throat starts to get that itchy feeling. It is awesome, lol.)\n\nI hope something helps you!!!! You should do the gupta limbic system retraining. Your symptoms do not make any sense, so you are perfect for it. You cannot identity consistent triggers because you are probably reacting to yourself. Get away from as much stress as possible and do it. My mast cell issues are gone and I am not even histamine intolerant anymore. It works. Thanks for this. I will mention this to my dr when I see him next week. I will also check out the supplements. I am CKit neg but I saw some other genetic tests online that I could look into as well Good idea. I had not thought about the genetic tests! \n\nThis? I have never heard of this before. I will have to look into for sure. Ugh, that is terrible! Allergic to steroids here, and have heard of benadryl allergies too. I got Cromolyn on that list! It gave me full on anaphylaxis. Nothing is safe! Sorry you have to go through that. Steroids must be hard with MCAS. Yeah, super fun to be allergic to what drs give you before they bother reading your chart. Do not even know for sure if it is a mast cell issue or just IgE issue, as I have up to 50 IgE allergies that show up on blood tests, so hard to tell if it would go away if I could successfully avoid everything, or if another something that I am being exposed to all the time is causing issues (like people who seem to be exposed mycotoxins or something else on a continuous basis and think it is idiopathic) I just had a conversation with my dad today and we think he may have a mild undiagnosed case of MCAS. If he does maybe a genetic link could be an answer for me. If you are allergic to bandaid adhesive, you should try to pin down what chemical, as some of the chemicals are in a bunch of things like floor finish, cleaning products, paper, etc.  Good thought! You are a nice person. I am echoing the quercetin. My MCAS doctor is very into it, he says it is more researched in Europe. I have had far better MCAS flareup control with quercetin then any of the heavy hitting RXs, in terms of daily symptom relief. Cromolyn also did not work for me.\n\nI also want to share that I too suddenly had an ongoing MCAS flare at around age 22, and for 3 years I really felt the same as you. It felt so lonely and so difficult to imagine a future when I had to plan ahead for something as simple as driving to the grocery. However I should clarify that my symptoms were not as severe as yours, and my food allergies seemed to track with higher histamine foods (except for a few random one-offs, like gluten and cantaloupe, those two I think I will stay away from permanently). \n\nThe biggest helps for me were: prescription strength probiotics (70-80% of your immune system is in your digestive system, and there is a growing body of research showing how a healthy gut microbiota is key to fewer allergies), \ngetting my vitamin D and zinc up, \nconsuming natural DAO and vitamin A in foods like pea shoots, grass fed local animal organ meats 2-4x a month, lots and lots of carrots and sweet potatoes,\nremoving myself from a toxic familial situation with the help of a therapist, \nand doing a lot of work in body-based/somatic therapy (which has you tune in with your bodily reactions to sources of trauma and stress, to help your brain relearn new ways to process things without bottling it up and suppressing it. There seems to be a link between big stressor events and onset of MCAS, this is even mentioned in Dr. Afrin's book). \n\nI also moved out of moldy, dusty housing with a roommate that smoked, to an apartment that had been recently renovated and a nonsmoking roommate, so I think that also played a role. I used to not be able to smell campfire smoke without my face and mouth swelling, now I can with no issue, as an example of one of many improvements.\n\nThere was a period of time when my symptoms were at their worst, when I was eating a strict list of 22 or less \"safe\" foods, and taking several meds and OTC supplements a day. I felt ridiculous with all the bottles on my college desk. Even so, sometimes you need them to get through the flare, and once your immune system heals a bit and calms down, you can work with your doctor to begin tapering off them. I would say that period lasted for about a year of intensive, confusing symptoms with a lot of ER visits, followed by a period where I made progress very very slowly, adding one new food every few months, or finding I did not react to smelling gasoline in the garage anymore. \n\nSome resources I have referenced on living with MCAS and similar allergic conditions: Mast Attack Blog, Allison Vickery, Healing Histamine. Can I PM you about this? Thank you so much. I really appreciate hearing about  your experience and the references. I did have a period of stress that accelerated my symptoms and it seems I have been battling waves of degranulation and flares for the last two years without a real handle on them. I will look into your references and dietary habits. I am willing to try anything. Thank you I think I need to ask my doc to look outside of food allergies. He is never considered other triggers. Combination. I take ketotifen oral (which I actually buy OTC from Japan because it is cheaper), cromolyn sodium, and palmitoylethanolamide (otc). I also take 1-2x a week a lorazepam which is probably the strongest stabilizer but risky if taking any more often than that. People underestimate how important stabilizers are and often stop at one. \n\nAntihistamines do not stop the reaction, which releases hundreds of mediators aside from histamine. \n\nIf throat swelling is an issue in particular and the stabilizers do not work you could try an antileukotriene like montelukast that is supposed to help with swelling. Yep. Well, I am not familiar with dr. Hedberg but the gupta program he is discussing is the same. My new doctor recommended it to me as well as similar lifestyle changes a couple of months ago. Changed everything. Sad that over the years no other doctor mentioned it, not even the functional med docs. I was in the hospital and had no quality of life anymore, just wanted to die i was so sick. Now I have no symptoms at all. It is ridiculous the change was almost immediate. None of my symptoms actually came from the food, chemicals or environment. My body was just reacting crazy to all that stuff, really everything and nothing back then. Now I can eat almost everything and the chemicals and smells do not bother me at all. Had to get rid my stress and address depression in order for it to work though. Sure yea took me about 6 months also before it kicked in. Thirding the quercetin. Fortunately I can tolerate cromolyn but the quercetin also has a noticeable impact on top of it. If you have a functional medicine practitioner, they will often run tests on chemical sensitivities that an immunologist might not and then you can take the info to the immunologist in addition to doing environmental remediation. It is how I figured out what I was reacting to in tap water. I am really sorry for you &lt;3  \nDo not know if it is of any help, but have you thought about having ige-dependent allergies on antihistamines and other anti-allergy meds?   \nI do not have the kind of problems you are speaking of, but I have had plenty of drug sensitivities and allergies, not only connected to my mastocytosis. So when I had a huge flare up few years ago, I coudn't take almost any kind of drug, because that made my masto reactions even worse. In fact, I also coudn't eat almost anything. And yet after many months on the diet I have still reacted after food. Only when I eliminated the last thing (everything connected with yeast), very, very slowly I have started to feel better. I also radically avoid stress when I only can. These lifestyle changes helped me much better than meds, which in reality made me worse. Thanks for this. I hit a new low with my depression when I wrote this and I feel kind of dumb for penning such a \u201cwoe is me\u201d post. I am just stuck waiting for a specialist in Boston to accept my case because my doctor does not know what to do with me anymore. I think feeling this way is totally understood in your situation. In fact, we are all here looking for support. These MCAD diseases are so crazy, and symptoms can be exhausting on so many levels... Good luck with this new specialist. I hope you will feel better. Maybe you need to try a new med. I know its exhausting but it will be just that, until you find the one that works to stabilize your body. Cromolyn is the one that works for me. I have a severe form of mcas myself and have I would say hundreds+ of triggers. I can count maybe less than 20 foods that I can eat safely. \n\nThat being said, Cromolyn is the one thing that keeps me stabilized and stops my anaphylaxis. It stops pretty much any of my reactions, or lessens them greatly.  I still take full daily over the counter antihistamine regiment and have an inhaler. All of these things combine keep my body stable. But the without the Cromolyn, it still did not have a great quality of life and could not work it have a normal day out of the house. \n\nSo keep looking for a stabilizing med like that to add to your regiment. Good luck friend. I had a lot of yeast in my body, which triggers histamine reactions &amp; I know a few people who are severely triggered by mold. So for me it is like the food piles on, I tolerate it some days and I guess I am overloaded on others when I cannot tolerate the same thing. Makes it hard asl to figure out what I can eat though. Do you take kidney pills before eating anything with histamine?   I would try having a very restricted histamine diet and whenever eating anything with histamine to take kidney pills.  \n\nHas anyone showed you the histamine diet list.  This is considered the best one.  1 has lower histamine, 3 has major histamine and will cause worse effects.  \n\nH next to foods stands for histamine.  \nL stands for liberator foods, which means that even if kidney/ DAO pills are taken 15 min before eating that you can still get a reaction because liberator foods trigger mast cells.   Brand of kidney that is great is Ancestral Supplements but I am trying to find a cheaper brand that is hopefully as good.  \n\nThe only things I really eat with histamine and kidney pills for are steak / beef/ poultry for a treat.  Some places eating out at are better I think because of course some of their meat is older than others.  The more older it is the more histamine it is grown, the more kidney pills needed.  So it is always a guessing game how many kidney pills are needed.  \n\nThere is veggies that should not be eaten at all: eggplant, spinach, I think one other that I forget.  Most other veggies are ok.  But then if an acceptable veggie / fruit on the ok list is old/ ripe it too can grow histamine.   \n\nDiet list that is not 100% for everyone.  Still need to test foods.  Like blackberries are not good for me but they are supposedly ok on this list.  This list is from Germany so they might have different varieties of foods.  Lundberg rice is a very safe rice, got it from a tip from someone here.  Lots of other rice is not well tolerated.  \n\n", "Recommendations for Quercetin? Just wondering which brands people are taking. Most of my supplements are pure encapsulations yes, this is my go to.", "Concerning symptoms after eating This has happened 3 times. The first time after drinking a beer. The second time after drinking a cocktail. The third time after eating pizza. I had no problem with these foods before \n\nI start getting a cold sweat, then nauseous, my heart is racing, then I throw up (sometimes diarrhea) and it feels like my blood pressure drops. I do not remember any skin symptoms This sounds like it could be an allergic reaction. Keep a food diary and log your symptoms. Take them to your Dr. My doctor said it was allergic reaction after it happened with alcohol, but now it is happening w pizza too Sometimes reactions can be delayed or trigger for me when I eat another food later. A journal of what you ate that day may help you see a pattern versus thinking it is multiple food allergies. You can also be correct about it happening with more and more foods. A journal helps me discover more patterns than my memory does. The reason I went to this sub is bc my doctor thought it had to do with the histamines in alcohol. I am afraid to eat now All three of those are high histamine. I cannot have any of those or make alternatives  I assume bc of tomatoes in pizza? The yeast/ fermentation of the dough, the parm cheese, any cured meats. Fresh mozzarella is good but not all. Avoid preservatives and eat fresh organic gluten free to avoid flares. I have not been able to drink alcohol for a few years now. Same with pizza. Gluten, dairy and tomatoes all mess me up. As others have said, keep a food journal. I am down to 6 foods I can eat. Do an elimination diet and try to figure out what foods are safe. Organic is better. Also avoiding processed foods. I understand being afraid. For me personally, I have cut back on processed foods for a few days to try to stop reacting. I eat things like plain chicken, rice, steamed veggies, etc. Anything that is a whole food and not processed. Avoid seasoning on foods as well because those can be irritating for people with mast cells disease. This is not a strict permanent diet. This is to get you feeling safe again when you eat. \n\nYou can also look up high histamine foods while you are at it. Avoid those during your break from processed foods, so avoiding things like spinach and bananas. There is a more strict approach to a low histamine diet for people with mast cell disease that includes avoiding leftover foods or making sure you are getting meat that is flash frozen so they do not produce histamine in your fridge. That is a more extreme approach and I do not know that it is warranted right now. I have MCAS and I do not seem to react to foods based on how much histamine is in them, so cutting out high histamine foods did not make a difference for me. Cutting out processed foods works better for me. You may need to try a low histamine diet in time, but I do not think you are there yet. I have also heard some doctors mention that a Mediterranean diet is good for cutting down on processed foods. Be careful of alcohol and tomatoes if you try to find Mediterranean recipes. \n\nThere was a time I thought I was reacting to a lot of foods and I could not figure out a pattern. I had to think of everything I was consuming or using. It turns out I was actually reacting to my toothpaste, so I had reactions no matter how much I restricted my diet. I changed my toothpaste to the Biotene brand based on a recommendation from my allergist, and I changed to a waterpik for flossing because I was reacting to dental floss a few months later. Think of pills you are taking, lip products you are using, etc. \n\nI hope your are wrong about reacting to pizza, for your sake. I have not been able to have tomato sauce for about a year and a half, and it makes me sad. Hopefully restricting your diet for a few days helps you get more clear answers. Yeah and it is like sometimes I can have those things. I already have to avoid greasy foods bc I have reflux, the pizza was a mistake. I do not have any problems with bananas or spinach afaik. I ate like 3 bananas yesterday and feel fine lol\n\nSo far just alcohol and greasy, storebought pizza. Right now it seems mild. I do not think I am having any reactions at other times. Just those two things. I hope it does not get worse bc I love food\n\nI am catastrophizing and worrying about not being able to take medications I need Fuck. That sucks. I am sorry for how this sounds but I really do not want that to be my future. This just started for me last month. \n\nI actually eat a lot of dairy and never have problems. I find it is one of the foods that always makes me feel ok along with things like rice and chicken A lot of people with mcas end up like me, hopefully you will not. I started having problems in my 30's and I am 52 now. Allergies get worse as you get older. I am 21 I also have narcolepsy. My fear is that the treatment for one will trigger the other. I have my whole life ahead of me right now and I want it to be relatively normal\n\nI am ok if I have to start eating a restricted diet but I just do not want things like reacting to medicine or shampoo or whatever Yeah, I totally get that. My kids started having problems in their early 20's as well. Figuring out what foods are a problem and avoiding them will help a lot. My kids drink gluten free beer,cider and potato vodka. Maybe try those and see if you tolerate them better. I had fewer problems with alcohol free beer so I figured it is the alcohol my body was reacting to. Cider\u2019s been my main drink for years. Although tbh I think I have had reactions to alcohol/beer gradually increase over the years. At first it was flushing when I was not drunk or anything \n\nObviously one of my fears is that this is like a liver issue or something serious but my doctor seemed to think it was a mild mast cell issue, but I would have to go to another to confirm I also have an anxiety brain sometimes. If you are worried about not being able to take medications you need, worst case scenario is that you need to get the medication compounded because you react to fillers like lactose. They make the pills custom for you without your allergens. That is actually fairly straightforward to do if you have an allergy. My insurance does not cover my two meds, but they end up being maybe $30/month each. Some insurance companies do cover compounded meds. I cannot take some meds like specific cold medicine brands because of the fillers, but I have survived for a few years without them. If the med is worth it and you are not allergic to the active ingredient, there is a way. \n\nWith alcohol, is it the same brand and same alcohol every time? Or different brands and types of alcohol, like beer one time, wine another? Also, it might be a specific ingredient in the store bought pizza like a preservative or something. My mast cellness is weird - I cannot usually tolerate any ice cream except for Dairy Queen and Chick-fil-A vanilla ice cream. Do not know why. Cannot narrow down an ingredient. But I will keep eating those ice creams until I cannot anymore. Bodies and allergies (or \u201ctrigger foods\u201d with mast cell disease) are weird\n\nEdit: I also love food. I have a very restricted diet now from MCAS, and there are only a few foods I really miss. Once a food makes you sick enough, you kind of stop craving it. Or your body stops liking the smell as like a defense mechanism. It mostly becomes inconvenient to eat in social situations or getting sick when traveling, but otherwise, humans are surprisingly adaptive. Hopefully you do not continue to react to new foods and you only have to worry about alcohol and a random pizza brand. It is most likely mast cell related. I quit drinking because eventually I would get sick after one sip of alcohol. The fact that I reacted to a food that was non alcoholic seems to suggest that, yeah Thanks. I am not optimistic but I am trying not to freak out. I just want it limited to foods I can avoid. I see all this stuff about avoiding lights and cleaning products and all that shit\u2014 I feel fine 99% of the time, just have these episodes. I do not want to live off the grid or anything extreme. I just hope it can be treated\n\nI already have narcolepsy I think I am prone to autoimmune diseases (if this counts)  The good news is the dr will get you on a regimen of medication to make eating less scary. I started with issues over a decade ago. Peaked with a year of almost 10 hospital trips for anaphylaxis.\n\nNow I am stable. Have not been to ER in 3 years. We have lists of what I can have safely. But some days that list is useless because my immune system is so mad. Those days get fewer and farther between the longer I follow my drs instructions and stick to my meds.\n\nSometimes this means premeditating for meals. If I am stressed I sometimes take Benadryl before I eat riskier things. I have never had anaphylactic shock but terrified of that. Just GI symptoms and blood pressure drops Mast cell disease is not autoimmune, but we tend to be in the same ballpark of having multiple problems and weird lives. Doctors do test a lot of us for autoimmune disease first because there is a lot of symptom overlap. \n\nFor me personally, I do not avoid anything I do not have to. I have tried cutting some things out, and if there is not a noticeable improvement, it is not worth avoiding. Say this is mast cell disease, everyone has different triggers and those change over time. There is not really a diet that works for everyone, so most of us just avoid our unique trigger food list while we try to get our medications balanced. I personally have been developing longer lists of trigger foods for about seven years, and I would not have described myself as being affected by a chronic illness until the last year and a half or so. I felt normal besides having to avoid food. There was over a year where I had almost daily mast cell symptoms, and now I have actually been able to eat more foods and I would not say I feel chronically ill anymore. I have been able to work full time and be physically active this entire time. Most people in my life do not know I actually have a medical condition because my life is so normal. \n\nWhen it comes to avoiding certain things for mast cell disease, you do you. For example, I cannot tolerate foods that contain disodium EDTA, but I can tolerate lotions and beauty products with it because my MCAS does not have skin involvement. I do not have sensitive skin at all, so I do not bother to avoid any of that. I tried to cut all kinds of stuff out from beauty products for a month and did not notice any change at all, even when I started using those products again. My triggers personally are foods and then exercising while it is hot (heat alone does not bother me and exercise in a comfortable temperature does not bother me). Every person is unique. Seriously, listen yo your body. Avoid what it is telling you to avoid. Elimination diets do not help me because I can do an elimination diet for two months and then develop a watermelon \u201callergy\u201d two weeks later that the elimination diet did not catch. \n\nIm hoping you just have some straightforward allergies. You may have a histamine intolerance and not mast cell disease, which seems easier to manage. You may have another condition that has a straightforward treatment. The most important things are listening to your body and trying to find a doctor who you trust. Take pictures of visible reactions, document things by writing them down, so whatever you can to establish a record of what is going on because patients seem more credible to doctors if they document things rather than just go in and tell them that they are having allergic reactions to everything. Even with a diagnosis, some doctors do not listen to me and prescribe me medication with inactive ingredients that cause anaphylaxis for me. You just have to find the right doctor who can be your main source of treatment. How soon after eating/drinking did it happen? Within an hour Hmm yeah it might just be histamine intolerance. I have to make an appointment, probably with a GI doc first because it is (almost) entirely GI based. Thanks for the info :) There is also like a small chance this is somehow just stress or anxiety. I mean probably not, but I did feel similarly when I lowered my anxiety meds a few years ago. I developed some agoraphobia, I would feel nauseous when I had to go to work or leave the house, and the fact that this has only happened outside my home interests me\n\nThe biggest difference I think between panic attacks and this is a sensation of blood pressure lowering and raising. Which I know you cannot technically feel, but it is basically like feeling woozy, tired, and cold vs feeling agitated, ready to escape, and hot. The sensation of adrenaline just is not as there for me w this. Or at least that is how I can explain. I have a problem with almost all high histamine foods. All the foods you mentioned are high in histamine. I get around this problem by taking Naturdao with every high histamine food I eat. It really is a wonderful supplement. You should look into giving it a try the next time you want to eat high histamine foods. I will check it out. I am asking this of every commenter but just the possibility of having this disease is really depressing me. When I google it I see people talking about being allergic to everything and having to be bedridden etc. And the thing is, I have had no issues besides these three episodes but I know it progresses. How are you faring? I have no issues besides skin issues. If I eat something high in histamine, or expose my skin to too much heat, etc, I start to itch, then if I keep up the exposure I will get a rash over my torso and then I will get tiny blisters on my torso and arms. It is very strange.\nI am currently awaiting skin biopsy results. \n\nNaturdao really is an amazing product though if you have histamine problems. It does not completely get rid of the problem, and I have to take 4 antihistamines a day as well, but it allows me to live a mostly normal life. Hmm interesting. I am a bit worried about the low blood pressure type symptoms but otherwise this seems \u201cmild\u201d bc I have only reacted to a few things so far. I guess I will see\n\nEdit: I am going camping (terrible timing) and will not be able to see a doctor for a week. Any OTC recommendations?", "Anything you have found that relieves the intense bloating? Not talking about finding the trigger (though I will) anything that helps during the episode? I know part of it is that I am ridiculously constipated but also my belly is tight and distended, I look pregnant. (That said, it is also just below the belly button which is weird). I also feel very, very full. \ud83d\ude44 I find that addressing SIBO by taking herbal antimicrobials helps me. Sometimes, though, the bloating is just MCAS related and all I can do is wait for it to go down. What herbals do you take? GI Microb-X. A simple diet.  Single item foods.  White rice first for a few days.  Then steamed chicken.  Water.  See how you do.  If it helps, add other foods and see how you do as you add them.  Obviously, if you have a medical condition that contraindicative of what I just said, consult a doctor first.  Got to keep blood sugars right, etc. in people that need to watch those things. I would suggest a visit to a gastroenterologist, they have been the only ones to help me so far with my stomach issues. Not sure what yiur diagnosis is, but I had to eat all the foods which make me sick before my scope, and gained five pounds in bloat. I have identified safe foods via elimination diet, but if you have a diagnosis apparently skin scratch testing will identify the foods you are having an IdE reaction to. I am sceptical, but the dr seems sure of it.\n\nHelping the constipation helps, too. If it is severe abdominal swelling caused by a trigger, try benadryl (diphenhydramine). I realized in my case it was not bloating so much as swelling caused after exposure to a trigger. It usually goes down about 30 minutes after taking benadryl. I get insanely bad bloating too... I just put on my first pair of thin, loose joggers the other day after weeks of nothing but loose jumpsuits and dungarees so I definitely feel your pain. The 3 things I find work best when I can feel the crazy pregnancy look bloating coming are: heat to my stomach (hot water bottle/bath etc), taking 2 swigs of an oral antihistamine (I use cetirizine hydrochloride), and the really weird one is putting in ear plugs (silicone ones from Amazon work well) ... I do not know why it helps but it really does. I hope one of these might help you too.", "Please share your covid vaccine anecdotes! The more stories we have, the better prepared we will be. I would like to know how everyone so far has reacted, where your baseline was just prior to getting the vaccine, along with which one you chose and the time frame involved. \n\nThanks in advance. I had Moderna. The first shot made me super tired for like 6 hours or so. I was tired and then it was gone. It was not that much worse than a flu shot. The second shot was hard. I had lots of fatigue, joint pain, muscle aches. Some possible nausea lack of appetite symptoms. No fever for me. No noticeable change in my GI. The worst part was that it trashed my endurance for close to 2 weeks.\n\nI did not notice any kind of mcas flare. I just got my second Pfizer shot yesterday. I took Benadryl before and after, as well as vitamin c and quercitin. no flare, just so tired yesterday. slept for 8 hours starting a couple hours after getting the vaccine I got J&amp;J during a flare up (I am always in a flare-up), I waited 15 minutes no reaction and was on my way. It did not hit me until a few hours after injection. Horrible joint pain (much worse than what I experience with mcas), cold chills and most likely fever, headache for 2 days and slept 15+ hours that night. My reactions were over within 48 hours. \n\n\nI will also note that my husband and MIL got moderna and MIL had similar symptoms after her 2nd shot, she does not have any autoimmune issues. Husband said his arm was sore for 2-3 days and is due for his 2nd dose in about a week, he has POTS. I have had one Astra Zeneca shot. I took a benadryl before, and had no symptoms the rest of the day. The next morning I had a 15 minute hot flash - very hot, and that was it. I may have had some extra MCAS symptoms, but it is always hard to tell. Baseline is getting skin welts and blisters from eating almost everything at present. Had Astra-Zeneca with absolutely no side effects. I have other autoimmune disorders so I was expecting something.\nHusband was unwell with fevers/ sore arm for 48 hrs after Pfizer, and son unwell for 36 hours with flu like symptoms after AZ I took the first that was available to me which was Moderna. Took the first shot around mid-day, by that evening I was feeling really exhausted. Slept in the next day and very tired and pretty fatigued all day, but it did not really provoke my mast cell symptoms. The following day I felt fine again. I did end up have a really bad reaction to my allergy shots one week later, however, and almost needed to Epipen and go to the hospital for steroids. I think my immune system was just in high gear and it was too soon after getting the immunization.\n\nAfter the second shot, also mid-day, I felt fine until right before bed and then got really tired. I slept 10+ hours and could barely drag myself out of bed. I had the worst headache I have had in years, body and joint aches, could barely move off the couch, could not even mess around on my phone I felt so bad, nodding off, a 101.8F/38.8C fever, chills. Like the first shot, I felt fine the following day after a full night's sleep. Did not have any uptick in mast cell symptoms until the next few days, and then it was only a few days and very mild before returning to my baseline. Oh, also my arm was very sore and tender for a few days after each shot. Even just turning over in bed was very painful.\n\nTL;DR: Overall, not too bad for me as far as mast cell symptoms, though my immune response was very strong and felt very bad for a single day after the second dose. My baseline is some mouth swelling and facial flushing at least once a day, and usually needing my inhaler if I leave the house.\n\nI got the J&amp;J because that is what my allergist said was safest for me. I took 100mg Benadryl 30 minutes before the shot. I had nausea and felt very warm after the shot. I took zofran, waited my 30 minutes and then went home and slept 20 hours. For the next week, I had nausea, a bunch of awful burps,  dizziness and joint pain in my ankles.  Since then, for the past 3 weeks, I have been having diarrhea after every meal, my soft palate swells when I eat almost anything, I am flushing and staying red for hours. Friday I got xolair and I also got a shot for pain in my hip. That night my face swelled and flushed and I got some very hard swelling in my neck that was making it hard to breathe.  Those symptoms did not go away, so I took 60 mg prednisone. Within an hour, I felt much better, no joint pain, the burning stomach pain was gone, the swelling in my face and neck started to go down. I decided to take the prednisone for three days to try to reset. I will know tomorrow or the next day if it is going to help. Right now I feel good. I had AZ in late January, it caused all the normal symptom I have (fatigue, nausea, headache, etc.) to worsen, but also caused a mast cell reaction. I had some hives and facial swelling, and my tongue was numb and tingly for a while, because of this reason, I was refused the second jab in the same centre (they were uncomfortable with me getting it done without full resus facilities as they are concerned about my anaphylaxis risk, despite my go ahead from my allergist), and I have to go to a hospital to get the second one. Still waiting for this! You had similar symptoms that my SO experienced to the vaccine and they do not have MCAS. This sounds like a robust immune response to the vaccine. Pfizer, MCAS well controlled, no symptoms except arm soreness. I did premedicate with zyrtec and took a benadryl afterwards. My SO who does not have MCAS had a much rougher experience with both vaccines...but they are presumed to have gotten sick with Covid earlier this year. I was 100% reaction free prior to the first shot. I normally feel pretty run down when I get flu shots, but I did not have that problem with the covid vaccine (Moderna). \n\nI did get \"covid arm,\" though. I developed a hard, red lump at the injection site that swelled to about 3 inches in diameter. It was warm, itchy, and tender for about a week. For the second injection, I rubbed the injection site frequently, as soon as I felt the lump forming; it never got bigger than like a half inch diameter. So I do not know if I just had a milder reaction the second time or if the rubbing actually helped. 3 inches is 7.62 cm The first shot I had that rush feeling, but then I was fine; no reaction other than the normal really fatigued and sore arm.  Second shot was completely fine, side effects were much worse.  I had a fever for two days, total fatigue, sore arm and freezing.  It was only 48 hours though and then I was perfectly fine. First Pfizer just arm soreness.\n\nSecond-- headache (not for very long), moderate fatigue, and a ton of arm pain and swollen lymph nodes (still swollen a week later)... no anaphylaxis though so that is good I was in a bit of a flare when I got my first Pfizer.  I premeditated with Zyrtec and Pepcid.  I was extremely fatigued about an hour after.  Followed by intense muscle aches, severe brain fog (I was calling it balloon head), sore arm, and fever of 100.  I felt horrible!  The next morning, fever broke and muscle aches were gone.  Fatigue, arm pain, and brain fog stuck around.  Two days after is when my MCAS flare started.  I was nauseous and dizzy.  Started reacting to everything.  Usually I will get 1-2 symptoms at once like a headache and flushing on ears, cheeks, chest.  But I was having headache, congestion, flushing with burning skin, hive on cheek, stomach pain, diarrhea all at once.  It was pretty scary, I have never had anaphylaxis and I almost called 911 twice.  In a desperate attempt to calm my mast cells down, I decided to try Xyzal and it has helped.  I am able to eat a few safe foods.  My doctor doubled my H1/H2 and added Singulair but I am scared to try it.  I had to push my second vaccine out a couple of weeks so I could try and get stabilized a little more.  I am scared to get my second shot \ud83d\ude14 I got AZ, because it was the first available. I took 25mg benadryl right before just in case.\n\nNo noticeable MCAS reaction to the shot. Some standard COVID vaccine reaction stuff in the hours that followed, though. Mine was really, really profound fatigue, some dizziness, a bit of nausea, and a decent fever. Most of those broke in the middle of the night after about 16 hours.\n\nThe fatigue kept on, though. It would come in waves, too...I would feel fine for a bit, then really, hopelessly tired. By day 3 or so, it was more of a background \"I am feeling tired today,\" without the big crashes.\n\nSo yeah, I would say to plan for a day or two off, and be pleasantly surprised if you do not need it. \n\nDefinitely worth it, though! :) Hi, curious, did you get your second shot? I also had a reaction to the first vaccine I am sorry that I am just seeing this!  No I still have not gotten yet but I need to ASAP.  I have a child in elementary school :(\n\nDid you get your second yet? Not yet! The first vaccine triggered moderate MCAS (asthma, reacted to high histamine foods). Allergy testing to PEG (which included going off allergy meds for 12 days...) brought me to zero safe foods.\n\nI probably had mild MCAS beforehand and did not know I was in a flare at the time.\n\nOn many MCAS meds and an inhaler now, which are helping.\n\nI am talking to my allergist today, again, about options for getting the second shot! If nothing else I will premedicate with benadryl and everything. I am glad you have found some meds that are working for you!  I need to make an appt with my allergist to discuss getting my second shot too.  Have you been able to add some safe foods back in? Yes! I have about 30 safe foods now. And even if I eat relatively unsafe foods, my reactions are not so bad - I feel lethargic for a few hours. I have not tried anything really risky though, just stuff like chocolate or ice cream. That is where I am at!  I caved for ice cream \ud83d\ude2c Okay so apparently if you eat a pint of mint chocolate ice cream and a 7oz block of aged cheese over two days there are repercussions, do not recommend :).\n\nI felt fine at the time, I am just more reactive to stuff now after the fact. Jeni\u2019s Salted peanut butter with dark chocolate flecks ice cream is what took me down lol.  I was fine after the first few times I ate it.  Man it is good.  Worth it lol Oh no I know not to mess with peanut butter \ud83d\ude1b", "SIBO + MCAS Anyone here have both SIBO and MCAS? And after \u201ccuring\u201d their SIBO, have they noticed MCAS symptoms go away? Just wondering if SIBO caused MCAS and if you fix the root cause, maybe MCAS will also go away. Maybe wishful thinking. I healed my SIBO but unfortunately the MCAS did not go away. I guess it was not the root cause. Darn, that stinks. I read somewhere that MCAS can happen from a gut dysbiosis. If not, sure would be nice to know why MCAS happens. I believe curing SIBO can help with histamine intolerance. Also maybe someone else had a different experience than i had. We are all different. The only things that have helped my MCAS are meds, supplements and avoiding triggers. As to where it comes from, i believe that is different for everyone too. I had a very mild version from a child, and it only got worse 5 years ago and i have no idea why. Yes, that is how it worked for myself.  \n\nExcept I only had extreme food sensitivities with itching and headaches for symptoms.  Not really MCAS.   But it spanned at least 10 years and got extreme in 2018.  December 2020 had extreme diarrhea, frequent headaches. \n\nBroke the vicous cycle with 7 day water fast followed with Tributyrin-X butyrate supplement, probiotics, nutritional support, and anti fungals. u/OldCanary how are you doing now? it helped, but curing my SIBO just helped to reveal the MCAS. I have mcas and had sibo. Knocked it out with Xifaxan. Helped my symptoms, especially gastro. But still have to take all my usual pills. I got sibo from before I was diagnosed and treated. After getting rid of the bacteria overgrowth my body was able to do it is thing and it has not come back. Getting rid of SIBO does help but not 100%. I also recently discovered a genetic predisposition to histamine intolerance so figure there is more going on there. MCAS is the reason of inflammation and the source of inflammation. Start either way but do not skip working MCAS drugs Oh bummer. It is so crazy how everyone reacts  so differently with these! Thansk for your input and hope you find a way to treat the MCAS! I would still call that a win since you tackled one of the issues! What are you taking for MCAS still? H1 and h2 blockers or supplements? I am on Quercetin and Vit C and trying to avoid and still figure out all my triggers. I have not done anything with the SIBO issue yet as we just figured out that is something I have...oh and H Pylori. Joy. Thanks for your input! I do feel like doing a genetic test has some value for sure. I am going to bring that up on my next appointment. 7 day water fast?! Kudos to you! I personally do not think I can do that. I am pretty small framed as it is and fasting might just tip me over to the wrong side LOL For sure, I would behappy to resolve something! I also found out I have H Pylori present in my stool so that is just another thing to figure out. &gt; For sure, I would behappy to resolve something! I also found out I have H Pylori present in my stool so that is just another thing to figure out.\n\nH. Pylori treatment is coincidentally anti MCAS Great. Have you had both before as well? What has been your experience? yes, it is being treated and is really stable. sadly, my real problem is chronic fatigue MCAS is shit, will not do it again \\_)) Sorry, I am not following, what do you mean you will not do it again? It is a review meme ) Meaning If I will reincarnate I will choose body without MCAS )\n\nAntibiotics are good, but Cromglycate is the best Its going really well, except for kefir milk that exposed my extreme magnesium deficiency with a whole lot of foot and calf cramping. \n\nEating some almonds for that and increase Mg supplements.    (Both kefir and almonds are higher histamine foods that were not tolerable only two months ago.) \n\nFood histamine levels is not something that I even think about anymore.\n\n\"Calcium causes muscles to contract, while magnesium helps them relax.\"\n\n\"Magnesium and calcium are paired minerals. Several studies have reported that increasing calcium in the diet significantly reduces the absorption of magnesium. Calcium intakes above 2.6 grams per day may reduce the uptake and utilization of magnesium by the body and increase magnesium requirements.\" H1, h2, montelukast, Quercetin, vitamin d, probably forgetting something. Also vitamin b &amp; c. High dose vitamin d (50,000 iu 3x week) has helped some as well, plus it is good in general. Many people have too low vitamin d. At least h pylori is an easy fix and you know you will get some more relief once it is fixed and any ulcers have healed if you have them. Then you can focus on the sibo. Xifaxan was amazing but super expensive if your insurance will not cover it. One of those drugs that often requires preapproval and review. One fill was like $2.5k if I remember correctly, with insurance it was $30. \u2018Merica what genetic test did you do? TellmeGen Has anyone on this thread that cured their SIBO have it come back? I have been dealing with SIBO off and on for a few years and it always comes back. I am wondering if it keeps coming back because of undiagnosed MCAS. Did you take all of your MCAS drugs while also treating SIBO? I was not diagnosed yet at that time but shortly after. After mcas meds to manage it never came back. I mention that because sibo often comes back according to doctors. I am guessing if the underlying issue that caused it is not treated. Did xifaxan help your symptoms before getting diagnosed? I just got diagnosed with SIBO but it seems like MCAS may be my root cause based on my symptoms getting considerably better when I take H1 and H2 blockers together. I am going to pursue the MCAS diagnosis after I finish Xifaxan. To an extent it helped, but that is only because the sibo exacerbates GI symptoms from mcas. Either way though, you will feel better after it is gone! After everything I got more relief after adjusting diet. Besides triggers that popped up on allergy tests, removing meat was a game changer. Now I can eat meat once in a while without discomfort and running to the bathroom 30 minutes later. Who did you see to get diagnosed with MCAS? So SIBO is probably not the cause of MCAS but makes it worse? It was an allergist. But not my first allergist. My first one did not believe is mast cell disorders aside from mastocytosis. But sibo did not cause mcas, it is more the other way around. The dysfunction allows for the bacteria overgrowth to happen. Then that makes the gi mcas symptoms worse. There are actual genetic mutations that cause a person to have MCAS like lack of DAO enzymes to break down histamine or a mutation with HNMT which helps clear histamine. If you have done a 23 and me genetic test, you have access to your raw data and can see what genes you have. \n\n(", "What are the criteria for MCAS and Mastocytosis? So I started getting itchy bumps on my face around 5 months ago, that come and go in waves.I have been combating it with claritin. It helps a bit, but not a ton. Sometimes it appears randomly even tho I took the medicine. They look like hives.\nI have somehow stumbled upon some reddit post where somebody had similar case and somebody suggested that he may have mast cell disorder (mcas or mastocytosis).\nI am afraid that I might have one of these, but what gives me the hope is that somewhere I read that multiple organ systems need to be affected at the same time in order for it to be mcas or mastocytosis.\nCan someone write down those criteria, and dumb it down a bit. My only symptom is itchy hive like bumps on my face ( my face ONLY). The medical criteria is a elevated tryptase, evaded plasma prostaglandin d2, or elevated histamine in a 24 hour urine. Also some doctors will diagnose based off symptoms and positive results from mast cell medication. That is more know as idiopathic MCAS.\n\nIf what of the blood tests pop up then that is known as MCAD which is disease vs syndrome \n\nThis is an excellent resource. For multiple systems involved it can be something like a misdiagnosis of IBS which is just GI tract involvement. Go see a dermatologist or allergist. Yeah that does not sound like it. Usually there is wayyyy more symptoms. Unless you are getting hives in reaction to almost everything- eating anything, pressure (dermatographism), vibrations (like from a car), temp changes, emotions. I would try to figure out what is triggering it keeping in mind some food/cleaners/bathroom products/detergents have a lot of weird chemicals in common that could be causing it. \n\nYou could still try a mast cell stabilizer since it works on allergies/sensitivities too. Like spraying nasalcrom on the affected area or something.", "Drs are so stupid.  On Twitter in late 2019, a lot of chronic and late diagnosed patients shared stories under the hashtag #DoctorsAreDickheads. The stories are heartbreaking.

In late 2019, I started having skin reactions to any type of pressure. If I touched, scratched, bumped into something, etc., my skin would turn red, become itchy, and hive up. Between 30 - 60 minutes, the redness, and itchiness would subside. I have been diagnosed with POTS (2019), and I have been diagnosed with Benign Cramp Facilitation Syndrome (2018). For awhile, I have been feeling like something is \u201coff\u201d with regards to my body. Doctor\u2019s always revert to anxiety. I finally found an allergist who ran bloodwork on me, because he suspected dermatagraphia/MCAS. Tryptase results came back with \u201cElevated Tryptase 14.8 mcg/L\u201d. Dr. Google suggests Mastocytosis. Is this accurate? How were you diagnosed? Thanks, everyone. You need a spinal tap next, I believe. It allows them to see if you do in fact have an increased amount of mast cells. Not particularly a spinal tap... The bone marrow biopsy goes in one of the larger bones (usually hip ...but I have seen them done in the tibia and sternum before). It greatly depends... If you meet criteria for a bone marrow biopsy to check your marrow for abnormal mast cells and mutations then that is likely on the table in your near future. Assuming they check tryptase ...again, before all that, which is standard procedure btw. \n\nWe do not know enough information to give you anymore specifics on what your doctor could do after an elevated tryptase like yours. \n\nLook up hereditary alpha tryptasmia; monoclonal mast cell activation syndrome; cutaneous and systemic mastocytosis.\n\nLikely your tryptase is not high enough for mastocytosis (systemic) but I would not rule out a bone marrow biopsy with your tryptase level for a potential diagnosis of HAT, MMAS; CM. \n\nThough, likely they are going to test you again first. Yeah, I have another blood test, tomorrow. Appreciate the information! I will look up what you mentioned. Yes! My bad. Bone marrow biopsy.", "Low WBC Count with Ketotifen? Hello all. My wife recently had lab work done and we had a telehealth visit with her PCP. Her White Blood Cell count was low, which has not happened before. Currently my wife is taking a low dosage of Ketotifen and we are working on slowly increasing it. \nHer PCP said that the low WBC count might be from the Ketotifen, but that we should speak with our Mast Cell Specialist about it in our next meeting, which is December 30th. \n\nWe just figured we would ask in here in the mean time. Have any of you ever experienced a low WBC count as a result of Ketotifen? Do you experience a low WBC count just as a result of MCAD?   \n\nThanks! Never heard of that would like to know more Yes, due to MCAS not ketotifen(I take Cromolyn). I actually fluctuate between being anemic and not. It is not due to any deficiencies, they tested me for those too. In Dr. Afrin's book he talks about several cases, in fact I believe he specializes in hematology. You are saying The low count is from MCAS? And not the meds? In my case, yes.", "Finally thinking I am not crazy I (24f) just got diagnosed with MCAS on Monday while in testing for EDS. I have had symptoms my whole life that I thought were normal or could not totally be explained especially gut related issues. Had a triggered attack yesterday that led to a bunch of things but I am now up realizing that that is been my problem all along. I will be starting Cromolyn soon. Just knowing that this is what is been happening to me makes me feel so much less crazy. No one could explain my symptoms to me until now. I really could cry tears of joy. I am so happy for you! I wish this diagnosis was available when I was that young, but yes, I have shed so many tears of joy since finding answers and getting treatment that actually works. Congratulations :) I went though HELL in the medical community. Hell. You know how many times I was told my doctor's it was just in my head? And even given Really BAD medicine that destroyed my life? I hate thst this is such a common story amongst all of us. funnilly enough they will never give the ones that actually helps your life. You guys ever try to get any legal recourse? I mean one doctor literally destroyed my life and caused me to end up in hell on Earth for a while.\n\nOf course I talked to a medical malpractice attorney and was told they cannot help... Diagnosis is so bittersweet\u2764\ufe0f It is amazing what we can adapt to. Hopefully you start feeling better. I (20F) was diagnosed in February after allergy retesting to restart the allergy shots. I felt the SAME exact way! Everything that I thought was normal was not actually normal, and had a perfectly valid reason for why it was happening. Congrats on your diagnosis! Thank you congrats to you too! I just like knowing what is happening now Discovered all of this recently and am taking meds for the first time that actually help! It is amazing", "Could a non-stop rash going on for 3 month be signs of Mast Cell Disease?  I am trying to figure out what condition can cause a rash spread in the whole body (not just one body area) for over 3 months. Rash characteristics: no ulcerative, no oozing, raised wheals and flat wheals, pinkish color to light red. Individual size can go from 5mm to 3 cm Each lesion last for 5 to 7 days and leave purplish/brownish mark. They itch, and sometimes burns or sting. They go back and forth. Currently using Mometasone ointment to relive swelling and itching but this thing is not going away.\n\nCurrent conditions: IgA+, ANA+, no smoker/drinker, no drug use, glucose ok. Not known underlying condition so far. No current changes in life style. Symptoms started after traveling to tropical place in Mexico and after I got the flu vaccine. One of my doctors thinks this could be a viral post-autoimmune reaction to something (probably to a tropical insect bite or the vaccine itself), but since it has been for over over 3 months she suspects liver disease, autoimmune disorder, or even but less probable, early signs of cancer. Can you relate?\n\nVisited Dermatologist but he could not find anything special on the skin itself, so he also thinks this could be something internal. It does respond to Prednisone, but get worse when I stop. Any ideas?\n\nmore info ( I am NOT a doctor. I do hobby study medicine though, and I have had mastocytosis for almost 5 years.\n\nANA positive is seen in autoimmune disorders. It also is known to give false positives too, so if it has not been rechecked, get it rechecked. Rashes can come from so very many disease processes, but with it lasting for so long and given what you have shared, I would strongly urge you to seek another opinion and get a doctor who is interested in helping you get the answers you seek. \n\nThere are specific things that can be tested, like your tryptase levels, to see if it might be mast cell related. I strongly suggest you see an immunologist because I have not met a dermatologist yet who is familiar with mastocytosis.\n\nBest of luck. &lt;3 Did your derm take a biopsy? Contact dermatitis can last a long time. Yes, but he said he did not noticed anything particularly special such as vasculitis. This is the result: The specimen is characterized by a superficial and deep wedge shaped perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes admixed with few neutrophils and eosinophils. Eosinophils also sparsely scattered in the reticular dermis. Spongiosis and edema of papillary dermis are absent. Thanks, My current immunologist seems novice to be honest. Last time he just said he would just refer me to rheumatologist even when he did nothing other than to charge me for two follow ups to see how I was doing. So unprofessional. (I am just a patient, not a doctor)\n\nDid he check for cutaneous mastocytosis? There is a special stain that is done to the biopsy for that, I believe. Oof that is rough. Unfortunately, you are probably going to have to go through a few crappy doctors before you find a good one. That is been my experience at least. The rheumatologist would be the person to address the positive ANA, but like I said, get a retest first. It is cheaper to get lab work than it is to see a specialist unnecessarily. All the best! I used to get a rash like that all over my body, from my scalp to the soles of my feet. Rash lasted until I took something like prednisone, but the rash always came back the first Monday after I quit taking whatever corticosteroid the dermatologist prescribed. This cycle continued for at least a year.\n\nDermatologist eventually gave me a biopsy but *said* it was not conclusive. She then gave me a patch test and the results were that the rash was caused by something in the air I was breathing at work. I changed jobs. So, in your case was something environmental. I have back home from the city to rule out any environmental cause and still is going on. Yeah, it is going to be hard, but the fact that this has not even subsided for a single day, not even one, is so worrying. &gt;cutaneous mastocytosis\n\nnot sure, I do not believe so. I will follow up with my current allergist, if things does not get better by the end of the month I will seek a new doctors. the problem is that to get re-tested I need an order from a physician, which is going to be tricky. I will first talk about the possibility of chronic urticaria or as someone said, cutaneous mastocytosis. Thank you for your wishes! Again I am not a medical professional, I have no idea if that is what you have, but in any case I hope you keep pushing for answers. Please do not get too discouraged by doctors who do not have the answer. Just keep going, you deserve to feel better. That looks like an uncomfortable rash, I hope you get relief sooner rather than later It was an *environmental illness*, but it was not *environmental allergies*. \n\nBe sure your doctor knows the difference because the symptoms, diagnosis and most effective treatments are different. oh sorry, I did not realized the sentence \"cutaneous mastocytosis\" was highlighted. I did not mean that I know for sure I do not have that. What I meant is that I am not sure my doctor did any testing to detect that. Sorry for any misunderstanding. I was unaware of that. Yeah, I have only heard of occupational-triggered allergies. Yeah I am glad you figured it out! I think I need to be more assertive when talking to my doc. Sometimes I feel that If I suggest something they will say that I know nothing and that they are the experts :( I had help because when I first got that full-body rash I was working with a team doing research on occupational-triggered allergies and my colleagues helped me figure out what caused my rash as well as how it should be treated. Hi, the brown spots look a lot like the cutaneous mastocytosis I had as a child. It was a dermatologist (specialised in rare disorders) who diagnosed me. Urticaria pigmentosa.\n\nDoes stroking the brown lesions cause a red flare/ reaction? mmm they are usually red 24/7. If I scratch it I just make them inflamed and get a burning sensation. yeah, the brown marks tell makes it reassemble mastocytosis, but my dermatologist said it could be papular urticaria which also produce dark markings. I do believe that this could be more related to mastocytosis, though. I just need to find someone who can diagnose it. Do you know or remember what testing did you undertake? According to my mother (I do not remember, as I was 3 months old at the time), he used Darier's sign (  ). The rest was textbook symptoms, so they preferred to avoid a biopsy. Shibebear, were you ever able to figure out what this was and if you were able to cure it? No, I am still working with doctors. We ruled out all autoimmune diseases after extensive testing, I am just waiting the results of my recent biopsy. I suspect this is either just a long-term immune response to an insect bite, or  according to some doctors, early sign of blood cancer :/", "Washing Reusable Masks - Without Adding Smells! Hi All,  \n\nI use reusable masks every day. I should wash them more often than I do - but I am hesitant because I HATE adding any kind of smell to the mask.  \n\nI absolutely avoid the washing machine at all because flatmates use it with regular detergents - so even if I use some special detergent, it still gets a smell.  \n\nThat means I have to hand wash.  \nThe best I have come up with hand wash with vinegar and water then let soak - but this is a chore and also leaves the vinegar smell - which I can tolerate but do not particularly appreciate.  \n\nAnyone have any tips for this?  \nBoth quick and easy cleaning, and effective (read: sanitary) but also fragranceless/triggerless cleaning agents? I use fragrance free detergent (tide free &amp; clear) and fill a freezer sized baggie about half way (or more if needed to submerge the masks) with hot water from the tap with some detergent, plop my masks in and shake it all up until it is sudsy. Let soak, rinse by hand, air dry or pop them in the dryer! They used to make unscented lysol laundry sanitizer that I would pop in there as well but I have not been able to find it for over a year \ud83d\ude29 A few drops of tea tree oil in the washer will fix this, without adding a scent. \n\nI tried everything: borax, baking soda, vinegar, the list goes on. Tea tree oil fixed the odor permanently, and now I add it to every load. It also kills dust mites and neutralizes dander. Hmm yes tea tree oil has come up numerous times in my various googlings over things in the past.  \n\nMy triggers are mostly plants and herbs. In fact I have a theory that my worst triggers all have antifungal properties - which lends itself to my practitioners suspicion that I have a mold colony in me somewhere.  \n\nSo theory goes that the thing in common with my triggers are they all have antifungal properties which disturb the fungus cohabitating my body with me, which then release toxins and trigger MCAS.  \n\nAnyhow - tea tree oil seems to be a good antifungal - will probably trigger me :S  \n\nWorth a test I guess. My daughter cannot tolerate any scent on her laundry. We make her laundry detergent from 8 oz olive oil bar soap, grated finely, mixed with 3 cups borax and 3 cups super washing soda, then use 1/3 cup per laundry load. It is turned out to be the perfect detergent for washing masks, no scent left behind at all. Spray or soak it in alcohol (=a good wodga is what smells least during application and is most unlikely to leave traces), and let ist soak in for 5-10 minutes before you wash it out. Alcohol kills most of the bacteria and also solves many chemicals. I use fragrance free dish soap (Seventh Generation), and hand wash at the kitchen sink.\n\nIf the mask has been worn for only a little while (like a trip to the grocery store), it will usually just need a wash and rinse. If it is been worn all day, I find that another wash &amp; rinse will make sure it smells completely clean before I hang it to dry.\n\nI just wet the mask and squeeze the water through it a few times, get some soap on my hands, rub and squeeze the soap through the mask all over, and then rinse it thoroughly, squeezing the water through to help rinse.\n\nSoap/detergent will kill coronavirus, but vinegar and tea tree oil do not, apparently.  \n You could consider washing once with tea tree oil to kill the funky smell, then once without to remove anything you might react to. Just a thought. Good luck! Tea tree has a very strong scent to me. It is also a big trigger of mine. Agree. But the thing that surprised me about this approach is that I could literally not smell anything of tea tree after using a few drops (not more) in the wash. I have tried tea tree oil for my shoes and the scent is VERY strong. I would suggest trying to smell it at the store to make sure that you do not react to it. Interesting. Thanks.", "Anyone in NC or SC? This is a shot in the dark, but is anyone currently being treated in the states of NC or SC by a great root cause functional med doctor? \none familiar with MCAS / POTS (+more) I am in WNC and have been really unable to find anyone - can only tell you who to avoid! My internist is the one that treats my POTS/MCAS because there is not a great allergist or other specialist, at least around this part. Appalachian Wellness Center in Asheville looks to be a great root cause focused place and specifically mention MCAS on their website, but the main DO has had sexual harassment and malpractice issues in the past - iirc his license was suspended at one point, never could find when and under what conditions he got it back! I do not have personal experience there but I would not go. There are a handful of good doctors in NC who have above-average (but still minimal) knowledge of MCAS/POTS  through their EDS patients, like mine, but I cannot say I could recommend anyone to treat mast cell specifically. Wish I could help!! ah unfortunate to hear. thanks for the insight", "Food replacement ideas? Hi all, I just got diagnosed with MCAS and I am now figuring out triggers. I discovered this morning that ketchup, or I guess really tomatoes are a trigger for me. Problem is I am one of those people who eats ketchup on like everything. Does anyone have any recommendations for replacements? I am pretty bummed out by this... Maybe try making your own ketchup? Im allergic to a lot of condiments, but if i make them myself without the added preservatives and sugars i am okay. \n\nSorry I cannot be of more help, I am not a ketchup fan so I do not know alternatives to it. Thank you! I might try that. I am looking for tomatoless versions as well because I believe that is my problem Is it the tomatoes or vinegar in the ketchup? I find I can tolerate tomatoes sauce I cook sometimes, the proteins are broken down and may have less of an effect if you do not have it everyday. I can not tolerate fresh tomatoes, melon, avocados and the list goes on so I feel your pain. My issues are subtle and build up vs getting reactions right away though, we are all pretty different but I suspect histamine build up occurs in all of us Homemade tomato sauce is not as much of an issue for me so maybe homemade ketchup could work! I do know that my tongue literally hurts after eating tomatoes on their own but I kind of convinced myself it was normal. I am pretty sure it is not so I do think it is the tomatoes. I can have vinaigrettes with no issue so I do not think it is vinegar. Ketchup has both tomatoes and vinegar. Vinegar (and other fermented foods) are a huge trigger for many. Odd I do not seem to have issues with vinegar in like salad dressing? Malt vinegar is a no go though so maybe it is both. God this condition is hard No joke! These days, I am on a mostly beef diet. I have really abnormal reactions too so it is hard. For whatever reason my body does not produce visible hives? But I get gi issues, itchiness, and like hay fever symptoms. The doctor was like yeah that is mast cell but I always thought mast cell symptoms were worse than this? Guess that is what years of medical neglect and gaslighting do to you. There are some recipes for AIP ketchup that I used for a bit. It does not taste identical but it is similar enough. I have seen a few of these, if it is similar enough it is worth the try. I mean ketchup made by the restaurant tastes different from bottled so it is worth the try. Thank you!  If you are interested in learning more about this, there are two resources you might want to check out:\n\n1. ( is an influential book in the mast cell patient community. It is written by Dr. Lawrence B. Afrin, who is an influential doctor working in the field.\n\n2. Afrin, Ackerley, et al. ( Diagnosis (published online ahead of print 2020), 20200005.  Web.\n\nThere are also a lot of other resources available that characterize MCAS, but what you will likely find is that the subject is both new and contentious, so the exact diagnostic criteria are still very much in flux.\n\nSome places you can find additional scientific reading:\n\n- (\n- r/MCAS\n- Wikipedia: (\n- The ( (this is a very narrow definition - probably more in line with what you had encountered)\n- Lisa Klimas's excellent blog, from the perspective of an MCAS patient with a heavy science, medicine, and pharmacology background: ( Thank you!! I am always interested in learning more about this. It keeps my anxiety down when I know what is happening!! Personally I noticed certain varieties of tomato's cause less problem than others (more archaic = better for me) For a while my daughter could not tolerate tomatoes. We used roasted red bell peppers as a substitute, but did not try making ketchup with them, because ketchup is hard to make.\n\nPersonally I react to most ketchup but can use Sir Kensington or HEB organic ketchup. Love this article: basically summarizes that just because you reacted today does not mean you would react tomorrow \n\n\n Try apple butter instead of ketchup. \n\nDefinitely works on burgers. It is also my substitute for steak sauce, BBQ sauce and in casseroles and soups that can be a little sweet. I buy it by the case because I have to get the kind without citric acid and stores rarely carry that. I love this idea...thank you!! Thank you! I have heard of this but actually I am realizing that ketchup and tomatoes have been a trigger for me forever just...did not know what was happening. My trigger is the vinegar (corn) and HFCS (corn) so I cannot do mayonnaise either and also use it instead of mayonnaise in some salads. I too love ketchup. I think the big thing is the combination of the sweetness and the tartness. \n\nSo if you were to try mustard instead, go with a honey mustard. Relish is also pretty good, like sweet green relish.\n\nYou can make pasta sauce out of carrots, you can make carrot ketchup as well  Thank you! I think making the carrot version is a good idea! It might not be the tomatoes. It might be the other ingredients. I did not eat tomatoes for 8 years. I make my own katsup and sauce now and I am good with them. Hi good with them, I am Dad\ud83d\udc68 I was hoping this was the case but tomatoes themselves give me the issue and so does homemade pasta sauce. :/ I am actually realizing my body has a bad reaction to a lot of fruit. Did not realize your tongue was not supposed to hurt after eating fruit...I am not necessarily completely giving up hope but I am pretty sure it is a trigger.", "Telehealth call with new allergist/immunologist Hello all. \n\nIt has been a rollercoaster of a week and I have gone back and forth between total anxiety and despair to elated joy and hope. I am going to go through the story mostly for catharsis. You should know 2 things ahead of time: 1. Its super rambly because my thoughts are all jumbled, and 2. You do not need to read the whole thing. Everything below the dotted line is all that is essential. Everything else is just filler detail.\n\nIn December, my wife went to a hospital in order to get consultation from doctors of various fields because she is bed-bound and unable to make in-person appointments. This had a lot of terrible effects on her body and her condition has continued to rapidly worsen since. However, one of the doctors we met was an allergist/immunologist. She was called in to the hospital but was only able to stay for about 10-15 minutes (she was technically not supposed to come in and had other arrangements but made it in anyway). This was a ray of hope to us because she seemed to have some ideas of what was going on. For the first time ever, we heard the words 'I have seen this before.'\n\nHowever, in order to be treated by her, we needed an appointment. We went back and forth with their office and sometimes it seemed like they were willing to do some stuff and other times it did not. They did do some lab draws (we have in-home nursing that can do labs at our house) and I know that the doctor has spent hours researching and consulting with other doctors. It seemed like we were on the cusp of doing some more labs and possibly getting treatment as soon as paperwork from another office came in - and then the coronavirus happened and their office closed for a couple of weeks. They then reopened but with spared staffing.\n\nI had been calling every day and getting only voicemail and I had sent a couple messages, getting a message about every day or so. The message I got on Friday was essentially, 'the doctor is not going to treat her without having seen her. We recommend she see her PCP, a dietitian, and a psychologist' (her PCP  does not know what to do with her condition and I have honestly lost all faith in him, she has been to 2 psychologists and both said they cannot do anything for her). I began freaking out. This was the one thing we had and at this point, my wife is to the point where if she gives up, she will probably just die - and something this detrimental might do that. So, I messaged back asking if we could make an appointment. This would worsen her condition - but so would doing nothing. \n\nI also called the next day only to find out that they were not accepting new patients because the coronavirus had forced this doctor into retirement for financial reasons. Again. I was crushed and my mind was whirling. Again this was bad. \n\nSo, I talked to the Office Manager about steps moving forward. She said they could send a referral to another allergist this doctor had taught. So I said to go ahead and do that, then I called their office to set up an appointment. I was dreading having to tell my wife that not only could we not see the specialist she had set her heart on, but that we would need to find *some way* to get her to the location physically.\n\nThen, during the phone call, I learned that they are doing their appointments via telehealth because of the coronavirus. Everything flipped. I did not need to find *someway* to get my wife to an appointment that was going to drain her of the strength that she has left in order to be seen, instead we are going to be able to see a specialist without needing her to leave the bed, or even deal with the triggers of other people. Huge blessing and weight off my shoulders.\n\n-----\n\nNow to the point of the post. What should I reasonably expect from this appointment? I know finding an allergist as a big part of treating mast cell a lot of the time, but I honestly do not know how they interrelate, and we do not technically have an official diagnosis. There is also the fact that, while telehealth means my wife can stay home, it also means there is not a physical examination of anything like that. Again, we have in-home nursing and a visiting physician so that might help, but I am just not sure what to expect or even what to ask.\n\nThanks! What helped me was seeing a functional medicine doctor who suspected MCAS, and then finding a specialist on my own, who turned out to be an internist with an interest in MCAS. Have you looked at the Mastocytosis Society website? They have recommended doctors - in the USA. There is also a Canadian one. I do not know where you are located. \n\nAs for what to ask, I imagine the doctor will do most of the asking. You might want to have a list of symptoms, triggers if known, and if you keep a log that would be helpful too. Good luck! I would be sure to point out any physical details they might miss on the tele-health video.\n\nSadly I have not had much luck with allergists or immunologists.  Most seem jaded like nothing they do will cure you anyway.  And why bother with that blood allergy test...cannot trust the results anyway (I had a doctor that offered a test talk about it like this).  My best experience has been with functional/integrated medical doctors, and I would look for one of those to see next.\n\nBut if it was me I would experiment with anti-histamines.  See how they make her feel.  Many are OTC and are pretty darn safe (many of us take 4 times or more the dosage on the packages regularly to get full relief).  There are some medications called mast stabilizers that only a doctor can offer (ketotifen and cromolyn), which seem to work the best for us all.  I have seen a bunch of slides online from various presentations and many list out typical symptoms and/or medications to try.\n\nThere are flavors of this where you can precisely test for a condition, but just because you get a negative gene test for mastocytosis does not mean the medications are useless.  Only way to know that is to try it yourself.  And some people react to the fillers or dyes, so it can pay to buy the fancier low allergen stuff at least to start with (before you know when stuff works and what makes you react).\n\nAlso foods can cause many different symptoms.  For me, I get swollen purple joints in my feet, ankles, and knees.  And GI reactions.  An elimination diet is how most people figure out which foods are OK or not.  Which I can say is really hard to stick to (only adding new foods 1 every 3 days!)  But can show you how you are hurting your own body with all these \"normal\" foods like PB and J sandwiches (I have IgE allergies to wheat and peanuts).\n\nIf this is her issue...finding what she is reacting to, then avoiding it, is the biggest solution I have found.", "Hi I was wondering if anyone ever experienced mast cell degranulation or issues with iodine contrast dye? I believe my neurological issues that started the day after ct contrast dye were dye to mast cell. I have developed small fiber neuropathy,POTS,ringing in ears,sensitivity to smells and foods. I did not know anything about mast cell prior to the scan and now I feel like I am slowly dying. Everything I eat screws me up,the nerve pain is everywhere and twitching,is there anything that can be done about this? I have only had contrast once and that was before I developed MCAS, so I really cannot tell you, but I have heard a lot of people do have problems with it. So is mast cell something your not horn with but you develop it? I believe it is genetic, that some people have a tendency toward having it, but it is usually triggered by some event or exposure to something, mould for example. I had it very mildly all my life but never knew what was causing the symptoms, then about 5 years ago it kind of exploded. I have not identified the trigger. Maybe some people have it full blown from birth as well. Oh yes well I think I must have had it my while life and did not know it but I had a cat scan that ruined me with dye,I have never been right since with neurological issues and stuff,why do not they test for these things before giving dyes it is ruined my life. \ud83d\ude1e I am sorry you are going through that. It is a very frustrating condition. I do not think they can test for it before giving dyes - it is a very complicated testing process and the tests are not often conclusive anyway. I was diagnosed more on medical history and symptoms than from tests, although I did a lot of them. Also it is a very newly understood disease, and most medical professionals have not even heard of it. It is possible that if the dyes had not started it for you, something else may have come along. There are many different possible triggers. If you can find out what contrast chemical was used, some of them can be chelated out of your body, and that may be some health Yes true,I will do my best to have drs look into it I am under the impression that this dye does not stay in the system like heavy metal dyes Some of them do. Looked into this when I have had to have CT and MRIs before. You have to do the research, especially if you are fairly certain that you have issues that started at the same time, there is a good chance it is related.", "Are you in the club? In light of the no diagnostic posts on the other sub I thought I would just say that most health related subs are focused on if you are diagnosed or not. If you do not have an official diagnosis then you do not count.\n\nId like to say that for 10 plus years I have dealt with pain in my head and neck, while also dealing with allergy issues which I would say was not as bad as the neck pain and migraines. \n\nDoctors have been looking at me for 10 plus years. When my neck pain turned into a neck fusion that never fused. Then a second fusion in through the back of my neck. Meanwhile I was having daily asthma attacks that I just ignored. \n\nI was having diarrhea and told I had IBS. I went on for a year having diarrhea right after lunch everyday.

I went on a low histamine diet which allowed me to eat more that just meat. \n\nI have no official diagnosis, but I know I have been through a hell of a lot and I am sure a lot of others on these forums have as well. We are all just trying to take our health into our own hands and away from these doctors that cant figure anything out. \n\nI may not be in the club of MCAS, but I am in the club of shit health. Yeah, I think it is unfair to exclude people without a diagnosis because:\n\n1. It is hard to even find doctors that are knowledgeable enough to diagnose.\n2. The diagnostic criteria are constantly changing and not entirely agreed upon.\n3. Even if you find the right doctor, the tests can be time consuming and often are negative even in people who have it. E.g., many labs do not know how to handle 24-hour urine samples correctly.\n\nI was incredibly lucky that my primary care doctor read \"Never Bet Against Occam\" by Dr Afrin, and she put it together. The labs she ran for me came back negative (except Chromogranin A, which is not specific to MCAS). She was still wanting to diagnose me based on clinical symptoms and response to antihistamines.\n\nI was skeptical about it, so I went to an allergist. It turned out that she was even more knowledgeable than my PCP (I got really lucky again). They ran the labs with a different lab (which she would basically trained to handle samples properly). I had elevated Prostaglandin D2 on several occasions and CgA on another occasion. That plus response to treatment is enough for a diagnosis according to Dr Afrin's criteria. According to some newer criteria, you have to have an elevation of tryptase during a flare over your baseline. I have never had this yet, so by some criteria I would not officially have MCAS. (I also have not gone in for testing when I am at my worst, so maybe I could still meet those criteria...  it just has not been worth it. I do not have throat-closing anaphylaxis, so generally I want to be at home when I am flaring).\n\nAnyway, that is a long story. But given my path to diagnosis, I feel very fortunate and I know that there are people out there sicker than I am who have not been able to get diagnosed, so I would not try to take on any kind of \"holier than thou\" attitude because I am \"official\".  \n\n\nBesides that, I probably have celiac disease (I sure have to live like I do) but I do not have an official diagnosis of that... but celiac disease forums etc have been so helpful and welcoming.  \n\n\nAnyway, I am really sorry you are struggling. Speaking of celiac - anyone with IBS should get screened for it (not to mention your other symptoms). Hopefully you have been checked for it? Anecdotally, I have met (online) a LOT of people who have some combination of celiac/microscopic colitis/MCAS like I do. Something to look out for. Most people with rare diseases do not get a concrete diagnosis for years. The average is seven years. \n\nI do not have an official dx yet. My allergist is convinced though and treats me anyway. It took me literally 2-3 years from initial onset of symptoms of (flushing, diarrhea, wheezing, anaphylaxis) to get an official diagnosis. MCAS / Mastocytosis have very similar symptoms to other neuroendocrine diseases so going through the gaunlet of every single disorder took time.  In addition to the abomination of the US healthcare system where insurance + deductibles + getting approval for every exam / test possible was nigh impossible - which delayed much of it ... including having insurance to fucking reset each year to do the same fucking thing again with a doctor in a new insurance plan. \n\nIf you live in the US and have any orphan diseases like MCAS/Mastocytosis ...it is going to take a long time unfortunately. But do not fret. Be your own advocate! Took me 30+ years to get a diagnosis... I know its a rare disorder, but when I started experiencing some of the more extreme issues such as extreme fatigue and extreme brain fog I got an incorrect diagnosis that honestly made sense at the tine -- post concussion syndrome and brain damage from playing football.   \n\nIt likely plays a role today, but at the same time, the biggest culprit I have found have been my allergic triggers. Getting mostly misdiagnosed really hurt me a lot in someways, but I do not regret where I am at now.  Being able to treat the allergies has made me feel like a whole new person with experiences I would likely not have. All I know is that this disease is hard to live with and manage and I wanted people to talk freely and diagnosis questions and just feel like they have somewhere to talk. The mod on the other sub went off the deep end and literately said go make your own sub. So that is what i decided to do. I truly have a Mast Cell Disease, I do not think the mod on the other sub had one. That alone I think is ridiculous and she was acting crazy deleting every other post if it was asking a question about possibly having the disease. \n\nI thought the whole point to the sub was for people to talk and to possibly find out and understand if this is what is wrong with them. \n\nA Place like this can be a great resource considering most doctors know very little about Mast Cell Diseases. \n\nI wanted people to have a sense of community here. I agree, the mod is either lucky, privileged, or simply does not understand what it means to have an orphan disease or disorder. It is pretty absurd to limit posts that do not have a diagnosis. People literally go out to the internet ... including Reddit (which is what I did) to seek help on getting a diagnosis. My doctor's were starting to think I was crazy when test after test became negative. I wasted a TON of money to begin with already trying to find a diagnosis and I think it is self-centered and and disingenuous to limit others who need help trying to find just wtf is going on after months of seeking out a diagnosis. Moreover, if you think about it a little more not being able to find support or assistance when everyone (doctors) think that you are crazy can be dangerous to the patient. \n\nFor example; After a cancer stint that was EXTREMELY difficult to diagnose several years ago and acquiring masto immediately after that was resolved, I was starting to give up myself (suicide) as the US healthcare system does not treat us too kindly. Now that I have a diagnosis, I just have a ton a PTSD of having to deal with any sort of healthcare related issue now.\n\nThat said, I greatly appreciate this sub and I truly hope that the other sub dies off I am favor of this one. Amen. Well said and well worth saying.\n\nI hope you catch your break soon! Thank you!", "Anyone here suffer from enlarged turbinates (nasal passage swelling)? Hi,\nOne of my most aggravating symptoms is that the turbinates in my nose are almost always swollen, esp after eating. If I avoid triggers it is sometimes okay but am limited to so few foods that it is not sustainable. I want to avoid surgery for fear of  Empty Nose Syndrome. I have tried NasalCrom (mast cell stabilizer spray) for a few weeks now with no success. Maybe needs a bit longer?\n\nAnyone else have luck with something else? Flonase and antihistamines like Allegra, Claritin, Zyrtec have little to no effect on the turbinates. Montelukast also does not work. Best thing so far altho not 100 percent effective is   straight pseudoephedrine but trying to avoid long term use of that stuff. Afrin feels great but obviously trying to avoid.\n\n\n\nThanks in advance! Yup one of my main symptoms. Singular has helped. I would check out cactus juice. A study in turkey showed it to be as effective as ketotifen as stabilizing mast cells. Nueroprotek and xyzal also help my sinuses Nasalcrom need to be used 4 months before evaluation I would not replace my ketotifen with cactus juice When did I ever insinuate to replace Ketotifen? This is just something easy OTC to see if it helps their sinuses Azelastine nasal helps me but beware it has a taste/smell that will not go away. Does not bother me, but could bother someone My son has to have outpatient surgery because his turbinates are so swollen. He has tried all the nose sprays and nothing helps. He wears nasal strips which help a bit. He has MCAS, asthma, and food allergies. He takes Singulair and several H1 and H2 antihistamines. You may want to see an ENT if nothing works. you are overreacting Projection happens When I read this post, I thought I might have written it myself!  This is one of my biggest and most frustrating symptoms.  I, too, am not a big fan of surgery because it will not treat the actual problem.  Treating it with diet works but like you said, it is pretty unsustainable, at least for me.  OTC h1 and h2 blockers have not been effective for me, nor have Nasalcrom and Flonase.  Singulair helped a bit but turned me into a zombie.  Cromolyn sodium (oral) has helped a little bit just by reducing my overall histamine load.  Ketotifen helps even more but makes me bloat :(  Still trying to find a good solution.  If you find something that works, please let me know!  My back up plan is to move to SE Asia :) Food is very fresh there.  I traveled there for a month a few years ago and felt the best I had in years. Thanks I will check it out! I was thinking of asking for this! Thanks! Been having problems getting insurance to pay for it but glad to know this has been helpful! No problem :) I have actually been looking into freezing (cryotherapy) the turbinates which is way less intense than the surgery but I am sure there are risks involved so will want to look into it more deeply and exhaust all medication options! Xlear is really good too but has grapefruit seed extract so that could potentially bother someone with citrus problems I know a guy who hung himself in March after having the procedure your son is about to have. Really hope he has better luck because empty nose syndrome is the worst nasal condition someone can have and probably one of the most debilitating conditions ever. Wow. Thanks. Have you tried azelastine? Not perfect but it helps me more than the rest of the things you listed, which also do nothing for me. (Full disclosure - I have already had my turbinates reduced and I do not know if azelastine would have been helpful before that, but it does help a bit with the one side that is still 50% meh.)\n\nNAC (at 2400 mg, but I take it at such high doses for ocd) also helps me a bit, mostly by reducing mucus. Thanks so much! I just asked my doctor about azelastine. I keep hearing about it...weird that none of the doctors suggested it so far (I have been to three!). I have never heard of NAC. Will check it out! =) Not sure how you are doing, but one thing has _kinda_ worked for me. I tend to get the issues when laying down, to where I cannot breathe, so it is really only a problem at night, minus the naps I take in the recliner from time to time, haha\n\nAnyways, for the past couple years I have been severely diluting Afrin in saline into a spray bottle with saline spray. This was recommended to me by a Doctor doing a study at UC Berkley, and my ENT says it has not damaged my nose or anything and that it was fine. I use like 5 parts Saline Spray and maybe 1 to 2 parts Afrin (the regular/mild stuff, not the severe kind). The doctor said you could use more parts Afrin, but I do not want to push my luck. I then take one spray in one nostril, or both if they are both acting up, with my nose pointed to the ground, sniffing, and then I wait 15-20 minutes. Your nose should clear up by then (most of the time). After this time, rinse your nose out with saline spray or whatever you use, then take two sprays of Triamcinolone (Nasacort) into said nostril(s).\n\nThis has given me a good night's sleep for the past couple years after I was hit by this crap. Hopefully it can help some others too. \n\nNote: your nose may become dry at times and exacerbate the issue, I notice this later in the day, but saline spray helps.", "Should I See A Doctor? I have CPTSD and since 2018 I have had on and off symptoms. In the beginning, it was insomnia, rashes on hands and feet, heat intolerance, twitching, burning on skin and mouth, eyes, weird body pains, presyncope (only passed out once) and others I am having trouble remembering.\n\nHowever, over those two years, a lot went away and I thought maybe I am just left with CPTSD and nothing more. But more recently the burning in eyes and mouth have resurfaced and some fatigue during the day. I am a little frustrated because I am finally address the CPTSD and making progress there but now the burning is back and it feels like this has nothing to do with the CPTSD. I have had every blood test imaginable, seen every doctor --- they at one point thought I had POTS, but autonomic tests showed otherwise --- so I am wondering who is left to see? And if anyone had something similar?\n\nI take anti-depressants now and occasionally Famotidine when necessary.  I have no other diseases or syndromes that I am aware of.  Does MCAD vary this much?\n\nThanks MCAD symptoms are highly variable. They can very both over the course of a person's life, as well as from day to day. Reports of transient asymptomatic periods lasting months or years are common too.\n\nAnd, the correct answer to every question is \"see a doctor\" ;)\n\nHowever, be aware that most GP's are not familiar with MCAS. Consider asking for a referral to an immunologist if you feel it is reasonable to do so. Thanks.  I will do that.  Appreciate the advice You might want to check out The Body Keeps The Score, if you are in a healing trauma headspace. The physical symptoms coming back could be related to something with your CPTSD. I have seen people say on reddit that mcas/d is a physical manifestation of CPTSD. And yes, always see a doctor. But you might want to journal your symptoms, foods eaten, and stress/anxiety to see if you can find connections and take that to the doctor with you. I have never seen so much bullshit", "Be Careful with Probiotics  Probiotics are tricky and something i had serious issues with since a lot of them Raise Histamine. So make sure to research what probiotics raise and help lower histamine. Can you recommend a specific probiotic for people with MCAS? Bifidobacterium which is \u201calign\u201d is the one I researched that is supposed to lower histamine. And from my personal experience it is the one that caused me the least problems. With that said I ended up getting off all of them cause they were causing issues and the majority of them raise histamine", "Diagnosis  Last week, I visited university hospital allergist and took a lot of tests. MAST 93 allergen test, UniCAP specified food allergen test, blood test to figure out whether my reaction is Eosinophil or Hyperthyroidism, X-ray to confirm allergic rhinitis and asthma.\n\nToday, I got a result, and everything was absoultely normal. Only dust mites was positive in MAST. Beef, Pork, Chichken, Gluten, Egg yolk, Flour, Spring/Summer/Fall/Winter Pollen(all kinds of fruits and veges), Latex was absolutely negative. Class 0 allergen out of Class 0 to 6. I only got prescribed 3 weeks of Levocetrizin based on the pictures of my rashes.\n\nHow were you able to be dianosed as 'MCAS'? Did the doctor diagnose you just by hearing your symptoms without a test? The first allergist I saw had me stop antihistamines for skin tests, but I reacted to the saline control, so the tests could not be done. He ordered blood tests for the foods I was reacting to. They were all negative. He suggested I see a psychiatrist. The second allergist I saw ordered blood tests for tryptase and for seasonal allergens. My tryptase was normal and the only allergy the blood test showed was one kind of mold. By that point, I had many photos of reactions and had been to the ER multiple times for reactions. I also kept having reactions in her office. She diagnosed me based on my symptoms. I know it sounds weird but I want to say that you are lucky because you can get diagnoesd and treated by doctor...\n\nSo how are you doing these days? My sisters and my daughters all have it too, so it was good getting a diagnosis so we could start figuring out what was wrong with all of us, and so my daughter could get the school accommodations she needed. \n\nI am a bit better than I was before diagnosis. I still have some scary reactions, but at least I have meds for them. I am on xolair, which has helped, except for the time I had a really severe reaction to it. I am still losing foods and I still cannot exercise. I have been sick about 6 years. My daughter who is on xolair can shower and brush her teeth without a reaction, which is a big improvement. I read about a lot of poorly understood illness with similar symptoms.  MCAS being one of them, Fibromyalgia, ME/CFS, IBS, etc. being some of the most well known of the others.  Diagnosis of all these syndromes happens based on set of criteria and not a set of tests.   \nAlso, diagnosis is usually only made when tests fail to show better understood illness. What you describe is typical.  People know there is something wrong with them.  The see doctors.   \nEvery test comes up negative.  Maybe a doctor proposes some lesser understood condition.  Maybe a friend or relative mentions the other condition and a patient goes out seeking a diagnosis.  \n\nIn the case of MCAS unlike other conditions, treatments are available (antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers) and the MCAS diagnostic criteria require that the treatments work.  So that may be the last piece for you.  Trying the treatments. any doctor who diagnoses mcas just hearing symptoms is a quack.  the symptoms of mcas are identical to the symptoms of allergies and overlap with the symptoms of many other diseases.  mcas requires *idiopathic* anaphylaxis and there is no way to know if anaphylaxis is idiopathic without testing.  \n\nmcas is a diagnosis of exclusion.  u are allergic to dust mites, which prob explains yr allergic rhinitis and is prob a trigger for yr asthma.  \n\nmcas requires discrete and severe episodes of multisystemic anaphylactic reactions.  there are a lot of quacky mcas diagnoses these days based on vague symptoms, but i do not know many peeps w legit diagnoses who have not been to emergency for anaphylactic shock or other severe rxns\n\n( is a real important article to read for peeps who are chasing mcas diagnoses without evidence of idiopathic anaphylaxis.  there is so much bullshit printed on the internet about mcas, but this really debunks many of the myths.  \n\n&gt;Most patients with MCAS suffer from recurrent episodes of severe hypotension (anaphylaxis). If this is not the case, MCAS may still be diagnosed, but is a less likely diagnosis. In particular, there is no evidence to support the existence of a chronic form of systemic MCAS without severe episodic events. Patients with multiple chemical and environmental intolerances or multiple food intolerances should not be diagnosed as MCAS. My MCAS was suspected based on symptoms and already diagnosed autonomic dysfunction, but the diagnosis was made based on those things and high histamine levels in a 24 hour urine test. My specialist, very much an expert in his field, and respected in the medical community, had me read this book: Never Bet Against Occum. It is never a bad idea to keep learning. \n\nThis is not the first time I have seen you post misinformation, and messing with the upvotes. I am sure my posts will be getting downvoted again by you, after this comment. Absolutely no surprise that you are follow illnessfakers- biggest group of diagnosis gatekeeping Karen's. Going to have to respectfully disagree here (as would Dr. Afrin). I have experienced debilitating idiopathic multisystemic reactions\u2014including airway restriction\u2014to temperature changes, sun, stress, medications, and all manner of foods for decades. Those symptoms respond only to (and can only be prevented by) large doses of antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers. Allergy tests come back negative and histamine levels are consistently above normal. That said, I have never experienced anaphylactic shock. My care team is operating under a \"presumed MCAS\" diagnosis.", "Vitamin B6 How much is too much? The tolerable upper limits vary wildly based on different organizations (see ( I want to be careful with this because I am very sensitive to vitamin overload (dealing with an awful one from vitamin D right now), and because the half life of B6 is so long.\n\nI would like to play it safe and only take 10mg a day, but I am having a hard time finding a pill in that dosage, or even 25mg, without dicalcium phosphate (which the SIGHI list puts at a 1 for histamine). What if you did not take it every day? Yes, this is my current plan. I am just not sure if I am maintaining adequate levels this way. To my understanding B vitamins are all water soluble.  So, if you drink enough water you will just pee out the excess.  Vitamin D however is fat soluble, so you can build to a toxic level easier.", "How unlikely is this disorder? I have some dermatographism, but nothing major and its not really all that bothersome to me, I have some stomach pains every so often, but once again, its not severe and usually not that painful and generally is not accompanied with any severe diarrhea or constipation. I have spoken with my allergist about this and he is aware of the condition and how to test for it so he at least knows about it, and he has stated that he believes it is highly unlikely that I have any MCAD and he even tested my tryptase, which came back normal, and which I believe he did to ease my mind. I work in a restaurant as a cook and am around heat, smells, chemicals, etc. most of the day, and it does not seem to bother me too much. I am also on my feet for 6-8 hours a day for 5 days a week and have little trouble being on them for that long generally. I do not seem to have any characteristic flushing of the neck, face, and chest. I stumbled upon MCAS and cannot really get it out of my head though. I have been to three doctors, an immunologist, my PCP, and a fairly young GI doctor and mentioned it to all of them and they have all stated that they believe it is highly unlikely. My PCP took all my vitals, vitamin levels, palpated my liver and spleen, felt my lymph nodes and looked at parts of my skin, really listened to me and what I was feeling, and told me that he does not believe I have any mast cell issue. I then trialed myself on double doses of H1 and H2 blockers for well over a month and they did little for me. I have been off of them for over a week now and I do not really notice much of a difference in how I feel, I definitely have not noticed any sharp decline so far. I do not believe I have had any severe, recurrent episodes either, but find myself wondering if maybe the things I am feeling are still linked. This is also a fairly new thing I am experiencing and I have not chronically been sick for years and was not really that sick as a kid. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am not looking for a diagnosis with this post, to be honest, I just know how much this disease can vary and I am looking for people experienced with it to perhaps read what I have been dealing with and tell me how unlikely it is this condition that ails me. This may be a selfish request, and I apologize, but I am having a hard time getting over it. The jury is out on how common it is. Some researchers say up to 17% of the GP, some say significantly less. Look up tmsforacure.org I am aware of this. I was just wondering about what I have been feeling in particular. Like how rare would it be with what I am feeling and what I am not experiencing? It is relatively rare; for example, while it says 17% I have never met another person with this disorder, but anecdotal evidence is not robust. I am not a doctor so I cannot be anymore specific than that. In general, if you are not meeting criteria (as listed on the site and various other research sites) then categorically your providers would rule it out. Diagnoses in any field have criteria and rules that must be in place before they can be applied. Listen to your doctors and keep a journal of symptoms and they can guide you. The severe form is super unlikely but I would not be surprised if the very weakened down form of it existed more commonly and we had not noticed. Which means it might not be worth figuring out. \n\nWhat is the point in pursuing this though? It does not sound like you have it or a severe form of it at the least. Why cannot you get it out of your head? What is your fear? From what it sounds like, your symptoms do not sound particularly troubling, many doctors have said that it seems unlikely, your lab work does not suggest anything, and the treatments are not helpful.\n\nI have seen quite a few posts like this and want to understand better: what do you think it is it about this disease that you are drawn to? I have told you in your other posts, I do not think you have it.  \n\nNot having it is a good thing, MCAS sucks and makes life much more difficult.", "Overheating at night \u201cDoes anyone else wake up in the night extremely extremely overheated?

I definitely go through temp fluctuations (go to bed cold and wake up in sweat) but I am normally cold. My SO is often hot and always has a fan on. The key is to circulate the air in the room rather than have it directly on yourself. Yeah I go through periods where I wake up dying hot. I have always been a cold person but in the last few years this started happening. I have mcad. So you ever wake up sweating but cold? Sometimes that also happens to me. How about a Chillow? I seem to be always hot right now until I wake up freezing. :)\n\nWhatever the trend is, I try to adjust using alexa-enabled outlet plugs. (Before we had Alexa spying on us, I used the plug in timers you use to make your house look occupied when you will be in the hospital for a while or on vacation.)\n\nSo right now my fan goes off and my heated mattress pad (my side of the bed only) goes on low at around 3M. At 6, that reverses.\n\nIt does not fix everything but it helps. I do. I wake up hot and with my heart pounding. Not all the time but I will go through periods. I control the thermostat through my phone so I immediately turn the temp down. I have my ceiling fan on a remote so I turn that up. Do you take anything before bed? My doctor recommended Zyrtec before bed to help with reducing flares while sleeping. Drink some icewater from the fridge.. its the only thing that helps short term you need to take 20mg or higher. 10 mg is too low of a dose. Personally benadryl is the best anti-histamine in general. As long you take one that crosses the brain blood barrier because mast cells are present in the pituitary gland. It is not recommended to take diphenhydramine regularly due to its dementia links.

I was not seeing much improvement but, as time went on I have I was starting to be able to eat without stomach pain, nasea, vomiting, palpatations, flushing, ect. And actually starting to feel better!\n\n Had an incident and got sprayed with bear mace a bit over a week ago, and now I feel like I have taken 10 steps back. I am waiting for my Dr to get back to me but, after getting sprayed I keep getting burning/itchy rashes on face/neck, (have not had chronic hives in a while over a year), I feel like garbage after eating again. And overall feel so fatigued, POTS symptoms are worse.. \n\nCould the bear spray triggered something? Supposedly it is like a pesticide, and my body is so sensitive to anything it seems like!\n\n What do I do? I am only 103 pounds and cannot go back to not being able to eat, I am barely staying at 103. Bear mace is usually capsaicin, which is the primary spice in chili peppers, jalape\u00f1os, etc.\n\nThat chemical causes stress and inflammation, even in people without mast cell diseases.\n\nI feel like getting pepper sprayed is going to send anyone for a loop, and intuitively it feels like someone with MCD will probably experience MCD symptoms and take longer than average to recover.\n\nI am sorry. Good luck... Oh noooo! This sucks It may be too early to state this since you started Cromolyn but I would look into Xolair down the road. \n\nMuch of my rollercoaster two steps forward, one step backwards reactions have pretty much stabilized. Do I still get reactions while being on Xolair? Sure, but I am playing roulette on whether or not a reaction will set me back to 2+ days. In addition, my reactions have been nowhere near where they were prior to Xolair. Okay I will ask my Dr! Have you had any side effects from it? Yup. The more reactions you have the more reactions you will have. You get more and more reactive.\n\nSo the thing to do is avoid every single trigger you have and hope things start to calm down. Maybe your doc has some meds to help, like maybe a course of steroids or something. I have been on Xolair for a year already and I seem to still get the fatigue / malaise side effects for a couple of days after injection.  I was reading that these side effects are very common with MAB (monoclonal antibody) drugs.\n\nOther than that though, the benefits by far outweigh the side effects. \n\nMy insurance would not cover Cromolyn but they covered Xolair and it was a pretty good decision to switch to Xolair as it seemed Cromolyn was really a hit or miss for me."]
