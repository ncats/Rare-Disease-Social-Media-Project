["ground breaking fsh new  Scientists make ground-breaking discovery on FSHD gene\n\n#### 19 July 2019\n\nScientists from Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (USA) have identified a new role for ( the gene that is mutated in FSHD. The researchers studied DUX4 in different types of cancers. They found that some cancer cells use DUX4 like an invisibility cloak, to avoid detection by the body\u2019s immune system. This also protects the cancer cells from immunotherapies.\n\nThis discovery suggests that drugs that block DUX4 could be used to boost effectiveness of anti-cancer therapies. This is good news for FSHD, as it could potentially mean more money and resources being directed towards the development of DUX4 inhibitors.\n\nFor more information, read Fred Hutchinson\u2019s ( Those are some really sneaky cancer cells Oh my god \ud83d\ude02", "FSHD Virtual Family Day- Saturday, February 20th ", "new in cell news (", "Fulcrum Therapeutics Announces Results from ReDUX4 Trial with Losmapimod in Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD) Demonstrating Slowed Disease Progression and Improved Function  sooooo does it work?   hoping to find something that works ASAP before things get much worst. Short answer: yes They are live presenting today.. signup here to watch\n\n How long before this goes to market I think it is not totally clear since it does not appear to reduce DUX4 expression (which was it is supposed success mechanism)-- but somehow it still seems to have made a difference functionally for the people who took it. They talked about difficulty in measuring the DUX4 expression so maybe it does reduce it and they were not able to measure somehow?\n\nPerhaps the most telling thing is that 99% of those who were involved in the trials opted to continue taking it. They admitted that their way of measuring Dux4 expression was flawed. They created their bio markers from the results of their pre clinical trials and their theory of how they think Dux4 expression should be measured.\n\nThey went on to say that because almost all of their other markers were met, they must be measuring it incorrectly since theoretically the only way these other markers would improve is if Dux4 expression is reduced This article explains it a bit better   The way I understand it is:\n\nThey measured DUX4 reduction prior to the trials in vitro so they knew it would have some effect\n\nThe trial showed the results of DUX4 reduction, improved (statistically significant) metrics... eg: measurable results\n\nThe 'primary endpoint' of actually measuring a reduction in the muscle tissue failed but this is down to the way they are trying to measure. Not only is it difficult to highlight the biomarkers but they are so spaced out and happen so rarely that it is like finding a needle in a haystack.\n\nYou could take two biopsies, from the same muscle, at the same time and have two completely different results depending on whether you hit a point with active DUX4 expression.\n\nThey showed the results of DUX4 reduction (secondary endpoints) without being able to show a slide saying 'here is before and here is less after'\n\nThe failure was in the measuring, not the drug or it is effects.\n\nWhat I am now curious to see is where things go from here. Are they going to liaise with the FDA and try to go straight to market, having the 'phase 3' after it is available on prescription or are the FDA going to request further testing before approval?\n\nIt certainly shows a measurable benefit which is high on the FDA's list, so who knows?! It is a waiting game and we are (reluctantly) all good at that.\n\nPotentially this could be available by the end of next year which is a great relief to those of us who cannot afford to wait. I keep my fingers crossed for an even speedier approval process.\n\nNice to have a bit of good news though, is not it? Is the full presentation online yet?", "considering genetic testing for fshd? I have family members who have physical symptoms of it but they only appear to be men. My moms fine she is almost 60. She is got osteoporosis and RA but that has nothing to do with fshd (has no mobility issues or muscle issues as I can see). My aunts got an actual gene for it nearly 50 with no symptoms. There was also a great aunt with it quite healthy who passed it to one of my moms maternal cousins who is male. My grandpa had more of a mild fshd I suppose but was diagnosed as a child with it. I think his genetic diagnosis was 35 kb but the genetic test seemed kind of inconclusive. it mentioned there was a translocation between 4q35 and 10q26 and that it showed a possible FSHD deletion but they were not sure.

She always has aching when she is stressed and I was wondering is there any way i could help her? Like in form of a special massage or anything else. Im willing to try anything to make it atleast a little bit easier for her. Thank you in advance It is tough because being overbearing is not that great but being aware if you need to help out without making a huge fuss would be great ! However I would say the biggest thing you can do is both remain healthy. Sounds silly but the pain can simply be exacerbated by not getting enough sleep and not eating well. Also mood plays a big part.  Having fshd myself is a drag but the most important thing about life is having some sort of joy and make sure you have an avenue that can give you some amount of quality endorphins :) Everyone with the condition has it differently, but if my partner were to ask me where I would like to get massaged. It would be the neck, shoulder and arms. Between the scapula is not actually that painful but the muscles that compensate are the tiring ones. Message me if you need some more questions. Happy to help someone who cares !", "Hi there What are your thoughts about this?\n\n(\n\nI hope that you do not misunderstand the reason behind why I am posting this. I dislike those who advocate this kind of stuff as it mostly invalidates our experience and struggles.\n\nAlso I am not posting this as some kind of quick fix, nor to claim that we can cure ourselves by changing our mindset or affirmations. \n\nI am just curious if there exists some or any truth in what is being said in that article and I thought of sharing that here. Since, if there is some truth to it, at least most of us can confirm whether we have somewhat similar thought patterns.\n\nAccording to this article \"Illness\u00a0however mild or severe is an indicator of your emotional state, caused by your thoughts and focus.\"\n\nThe writer goes on to list most illnesses and their associated thought patterns. I will save you some time by copying what the author said about muscular dystrophy.\n// Muscular Dystrophy: \"It is not worth growing up.\"\n\nHaving said that I rarely subscribe to such viewpoints. I am a firm believer that our genes manifest as we go through life in a way that depends on the thought patterns, attitudes and emotions/actions that we choose to bring forth.\n\nSo my question is, Do ideas of growing up or lack of growing up resonate with any of you? It actually does resonate with me, so I will continue with a little of my own story for some context. \n*Feel free to stop reading here, the rest may not be at all informative.\n\nI am 32 years old. Started noticing scapular winging when I was 13, which led me to visiting a few doctors until I was diagnosed. At the time I could not really understand the impact FSHD would have on me and I acted all my life as if I am accepting of my situation. I never really complained to anyone and rarely ever talk about it with any of my friends. Noone ever asks me how I am feeling or how it is affecting my life and I mostly feel alone in it. I sometimes get the urge to complain to someone but hold myself back because I know that ultimately all I would be getting out of it is self pity which would never help. I think deep down I am angry and frustrated, yet if you ask any of my family/friends they would tell you otherwise. Writing this post is the farthest i have come to discussing my thoughts and feelings with other people, this is actually me putting myself out there.\n\nOn the topic of growing up. I have always been a shy person and now at 32, I still am. Although I used to be confident with who/what I am as a kid, as I grew older I am not. I started a smoking habit since 16 (hash/weed) which quickly grew into an addiction. I have been smoking daily for about 15 years now and I am having a very hard time quitting it. \n\nI think I actually HAVE been resisting growing up for such a long time. Here are my reasons as to why I think that:\n- I graduated university at 21 but actually started having some sort of financial dependency at 29.\n- Since being diagnosed, I have mostly made no effort in trying to slow the progression. Rarely exercised, chronic smoking, alcohol and other drugs (all of which I have quit now except for smoking - any drugs that I successfully quit was not out of willpower, rather lack of convenience, for ex. Alcohol tired my body and was not enjoyable anymore, thanks to my now older age I guess.)\n- I am not comfortable in my own body, lots of anxiety, fear of public speaking, mostly unable to handle myself in social situations that include anybody other than my few closest friends. Cannot seem to overcome my lack of self confidence.\n\nI can go on but it is starting to feel more of a therapy session which is making me uncomfortable as I think I may have alterior motives from talking about myself, of wanting attention or validation. Which again is childish behavior you see. So let me just conclude by saying that I blame noone but myself for having turned out that way as a (grown up?). I believe that throughout my life I have been aware of my wrong and destructive behaviors and their impact on the development of my character, yet chose to do them anyway.\n\nIf you have read all the way through to here, I apologize for taking you on a trip through my disorganized mind. The thought patterns you list may be good to explore and go over with a therapist. That said FSHD is a genetic disorder that can be diagnosed before a human is old enough to have any thoughts at all about \"growing up\" Actually not, though the genes are there they are not always expressed. For example none of my family members have any symptoms. Add to that that the human genome includes a huge amount of genes that are simply turned off. For example we share 50% pd our genes with bananas.\n\nYes you can diagnose whether FSHD is there genetically before you are born but you do not have any indication whether it will manifest physically or not. The severity and age of manifestation also vary and we do not know why\n\nCorrect me if I am wrong Your right. My aunt has a genetic diagnosis of FSHD and is healthy. She is nearly 50. My mom and I may possible have it genetically and neither of us have manifesting symptoms. My great aunt had it also with no symptoms but my moms cousins did as well (he got it from my great aunt) as my maternal grandpa. The majority of my family that has it are more mildly affected though thankfully. that said it is still a genetic disease with probably multiple causes (environmental, epigenetic, etc). Exactly. Thank you for sharing.\n\nAs I mentioned at first, I am in no way claiming that this article is 100% true and I am not attempting to give anyone false hope, yet several studies have confirmed that gene development are affected by our environment.\n\nI shared this article for 2 reasons:\n\n1. Looking for others with MD to reflect upon themselves and either validate or invalidate. Yes or no are the two replies that I am looking for.\n\n2. Even if 100% false, it may be a catalyst for some to change their perspective just a little bit and perhaps be a cause for some reflection and personal development.\n\nPersonally, reading about this, regardless of being true or not, has helped me reflect on my own attitude, while at the same time realising that this is no cure. My disorder will most probably remain the same. While I think there is an associated effect between mind and body I do not think it is particularly relevant with FSHD.\n\nI have seen stories of a man who was misdiagnosed, told he had months to live and gave up on life. Things progressed till he reached the ICU nearing end of life. Then they discovered he would been misdiagnosed, told him that he would be ok and sure enough he started to recover.\n\nSo the mind has a powerful effect on the body, just look at the power of placebo.\n\nTo address your point, I was not diagnosed till 40 although I would always been skinny to the point where people felt the need to point it out.\n\nThing was, back in that transition into adulthood I would tried to get on the weights (which did not really work) but I never felt I developed into 'a man'. I was unaware back then so it was strictly my physicality holding me back, which I then internalised and concluded it must be me, some fault with my personality etc.\n\nIt is a chicken/egg situation but I think it wise to lay the blame at genetics' door.\n\nFrom a psychological POV, we can only play the cards we are dealt and in a world where our physicality defines us as 'less than' or 'other' we develop strategies for dealing with the world. When we feel vulnerable it is natural to deploy tactics that minimise our perceived risk, one of those could be to act more childlike so we are not seen as a threat and will not incur any wrath. I am not saying that is the case but I can see how that could happen.\n\nBefore I write a dissertation just hear this. You are enough, it is not your fault, you can only do what you can do and no more. \n\nWhen we truly accept ourselves the need for validation diminishes.\n\nI still want to get a tattoo that says 'Stay Strong'. Thank you for adding this perspective. I can only wish to internalize such a unique understanding by 40.\n\nPersonally my aim is to have a strong mind. I have made that decision a long time ago for the purpose of compensating the weakness of my body, although that is not what drives me anymore. In that way I am grateful for my weakness.\n\nTatto or not, you will stay strong. No one person is burdened with more than they can handle.", "Tips on dealing with FSHD Hi guys this is my first ever post on this sub.\n\nI am a 17 year old guy and my 13 year old brother was diagnosed with FSHD when he was around 7.\n\nIt has been very difficult watching him grow as my family and I could see his symptoms worsening. At 7, he could lift his arms above his head. He stopped being able to do that at 10. Because of the weakness of his muscles, he also falls down a lot. He used to be able to get up from the ground himself, but he no longer can. Last night, he was crying because it really hit him about the severity of his problem and he was sad that he was no longer as strong as he used to be.\n\nWatching him cry because of his disorder really hurt me as every time I think about that moment, I have the urge to cry. I love him very much and want to be his best self.\n\nThere are really two reasons that I am posting here:\n1. What are some things that I should expect in the upcoming years regarding his condition? What new symptoms develop and how much worse does it usually get?\n2. What are the best ways that I can help him? How can I make his life easier and more enjoyable? \n\nI currently do everything that I can but I do not think that I am doing enough. I love him and want to make sure that he always feels safe and loved.\n\nThank you in advance for your answers! Well I will answer the second one first. Just be there and listen. I think people get weird around mortality and change and it is really hard to watch someone else struggle with something that is incurable. That being said support and love and patience and all the things required of us as humans is and will always be more then enough, love especially! \nAs for question one that is tough. I have had FSH since I was 14 and have undergone both scapularthoracic fusions at Boston children\u2019s to stabilize my shoulders. I work and have always worked as a cook and for the most part have not had many issues minus some degeneration and sensitivity due to metal and wires and new bones being part of the normal. My confidant on the other hand was completely wheelchair bound by my age(28 year old male). Same disease different results. I was told it is on a spectrum, it is bilateral in males meaning we tend to be effected more and usually it is the right hand side that is more severe. This is a strange illness so there is no how to or comparison really. It is important to reconnect with a sense of normal as well as best you can. I encourage therapy and continued emotional support for both patient and family and filter your research. There are potentially cures possible but it is a ways off. I am not saying loss all hope of recovery but I will say mange expected outcomes and comparison is the thief of joy. I would encourage your brother to strengthen is mind. He could be the one to create a cure if given the opportunity and ability so to speak. This disease does not come with a death sentence. With technology being the way it is not and all the progress we have available who knows what kind of options with be found. Thou he may never be Arnold there is not reason why he cannot live as normal a life as anyone else. My friend eventually passed away but thou he could not move he had a wife and kids and very successful law career as an environmental lawyer. I would also recommend medical cannabis once he gets older, it really helps with pain and comfort within ones skin. This was also recommended to be by my comrade and the staffing at Boston children\u2019s as I was 20 when I finished both shoulders. There is hope for sure and at the end of the day I do not see a single human who has not been dealt a raw card. It may seem like a lot and give yourself credit it is, but it is also a part of life and being human. I believe 100% that you and your brother will both have an amazing life! before I forget! Lions mane mushrooms help. It is a naturally occurring mushroom that contains compounds that help with nerve diseases. You can get it at health food store, I use a company called host defense, it definitely helps me feel less tired and even as it supports all the systems effect by md. Take vitamins like b12 ,cOq10 ,d3 all of which you can get at most stores help as well. And swimming, if you can ,helps with workouts without stressing any supporting muscles which compensate for loss of muscle mass. And keep moving and strong in anyway possible. Physical therapy works as it allowed me to get strong enough to have my shoulder drilled and fused to my ribs. Its important to not over do it and avoid injury as it can set you back but a balanced physical therapy will help deal with some of the burning sensation of muscle fatigue. If your brother finds himself in pain a lot avoid taking a tone of anti inflammatory drugs and instead seek an alternative as larges quantities and the nature of the disease being incurable means you need a lot and over time they are not the best on your body. Again this is all generally what works for me may not for him but I have kept up on research and have lived with this for 15 years now. It requires strength but you can manage and accomplish an epic life! Hey,\n\nI am Chris, 31M, FSHD (diagnosed at 16)\n\nProgress of the disease is in every case different. Bit I will try to help you as much as I can.\n\nIn my case \"schedule\" looked like this:\n\n16 - could not lift up left arm, my eyes keeps open up when I was sleeping\n\n17 - could not lift up my right arm\n\n19 - my abs went to shit, I need to slingshot myself from position on my back to be able to stand up\n\n19-31 - year by year regression of my legs, first was my foot, could not lift my toes higher than heel. Later I was unable to move my heel closer to the butt (regression of the biceps of the tighs), \"duck walk\", every step on something even slightly wet or slippery made me finish on the ground.\n\nOf course muscles were weaker year by year, and so was the fatigue. \n\n2. You know your brother better than anyone else. Make him as comfortable as you can and treat him as a human being not the disease.\n\nIn my case I was furious about everyone trying to do everything for me...\n\nask him if he want any help before you try to help him himself and accept it if he refuse.\n\nThis is the my perspective. Remember that we, people with FSHD, can be weak and fatigue but we are still humans with flame of ambition and dignity which can be taken from us easier than from other humans and that is scares a shit out of us. Be his brother, be by his side when he needs you, and you will be fine ;)\n\nPS:\n\nOf course you can always be a researcher and find a cure for us all, but do not put whole world on your back ;P Hey man, thank you very much for the advice. I think I understand the situation quite a lot more thanks to your post. Also I have already had plans to go into the field of medicine, and my goal is to become a medical researcher! Glad to hear that, I hope you will succeed where I fall...\n\nIf you want to know more about the disease and research visit: ( &lt; they have a lot of data for the start.\n\nBest! I want to thank everyone for the feedback and I will be sure to listen and follow your advice! I would encourage him to do things that he can be good at with FSHD.  I had a severe case as well. I could sort of play sports at around 8. By 11 I was in a manual wheelchair. By 14 a power wheelchair. I am 39 now.\n\nIntroduce him to gaming and programming.  For me, coding has had a tremendous impact on my life.  It gave me a great career and gives the opportunity to make enough to retire young, which in my case with fshd is important.\n\nAlso, always try to eat clean. Losing weight with fshd is hella hard. Thanks for the info and tips! If he is falling down because he is tripping over his feet, he can prevent a lot of future falls with awareness. Walking the toes should be pointed outward and heel first .. both feet together would look like a v kind of .. practice walking with awareness then walk backward then forward", "Pain Management Do you all have any tips for non-pharmaceutical pain management?\n\nThe area under my shoulder blades has been killing me all day and I am trying to avoid chronic ibuprofen use.\n\nLaying down sort of helps but I am at work so that is sort of a no-go. Actually, ibuprofen works best when not allowed to \"run out\" in your body. It will not work well if you let the pain build. It takes much longer to cause damage than just a few doses taken the proper 6 hours apart. Beyond that, alternating ice and heat does work for temporary relief. Ice can cause muscles to hurt more at first so leave packs on at least 10 minutes to get relief. I also use a vibrating heating pad, set on low. Takes about 20 minutes to feel relief. I am more just worried about gastrointestinal side effects from chronic use. I did end up taking some ibuprofen earlier and do feel better. I use CBD oil and find that it works really well.

I found a guy who helps me get what I need from a more enlightened state.", "Just a thought; what if there is already a natural cure we do not know about? So, I am thinking, there could be people out there who have FSHD but do not even know about it because they take a certain supplement or eat a particular food which counteracts the DUX4.\n\nSo my question is, is there anyone in your family who has had a blood test, confirmed FSHD but shows very few bad effects?\n\nIf so maybe we could build a list of their diets/meds/supplements and see if there is any correlations?\n\nJust a thought.... There was fairly recent (published May 2020) study in mouse models that berberine can downregulate DUX4 expression. See this: (\n\nHowever, to my non-doctor brain, one problem is that berberine is not always well-tolerated (can cause stomach issues) and sufficient quantities may not reach the right places in the body unless you increase absorption. In my opinion it is something environmental that causes gene mutations or damage at the level where your dna becomes altered thus the disease occurs and then can be passed along if you have a child and they inherit the gene. Myself and my connect who is 40 years my senior have similar family history with zero occurrences up until both our diagnosis and our symptoms showed early. With all the pollution and chemicals and blah blah blah I would not be surprised if our modernization is a factor. As for plant medicine it is completely possible if not probable as to find something that naturally occurs in plants that would be so hyper specific to such a rather odd and rare mutation seems slim and although a healthy diet is no doubt good it will not prevent a disease such as ours because it is our literal coding that is off. Maybe one could be derived or a medicine manufactured, If you could administer something that repaired or rewords gene coding but that is in essence what our modern gene editing programs are working on! I am totally with you. I believe there are lifestyle and wellness solutions out there that are making people with FSHD less symptomatic. \n\nI have been trying to get a student researcher to do even a survey to find out what people are doing and have success with. \n\nHave you checked out myFSHD? It explains why some people are less symptomatic Thanks for sharing this link. Appreciated. Thanks for this, very interesting. Where can I read the whole study? Correct. That is why it is not like we should all start taking this right away, and really it needs more study. I think if you took it with grapefruit juice it would help absorption. Berberine has some research related to diabetes, so there is evidence it helps for some things. See this is what I mean though, that is led me on a little journey...\n\nBerberine affects DUX4 production, what is Berberine, turns out it is a mild AMPK activator. You know what is a better AMPK inhibitor? Metformin.\n\nAre there FSHD affected patients who are also diabetic? If so did they notice an improvement in their symptoms when they started taking metformin?\n\nIt is all interesting... You would love the FSHD facebook group. It is filled with people who think the right mix of supplements (Vitamin D, proteins, etc.) do something meaningful. I do not think that is true, but I understand the desperation. I joined Facebook just to join that group but I am probably going to delete my account because the group is filled with crackpots. Ok, sure, but what you are saying here is not good science or good logic, so you should be very careful. Just because berberine activates AMPK does not mean that the AMPK activation effect of berberine is what downregulates DUX4 expression. That is not at all what the study says. You are making wild inferences here. I am just asking questions, looking for correlations.\n\n(\n\nCould a protein kinase activator like metfomin help with fshd? This is not how to look for correlations, though. It is using the internet to conduct uninformed medical research, and that can be dangerous and can help spread misinformation. See a doctor. Read what doctors write. You are not going to find something that the hundreds or thousands of doctors studying this have missed, unless you get specific training.\n\nFor example, one study mentions FSHD, cAMP and PKA: \u201cAmong those, \u03b22-adrenergic receptor agonists and phosphodiesterase inhibitors, both leading to increased cellular cAMP, effectively decreased DUX4 expression by &gt;75% in cells from individuals with FSHD. Of note, we found that cAMP production reduces DUX4 expression through a protein kinase A-dependent mode of action in FSHD patient myotubes.\u201d\n\nHowever, regarding metformin: \u201cThe molecular mechanism of metformin is not completely understood. Multiple potential mechanisms of action have been proposed: inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (complex I), activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), inhibition of glucagon-induced elevation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) with reduced activation of protein kinase A (PKA), inhibition of mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, and an effect on gut microbiota.\u201d\n\nNow, you combine these ideas. \n- cAMP production may reduce DUX4 expression. Woo hoo!\n- But how does metformin affect cAMP? Does it increase it or decrease it? \n\nFurther research shows some debate, but metformin appears to reduce cAMP production. So this would be net negative, right? Maybe it increases the effects of FSHD to take metformin? Oh no! \n\n\n\nAnyway, the point is not that you are wrong. Maybe you are right. The point is that you should not be doing this unless you are a doctor or have medical or science training. I should not be either, which is why I do not. \n\nDevote time and energy to supporting others\u2019 research, or to fundraising for research. I would not recommend spending time on the internet trying to solve exceptionally complex scientific questions that many, many scientists are trying to solve. It will not be fruitful and you could make your condition worse.\n\nScience is slow, which is frustrating for those of us suffering today. But you cannot speed it up without potentially damaging yourself.

I am sure everyone with this kind of condition goes through this stage at some point.\n\nI am still looking, still searching and still fighting.\n\nBack to the original point of the post though, it would be amazing to discover something that is already out there. Unlikely to find it on a board like this though with such low participation. I hear you. I know it is frustrating. I do not really talk about myself on the internet much, but I can say I have been through your stage of considering anything. I would recommend, if you can, to talk to therapists and doctors about how you feel. There may be some ways to help you with the feelings and anxiety. Also, maybe the Facebook group \u201cLiving with FSHD\u201d would help you. They talk a lot about supplements, various braces or therapies, etc. It just was not helpful for me - too much crazy. \n\nI would be happy to talk to you more (DM me, maybe we can have an email pen pal relationship). We could help each other understand medical research, maybe be a sounding board. And maybe just searching and DOING SOMETHING will feel good, even if it is not actually fruitful in the end. I just do not want anyone to to injure themselves or make things worse because of misunderstanding or bad internet advice.\n\nI feel for you, friend. The thing that makes any sort of hypothesis of this nature difficult to test is that we know FSHD phenotype is, in general, wildly variable between patients, even patients with similar D4Z4 deletions. It is probably not possible to attribute differences in symptoms to anything environmental, given the long spans of time over which symptoms worsen and the vast numbers of variables that need to be accounted for. My father is 53 and was diagnosed with fshd 3 years ago but he looks like a bodybuilder. He is a healthfreak, takes a lot of suplements and works out 4 days a week. I still think that you are lucky when you do not get symptoms at a young age. Yea. My aunt has the gene but she is not clinically affected I think she is 45 which is unusual.She only got tested due to curiosity. I have not seen any woman in my family clinically affected by it including my own mother who is almost 60. I am also not clinically affected. the only clinically affected people in my family that I have seen were boys before the age of 20. \\`I have two women confirmed with fshd in my family which was my great aunt who did not have symptoms even at 70 and passed it to her son who had symptoms before age 20. we only knew my great aunt even had it because my moms cousin was showing signs of it in his teens. thankfully the fshd in my family is relatively mild. I definitely think some people do not really develop it and we dont know why. Im almost 30 and so far dont show signs yet. I might get tested if I plan on having kids though since its very possible I could be a carrier. my grandfather had it for years and I believe he only needed a wheelchair when he turned 60 or 70 although he did have an onset before 20. I think alot of it depends on the specific type ur family has. mine seems to have some kind of sex based affect but some families might not. My aunt was told by her doctor that it might possibly affect her one day but no one knows if that would happen or when? They do not even fully understand the genetics of this disease I think tbh. She does have a little son though so were concerned about him. Thanks for this, it is likely your family only has slightly shortened d4z4 repeats.\n\nFSHD is a disease of inflammation among other things, estrogen plays a big part in modulating inflammation:\n\n(\n\nIt is possible that estrogen (in the women of your family) is enough to combat a relatively weak version of FSHD.\n\nJust my musings, and thanks again for sharing.

I occasionally have twitching. I have never really seen it listed as a symptom and it is not a primary symptom of mine, but it makes sense since muscles under stress may not be able to absorb nutrients as efficiently. Best thing you can do is stretch every night before bed...I mean real stretching for like 15-30 min, drink plenty of water, and have one electrolyte packet (I use a brand called Ultima Replenisher) with a glass of water per day.  This should help alleviate some of the twitching. If it does not, you should go for a full blood panel testing an array of vitamins (b, d, c, e, etc) along with CPK and Aldolase levels. Elevated CPK and Aldolase will be your first indicators letting you know if you need further testing for FSHD. From there, if you have supporting blood work and no real answers from the EMG (which is what it sounds like), the only real option is getting a chromosome test, which is unfortunately very expensive. I suppose you can get a muscle biopsy to see if fatty/scar tissue is starting to seep into/replace your healthy muscle tissue, but I do not imagine that being cheap either.

Im going on 32, last two years started noticing I was getting a lot weaker and losing muscle. \n\nAnybody have there own personal treatment that seems to be working?

I have noticed a big improvement from that. \n\nIt is interesting that you say that you just noticed it at 32. That is quite late and generally considered an outlier. Have you not noticed difficulty putting on muscle mass during your 20s? Perhaps your job is quite active and helped mitigate the atrophy? Are you type I or type II? Type 1 I believe. I was misdiagnosed since I was in high school. I was told by doctors that I had a bilateral nerve injury in my shoulders. It was not until I was 28ish I started to notice my legs getting weaker and other things. I always had trouble putting on mass, but thought it was a shoulder injury. Indeed. I am type II, so I am not as familiar with type I, but you should confirm your diagnosis. Type II is from a genetic mutation (I assume type I is as well, but if anyone can confirm the details, please correct me if I am wrong). The reason I mention this, is because it is probable that your siblings or one of your parents also have the disorder. Something worth considering. I had genetic testing done, and was able to track it back to grandfather, with several relatives also being diagnosed after. Is scapular fixation at all limiting in any way  ? \nI cant imagine doing pull ups or falling off a bike being ok. ? Or is it pretty sturdy It is pretty sturdy. I cannot do a pull up, but I can hang from the bar no problem. Deadlifts are good too. I do not view it as limiting, compared to the strength and mobility of my arm/shoulder pre-surgery. I still play hockey and ride my dirt bike with it - I just do not really notice it. However, there is a slight restriction in mobility, as I cannot scratch the center of my back like I use to. I too take supplements:\n\nD, Bcomp, C, zinc, iron, coq10 and 5htp, oh and CBD\n\nThe last two are more mental than physical.\n\nFSHD society have recently done a good series with a physiotherapist. It is not so much focused on exercising as it is maintaining 'ranges of movement'.\n\nAs your body declines muscles weaken and other muscles try to take up the slack, then those weaken and you stop being able to do things.\n\nI do not know what stage you are at but try to keep the main muscles going and rely less on the supporting muscles.

Crazy that you can hang from a bar. I had my first arm done in 2001 and my other arm done in 2004, I cannot lift them that straight up to hang like that.

(I hope not). If so, and you have recovered can you re-cap your experience?\n\nA few months ago I heard that the symptoms may be worse for those with FSHD if the muscles of the chest wall are weak.  Also, I know of an individual who does not have FSHD and was hospitalized with covid-19 for two weeks.  They lost a lot of muscle mass in their legs due to being restrained to a hospital bed the entire time.  Luckily for him he is recovered and can regain that muscle overtime.  If I were in that situation I am not sure I would be able to regain the muscle mass. No im lucky to be in Canberra Australia. I was worrying about that seeing as my lunges get so wrecked after flues. :/ Yeah, I am in the US in a major city.  We are having a record number of new cases here so I am playing it safe and staying in mostly.  \n\nWhat issues have you had with the flu?  I have never had issues with colds or flus.  Just regular symptoms. I usually get them longer than everyone else. Not sure its fshd related but ill recover from the flu then be left with copius amounts of phlem. So covid sounds very real for me. I hope things are leading in a better direction for you guys soon ! I have not had it but I am also being extra careful and isolating. From what I have seen and know, FSHD patients are not \u201cat any higher risk\u201d than anyone else for COVID itself. However, because the diaphragm and muscles in the rib cage wall are effected, this already causes breathing and coughing issues. That also means we are more prone to contracting pneumonia as it is. \nIt would also be extremely bad to be put on a ventilator for any amount of time. I remember going to an FSHD conference and learning that within a few weeks of being on a ventilator, depending on how progressed the disease is, the patients esophagus muscles can atrophy. Not only would they be dependent on the ventilator but their body would not be able to regulate or swallow on its own. Eventually, within a very short time, they would die from asphyxiation on their own fluids. Wish I could link a source but like I said, was a talk at a FSHD conference. Just remember it because I had not realized that would be a thing and it was terrifying. Makes sense though. \nDo everything you can to stay safe. Isolate, wear a mask, clean everything and often, do not go out unless you have to. It sucks but COVID is far from over. We are seeing the second spike which is worse than the first. We are also seeing patients who are contracting it again. Meaning because people are not being careful and continuing to spread it, asymptomatically or otherwise, the virus is mutating and evolving. Every new body it effects, it has a opportunity to get stronger and change to where the antibody\u2019s someone has from the first round no longer help prevent it now.", "Follistatin gene therapy strengthens muscle in FSHD mouse model  \n", "FSHd online meeting **Log onto Connecticut Connections: Thurs.\u00a0April 4, 7pm - 8:30pm***All are welcome!

Does anyone do this. Any results? I am hoping the testosterone will balance out the muscle wasting. Just looking for others who have tried this approach. \nThanks Never tried it.  I have always had the impression that supplementing testosterone had negative effects.  I thought your body compensated by lowering its natural production.\n\nBack in my teens I used a lot of creatine (I was a lot stronger then) and recently been using it a little.  I read that it acts as a slight myostatin inhibitor.  Myostatin inhibitors are an area of promise in treating muscle wasting diseases and also general strength training for athletes. Ya I am just surprised I cannot find more studies on the topic with relation to FSHD. I can only find one study that looks like it may be starting soon, that is testing low dose testosterone and HGH on patients. The dose of Testosterone looks like it is so low that it is doing more harm then good.\nTestosterone seems like a substance that can preserve muscle and grow new muscle so I am curious why it would not work for FSHD patients, but cannot find any literature on the subject. I have not arrived at a final diagnosis yet, but so far my testing is possibly pointing to FSHD. the doctors so far have eluded to possibly doing a steroid or testosterone therapy once I get to a diagnosis. I will keep you posted on what happens. My doc told me exercise and good luck. I should not laugh but same here. When I got my diagnosis they sent me to physiotherapy. The guy literally said 'I do not know much about this, I did a google search' (which was still open on his computer) 'exercise but not too much and good luck'\n\nThat was it, one session and his parting words were 'good luck' I know I am a month late, but the wasting appears to be entirely caused by myotoxic DUX4 protein which kills off the nuclei of myocytes. So while steroid supplementation may make healthy muscle stronger it would do little to hinder or reverse damage to muscle where DUX4 has already been expressed.\n\nMy expectation of the testosterone/HGH study is that they will observe increases in strength with little/no increase to the mass of already effected muscles.\n\nSee: (", "Possible treatments/muscle atrophy delays? Hello fellow FSHD warriors. I am checking out a couple possible treatments - has anyone happened to get a muscle transplant? Specifically from leg to bicep? \n\nIf so, did this procedure help and are you noticing if this new muscle is atrophying as well?\n\nI am also considering taking testosterone despite having normal levels to get some sort of strength back. Does anyone take extra T and notice a difference here? I do not think you will find doctors willing to transplant muscles because they simply would not last. I was speaking Dr. Peter Jones a couple of years ago about potentially using stem cells to buy a bit more time and he said any benefits would be short-lived because of the naturally 'toxic' environment inside our bodies, when it comes to muscle.\n\nThe best bet is to stop dux4 production at the source, before it has a chance to cause cell death. There are a number of ways to achieve this but only one trial running currently for an already well tested drug.\n\nThe thing is muscles are normally pretty good and they grow quickly so as soon as they find something that stops dux4, if you have got ***any*** muscle left it could potentially grow quite quickly and for those areas which do not there are ways to start things off in those areas.\n\nThe trouble with FSHD is that we are fading all the time, getting weaker and weaker by the day. Personally I find that really stressful, the clock is always ticking so for me a treatment cannot come soon enough. I want to be independent for as long as I can be but that day where I cannot continue on my own is getting closer.\n\nThey have just had a conference on the current research efforts, some limited info here:\n\n(\n\nYou can also check this link and see ongoing studies, but also check the completed ones to see what people have tried and whether it is had an effect:\n\n( Test will help for strength, but it will become a lifetime thing. I do a TRT dose, strength has gone up but no muscle. I think it is most helpful in preserving what is left, but it is not going to reverse anything Makes total sense that any muscle that is transplanted will simply end up atrophying as well - unfortunately . Makes for a better plan to hold out for the cure to stop it at the source and if needed, pursue a muscle transplant. Thank you for the thoughtful response! I think I will pursue this then. Preservation of the existing muscle until the cure comes out is the name of the game for right now Again I am not sure existing muscle, but I have kept my strength to a degree Do exercises with good form, if you cannot do an exercises the normal way, try to modify it / get on the bed, the most important thing is to use the muscles otherwise they will atrophy so even doing random things like crawling and rolling around will use a lot of muscles .. walking in a pool I dunno my grandfather had FSHD along with his nephew. My aunt and my great aunt are just carriers and never were clinically affected..which is weird but anyway. I remember he used to do like physical therapy alot which was sort of helpful (medicine balls, etc). Swimming was also good for him too. Playing piano helped to strengthen his hands. there is not alot to do about FSHD unfortunately but trying to stay active as you can without straining yourself seems to help a little. Never mentioned muscle biopsies to me. Thankfully FSHD is usually slowly progressive and my grandfather had a pretty normal life and was able to be able out of a wheelchair for most of his adult life and lived almost to 90. The most important thing that he learned from his diagnosis I guess was adjusting as he grew progessively weaker. I have heard of some studies recently and hopefully they find a treatment soon!", "Something to read ", "Scapular Winging  FYI, can see your face and the camera man in the mirror.

I have fshd in my family. my mother has RA but does not have FSHD and neither do I. none of my affected family members have autoimmune disorders. it is not related. MS is a different disease process than FSHD. FSHD involves DUX4, which I believe is a gene that is supposed to be shut off after birth but weakens the muscle because it is kept activated, and not the spinal cord or brain lesions which I believe is a part of MS.

I have been doing my best to educate myself, I know the medical side but I know I do not and cannot know what it is like to live with it. What are some important points I should know to try to be a supportive partner to someone who lives with fshd?\n\nThank you for any advice. I am a person with fshd who got married 4 years ago at the age of 36. I was genetically diagnosed around the age of 33 and started really showing signs around the age of 38. People with fshd are just like everyone else. I think it is important to see if that person is interested in you. And if they are, go out. The most important thing is to have open and honest communication in any relationship, but when you are in a relationship with someone who has a progressive chronic disease, that open communication is even more important. The disease progression is so unique to each person, it would be difficult to give you any other advice. She is interested, but I feel like she is apprehensive because of her fshd, she is afraid I am going to go running for the hills lol but that is not the case. I do know it is very specific for each person and how it effects them, I was not sure if there was some sound advice maybe I have missed or knowledge I have not acquired yet. I just want her to be as comfortable about it as possible. We have talked a good deal about it, she is becoming more comfortable about opening up. I just wanted to see what others might input. Not sure if this matters and how far she has progressed, but stats say around 20% end up in wheelchair. If you want kids, she may not and if she does she may not be able to do many tasks, which will put the burden on you. Just a few things off the top of my head, not trying to discourage the relationship just putting the info out there She is mostly in a wheelchair now. I am ok with everything, she is an amazing person and that is all that really matters to me. Kids I could go either way but I would say that is probably wayyy down the road and ultimately up to her since it is her body. I am just wondering like for date nights or other things, what I should check for, how I could make her feel comfortable in those situations. I should probably just ask her lol but I wanted to see if there was any great outside advice. Honestly? Just do not make a big deal about it.\n\n\"is that ok?\"\n\n\"can I get that for you?\"\n\n\"do you need help?\"\n\nIf she is already self conscious about things then my advice would be just make everything as normal as possible for her. Let her ask for help if she wants it. Do not make it the main talking point, do not bring it up at all.\n\nJust show her a good time, laugh, engage, give her the opportunity to forget about things for a while and get lost in the moment.\n\nIf you are really serious about pursuing something just let it evolve naturally, be fun to be with.\n\nThe classics are classics for a reason, get some nice food, does not even have to be in a restaurant, go have a picnic.\n\nThere will be time to learn what her particular needs are but for now focus on building something you both want to be a part of.

Yeah I did not see any official results for fshd patients, only that they tested on healthy individuals for a heart thing but did not work .. maybe I have been watching too much Netflix where scientists inject themselves whenever something goes wrong in space Sure, I would try it.

I have tried lots of different exercises over the years and I have learned when trying something new it is best to test the waters for a few weeks or months to see how my body responds.  My worst experience was getting a Peloton bike and riding a few tomes a week.  I ended up developing foot drop within a couple of months.  That was the quickest acceleration of muscle wasting I have experienced so far with FSHD and I definitely regret not being more cautious trying a new exercise.  Also I have yet to be able to target and improve any muscle that has been majorly impacted by FSHD. That being said I have been able to strengthen healthy muscle and improve mobility with moderate exercise.  I have had good experiences with yoga, body weight exercises, and free weights.  When I try to target areas/movements where I am weak I try to find physical therapy type exercises and modify them as needed to help me through the movements. ty for the information, but if you please, is it helpful i mean the exercises.

I thought their statement was a bit vague... 'We are going to talk to the FDA' so I am looking into things while we wait.\n\nFulcrum not only has Orphan Drug designation but is also part of the accelerated approval program. What does that mean and how may it affect what happens next?\n\n*The FDA instituted its Accelerated Approval Program to allow for earlier  approval of drugs that treat serious conditions, and that fill an unmet  medical need.\u00a0 Approval is based on a surrogate or intermediate  clinical endpoint.\u00a0 A surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory  measurement, radiographic image, physical sign or other measure that is  thought to predict clinical benefit but is not itself a measure of  clinical benefit. The use of a surrogate endpoint can considerably  shorten the time required prior to receiving FDA approval.* \n\nSo from that it looks like Losmapimod may meet some of these requirements, they have the MRI data showing reduced fat infiltration, improved strength tests and slight improvement in reachable work space.\n\nThe fact they did not mention a phase 3 leads me to believe they will be trying to go straight to market if possible. We could possibly expect a timeline of 18 months and hope for shorter. This would give them sole rights for FSHD treatment for a year I think which gives other research units time to further test their candidates.\n\nMy hope is that we get a treatment that reduces symptoms, then a better one that reduces/reverses them, then ultimately an mRNA injection that simply turns it off completely.\n\nI am very interested to see how the next few months play out, the light at the end of tunnel seems a little brighter... I sure hope so.  Glad to see others on here talking about it. Any Canadians on here who know what early FDA approval might mean for approval in Canada? I think that is what we are going to see also. Arrowheads treatment looks awesome and the crispr advances, this looks like a bridge treatment Really appreciate the digging you have done there. Thanks! Afaik Canada pretty much just follows USA on this stuff. For better or worse. Feels good to see everyone here. \n\nI am wondering what steps we should be doing to prepare ourselves for expanded access so we can start taking it ASAP. What comes to mind: Getting tested (if not officially done yet) and discussing with your doctor so you can send all the necessary documents. Any other ideas or thoughts? Thanks for posting. I am wondering where the estimate of up to 18 months comes from with no phase 3. I would have thought sooner. I watched the fulcrum webcast and I believe I remember one of the experts saying it can range from 14-18 months to get an approval/go to market. Anyone else who watched can you confirm? Yep, I saw that. He said it takes companies a year to collate their data and present it. The FDA then 'tries' to look at the data within 6 months instead of the usual 10.\n\nThings can happen quickly,  I would think a bare minimum of 8 months but we are nowhere near that kind of thinking yet, Fulcrum and the FDA do not know what they are going to do yet so there is no point building our hopes up for now... that is why I thought having 18 months in mind (if things go well) would be a good guide timeline.\n\nThey have approved drugs with less evidence (even recently) so I am happy to be at least a little hopeful but you never know with this kind of thing. sole rights for a year would be devastating, this drug would have to be taken every day for minimal if at any effect and does not even target the original problem vs. a gapmer treatment that has immediate significant results and is probably a short term treatment ", "Article from Psychology Today on FSH  ( Hi there.

He does 30 to 40 min of cardio and alternates weights (upper versus lower) each time and then does his PT exercises. I think more detail is needed here.\n\nWhen I was in college and did not know I had FSHD, I worked out like a maniac.  I built good definition in some areas but could not understand why I could not build strength in others.  Now I know.  As I aged, my 6-pack abs went to a 4-pack, then a no-pack to a beer belly.  Just lost the muscle in that area.  \n\nThese days, being in my 50's, the best thing for me was getting a dog and walking him almost every day (make my son take him on most weekends as one my ankles will swell at the end of the week).  \n\nSo I think workout depends on age and status.  I think the walks have helped my core, but I am not about to try to do Tricep dips with 100 lbs between my legs as those days are long past. Heck, tricep dips with body weight are gone down the river at this point. Should have explained more:\n\nI worked out with weights well into my 30's.  I think some of the strength I have left in my shoulders is still a result of how much muscle I built up in those days, but I could be wrong.  \n\nIn any case, I neither regret nor do I think my current status was impacted by my workout routine when I was young.  I came from a perspective of ignorance since my mom felt guilty and did not fully explain the genetic impact of her FSHD (she felt guilty and I understand fully now that I am older).  \n\nI just knew at the time that I was not as strong as many others my age and I worked hard to correct that.  \n\nYour son, knowing that he has this disadvantage can be more cognizant of what he can and cannot do and I hope he can focus on strength rather than becoming the next Arnold  Schwarzenegger.  \n\nOnce symptoms start showing up (for me it was into my 30's) you have to let go of your pride and embrace assistance (in my case leg braces) to avoid injury such as falls due to being too proud to get help.  \n\nI wish your son luck and hope that he accepts what he has and lives his life to the fullest. I  have always wondered I have been doing powerlifting  for a few years now  respectable lifts but nothing impressive.   I am 34  I started working out seriously in 2007.  I took a few years off 2013- Oct 2016.  I have put on alot of muscle even in my affected areas.  But I never really read about anyone working out seriously with fshd. I joined a US Navy Special Forces Unit when I was 19. I was an all state football player and diagnosed when I was 27. I am 30 now. I still workout/exercise very hard despite the diagnosis and \u201cdoctors orders\u201d. I used to, diagnosed at 28 and now I workout very moderately 2-3 days a week. Went from being able to bench over 250, run a mile in under 5 minutes, dunk, do over 20 pull-ups and hit a golf ball close to 400 yards. Had scapular fixation surgery in 2017 and am too scared to workout hard now since I have atrophied so bad in my upper body that I am scared to make it worse. My advice is to keep active but do not do anything too strenuous, looking back I wish I would have done so. I would give that up man. I went down the same path in my early-mid 20's only to look like a skeleton above my waist now. I was a personal trainer/gym owner for over a decade and ended up having to switch careers and sell my gym due to the worsening/atrophying of my upper body.", "World FSHD Alliance Research Congress Highlights from Dr. Jessica De Greef  Fulcrum's Re-DUX4 timestamp here: \n\nAn impressive overview and great explanation by Dr. Jessica De Greef of a number of different FSHD research studies.\n\nObviously the Fulcrum trial results are the big news, but I was genuinely surprised by the amount of positive news from everything else. Is there an estimate on when it will hit the market or the cost? I do not remember any cost or approval timescale estimates from the highlights vid but some here on reddit have suggested ~18 months for approval as a ballpark. My key take away from this was that she said we would probably take parallel treatments because there would be 'leakage'. Eg: One drug does not stop all the dux4, a combination of 2 (or more) may eradicate expression completely.\n\nThis is also kind of good news for other companies exploring different mechanisms for reducing dux4 as they will not be barred if Fulcrum get approved with orphan drugs status. I know a little more about this than when I posted previously...\n\nFulcrum are going to spend 3-5 months collating the data and presenting not only for peer review but also to the FDA who could take up to 6 months to review.

DUX4 was first identified in 19991, but only in the past five to 10 years have scientists reached consensus about the full underlying genetics of FSHD. Since then, researchers have worked tirelessly to understand how DUX4 causes muscle toxicity and cell death2, and how it prevents muscle regeneration.\n\nRecently, however, a Snow White-like story is unfolding, and scientists are starting to pay attention. While no one questions the foundational role of DUX4 in the pathogenesis of FSHD, three separate groups of researchers are now also calling attention to a protein called PAX7 and its close cousin, PAX3. It seems that DUX4 is like the evil, jealous stepmother who banished and put to sleep the \u201cfairest one of all\u201d\u2014the kindhearted princess, PAX7.\n\nBoth DUX4 and PAX7/3 are members of a family of proteins known as \u201ctranscription factors.\u201d Transcription factors bind DNA to regulate expression of genes that are important in embryonic development and in differentiation of cells into specific tissues. PAX7 and PAX3 are key regulators of the formation of skeletal muscle, though PAX3 generally operates during embryonic development while PAX7 generally operates later in development and in adult muscle regeneration3. In our Snow White story, PAX7 is the princess that everyone wants to see prevail.\n\nAbout 10 years ago, Darko Bosnakovski, DVM PhD, and Michael Kyba, PhD, then at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, discovered that in a cell culture model of FSHD, the presence of DUX4, the evil queen, causes the function of PAX7 to be suppressed. When researchers manipulated the cells to artificially increase expression of PAX7, the FSHD cells survived more robustly. This indicated that the function of PAX7 may somehow counter the deleterious effects of DUX44.\n\nLast year, these studies were resurrected and greatly expanded upon. A team at the University of Washington, led by Daniel Miller, MD PhD, found that in early development, FSHD stem cells have normal expression of both PAX7 and PAX3 as they differentiate into muscle cells, consistent with the observation that most children with FSHD have normal muscle development and growth. Interestingly though, DUX4 expression was not observed at the predicted rates in individual cells also expressing PAX7 or PAX3. This indicates that in early development, conditions promoting PAX7/3 expression may counter DUX4 expression, and that expression of DUX4 and PAX7/3 may be mutually exclusive5.\n\nIn parallel, Christopher Banerji, PhD, and Peter Zammit, PhD, at King\u2019s College London reanalyzed several gene expression datasets previously generated from muscle biopsies from patients affected by FSHD. They found that the *suppression* of PAX7-regulated genes is, in many instances, actually a stronger and more reliable biomarker of FSHD than the *expression* of DUX4-regulated genes.\n\nThe network of genes regulated by PAX7 and suppressed in FSHD could also explain many FSHD phenotypes, including less effective antioxidant properties, cell death, inability to regenerate muscle, and the expression of DUX4 itself. These researchers also manipulated healthy cells to co-express both DUX4 and PAX7, and found that they mutually inhibited each other\u2019s ability to activate their target genes6.\n\nHowever, exactly how DUX4 and PAX7 interact remains to be deciphered. It seems that the relationship between the two is more complex than a simple, direct competition model would suggest6. Some non-mutually exclusive hypotheses that have been put forth include 1) DUX4 and PAX7 compete to bind DNA at a few key toxicity-related sites, and/or 2) DUX4 and PAX7 compete to interact with a third, yet-unknown protein necessary for their activity, and/or 3) DUX4 may interfere with the DNA-binding capabilities of PAX7.\n\nI hope that at this point you can appreciate how DUX4 and PAX7 seem to have an antagonistic, seesaw-like relationship. As Drs. Banerji and Zammit explain, it appears that DUX4 operates in two ways to cause FSHD: 1) by direct activation of certain genes that results in muscle cell death (the evil queen is simply toxic), and 2) by suppressing the work of PAX7, such as in muscle regeneration (the evil queen puts Snow White to sleep). In theory, if Snow White were awake, she may help counter the toxic effects of the evil queen.\n\nIt is clear that scientists are just starting to get to know PAX7, our Snow White, and what role she plays in the FSHD story. And understanding PAX7 biology is valuable because it may shed light on additional therapeutic opportunities. We will continue to watch this Snow White and the evil queen storyline unfold with great interest, as it will inevitably lead to an even greater understanding of FSHD pathogenesis, and may help contribute to a more \u201chappily ever after\u201d for FSHD sufferers.\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n1.

( ", "24yo Australian Male looking for somebody who understands FSHD and similar myopathies Hi there anybody who is reading this \u2014 over the last 5 years I have been noticing progressive weakness in my shoulders (talking on the phone, brushing teeth), hips (walking up hills, stairs), abdomen (situps, posture difficulties) and my face as well (everybody thinks I am depressed or angry all the time, I cannot smile properly and I look stoned all of the time.\n\nI have really run the gauntlet in terms of medical specialists and common diseases over the years. First it was things like iron deficiency, hypothyroidism, depression etc, but nothing ever fit. I was feeling very fatigued and had a fair amount of back pain, so I went to a rheumatologist who cleared me of any joint or bone disease.\n\nI have seen a neurologist now, but I was so distressed after waiting 8months between referral and my appointment, and my life had basically fallen apart (I have very little social support), that by the time I saw her I was in extremis psychologically and she brushed me off as psychosomatic/functional.\n\nI suppose I am wondering:\nIs anybody here from Australia? Does anybody know of any doctors of organizations here I could contact who are well-versed in FSHD and similar scapuloperoneal diseases?\n\nThank you for reading (if you did). Ahh well ive yet to find a specialist that actually knows what they are on about without palming me off again and again but I just found out about an app built by mdaustralia.  the app is called \"the loop\"  \nI am apart of an excerise group that moderates fshd effects via strength based training. This is in Canberra and its filled with multiple types of people with MD mostly fshd and its good to see and talk to people who have the same condition group is about 20 people that come and go mostly between 40 and 60. Im an outlier there at 26. Ive only been 2x so far but that is where im going to make my conections and the people are nice. \n\nWhat im trying to do with this group is not feel alone in this never ending battle. Im educating myself by learning excersises that i can do at home/ or gym when they open again. Im looking at doing the same with aquatics too. Starting in 2 weeks. Sorry about the info dump im getting through this too :) hope this assists you. Just yesterday through a referal by a neuro i visited this place  and although the people seemed useless they have refered me to a dietition/ ndis dedicated social workers/ mental health workers which has been the biggest step ive taken so far..  fire more questions at me if you want this community is still very small. You are in luck! One of the worlds leading FSHD research centres is in Aus.  and they are wonderful to talk to through their Facebook page. Fast to respond and will happily answer all your questions!\n\nI have it as well.  Every female in my entire extended family tested positive. You need to seriously consider children because it is very likely it will be handed down. Hi! I am from the states so I am not familiar with any Australian specialists, but I do know the best ways to find out if you do have FSHD or not. First, there is something you can do on your own. Only about 5% of FSHD cases are from genetic mutations (basically you got it all on your own), the rest are genetic. So odds are, if you have FSHD, one of your parents do as well. If you are still close with your family, talk to your parents to see if either of them have experienced weakness or if anyone in their families did either. If that pathway does not work, the only sure way to diagnose FSH is with genetic testing, so you could express interest in that if you have enough clinical symptoms, which to me it sounds like you probably do.\n\nIf you do have FSHD, do not worry too much! It does suck sometimes, but it is manageable. It looks like they will come out with a treatment within the next 5 years, so there is still hope. There are a ton of great communities on Facebook in the meantime to share tips and stories, and just vent if you need to. Good luck! I share my quick story in case it helps you. \n\nI am based in the US.\n\nI noticed a pretty sharp decline in strength 2 years ago. My back was also in a lot of pain as well as a lot of lower leg cramps / muscle spasms.....in my forearms as well. I started out going to a spine specialist and doing physical therapy. \n\nSpine specialist said there is nothing wrong with my back and referred me to a neurologist. \n\nmore then a year later I am still with a 2nd set of neurologist and I believe we are close to a diagnosis as I just had a muscle biopsy operation done and I am waiting to hear back with the test results. \n\nThe nuerologist do specific test to see if your issues are either autoimmune or genetic. Here is the list of test that they have done on me:\n\n1. EMG - nerve conduction (electrical signals in various parts of your body to see if your nerves are responding\n2. EMG - muscle contraction (stick needles in your muscles to listen to how your muscles are contracting\n3. various blood panels\n\nI would expect your neurologist to start with blood panels as a first step. You should ask them to do this if you have not. \n\nall this being said, you are on the right track with going to a neurologist. This is the type of doctor that will arrive at an FSHD diagnosis.......it sounds like you might need to find a better neurologist though. \n\nI hope this helps. Hit me up if you have questions. Are your issues asymmetric?  Did you do genetic testing?  Is your CK elevated?  I had what seemed like FSHD without any facial features.   FSHD has been ruled out twice.  We tested twice and about a decade apart since it was the best fit but it was still negative.  Working my geneticist and we are trying to identify some new form of MD. My issues are pretty symmetrical. I decided to hold off on the genetic test for now. Instead I went straight to a muscle biopsy...I just happened to have recieved my results today. They seem to be predominantly pointing to IBM (inclusion body myositis) first time I have heard of it. Still no treatment for it. Not great that you have a disease but great that you have answers.  Even if there is no treatment doctors underestimate how important a diagnosis is for various reasons. True. I am glad to have an answer as well :)", "Another article to read \n Very interesting.

Are they going to liaise with the FDA and try to go straight to market, having the 'phase 3' after it is available on prescription or are the FDA going to request further testing before approval?\r  \n\r  \nIt certainly shows a measurable benefit which is high on the FDA's list, so who knows?! It is a waiting game and we are (reluctantly) all good at that.\r  \n\r  \nPotentially this could be available by the end of next year which is a great relief to those of us who cannot afford to wait.

Most FSH patients go through periods of greater than 48 weeks with no change whatsoever in symptoms, interspersed with periods of muscle deterioration. The claim that study participants \"reported feeling better\" is scientifically laughable. The metric of upper body range of motion that they used also is so broad and subject to so many other variables that the very small improvement that they report does not strike me as anything but noise.\n\nThe way I read it, they are trying to spin it as \"it works, we swear, but we do not have the evidence yet\" I watched the full presentation of the results. Pretty amazing. No \u201cspin\u201d as some would argue from just reading a PR. Sure the one biomarker they aimed for did not correlate as thought, but the fact that fat infiltration was lowered and range of motion and strength was improved seems like a solid step forward and definitely worth taking. Nothing \u201claughable\u201d about it. As patients we know there are good days and bad days but if overall you feel better than your body must be doing better and that is what we need. Due to fast track designation and the proven safety profile I feel confident this drug will be available sooner than most. I concur.\n\nWe should absolutely maintain a critical view with regards to possible new advances in treatment for FSHD, but ignoring the positive secondary endpoint data from a \"randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled\" trial such as this would be ridiculously counterproductive for us.\n\nI look forward to how this pans out and how the data might also benefit other similar teams working towards their own trials. Do not forget the measured reduction in fat infiltration and increased strength (12-27%) in two key muscles.\n\nWhat I would not give for a 12% improvement per year, let alone 27%.\n\nIt is good to not get your hopes up to avoid disappointment but the fact they are still pushing ahead despite failing the primary endpoint speaks to the strength of results in other areas.\n\nIt is definitely not nothing and I am sure many of us are at the stage where we will take **any** improvement.\n\nImagine a crowd of 1000 people, that is a lot of people... One of those people is wearing red socks.\n\nNow imagine you get to shine a light on one of them, a random person, your chances of selecting the right person is slim. Even if you DO hit the right person you have difficulty untying their shoes to see if the socks are the right colour so maybe you still miss them even though you were lucky in finding them.\n\nThat is why the secondary endpoints are more important, to actually show real world benefits in patients obviously holds a lot of sway otherwise they would be a lot more downbeat about the results and there would be no mention of discussions with regulatory bodies.\n\nI agree FSHD society's post is a bit 'spinny' but there are definitely positives worth celebrating.", "Big money  What is the significance of this to FSHD? Fulcrum Therapeutics putting the money towards FTX 1821 a P38 inhibitor and a possible cure for FSH Nice! Thanks bud.", "To all of you with FSHD that are feels bad, let me tell you my story... Hi,\n\nI am Chris, 31M, Poland\n\nIt all started when I was 16. My left hand could not get on position above my head. Not one year pass and the right hand joins. Than I was hospitalized for 3 days for tests, after that the judgment day has came. FSHD, you will never be able to be strong, you will be fatigued, maybe you will need wheelchair...\n\nI was back than a little fury closed in a flesh. I was sword fighting, climbing, martial arts, thinking about joining the army (my family has 7th generation of military tradition, I am the only son who cannot ever be considered of joining, just imagine how my father felt about this...)\n\nAfter that day the fury was unleashed. In my country medicine is at lower level than average European standards, back than was even worse. So I did not get any specific details about disease, did not get any psychological help. Everyone got young vigorous teenage in it is puberty alone with this...\n\nSo my dumb little self thought, if my life will suck thank I have no regrets, no holding back.\n\nAlcohol was my poison... I was found drunk (almost to the border line) many, too many times...\n\nOf course with progress of my drinking almost all of friends and family turn away from me which makes me even more bitter, I was on the verge of darkness.\n\nIt took me 14 years to understand what I am doing with my life. I am so grateful that I am still alive.\n\nI was not able to kill myself with drinking and did not have the guts to something even more stupid. \n\nRight now I am sober over a year, I have got the pack of very close friend and has support from many people. I do not give a slightest fuck about anyone who thinks of me as of \"not a man\". They know nothing about hell that I went through and walked back alive... It made me stronger than some of healthy people. I walked this year 10km straight in 2'20\" min (which I am damn proud of)\n\nBut looking back on my past If I would be consulted with psychologist, and given more information, I would be prepared and should not have to walk through all of this, and I would lost 10 years of my life for sorrow. \n\nSo if you consider what to do after diagnosis, please, do not do my mistakes. Consult with specialist. Start reading everything about (to be prepared for what can come at you), eat healthy (cliche ;P), and last but not least, do not ever, EVER, for a slightest moment think of yourself that you are a worse man/women. You are who you are and no one has a right to tell otherwise.\n\nBe safe all my brothers ans sisters! If you need any information, help, or just want to talk with someone with FSHD, do not be a stranger. In my mind fate bound as all with the similar genes, we are not a strangers ;) \nIf you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please reach out.

Good work and keep it up. Much like your 10 km, keep on walking. Thanks for sharing Chris.\n\nI did not get my diagnosis till 40. I had always complained to my doctor that I was too skinny, could not put on muscle, joined a gym in my mid 20s, worked really hard and got nothing back. I thought 'surely it should not be this difficult'.\n\nMy doctor just said 'oh you are young, you are lucky to be 'lithe', just eat some more chocolate.'\n\nI was pretty active until I could not continue any more, I was always going out on the bike every day, it was hard work but I did it.\n\nWhen I did get a diagnosis everything suddenly made sense. I had always known 'something' was wrong but I did not know what. Even when I was very young (5?) I knew that I found any exercise very difficult and it was frustrating to see everyone else doing well when I was struggling.\n\nThe reason I reply is because of something you said, do not think of yourself as a worse man/woman.\n\nI never felt that I grew up into 'being a man'. It is tough when you fail at all things 'manly' and I had struggled with that all my life. I never felt like a man.\n\nWhen I got my diagnosis I forgave myself, it was not me being weak, I was doing the best I could but I was dealt an impossible hand of cards that could not win.\n\nI think back to that little boy, at the back of the countryside race, struggling through the mud and rain while all the other children had run ahead... to that 25 year old trying their absolute hardest in the gym... to the guy who was exhausted but still riding that bike down the road... and I gave myself some credit.\n\nMy physicality affected who I was, I was incredibly anxious and could not really keep eye contact with some people because I was so uncomfortable in my skin and it showed.\n\nSince I got my diagnosis I accept who I am and I own it. My personality has changed massively and how I feel about myself has also improved. I joke with people 'trust me to get the disease where you look like an anorexic drug addict!'\n\n;)\n\nI just wanted to say kudos to you for finding your fight and keep on going. Our lives are harder than most and it takes special people to carry on in spite of that.\n\nKeep fighting and let us hope that treatments will be with us soon. Thank you very much. I will surely do ;) Thank you very much for your story. This days the only thing I am really ashamed of is that it took me so long to embrace myself rather than hate myself. What you have said about childhood, It is becoming clearer to me right now that the signs of my illness were everywhere, I was just blind and oblivious... Keep fighting too! All the best! It is a hell of a diagnosis, that is for sure...\n\n\"Yeah you know all those problems you are having? Well it is only going to get worse and there is nothing you can do about it. There is no treatment, no cure and we cannot even tell you how it is going to go. You may end up in a wheelchair.\"\n\nIn a way I am glad I did not get a diagnosis when I was young, like you were. I am not sure I would have handled it very well. It took me at least a couple of years to come to terms with things properly and that was at the age of 40.\n\nAgain, credit to you for getting to the other side. Do a little every day, whatever exercise  you are comfortable with and keep it going.\n\nI wish more strength for us all to keep fighting\n\n:)", "Fsh Society Who we are What we do   \n\nFacioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD)\u2026 the most prevalent form of Muscular Dystrophy, is a devastating, muscle-wasting disease and the FSH Society, is a 501(c)(3) charity dedicated to solving FSHD. The FSH Society has led the way in the fight against FSHD thanks almost entirely to generous donations from the society\u2019s members and those who want to make a difference\n\nWe are focused on the two components that will propel us to success. First, we are directing our funding to research and infrastructure that will greatly speed up the development of treatments. And second, we are enlarging and activating our community, and empowering our stakeholders to raise awareness, engage, and advocate for the resources we require.\n\nMany of our seed grants and starter projects have generated data and insights that help with screening for FSHD, improve genetic testing, and ultimately improve the speed and accuracy of diagnosis.\n\nFSH Society seed grants launched the international effort that culminated in the discovery of the complex genetic mechanism by which D4Z4 contractions on chromosome 4 result in expression of the DUX4 gene in FSHD Type 1. FSH Society grants also contributed to the discovery of SMCHD1\u2019s role in FSHD Type 2 and as a disease modifier in FSHD Type 1.\n\nIn therapy/treatment, we launched two groundbreaking nutritional research projects covering creatine, MRI/MRS, and better biomarkers and techniques to measure clinical trial outcomes and endpoints.\n\nThe Society helped advise, network, and consult with clinicians, patients, and Wyeth Pharmaceuticals to bring about the clinical trial of the myostatin inhibitor myo-029.\n\nThe Society met with Acceleron Pharma to make the case for FSHD as a candidate disease for their myostatin inhibitor ace-031.\n\nIn 2014, the FSH Society worked with aTyr Pharma to recruit volunteers for biomarker studies in association with aTyr\u2019s launch of a Phase I clinical trial of a novel therapeutic compound for FSHD.\n\nIn 2016, the FSH Society helped launch the nationwide FSHD Clinical Trial Research Network and collaborated with Acceleron Pharma to convene focus groups around the ACE-083 clinical trial.\n\nWith FSH research The Hutchinson Cancer Center neurologist and molecular geneticist Dr. Stephen Tapscott broke a decades-long stalemate with a common form of muscular dystrophy when they identified the mechanisms that cause it. This opens the door for future treatments for the disease and, potentially, some cancers. Tapscott\u2019s team first showed that it took two genetic changes on chromosome 4 to cause FSHD. Later, they determined that a certain protein called DUX4 \u2014normally found in germ cells that give rise to sperm in males and egg development in females\u2014was abnormally active in muscle cells, causing muscle mayhem. Tapscott\u2019s research has the potential to lead to a vaccine to treat cancer.\n\nShawn Welch - I have FSH, I volunteer, I donate to research, muscle, blood and time\n\n  (   ( ", "Do not be fooled is the money going to fund a cure   When you decide to support a cause you care about, you want your donation to count.
