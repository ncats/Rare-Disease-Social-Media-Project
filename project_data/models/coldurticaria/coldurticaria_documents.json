", "9 minute ice cube test. is this a reaction? no itch, just hurt as it was thawing. pharmacist said not to put ice on myself for that long again.  No just regular irritation from the cold, perhaps very mild frost burn too. even those small raised whiteish bumps are just regular cold irritation? i have extreme health anxiety and i am so paranoid. No cold urticaria would cover a much larger surface and look way worse. Big red hive like bumps and raised surfaces. This is just a typical reaction to having ice on the skin. Your skin is being irritated by the cold temperature but your immune system is not kicking into hyperdrive like it would with CU. thank you so much you just eased my anxiety. the bumps looked raised a bit &amp;\ni have a little tiny bit of swelling where the ice cube was, but like you said my skin was irritated from the cold &amp; i may have some mild frostburn. should i be lead to believe i do not have CU? i have done so many ice tests and all i get is small bumps like this with no itching or anything. Yeah you are just having the normal reaction. I have CU even driving with the AC on, the cold airflow starts to burn my whole body. thank you for your help! &amp; i am sorry that happens to you :( i hope it gets better for you in the future like i hear can happen I have bad (diagnosed) CU but I do not generally have a reaction to the ice cube test. If you get little red dots (like baby hives) after you get out of the shower/swimming or with the ac on, when it is cold (especially humid) you might have it. If you are worried ask your primary care to refer to to an allergist. Or just ask your primary care about your concerns. I had it for years without realising and would just get the little red spots/bumps everywhere after showers and stuff, but when I moved back to a cold place I went into anaphylactic shock after going in the ocean and found out I had it. Lmk if you have any questions or anything if you are still confused or worried:) i have a doctors appointment this thursday! i do not get red bumps after showers or with the ac on and i sleep with ac on every night. i had ONE reaction with hives and red skin on my legs after being in the ocean on tuesday. but i keep getting told it might be from something in the water or the sunscreen i was wearing mixed w the ocean water. ( i have normal every day pollen allergies idk if that means anything) literally idk how this even would happen bc before tuesday i would use cold water on my face every day, and i would rinse my hair with cold water in the shower. i appreciate you answering so much. did you itch when you had the small bumps? I also have polled allergies, I get really bad ones in the late spring and sometimes early fall. And yes, I get super itchy with the red spots/bumps. When I went into the ocean I was about waist deep and the reaction happened about 10 minutes after first getting into the water I believe. Very scary. It is possible you may have even a less severe form of Cold Urticaria (hopefully you are in the clear all together though) but you are worthy of being validated for your worry either way. I am very medically aware and scared a lot too. Again, if you ever have questions, especially after your appointment, I am here:)) most of my knowledge is from research, a lot of doctors do not take the time with some of the less common allergies/etc Also, if you do have it, severe like me, or not, you will be okay. I live in a very humid yet cold state and I have figured it out with other Heath stuff going on too. It sucks, but there is always a solution. I know how scary not knowing, and being sick can be \ud83d\udc95 yes same! basically i just out my arm in front of my ac unit for a little bit \ud83d\ude02 and it is been 9 minutes and i have no reaction yet. it just got a bit red but that is understandable as the ac is cold haha. other than that no itching or bumps (yet at least??) idk how long it takes to happen from ac tho. you are a literal angel. thank u so so much. i appreciate you &amp; you are a wonderful human. \ud83d\udc96 You would definitely know. It would also begin feeling hot and burning once the cold source is removed I think some people with milder CU do not react to ice cube test. I am almost positive I have mild case of CU because I have had some... incidents. One in ocean as well. I think if you have a mild borderline case where you are not getting hives constantly it is tricker to be diagnosed but happy to not have to deal with the severe symptoms so am not going to complain", "AC vs. Winter I live in Saudi where it gets as hot 100+ F (50+C) in the summer and as cold as 50 F (10 C) in winter. \n\nLuckily winter is only 8-12 weeks long, but the shift is not gradual its sudden.  \n\nI suffer from CU during winter, however not when exposed to cold AC air during summer (AC\u2019s here are usually set to 60F (20 C) or so ). All buildings and homes here are air conditioned \n\nIs that weird ? Anybody else here experiences the same thing ? Not me. AC gets me pretty bad. But everybody has a different threshold. Maybe yours does not kick in until 55 or something. It is not weird. You are probably being triggered by the temperature under 60f. Try refrigerated items and see if they trigger a response.  You mean against my skin ? Yup. Pretty standard test if, by chance, you diagnosed yourself. That i know about , i did not self diagnose urticaria . But i did self diagnose CU as it only occurs during \u201cwinter\u201d time \nOriginally my doctor thought it was psychological So, right now you have narrowed the source down to winter time. The main reason I suggest testing is to isolate the cold as the trigger. It could still be exacerbated by humidity, plant sources, etc. When your threshold is higher it is super easy to test what your threshold is by being naked or lightly dressed in different thermostat settings. But if it needs to be that low the only real way of isolating the cold is by testing in an otherwise non-triggering environment with a source of cold bellow your likely threshold.   Just did ! Redness is there , skin it tight , bump is not as elevated as usual or itchy. I do think its due to the fact that I am doing this consciously ( similar to not reacting to tickling ourselves?!)   Well i guess i am lucky .. i have to be indoors 10 months a year , and every place here is air conditioned Sounds about right. May get itchy in a bit but if your skin is elevated then it is probably the cold triggering it. Your threshold is just under the AC temperature. Invest in warmer/longer garmets for the winter, and consider extra bundling on the main trigger spots; thermal leggings/pj pants and a long coat for legs, a thermal long sleeve for arms and chest, scarf, face mask, etc etc Sadly , I am wearing warmer / longer garments. Maybe I should consider thermal pj\u2019s or so :). \nIts 64 F here , so I hope I have better tolerance tonight ! Thanks Not unless it is breezy AC.

Like my body knows what will happen if I go outside so it is trying to keep me in bed. This is an old post so sorry for the late comment, but I would consider talking to a rheumatologist about a variant called familial cold urticaria. It is a genetic mutation that causes additional symptoms beyond the typical hives and swelling such as joint pain, (similar to rheumatoid arthritis), fatigue, and similar symptoms. Unfortunately it is the rarer of the cold urticarias and is commonly mistyped as other conditions (like RA or fibro) Do not mind the late comment at all. I have actually also developed plaque psoriasis(on the bottoms of my feet) in the 1.5 years and have been experiencing some joint pain that could be psoriatic arthritis, so I have already been told I should see a rheumatologist about that as well.

A few years later I googled my symptoms and found out about CU. My symptoms have gotten better but I still occasionally break out into hives in the cold weather. I was wondering if other people are on the same boat as me? What was your experience finding out that you have CU? Are there allergy medicine I can buy to help with the symptoms (I have never used any to help with it)? I am on the same boat!! I am also 19 and I have had CU symptoms for as long as I could remember. I had allergies to food and other environmental factors as a kid with reactions identical to CU hives but they all went away after 5+ years of weekly allergy shots. I only recently learned that about CU after googling my symptoms and I am confident that I have this condition.\n\nAs others on this subreddit have said before, you can almost any antihistamine and that would help prevent hives when you are cold and that is also what I take too. I will take a generic, Walmart brand antihistamine if I know I will be going some place that is a little cooler, like the movies or to a particularly cold classroom and I find that it really helps!! You are not alone. I started experiencing it when I was around 12 or 13. It is gotten worse though. Benadryl can help but I normally just try to power through the pain since I normally do not have any medications on me when it happens.

I was taking Zyrtec and Benadryl daily for years and they have managed my symptoms super well... until I received the vaccine. I did not receive the 2nd dose out of fear (saw a dermatologist and allergist and both recommended I receive the 2nd dose, though). The dermatologist increased my Zyrtec to quadruple the dose until the rash was gone, which was approximately 3 weeks after receiving the 1st vaccine. I am required to receive the 2nd vaccine for my job and I am having extreme anxiety over it. It was recommended to take quadruple the dose of my Zyrtec again for 1 day before the vaccine and 1 day after, but because it took 7 days for me to have a reaction the 1st time, is that really going to be enough to stop the reaction?!  \n\nAnyone experienced similar issues? Any advice? I had no issues with both doses. In my country we do a larger gap between doses so i got 2 pfizer doses about 7 weeks apart. Interesting. Glad you did not have a reaction! Had Moderna, had no issues with either shot. I had both shots of Pfizer back in February and I had no issues! I have had my first Pfizer (second doses are recommended at 8 weeks in this country, so I have not had it yet) and had no reactions to it - I checked with my allergist beforehand and they said it was fine. Maybe it is because I have chronic idiopathic urticaria (cold urticaria dominant) that I had such a severe reaction?! I am glad you did not have any issues with it, though! Glad you did not have any adverse reactions! I must be one of the rare few who did. Awesome!

I was walking in the cold super quick and this happened after I sat down within minutes of getting back.  Hard to say, but it does not look like it to me. Does it itch? It might just be your akin that got cold and red after going in. It did itch in the beginning, the white in the middle is swollen and tougher to the touch than my other skin so I think it may be a welt or something. Hmm, ok. Hard to say. If it is CU you will get it again at some point. Also does applying heat in it relieve it immediately? Going inside or not walking in the cold seems to relieve the symptoms. My legs itch when walking in the cold and they have as long as I can remember. Sometimes they get a little rash but never a tough mark in the middle like this. Hmmm, it may be that then. Maybe you have a not so severe form of it. If you want to be sure I guess a doctor must evaluate you. Or try antihistamine.

Ice cube test to confirm. But it is possible it is just some product you are using. Basically run an ice cube on your forearm for about 5 minutes (stop immediately if you start getting a welt before that) and when you remove it you will develop some welts (not goose bumps) if you have CU.

It is getting colder outside, so I guess I will find out :| Did you fingertips become swollen at all? Not visibly, but that is what it felt like. Funnily enough I described it as \"you know when you are making snowballs with your bare hands and you are slowly regaining more feeling in your fingertips when they get warmer again?\"\n\nLeft hand (cold food) vs right hand (warm knife): \n\nSeems so obvious when I think about it but I did not make the connection back then Yeah I have the same issues. Cutting up cold fruit or veggies triggers swelling and itchiness. Like you said, not visibly obvious but I feel the swelling is there. It is been bad enough before to the point I could not bend my fingers to make a complete fist. I also feel like fingers and hands are the most reactive during CU because they are mostly the first ones exposed and first ones to get cold. I take loratadine every morning as a preventative - it helps a lot and is non-drowsy! good test. though I would just try an ice cube on your inner forearm for a minute or two to confirm. Materials add another possible allergy vector. Though since you tested with two different things, plastic and aluminum, I would say it is confirmed cold. \n\nitchy other things could be related. like when your whole body is exposed to cold, but not enough to cause welts. My daughter gets stuffy and itchy from AC blowing on her face if it is cold enough it seems. Oh yeah, using a coolpack was a dumb idea, because it was way too big. The material was an unlikely allergy vector as I have used it in the past quite a lot. Ice cubes are better, I just did not have any at the moment and I did not want to wait. \n\nIt is not cold enough and I still get ichy, that is what is strange. So you can itch without overt symptoms. Most people it is a very narrow window,  they are busting out in welts and itching at the same time once they cross their threshold temp/wet/wind level. Some however have a range of effect, like first some itching to a temp, then red, then welts, as it gets colder. So on off switch vs dimmer basically. Sounds like you might be a dimmer switch.

I havent had any issues with the drowsiness, I just wish I could drink with it \ud83d\ude44 what do you do to combate cold air when you breathe? It traps warm air between the mask and your face, and also warms up as you breathe through it which warms the air as you breathe it in and stops you breathing cold air straight out the sky.

Fast forward to a summer when I was 18, I went swimming at the beach, which has never caused me any issues up until that point, where I started feeling a fatigue and my heart beating fast, I tried to swim off to land, and as Soon as I stood on my feet to walk back, I collapsed, and I felt my heart going warmer and tensing up. i luckily was saved by a woman walking by who gave me some water. I did not know what to make of it, and I assumed it was because of something I ate ( I have no food allergies, that seems to be a common thing here ). Some months later I start noticing that when I touch cold stuff I feel itchy and get mild hives on my skin, So I visited a doctor but he could not recognize the disease. I am sorry for the long post I tried to go into details so I could get better feedback and see if many of you guys relate. Can you just get an allergy suddenly, and is it treatable, I tried antihistaminics ( Xysall ) but I stopped, since the weather is warm and I am not at much risk daily. thank you! Hi! I have both dermatographia and cold urticaria and my understanding is that both can be linked to autoimmune disorders, so yes it would make sense that it runs in your family. I take 30-40mg Zyrtec (cetirizine hcl) daily as prescribed by an allergist and that keeps mine very manageable. However, I have never had a major attack like it seems you have, so I would be a little wary of not having an epi pen on me (that is something I discussed for a while with my doctor) Hey! My father has a very mild form of CU that he has never been diagnosed for but we realized after I started having severe CU reactions. I have never had allergies before November 2019 and I was (am) 19. I was not allergic to a thing until I suddenly started breaking out into hives that burned and itched to the point I was in tears. I started taking Fexofenadine (allerga) at 180 MG twice a day and after a month or so I got to the point where I can eat/drink cold things again. Yes, it can just appear and it is actually pretty common, from what I have researched, for CU to develop in your late teens early 20 . If you need someone to talk to or if you want me to try to help you find research on CU just message me. Thank you so much! I wish you the very best at dealing with this condition. I sure will do whenever I have a question.", "Hi everybody! I just had this weird rash for the first time ever today after swimming in the cold ocean (it is winter here in Australia). Can anybody tell just by the looks of it whether this is an allergic reaction / cold urticaria? Thank you!  It is possible! Coincidently, I had my first cold urticaria reaction during an ocean swim in Melbourne (in my mid 20\u2019s).\n\nYou can test this by grabbing an ice pack out of the freeze and strapping it to your arm for 10-15 minutes. If you take it off and there are hives, you have joined the club.  Ahhh hehe. Might try that just to know. Thank you. Usually cold urticaria goes away quickly once you warm up It did! Well then it definitely could be! You would want to test out your reaction to cold again to be sure and talk to your doctor Okay I will do that, thank you! Could I make it worse at all by exposing myself to cold water more? That is not really the case for me, I get worse reactions when I am in really cold weather but when I go back home to warm California I go back to normal. It is a really weird disorder we are all kind of different. My case is pretty mild but some people have it so severe they get anaphylaxis My first reaction was after swimming in the pacific. Mine looks just like this. Not as severe as some you will see here but quite obnoxious just the same. Basically, the doctor I went to, a supposedly a renowned allergist and immunologist did not know what the hell it was. He had to excuse himself and go look it up on a computer. He is never seen one in his 40+ years of practice. For the test, he followed exactly what was stated on the web. An ice cube test, where he had me hold an ice cube on my forearm for few minutes. Sure enough there was an itchy red blister when I removed the ice. His solution was to have me take over the counter Benadryl. That is it. What a waste of time and money. Does it bother you much in your daily life? Not if I avoid the cold. It is annoying all winter but I generally minimize my time outside (I live in the southern plains, it gets cold but it is not always cold). During the summer I have to stay out of cold water. Pools, lakes, and the ocean bug me if they are not warm Right, that is good to know, thank you! He could not do much because there is no cure and literally nothing except antihistamines can make it a little better or prevent severe allergic reactions to occur  They do not tell you about lifestyle changes like histamine diet, checking for thyroid abnormalities and Hashimotos. \n\nCheck this out:  I went on a KETO diet and 90% my CU went away. The key is to lighten the histamine load on your body. Yes there are some high histamine food on KETO just eliminate them. My doctor could not tell me that. \n\"Nothing but antihistamines can make it better\"? That is just a band-aid. Ok but low histamine diet is too restrictive for most people. Also I have already cut out most high histamine foods from my daily diet. If it worked for you great, but KETO also is not meant for everyone. Of course the answers of doctors for this condition is a waste of time and money because there literally is not enough evidence on it, or histamine intolerance in general. Taking OTC allergy meds also prevents more severe reactions from quickly occurring such as shock from the cold or even anaphylaxis. Otc meds like Benadryl crosses the blood brain barrier. Do you want that chemical in your brain? Let me break this down to you. You are elevating your histamine levels by stuffing allergens in your gut (SAD-standard American diet). You may not know it at the time until it reaches critical level and manifests into a outbreak like a rash or anaphylaxis. For some, anaphylaxis can be deadly. Are you willing to take that risk? Every time you consume that allergen it builds up in your body and creates more histamine --histamine builds up in your body like running tap water in a cup, eventually it overflows when it can no longer hold all the water. Result is an outbreak. Keto may not work for everyone since you could still be consuming that one allergen that is causing you problems. If you want to get to the primary cause of your elevated histamine levels, but more restrictive, is the Low-histamine/ Elimination diet. \nHear me out. Benadryl and other antihistamine is a bandaid! Pills are not the answer. And how old are you? \nI heard sometimes it stops after 5-7 years", "What is your experience with CU? So basically I am really curious to see how CU effects all of you. What are your symptoms, how long have you had it, does it get worse or better?\n\nI will start, ~10 years and it is only gotten worse. The cold makes my hands and feet swell up, then hives on my thighs, face, neck, until it spreads to cover my entire body if I am not careful. I will start shaking really bad before anyone else does, and it makes it really hard to think so I end up forgetting words and stuttering a lot. Doing things like holding cold drinks physically hurts, and if I drink a cold drink too fast I get brain freeze. I am talking a juice box here. If I drink a cold drink for too long or eat something like ice cream my mouth also swells up.\n\nYour turn! When it gets cold I get hives on my hands, and I can feel them on my feet. If I do not warm up they start to spread up my forearms and legs, but I have never let it progress past that before getting warm. \n\nI have been diagnosed for 2 years. It has not really progressed since I was diagnosed. I can drink cold beverages and eat ice cream just fine. I have not been swimming since my diagnosis, but leading up to it I did not have any early warning signs that it was an issue. I will probably dip my lower legs in for 10-15 minutes and see if I get a reaction, and if not I will get in with my epi-pen close. \n\nFor me it seems that as my vessels vasoconstrict due to the cold my body releases histamine. Thus the progression from the extremities to my body. \n\nFor day to day life I wear gloves and jackets a lot more, and bought warmer socks. I am toying with the idea of long johns under my pants and shirts for colder days. I live south so it is only an issue from about December-March. I have had CU for as long as I can remember. I am 26 now and it is only gotten worse. Whereas before I would only get a reaction (hives literally all over) when skin is against the cold weather, now I can literally wear layers and long johns and it will not make a difference, I still break out. I started to take quick bursts of cold showers to try to experiment with minimal constant contact so we will see how that goes. Eating and drinking cold things never bothered me. \nPs.

It seems to have started around the time she started going through menopause and so far has not shown any signs of letting up. \n\nA big annoyance for her this time of year is the cooling of her skin when she sweats. She also cannot swim anymore as the water temperature immediately causes her to break out in painful red splotches.\n\nI am just wondering if any of you have any advice for things that worked for you? Types of clothing or anything at all. I just want her to be able to enjoy summer as much as possible, and she is not tech savvy enough to use Reddit herself to ask.

She is on a pretty good concoction of antihistamines and other stuff to mitigate her symptoms but she still struggles a lot in summer more than winter. Maybe she could be on a stronger one though Yeah, I live in a place with cold winters, but I react the worst when it is like 5-10 Celsius and rainy or windy. Im on antihistamines and it works. Hunt around for allergists and ask them if they have seen CU before. I was lucky and on my first call my doctor had seen two other patients with it. (I live in New England) going to a specialist is the best thing you guys can do. Check if you need a referral from your PCP and book an appointment asap! I take almost about 180-360mg a day Thank you. We are in Ireland, I do not know if there are any specialists here.

I have not seen anyone else with little babies that have CU and I am wondering if anyone on here has any advice? Specifically for night time which is when she breaks out the worst. Right now we are doubling up her jammies but any tips or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated. Unfortunately I am 20 y/o so not exactly what you are after but some general advice I think to help your baby to be most comfortable is focus on the room temperature rather than doubling pyjamas. Of course I am unsure on the severity of your child\u2019s case. But doubling pyjamas could make her hot and sweaty through the night and then the skin (for example fingers, ears and toes as they are easy places to be affected because they are extremities) exposed will react to the colder air even more. Again having no child experience whatsoever I am not sure if she would be sleeping in another room(?) but if she is, I would definitely try to create almost a mini climate for her in there. Keeping her door shut and a fan on very low to keep air flow good, accompanied with a heater should stabilise the temperature and help her sleep more peacefully. Also when you are out and about and she has reacted, her skin may feel sensitive afterwards for the next half an hour or so, so just some extra care there should help her comfort but again I am not sure of how she reacts. I hope this helps a little bit, feel free to dm me for anything else :) I have CU and I suspect my 22 month old daughter does as well, though it is not been confirmed yet. Our pediatrician said it is ok to try children\u2019s Benadryl to see if it alleviates the symptoms so perhaps ask your doctor is that is an option? Slight warning: Benadryl sometimes has the opposite effect on really young kids than you expect and can make them really keyed up instead of groggy. I also find that a space heater in her bedroom helps but I know that even when she is really bundled up she just will not last as long as her brother when they play outside (though we are in Minnesota so it gets really cold here). Good luck figuring out what works for you!", "CU and Covid-19 vaccine Hello there! I am a f28 with CU. I was wondering if it is safe for me to have the vaccine?   \nIt would be great to hear from other people that already had it.  \n\n\nDid you have the vaccine? I had both shots (pfizer) about a month ago and had little to no reaction. Just a sore arm and some fatigue. You should be fine! I got my 2nd Pfizer does a few weeks ago with out any abnormal reaction (a little sore and tired, just the normal stuff ). Pre-Vax I had a similar concern and asked my doctor, she said there was not anything to worry about - by the time I went back for my second dose I was more worried about getting hives waiting outside  in the cold for line than having a reaction to the shot! and you have cold urticaria, right? I am just double checking because I had an anaphylactic shock once (nothing drug related, only from cold) and it is enough for me :P your experience is helpful.   \nthank you very much!! \\^\\^ Thank you very much! Thank helps a lot! fun info, I was checking Google for that too (I did not get any insights) BUT I learned that cold urticaria is apparently a recorded rare side effect of some covid-19 cases. I have heard some people talk about having reactions or worse cu symptoms following the vaccine for a bit, I would recommend talking to your doctor and asking them what regiment of antihistamines to take the days leading up. Obviously keep your epi pen with you when you go and stick around a little longer/near a hospital for a bit just in case if you can. I have to call my doctor and see still, but I may go get mine Thursday! Got 2 Pfizer shots...no CU reaction. (I have CU). thanks! I will have my epipen with me and I will stick around for an hour at least... as for the antihistamines I have heard contradicting things for other allergies (as for example to stop them before the vaccine). They do not do much for me either way and I do not take them regularly. Good luck on yours! Yes I do, I was diagnosed at 5 years old and have been living with CU for 18 years. My doctor told me to get the vaccine. There really is no way to have a reaction as a result of CU because it is a completely different stimuli (vaccine vs. cold). There is little to no possibly of the vaccine causing a CU related reaction. Thaaank you. I have CU 10 years now. Thanks for the info :) Appreciated I have had both of the Pfizer and I was fine. Just let them know you have cu and they might make you wait longer after the shot but that is it. I have had CU for a decade, a month out from my 2nd Pfizer shot and no reaction. Just an FYI- there is one study that indicates people have had adverse reactions to having the Covid vaccine too soon after having immunotherapy or omalizumab injections (xolair). Advice seems to wait at least two days after immunotherapy/ omalizumad injections before getting Covid vaccine.\n\n\n\n(Edited to include link to study) thanks for the info. I did not but it is good to know Got my vaccine today (Pfizer). Minor headache afterwards and slight pain at injection site. I brought my EpiPen with me, and the staff asked me to stay for 30 minutes for observation just in case.\n\nIts always good to limit the medications you take right before and after a vaccine. This makes it easier to determine the cause and severity of potential side effects. I was advised not to take anti-inflammatory meds or antihistamines 6 hours before and after. Great! Thanks :) Thank you for your input! I wish you a quick recovery from the side effects! :) also good to know about the anti-inflammatory meds.

Except when they are not. This year we have had a relatively warm winter making for soggier air. I have noticed that even when I have not been outside, and the house is cozy (to me anyway) my toes, arches, fingers, and wrists... will hive up, swell, and itch like crazy when there is heavy dampness.

I wanted to check with this community and see if anyone else has issues with gluten or immune issues! I have not specifically read anything on gluten in relation to CU, but there could be a connection.

Although, it is summer and I am in TX. So more time is needed to see if it is working. I started a strict dairy free keto diet and my cu had diminished greatly.

Hi everyone,\n\nI have not been diagnosed with CU, but I have always had a problem with cold exposure (especially outdoors) with severe extreme itching and redness (harder to see because I am dark skinned) it mostly affects my legs and stomach area, but can also affect my chest, arms and back. Working out in even moderate climate gives me a horrible reaction and if a fan is blowing on me or there is wind it is even worse. \nI never even knew this was really a thing until I hired a girl who explained that she had this condition (hers was severe and could send her to hospital) and I was like \u201cME TOO!!\u201d Both is my sisters also suffer from it in the same ways that I do. \nI live in Canada where it gets very cold for many months of the year and I need to dress very warmly when walking my dog and make sure I stay at a slow pace because if I get heated it will be awful.\nToday I went to walk my dog and it is only 12 degrees celsius (not that cold) and I did not even walk very fast and after 15 mins my legs started going. I am concerned because usually it takes more activity or a colder temp to get me to the point I was at today... I feel like it is worsening.\nWhen I went to my doc about this last year she basically shrugged it off and said there is nothing that can be done except to stay out of the situations that cause it or take an antihistamine before hand... so annoying. I am now 36. Has this worsened for anyone else? Any tips? For be it only got better so not sure what I can tell you. It got worse the first months I had it and stayed stable for many years then gradually lessened.

Whether or not this is true I have no clue. But it is the reason I started antihestamine Hello, kind of in the same boat sis. I live in Canada and have CU for 2 years. For instance, just the cool air from AC will trigger hives and itching. I always have antihistamine on me and always take it before I leave the house during Fall and Winter.

Hi all! \n\nI have come on here every now and again but I always get really scared after reading a few posts, yet I am still glad that theres a community to turn to!\n\nSo, as the title shows, I have a question.. but first here is the history of my cold urticaria.. My cold urticaria started almost a year ago, about December 2019/January 2020, with my fingers slightly swelling and feeling a little tingly after a 5 minute walk from my car to my classrooms in the winter time. From there it developed into my face becoming red and other exposed parts, to  its worst when I walked for only 5 mins in 45\u00ba F weather (which I have easily tolerated in the past) in a short sleeve only to have huge hives all over my face, arms, hands, and swollen lips and hands. At that point I also had a slight kidney infection. After seeing the doctor and showing him the pictures (which I have lots of, if anyone needs to see), he immediately diagnosed me. I have had moments where drinking something cold has made my chest hurt (about once or twice) but I am unsure if that is related. My reactions have been anywhere from hivey to just red, never all that itchy just uncomfortable. \n\nAs it became summer, I had my last bout of reactions after being in some chilly rain in March, and from there it is been few and far between. Every now and again, less than once per month even, my hands may have the tiniest sensation of tingling, but that is it, no hives or redness. I have held cold drinks in my hands or between my legs for a while, ice cubes on my inner forearm and hands, dipping my hand/arm into cold water, and I have even taken a cold shower with no sign of hiving or reaction. Of course, with winter eminent, the answer should become clear, but I am curious if anyone has had a similar experience in the summer? Maybe it has to do with body heat being higher?\n\nFor reference I live in Texas, so summer is usually pretty darn hot and winter is not too too cold, just a lil windy. I also was in my senior year of high school when I was diagnosed and it was a pretty stressful point in my life, so I am not sure if that has to do with its onset. During summer my symptoms definitely subside, I even have ice cream more frequently:) the worst usually comes at the start of winter and then I just have to manage it. I read somewhere that there is usually a temperature that is like a threshold - I think I get affected most when weather is below 14 degrees centigrade or made worse by wind.

If your dr is refusing to refer you, get another doctor. Also try your insurance telemedicine line, if you have. Not a doctor, but reflux with chronic pain sounds like damage. Cold UC however, like many UC can be trigger by changes, one of which being cold/traumas/etc. While I do not think cold UC can be caused by drinking cold liquids, causing hives in your throat, you might want to try a full day or two of drinking warmer water just to make sure nothing changes.

It started in Colombia (tropical country), and then I moved to Canada in 2016 and honestly I do not  see any difference in intensity/frequency of the reactions. Seems very consistent to me. What I think, from analyzing my reactions, is that there is a temp threshold that once is crossed, the urticaria reaction starts. It does not need to be at freezing temperatures to occur. Anyway, I am trying to get pregnant and I read that antihistamines could affect female fertility by 'drying' women's fluids. Does anybody knows about this? I take reactin every single day to prevent/ reduce the intensity of my reactions. There is someone here that have gotten pregnant while taking antihistamines? I do not know specifically about the effect on fertility but I take Zyrtec regularly for my cold urticaria and did while TTC both my kids.

I have been an avid swimmer my whole life - but have not been swimming for about 1 year(with our lap pool being closed due to covid). I have had my CU symptoms for about 3 years now without knowing it was a condition and I use to swim all the time back then - but since being diagnosed I am really scared to go back to the pool. Are there any of you who are also competitive swimmers? surfers? or anything similar? and what are your tips if any? \n\n(i am planning on just forcing myself to go swimming tomorrow but not jump in obviously and see how it goes but i am terrified and frustrated that i am scared to do the one thing that gives me joy it sucks!) Thanks all in advance! Not competitive, but my son with CU uses a 3mm full wetsuit for pool or ocean swimming (( It is not so thick that he cannot move comfortably, but it provides enough insulation for a long time of swimming without rapid temperature changes.  He has not had hives while using the wetsuit, though he discovered he has to remove it and get dressed in a warm room, otherwise he will get hives when cold air hits him as he takes off the suit.  He blends in fine at the beach, at public pools I think most people assume he is wearing a full suit for skin protection (which is another bonus - no need for sunscreen.) Thank you for your response and suggestion. Does your son also take an antihistamine or something prior to swimming with the wetsuit? He takes daily Cetirizine to manage the various urticaria he has, he is got cold urticaria and cholinergic urticaria.  He started on the Cetirizine when they suspected idiopathic urticaria, but since starting that, he does not get random hives anymore, just hives linked to specific triggers (cold and rapid body temp changes in his case) so it seems like it works.  \n\nHis allergist suggested taking a different antihistamine in addition to the Cetirizine (I think she suggested benadryl or claritin) before exposure if he noticed his hives were still coming on despite preventative steps and he does have an epipen for emergencies which he is never come close to needing for CU (it is also for his food allergies, but prescribed for both.) I also take a levocetirizine daily and was recommended to double up my dose right before swimming which I have not tried yet because of the fear - but this is what i plan on doing tomorrow. I think im not so afraid of the hives as I am of a real emergency. Thanks again for your answers! I know everyone is different but it helps to hear other peoples experiences. I am not really a swimmer in the sense I do it for casual exercise more sporadically, but I just found out I had a very mild case of CU last winter and I also developed really intense anxiety about pools and swimming. When I went in the lap pool, it was cold but nothing I would not have otherwise been able to do symptomless bc my case of CU is so mild. However, my anxiety is so bad my throat started feeling really tight. I spun myself out almost into a mini panic attack and thought I was not going to be able to breathe. I stopped swimming and clung to the float thingie between lanes to pull myself all the way back in. I thought the cold water was closing my throat, but it was 100% anxiety symptoms.  I did not even have hives! but I was sooo freaked out. \n\nI ended up finding a warmer pool to swim in as my solution which eased my anxiety. This might not be possible but something to look into, it is worth it for peace of mind if it works for you even if it is a smaller pool.\n\nMy best advice is do not be hard on yourself about your anxiety. It is a natural and normal feeling that alot of people go through.  My therapist told me that anxiety symptoms can lead to very scary bodily feelings that might mimic what could be CU symptoms for example your chest or throat might feel more tight as one potential symptom as intense anxiety which you could mistake for anaphylactic shock. It does not mean your in danger but your body might be convinced you are in danger if your anxiety spirals. So I would say take it easy, go slow, do not push yourself to do too much too fast. Anxiety has a way of going away naturally over time through exposure therapy if you do not avoid your triggers and face them slowly but surely. As long as you are managing your CU in a way that is medically safe/doctors are okay with it and you are not pushing through an actually dangerous situation I think you will be okay. just take it extra cautious slow and be safe. Also it sounds like CU can get worse or better over time so all the more reason to take it slow and not assume the best or worst, but just take each moment for what it is. I would also ask your doctor if they have thoughts on this, obviously this is just my two cents not knowing what is safe/right for you. wish you the best to find a solution here! Thanks  you so much for sharing your thoughts and experience. I am also fortunate that my CU is mild according to my allergist. My allergist was not worried about it but she did have to mention that shock is a possibility and that is what is causing my anxiety. I do already have generalized anxiety and go through periods of panic and definitely have experienced what you are talking about. I plan on going slow tomorrow and taking my time getting in the water - I think I just need to prove to myself that I can still safely swim. Before I knew CU was potentially dangerous I had been swimming for years without worry despite having the same symptoms I now recognize as being CU. Anyways, thank you so much for your kind response it helped me feel better and of course I will be careful! :) For me competitive swimming pools are fin as long as the water temp is 80\u00b0F+ You can find the thermometer or ask an employee and you will get the tempature Thanks for the tip! I will ask next time. I was able to swim this morning without much issue. Definitely be careful with lakes/rivers. I have had multiple close calls without epipen and antihistamines full body reactions caused loss of vision vomiting and weakness. Pretty sure I was at cusp of anaphylactic shock, but was able to make it to scolding hot shower to stop it. Thanks for sharing your experience. That sounds awful, I am sorry you had to go through that. Do you find that taking antihistamines beforehand has helped you avoid these reactions or no? Yes 100%. They have saved my life with planned exposures to cold water. But they do not take away all symptoms.

I just thought it was cause I was too cold. \n\nThen, a year ago, my friend and I decided to do a photo shoot on the beach in the morning. My body had hives all over and we thought there was something in the water. \n\nI started researching it because it happened again when I went Ice skating for fun. I found out what \u201ccold urticaria\u201d was. \n\nMy family took it as a joke and called me a hypochondriac saying there is always something wrong with me. \n\nNah. Cold urticaria is not a joke. \n\nI went to the doctor and she diagnosed me with it. It sucks because it is gotten so bad that if I even walk on cold tile, my feet swell. If I hold a cold vegetable at the store I work at, my hands swell. And there is nothing we can do for this but take allergy meds. It is real. I just got diagnosed but mine is not too bad yet. Mostly itching and swelling when my skin gets cold. I take allergy pills when I go for runs in the cold. People do not believe me either when I tell them. Right. People make fun of me and say I am over exaggerating As somebody who has been afflicted by the disease since I was 8, now 22, I can affirm that people rarely believe you and will downplay your reactions to being caused by something other than what actually is happening. Even after being diagnosed by a medical professional who had the disease themself. \nI also had the same experience of it occurring a few times and not actually knowing why. I had a full blown hospital trip after going in to shock from it from swimming in a lake in spring, and was not diagnosed for at least another year. \nGood luck to you! Ooo good luck to you too! I am turning 20 next week so I know how you feel. Everyone just calls me a hypochondriac but I do not listen to them \ud83d\ude02 People are super quick to try and downplay problems they have never heard of. I am sorry about all the people not believing you. It is a shame that when you can look up almost anything on the internet these days people still do not believe in something unless they have already heard of it. Yes!! I have googled it just to show people I was right and was not making it up. I have also seen news articles and sent them those too Every time I get hives, I just say HEY LOOK and then end the myth about cold hives My family did not take me seriously at the beginning until I puked and fainted after I went for a swim in our pool. I am currently on the waiting list to get myself diagnosed. Aw I am so sorry! I finally got diagnosed this year but before that my family kept telling me not to go to the doctors because I was overreacting but then it started to show up in the news. They believed me after that!", "Cold Urticaria in Hawaii I cannot believe it - I just had a cold urticaria attack here in Hawaii. I moved here two years ago in part because I wanted to be somewhere warm and escape the daily cold urticaria attacks I was experiencing on the east coast (sometimes so painful I thought I was going to pass out). I was going on a walk this evening with my dog and had a terrible attack about 1.5 miles into the walk. I checked the temperature and it was 77 degrees. Such a bummer. Have antihistamines helped at all?  That is crazy man Thanks for the sympathy, I could not believe it. It seems to be a breeze that really triggers it, not necessarily temperature. But luckily antihistamines do help, I had just stopped taking them every day in the warmer weather. Really unfortunate that even in such a nice temperate place that can still happen.  My sister has CU and we live in Maryland so you can imagine how cold it gets around this time of year \u2744\ufe0f Good luck with everything! Ugh. I am sorry :(\nThat is my fear with moving away, I live on the east coast too. One day this summer it was like 80 some degrees out. I grabbed a metal horse bit that had been sitting in the shade, two minutes later I thought my hands were going to fall off.\n\nWe are not safe anywhere \ud83d\ude29 That is horrible.  Such an awful problem to have, and most people laugh and do not believe me when I explain it...

Im trying to see if anyone has tried Xolair for cold urticaria ?!", "I have to wear gloves while cooking My cold urticaria has been progressively getting worse and I am now at the point that if I grab anything cold from the fridge or freezer and touch/hold it for too long, my hands turn red and start to itch and burn. So I ended up buying a pair of \"cut proof\" cooking gloves and they honestly work great. They keep my hands warm, I am still able to keep a proper grip on things, and if the knife slips, apparently I am safe from a bad cut. I just wish I did not have to be the weirdo with special cooking gloves.\n\nDoes anyone else have the same/similar problem? I also cannot hold things for too long because my fingers swell up and it hurts to bend them. It does not stop me from rearranging the freezer though, just inspires a mad dash back and forth between the counter and fridge in a race against my cells.\n\nThe gloves sound like a really smart idea, I might get myself a pair. I personally recommend the gloves. They make a world of difference. You can find a bunch of options online!\n\nI totally understand that mad dash. I love an organized fridge and freezer, but it totally messes with my hands. I feel like it should be an olympic sport for us. I wear gloves when drinking, especially if they are cool enough to cause condensation as moisture makes the problem worse.  Gloves with grip pads are a lifesaver!", "Feeling suicidal due to this condition. Last week, I had the common cold and my Cold Urticaria came back. I read online that this happens when a virus gets into your immune system. Since then, I have been itchy and experiencing hives even when I am inside the house.

Itching has become something I am very scared to do because I am scared of it giving me hives. I do not want my family to spend so much money on me without a cure even being found for this yet.

Hello,\n\nI had a baby in august, and we live in a climate that is cold in the winter months. I have been going on walks with baby but ever since it is gotten colder, I keep getting red raised hives on my face and neck after I go outside. They get worse once I am back inside and they last up to 3 days. Is this cold urticaria? I have never had this issue before pregnancy. Has anyone else gotten this postpartum? How long did it last for you? And what can I do to avoid this so I can continue to bring my baby out on walks. \n\nThank you! So it sounds like it very well could be, maybe try the ice cube test on your arm to see. If it is lasting three days it could be hereditary cold urticaria which lasts a lot longer than non, but if it developed after you gave birth then idk. Best of luck to you! I have never heard of CU developing postpartum, but also never heard of it not developing postpartum. If you have already ruled out any other allergens in the area (maybe a new tree/plant in the area or paint fumes?), then it is possible you have CU. It is also possible to only have CU on specific areas of your body, so it is not particularly unusual for you to only have it on your face and neck (particularly since I assume those are the exposed areas of your body when you are out walking).\n\nAs the other poster mentioned, you can try the ice cube test. Not everyone who has CU develops a reaction to an ice cube because some people require a larger area of exposure to react, but it is still something worth testing out if you want to try to confirm it.\n\nFor me, when my CU is triggered, the symptoms will last for a few hours, even if I am moved into a warm area. Depending on the severity and length of the exposure, the hives/swelling may stay for a few days. I have had CU since birth and I am in my 30s now.\n\nHave you tried any allergy pills? They do not work for me, but it works for some people. Also, consider getting a balaclava or something to cover as much of your face and neck as possible to keep warm. Thank you I will try that, I am not sure what else it could be at this point since it is only when I am out in the cold Thanks for your response!\n\nI have read that pregnancy suppresses your immune system so that your body does not attack the fetus. So because of this, you can develop new allergies after pregnancy that will last until your system is back up and running.  \n\nI have not heard of anyone developing cu postpartum either. It just seems odd that it is the first winter since having a baby and now every time I am outside for more than a of couple minutes I get hives shortly after I come inside and they take 3 days for the redness to go away completely. \n\nI do not get the rash otherwise and everything is covered in snow here so there is not really anything new outside. I will try taking an allergy pill before I go out and see if that helps. Hopefully it works, especially with the lockdown for covid I would not be able to go anywhere else :(", "Went for a jog in 45 degree damp weather and 10 min into it broke out in hives on my hands, arms, groin, toes, had an itchy throat, ears, and eyes and had a slight wheeze... Leading theory is its cold urticaria.  As the title says, i broke out in hives and had itchy hands, eyes, ears, throat after going for a quick jog. The wheezing almost caused me to go to the hospital, but after taking medicine, that mostly went away within the hour. The hives lasted much longer and I feel asleep, three hours after it first started, still with them on my hands and underarms.\n\nAnyway... i need to go to the doctor for some tests for this and other things, but it was uncomfortable and trying to avoid it from happening again. Yep, sounds like it. Stay bundled up. I am sorry to welcome you to this itchy club :( It is going to be a weird winter. I moved to Los Angeles from the east coast 6 years ago and thanks to COVID I am back in an area with below freezing temps... hopefully taking my allergy medicine consistently helps! For me, Allegra makes the itching go away in my body but the hives are still there. My face, especially my ears, and my hands still burn and swell. I am glad wearing a mask outside is in style now, haha! It helps so much. If I am going to be outside a lot, wearing leggings under pants helps. Wool socks from Costco are good too.", "Hello fellow CU friends, I am glad that there is a forum for people who live with the same disease. I was wondering, does anyone else feel like their life is not the same just a bit? Since being diagnosed, I have not been able to wear shorts, sandals, or dresses in fear of having a reaction and freaking other people out in public. I have been staying away from cold drinks or foods. Also I am afraid to go swimming at the beach again or to go snowboarding. It is not the worst disease to be living with, but it definitely took me by surprise. Even when I am dressed head to toe in a jacket and socks and tennis shoes, my hands and feet get itchy while I am in the middle of a class. Let me know you are guys\u2019 thoughts. I just want to feel a little less alone in this and please let me know if you feel you have to take the same precautions. I wonder sometimes if I am overreacting. Also, while I am venting, I feel that no one else understands the discomfort of the itchiness, hotness, and the swelling that comes with a reaction. I have learned to stay away from triggers, but having a reaction sucks. \n\nAnyways, I wish you all the best and hope that we can figure out methods to tame the reactions together. :) Is allergy medicine like Zyrtec helpful to you with preventing CU reaction? I take my Zyrtec everyday as a preventative and it is really helpful and I feel less stressed about a potential reaction. It is been a week since I first experienced it. I am still getting my head around what adjustments I will need to make.  \n\nI am a bit scared to go out running right now and I have not been out in a week. While I ran 5k or more every day in January and the first 2 weeks of February (had planned on doing it every day this year).  Thinking I will sell my kayak.  I will probably keep hiking and accept the itching. I use to feel the same way. When I was first diagnosed I spent about 2 weeks doing nothing but sulking in my room and dragging myself to school and work. Recently I have gotten my normal life back after going to an allergist and taking 400 mg of antihistamines. It took about 3 months to build up enough of an immunity to the cold to be able to drink cold things and even eat ice cream again. I take allegra twice a day plus another medication to help my body absorb the allergy medication. Definitely go to an allergist it will help you A LOT!", "Viral Hives - Viral Hives Images - Viral Hives Treatment - Viral Hives Rash ", "What do you consider your \"allergy season\" For me (UK) it is mid-October to mid-March, starting in the mornings and evenings, by mid-November to mid-February it is pretty much a risk all day.\n\nI have just started wearing hats and thermal shirts and leggings when I am out after 6pm, as well as sleeping with an extra blanket at night to make it easier in the mornings (it is a small blanket that I can easily grab and wrap round me while I go to make breakfast).", "Will cold hives last until the end of winter? I am 21F and up until 3-4 weeks ago, I have maybe had cold hives a handful of times in my entire life. They would last 3-4 hours max and had no problems going away by themselves without antihistamines. A few weeks ago, I had a very bad breakout all over my body that lasted more than 24 hours for some unexplainable reason, which only went away after I took 180mg fexofenadine (Telfast). Since then, my cold hives keep coming back almost everyday, and I have been taking Telfast regularly to prevent the itching (which has been working very well). I started off taking them everyday and in the last week I have been doing so only when necessary (every second/third day when I will not stop getting itchy hives randomly). I live in Melbourne and it is currently Autumn so it is quite chilly (13-15 degrees Celsius on average). But again it is Melbourne so the temperature can drop/rise very suddenly, which I suspect to be one of the triggers for my hives. I guess my question is, do cold hives last until the weather gets warmer, or do they tend to go away after a while because you build a tolerance to the cold (if this even makes any sense)? I am just concerned that they will only go away when winter is over since autumn is not even finished yet where I am from. I understand that everyone is experience is different, but any help would be appreciated :) In my own personal experience, you do not really build a tolerance.  If you are cold, you get hives.  I have just learned to bundle up when it is cold outside. That sounds terrible. I have tried to keep warm when i have to go outside, but i sweat really easily and it just gets annoying.\n\nHow else do you deal with it, besides bundling up? I do not want to take antihistamines every day because i am afraid i will develop a tolerance, but that seems to be the only thing that helps. I am also trying my best not to scratch myself, which is mostly effective when i am awake. But when i am asleep and get itchy, i would subconsciously start scratching, which makes the hives spread like crazy and even itchier than before. Antihistamines are the only other thing that work for me.  I just try to minimize my time outside when it is cold, mostly.  Helps now that I work from home.  Wish I had better advice, this condition is so uncommon though there is not really much good info on it besides bundle up or take meds.  My doctor even was like, wtf are you talking about, when I first brought it up to her. Have you been to an allergist?\n\nIn addition to the cold, I sometimes get hives from exercise even when it is warm. It is just something I have always lived with. I have booked an appointment with my gp on monday for a prick test.\n\nThere is been a couple times when i was younger where i have had hives on my legs after running in the cold, but never anything this bad or long. Sometimes they are not itchy but i get bright red streaks on my skin when the temperature changes suddenly (washing my hands when the water is a bit warmer/cooler than room temperature). I have no idea why my skin is acting up all of a sudden. It is not as severe as some of the cases i have read about, but it is enough to drive me crazy sometimes. Covid restrictions in Australia are pretty much lifted and everything is back to normal now, which means i have to go to uni everyday during the week. I do notice that i tend to get hives on days i have to constantly move from one place to another. Have not had any problems at all during the weekend because i am always bundled up inside, but i dread going back to class and work tomorrow.\n\nThanks for the insight. It is definitely very comforting to know there are people i can relate to :) The time of year does not make much difference. When it is hot outside everyone blasts the AC to sub zero temps it feels like...and that is just as dangerous as the cold outside.

But the last year or two I now get blotches all over my face. No hives on the face just bright red blotches and the hives all over my hands.\n\nI have started taking an over the counter antihistamine when I think I will be going outside and for the most part it works I do not get hives and my face is not blotchy BUT I still get little red dots all over my face and hands. I assume this is the center of the blotches and hives and the antihistamine is taking away all the redness and this is what I am left with.\n\nI was wondering if anyone has had a similar experience and if stronger antihistamines might make the red dots not show up at all?\n\nExcited to hear from people who do not think I am nuts! I tested 3 different antihistamines so far (only had this for 3 months) and none of them reeeaaally did a lot. Their effect is not big enough for me to really know if they work at all.

I do not know if this would be considered that since you were out for a long period of time. I know for me and many others this can happen within a matter a seconds if we are exposed to cold weather, drinks, or foods That what I was thinking too. It seemed people got it very quickly but for me it took a while. I just do not know what else it could be. Everyone is body is different and the way my allergist explained it was that the reaction actually begins during the process of the body warming up again, not being cold.  I would make an appointment to get the ice cube test at an allergist to know for sure.  It sounds like it is CU to me. i think it is! this happens to me sometimes too, i get hives when i am cold and when i come inside i get more and they will burn and itch as i get warmer Thanks for the input! I will try the ice cube trick myself and advise my allergist, thank you I have similar to you. I am pretty sure I have CU, but my reactions more so happen after being in the cold for a long time, not quickly... Hey. I tried the ice cube trick on my arm for about 4 minutes. It is a huge bump rather than hives ( That is CU. Mine is always a huge raised bump.  I thought that was normal but in ppl without CU that does not happen. Yes the re-warming is when it happens. And your exposure time is unique to you. Everyone is different and this allergy is a spectrum. Not everyone reacts at the same temp. I can have reactions nearly any time at any temp if I am sweating and my sweat is cooling on my skin. I cannot really be outside in temps below like 73 degrees. Be careful. It can change on a dime.

Any tips on helping the symptoms? Not everyone is reaction is the same. My symptoms are mild. For the people who have severe symptoms they need the epi pens. You need to figure out what you can tolerate, temperature wise. Like someone else mentioned- symptoms wildly vary person to person. I have an epi-pen because after a few years my symptoms got worse and my mouth and tongue started to swell with food/drinks that were too cold. I have also had my face have a severe reaction looking into my own freezer at home that started an anaphylactic reaction. Generally though- it is a mild inconvenience. Grabbing anything from fridge I get hives, air conditioning on me? Hives. Windy? Hives. I find sometimes I react a lot, sometimes barely at all. No telling why it gets better or worse for me really. \n\nAs far as underlying conditions that could cause it- most people do not know.

Thank you for your reply If I eat cold things too fast my stomach will hurt really bad immediately. I can also feel it swelling up and trying to push everything back up.

I had forgotten my purse and could not get the train so I walked two hours back to my house like this. After being inside for about 5 minutes the normal itching started but it started to get much worse than it ever had before, till I looked down and saw my skin was covered in purple blotches and giant hives. I went downstairs to get my dad and caught sight of myself in the mirror, my entire lower face was dark purple and my eyes looked sunken. I sat on the couch and the itching got to the point that I was twitching and jerking from the intensity, I also felt like I just could not catch my breath, no matter how much I breathed in it just did not feel like enough. The blotching covered me all over and I was clawing at myself. This lasted just under two hours.\n\nSince it happened I have been trying to figure out what it could be, I know I did not eat anything and it seems like CU might be the answer, but I have only ever experienced itching before this and that was the first allergic reaction on that scale I have ever had. I wanted to check here to see if I should approach a doctor with this or if it might have been a one-time thing and I am over-reacting.\n\nThank you! I would definitely see a Dr, especially since you mentioned having trouble breathing. Yep sounds like CU - especially the parts about it not getting bad and itchy until you start warming up. For me, my everyday symptoms are well controlled by OTC antihistamines and being careful to keep fingers and whatnot warm when it is cold outside. Because you have had a full systemic reaction though, you should definitely see a doctor, to potentially get treatment and an epi pen to keep on you. Not the kind of thing you want to mess around with! Yes, go to a doctor and get some medicine. I take Allegra which lessens my symptoms about 60%, which is better than none! Wearing a mask in cold weather is a life saver and it reduces the swelling in my throat and lungs from cold air. We are you twitching because if the cold or the itching? I ask because I have gotten hypothermia multiple times when I have gotten really cold. For me the itching goes away when I apply heat. But I think some people are sensitive to heat. Just see a doctor. Wow. Get thee an epi pen. That is really dangerous. Do not get caught in that weather again.

I take Fexofenadine with great success, but it does not work for everyone. Depending how her CU affects her, there are meds that can help control other symptoms. For example, if her breathing is affected she could try salbutamol inhalers, or Montelukast. \n\nIf she is on social media, encourage her to connect with others that have it, or to join groups (I am thinking Facebook but there are others) so she can see other people\u2019s opinions, thoughts, successes, etc. There are lots out there! I have been with my boyfriend for two years and my symptoms started to show about 2 weeks after I moved in with him. Honestly it helps a lot for him to just listen to me and how it makes me feel. The physical part of the allergy is hard but the mental hump is even harder. He also will help me with things like taking stuff out of the fridge or other things like that.\nOne think that does drive me a little crazy is when I go to do something and he steps in to help me when I dont need it. It makes me feel like hes over protective and he knows that. Also getting some anti itch cream and benadryl from the drug store and keeping it at your house would be great for incase she has an outbreak. If you want someone to talk to about it private message me and I am sure my boyfriend would be more then happy to talk to you about his experience.

For example, if you live in an area where it snows, you might clean her car off/warm it up for her or shovel for her. If you are grocery shopping together, you could handle all the frozen food/dairy/cold items both in the store and putting them away at home so she does not have to touch them if that triggers her. Be aware of the temperature in the car when traveling (AC) and in the house when she is there. Maybe have one of those plug in electric warming blankets at your house for her if she likes those to stay warm with. And maybe have some extra allergy medicine at your house for her if she is taking it (in case she forgets). Hope this helps! :) this is super helpful, thank you so much!!", "How far into the winter/ cold weather does CU start? I started having hives since two days ago after going to eat out at night. The gives began immediately after. At first I thought it was food, but in the morning the hives went away. They return again the following evening after being outside after work. So I am thinking it is CU. So far evening after being in the cold is when symptoms come out. In the morning they disappear.

In 2018, I had my first case of CU and it was horrible, had to drink histamines, avoid cold places, etc. But miraculously it went away. It got weaker and weaker and then eventually I was back to normal. Fast forward to 2021 and I woke up with intense itching on my arms (only happens on my hands/arms). I thought I was finally free :(( anyone else who experienced this? Just started taking a daily Claritin OTC. Has reduced my symptoms probably 80%. Eating a popsicle now only causes minor lip swelling and my gums feel normal. I read somewhere it is a short term thing 8-10 years max.  I got it when I was 21..

Just a couple weeks ago I was watching my son\u2019s soccer practice on a chilly morning and developed itchy hives all over my legs and elbows.  Has happened a few times since and my PCP says it is likely CU.  Internet research says this typically strikes young people so I am wondering why on earth I started dealing with this now out of the blue?  Anyone else out there?? I was diagnosed when I was 29, and had some small episodes that I wrote off when I was 28. No clue why is just spurred on all of a sudden. I did lose about 25 pounds at 28 so maybe that? Not as much subcutaneous fat, that is my only guess. I was diagnosed in my 20s. My symptoms got quite mild after I had kids (at 28 and 31), with the odd serious reaction. Now that my kids are adults, my symptoms have worsened again. Mine started at 34. I have suffered from many allergies since I was a kid but I have no idea why I developed CU. Totally random and very annoying. Thanks for responding!  I do not have any other allergies or health issues so this just came out of the blue.  All my doctor said was to take Zyrtec, she did not really seem to have any other information at all which seemed strange to me, but maybe that is the nature of this condition. I know someone who was forty something when she developed it. I developed mine in middle school, but what triggered both of ours was that we had gotten really sick for a few weeks (unrelated, I believe she got sick after going abroad). When I got better, I suddenly developed CU. When she got better, she suddenly developed around 12 allergies, many of them really serious. So, maybe you got sick a few weeks ago? \n\nIf it is any consolation, it is been 9 years and after like 5 the CU calmed down a lot. So it may not be this bad forever. 36 here, not sure that qualifies as \"old\" ;)\n\nDeveloped it last fall after leaving the window open on a cold night. I was never diagnosed, as no doc I spoke with had ever heard of it. But I am confident I got it around 28; which was when my blood pressure was at its worse.

I live in upstate NY.  It is not terribly severe... just very itchy after being outside - even in just wind - for 10 minutes or more.  Or sitting on a cold seat outside.

It developed when I was playing soccer and started to get the hives. I have done a bit of research and what I came up with is to cut out histamine inducing foods. Basically no cheese or fermented foods. I cannot speak to the results because I cannot stick to a diet. But could be something to look into. I have had it for 27 years.

Hi everyone,\n\nI have had varying forms of this since my high school cross country days and always thought it was just a normal reaction from coming in from the cold outside. I have learned about cold uticaria today and I am trying to figure out if this is the source of my problems. \n\nToday I went on a long walk in 30 degree (F) weather and when I got back in the car, my thighs immediately started itching. I am used to this and always thought this was a normal thing people got when they started warming up. I checked on my thighs when I got back in the house and they were bright red and REALLY itchy. I was trying not to scratch but it was definitely hard. It is only on my thighs and part of my butt. It has since calmed down and no longer itchy but my legs are really hot. There do not seem to be any hives, just an overall redness. Not very patchy. \n\nI sometimes get it on my fingers and I remember one cross country practice I came in and I could not touch my fingertips to my palms and my coach told me I was allergic to the cold. I thought he was mostly joking and that it was not that big of a deal since he did not seem worried. \n\nIt is really varying however. Sometimes I can go out and come back and nothing happens. It is also always only on my thighs, fingers, or ears. No where else. \n\nIt is also never painful or burning like some others have mentioned. Just hot and itchy and red.\n\nIs this cold uticaria? Or is this just some mild reaction to temperature? Have you done the ice cube test yet? Could also be the result of something like (\n\n\u201cAs your heart rate increases so does your blood flow, which causes the capillaries and arteries in your muscles to expand. The capillaries stay open to allow for maximum blood passage when you are fit, but if you are out of shape, your capillaries tend to collapse, not allowing as much blood to pass through. When your capillaries expand, the surrounding nerves become stimulated and send messages to the brain, which reads the sensation as itching.\u201d I am not sure what that is. Is it just putting ice on my skin? Do you also get round welts/bumps over your skin? That would be then more likely a sign of cold hives. But itchy and redness perhaps the other. I have definitely had runners itch before and it does not normally come with a ton of redness. That also happens to me during a run but this redness and itchyness came after I was done walking. \n\nI guess it could still just be runners itch but I am concerned about how hot and red my skin was. No I usually do not have any bumps or welts that I notice Yeah just put an ice cube on your forearm for about a minute and then wait and see how your skin reacts. If you see any hives or swelling then there is a good chance you have it. I will try this! \nBut I might wait a little because my legs are still calming down from the walk I mentioned in the post\n\nThank you! No problem, glad I could help!

I have only gotten intense hives/swelling a few times in my life but I get rashes, redness, minor swelling more frequently. I have a question about anxiety. I just learned about CU recently and about the fact that a severe reaction can cause anaphylaxis. Ever since then I have been experiencing anxiety about being out in the cold. I just moved to a cold weather climate where it is very cold outside which I have never lived in before. I am freaking out when I am outside that I am going to have a really bad reaction, and so far I have been worried and then nothing happens. Do you have any advice on how to deal with the anxiety side of CU? Does anyone else experience this? I feel like a fraud because my case of CU is not even bad at ALL, it is really minor, but I am very emotionally sensitive and anxious. I just found out I had this recently. Well, I would say to have things that are a fail safe. Get an epi pen, carry liquid Benadryl, wear layers, have warm drinks with you...etc. Also keep in mind that CU can change on a dime and that the way you react now may not always be. Being prepared for the worst can ease the anxiety. If you can, having an epipen nearby can always offer some peace of mind. Otherwise, be patient with yourself and just start getting more exposure slowly. I lived in NJ most of my life and would skip school/work some days in winter because I was just too scared to step foot outside the house.\n\nAnd do not feel like a fraud! I think it is fair to dread any reactions, not just full blown anaphylactic shock, and wish for normalcy. It is just a draining experience all around. thank you thanks I used to take Allegra every morning so I would not get hives/would only get mild hives. Also, a scarf around your neck and a fleece neck/mouth warmer thing or a fabric mask to warm your breath helps. I recommend a scarf pulled up over your nose. However, it is not very glasses friendly.\n\nAlso, do not worry too much about it. As long as your throat does not feel tight and you are able to breath fine, all you have to worry about is some discomfort and your appearance. CU has definitely taught me not to be vain! Layers will become your best friend. **become your best friend, layers will.** \n\n*-Ehymie*\n\n***\n\n\n\n^(Commands: 'opt out', 'opt in', 'delete') thank you &lt;3\n\nironically, i think my anxiety is causing me to have a tight throat (symptom of anxiety). but it is psycho somatic. ugh. You should see an allergist. Definitely. :( oh man. im so sorry.  CU is the worst. Like others have already said, definitely see an allergist and get an epipen to have on hand! To add to that you can always keep some \u2018emergency items\u2019 on hand for peace of mind. I have a handful of those emergency survival blankets (the silver ones that fold up super small) and always keep one in my purse and a couple in my car a long with an extra pair of sweats, warm socks, and hoodie etc. Knowing I am prepared and have my extra allergy pills, extra warm gear, and my epipen helps me feel not nearly as anxious! The anxiety is definitely hard and sometimes the fear is worse then the allergy. Get an EpiPen it will help. thank you, that is very helpful to know. Yes this makes alot of sense. thank you so much for the advice!!! it helps to know im not alone. yes, totally. I cannot wait to get my hands on one. If you ever need someone to rant to about the anxiety im always willing to listen Thank you sooo much I appreciate that &lt;3 Hello there, just answering from the other side of that matter. I first learned that I had CU **because** of an anaphylactic shock.   \nNow, first of all, I want to say that you should always have an epi pen with you and warm clothes. But I want to also tell you that I had a shock, without epi pen, without knowing why I had it, and I survived. I am ok. Do not be scared over the idea. Knowledge is power. And in that specific thing it is knowledge is the only that matters, it is ENOUGH, you can prevent it. :)  \nps. I have had CU for 10 years now, some years worse than the others, but it is just normal anymore I got to know it and I am not afraid of it. thank you for sharing. im so sorry you went through that experience of anaphylaxis. it is ok, thank you for sharing what is on your mind :) oh!

It started last winter and subsided this summer. I was hopeful that it would not come back, but now that the weather is turning I am starting to see the same flat red hives appear on my lower and upper eyelids after about 5 mins of exposure. I am wondering if anyone else experiences this and if they know of any treatments besides antihistamine that might help? \nThanks! The only thing I can think is going on is that your tears are increasing the intensity of the cold. When it happens are you tearing up, even a little? Like you know (or might not depending on how long you have had CU) how when the wind blows and hits your eyes, it causes them to water. Cold water is worse than cold air against the skin, so maybe it is that intensifying the cold contact. No idea what to do about that if so, other than to wear glasses/goggles that would keep the wind fully out of your eyes? Those glacier glasses that have the leather side shields, not exactly current fashion, but might help. Just a guess though.", "Allergic to the cold in Boston Hello! So I recently was diagnosed with Cold\u00a0urticaria and I live in Boston. (Last year we had a low of -22\u00b0F) I was wondering if people had any advice on how to deal with it as the winter get colder? \n\nThe first time I noticed symptoms I had just gotten an ice coffee from Dunkins and was taking the train home. My hand ended up swelling and it was hard to bend my fingers and my legs were ichy from standing out in the cold. I had a few other things happen but the most notable is when I was at work, luckily I work at a doctor's office, I was holding a cold soda and broke out into hives on my arm. One of the nurses said it might have been the cold so they made me an appointment and lord behold I am allergic to the fucking cold. Hey, I live in Fargo, ND and it gets down to -40 here so I understand your concerns. Last winter was my first year with Cold Urticaria. I make sure to always bundle up before going outside. I warm up my car before I leave for work. I keep a backpack with me to store my hats and gloves. I ended up getting a neoprene steering wheel cover because I did not like driving with super thick gloves, but the steering wheel was still too cold with thin gloves. I lived in Mass for 13 years (and was living in Boston when I was diagnosed)  before moving back to Minnesota where I grew up so I absolutely relate. The biggest thing that helps me is knowing what is likely to trigger a reaction. \n\nGoing out in 25 degree cold is usually ok for me but going from the cold to sweating at the gym and then back again is really bad so I know make sure I take a Zyrtec first. Layers are always helpful but if an antihistamine works for you then you should treat winter as your allergy season and take one regularly. And maybe invest in one of those reusable iced coffee sleeves from Dunks if you are a habitual iced coffee drinker! Thank you! This is really helpful. I have not had it for very long because it just started happening recently so I am still not 100% sure about what causes me to react so I will definitely keep a look out. I live in ohio, gets pretty cold here. My hands are a real big issue, so I bought a rechargeable hand warmer and it is quite amazing. Doesnt solve it, but helps. I was diagnosed 5 years ago and I live in upstate NY where we see temps about as cold as where you are. Everyone seems to be different in terms of what they can tolerate. For me, I can do okay in the cold as long as I am bundled up well with lots of layers but if I get wet at all (sweat, rain, wet snow etc). then I get much worse much faster. My hands are a big issue for me, too, so I try to wear gloves as much as possible and limit holding cold things to very short periods of time but yes, as someone said below, get a coffee koozy! :) I also like having those chemical hand warmers handy just in case. Taking antihistamines does help me a little. I still break out but it is not itchy. My allergist told me to take Xyzal. It makes me sleepy so I take it at night and I usually only take it during the winter as needed. Hope winter goes quickly for all of us! Thank you! Thank you! I have some reusable ones that I can boil to reset so I will start keeping those on me all the time I found this rechargeable one on amazon that doubles as a charger, pretty nice. It was relatively cheap if I remember correctly. Sorry to hear that, welcome to the not so fun club. When I lived in a place that had a cold winter, I took Zyrtec every day as a preventative because my CU attacks were so painful. Having that constant baseline of antihistamine in my system worked for me. Good luck getting used to this. :/ Thank you.

I have heard the benefits of taking cold showers and have been really wanting to start incorporating it into my routine but I am worried with my allergy to the cold if it would be life threatening to chance it. my doctor told me never to jump into a pool of cold water because that could possibly put me into anaphylactic shock. she said to just ease into it slowly, which i think you could do with cold showers. maybe put the water pressure on low and do not stand under it immediately and if you feel ok and the hives are not coming all at once you could proceed. It depends on the severity of your reactions. Consult with your allergist before trying anything. \n\nAlso as a side note, as a medical professional who operates in the sports performance realm, the benefits of cryotherapy are massively overstated. Per the research there is not much benefit to cold showers or ice baths. And stuff like Wim Hoffs method is purely anecdotal and has not had any lab testing with randomized control trials (to my knowledge). In my opinion most benefits of cold therapy are placebo in nature. \n\nContrast baths have some validity and a decent theory behind it. It is actually sauna and thermotherapy that is more well supported in the research. I would really be careful. It is going to depend on the severity of your allergy and reactions. I would quite literally die if I did that. No lol I mean it might not kill you but it is probably a bad practice Talk to your allergist about your situation to be honest.

Just let the nurse know about it before hand", "Questions about CU 21/f Basically i have not been officially diagnosed, i have been to a few doctors and some say something in the water and others say sensitive to cold. but i had one reaction in the ocean that gave me hives. could have been from the water, something in the water or the temperature of water. but i am wondering, if i do have it, how do i live a normal life? i have been terrified to be around an AC even tho i have not had a reaction from one yet, i am terrified when i get out of the shower &amp; im scared to eat or drink anything ice cold. i can drink cold water and drinks so far and have been fine. i live in canada so winters are brutal. i am scared. this is the worst thing i have ever had to deal with &amp; im a big anxious mess. I have learned over the years just to bundle up very well, covering the majority of exposed skin whenever I go out and it is chilly.  Not much you can do about breakouts from swimming, if people ask I just explain it to them.  You can still lead a normal life just with some small alterations.  Try some antihistamines like Benadryl or whatnot as well, it helps some people. How long have you shown symptoms? I ask, because if you have had it 6 weeks or less there is a really good chance that it will go away on its own. I had CU several years ago and could not do much but it went away and has not returned. For most people, it is not a life sentence. \n\nAlso, did any of your docs recommend you try taking H1 and H2 blockers together, like Claritan and Zantac? I am talking over-the-counter doses only. I ask, because they work wonders together and unfortunately, many docs are not as informed about CU and the research on treatment.", "Does this look like a positive ice cube test for cold Urticaria? I cannot really tell  It looks very similar to mine, and the doc had 3 nurses and an ARNP come in to see what a positive test looked like. With no medical background, i would call it positive.", "Cold Urticaria Post-COVID? This is a forum that I did not expect to find myself in this morning.\n\nI was released from quarantine today as it is been over 10 days since my positive COVID test. I was totally asymptomatic and my test was a huge surprise. I went out with my husband for a walk to celebrate and it was quite cold--I was bundled up on top but only had leggings on bottom. The walk itself was normal when we came back in, I noticed that my calves were incredibly itchy. I took off my leggings to find that both my legs were bright red and it looked like very small welts were beginning to form. I googled \"cold allergies,\" took some Benadryl, crawled under tons of blankets to get warm and here I am now... my skin looks totally normal now and the itchiness disappeared almost immediately after the benadryl blankets combo.\n\nI have not found anything about folks developing CU post-COVID, but I have seen that it can be found post-viral and it makes sense with everything I have heard about COVID, circulation, immune responses, and the overall weirdness of the disease itself. I am going to do the icecube test tomorrow when the benadryl is out of my system. I have to say the welts themselves were not immediately evident, but the itchiness was noticeable and debilitating.... I go back to work on Monday and am terrified it will happen again just walking in the building from my car... I have also been very curious about this. Another person posted on here several weeks ago and said they declined CU after COVID. I am not sure if I ever had COVID or not, but I developed CU in May. \n\nI take Allegra everyday and it keeps the itching at bay. I still get hives when I get cold, but they do not itch very much at all. I have never had any kind of skin allergies or sensitivities.  I was positive for Covid a couple of weeks ago... 1.5 weeks after, I noticed hives all over my arms after giving my kids a bath. The bottoms of my sleeves got wet and I rolled them up.  Everywhere that got wet (and cold) I got hives.  A few days later I was reading up on it and did the ice cube test... 30 seconds of ice cube on my arm, I got itchy hives there about 5 minutes later.\n\nMy face gets hives just walking out to the car and I dont live in a very cold area.\n\nAt the same time, I also developed Raynaud's phenomenon which is a totally different thing than the cold urticaria! I developed CU years back after a very bad respiratory virus (did not have a specific diagnosis but it was like walking pneumonia  ), so this is really interesting to me . It faded after serval years of severe outbreaks. A doctor told me if I took both an h1 and h2 antihistamine before exposure  (like Zyrtec and Zantac ) at the same it would be best, and that helped a lot. Best of luck. I developed CU in 2019 after fighting a virus that lasted several days with a high fever. I have read lots of stories about it developing after a virus/illness so unfortunately I think it is possible. I am 35 yrs old and have had Cold-Induced Urticaria since I was 8 years old. It is a very rare autoimmune disorder. Nobody could tell me what it was until I was 24 years old. I take a Xyzal and Zertec every day. What I find helps me is not eating foods that are high in histamine and also histamine blocking foods. It also helps with bloating. If anyone is wanting to know more I am happy to help.. I have lived with this all of my life and have learned a lot about it. I am from Michigan and had to move to Arizona. I got cold urticaria symptoms in February last year after a temperature, cough, and generally feeling like shit. At the time I did not think Covid had really reached the UK, but now I am less sure. \n\nI spend a fortune on merino wool baselayers so I would be able to keep jogging, only for my schedule to be ruined by lockdown without childcare, so I never ran anyway. \n\nI have starting getting out in the cold again and it seems my cold urticaria has gone. Yes, this is possible. I developed awful allergies that I am still trying to figure out but I went from mostly mild seasonal allergies to being allergic to literally everything (plants, animals, environmental things like mold/dust/etc), anything other than cotton clothes, and temperature changes. I have never tested positive for covid but it is possible I was asymptomatic at some point (getting a blood test soon) but when I asked my allergist he said he is seen this happen to people post covid but that it could also be triggered by the immune system when it experiences ANY virus. I got Covid roughly 6 weeks ago, about 2 weeks into it after mostly recovering, the Cold Urticaria started in a major way (instant red bumps anywhere\u00a0on the body it was cold, especially wet). COVID likely triggered it as I have never had allergies in my life.\n\nIt dissipated for about about 2 weeks, but this past week it is started up again but really lightly--skin only turns slightly red when it is really cold. I am about 4 weeks from when the urticaria started, and it is not considered \"chronic\" until past 6 weeks so here is hoping I am just on a slow path to recovery + I am sure the current NYC freezing temp is not helping.\n\nInteresting case doc: (\n\nHope everyone else on this thread is recovering ok! Same thing happened to me post covid (I had mild symptoms; body aches, no sense of smell, low grade fever. no respiratory issues). I had to go to the ER with anaphylaxis (urticaria, angioedema, tachicardia) and became allergic to a lot of things even after the hives went down. It mostly went away afer 6 months, but that was one hell of an allergy season. I started to develop CU when I had covid last february so it has to be that. I had no such reaction UNTIL i got covid :/ Thanks for commenting! I am wondering if that is the case for me as well :( I hope yours will go away! It really sucks but I hope we get better cuz i live in canada and the winters there are not it", "Does this look like cold urticaria? ", "do I really have CU? I have never been actually diagnosed with CU and I think my symptoms are not as bad as most people on this subreddit. My whole life, anytime I would go out at night for a walk/anytime its chilly, my legs (and some other parts but mostly legs) would get torturously crazy itchy. But actually getting hives is really rare for me. Am I mistaking this for something else or do I just have a really mild case? Maybe I should just ask a doctor lol. Best to go to a doctor, even though the doctors usually will only subscribe antihistamine, because there is not really a cure, just management- but you can ask for a blood test that can check for any specific causes or just a routine blood test that tests for lack of vitamins, hormones etc. that may also be an issue. If it is bothering you it is not in your imagination! I am usually affected on my face and hands were exposed. My face gets hives but my hands become red and itchy. Just go to a doctor if you really want to get diagnosed. They will do some tests on your skin like scraping a bit and maybe also putting on something cold to see what type you have (my skin is irritated by both cold and touch). But if it does not bother you much, why bother getting diagnosed? If you need medications I would say go get diagnosed. I am in the same boat. I only get hives when I touch something frozen, but if I go for a walk in 40 degree weather my skin with turn red and swell and itch like crazy and I will have a lot of trouble breathing. I have been diagnosed. Sounds like how mine started. Definitely see an immunologist. They do an ice use test. \n\nAlso take any pics I have the diagnosis for urticaria and still experience those symptoms. As soon as I wear warm pants I am fine. I know other comments have the thing about not bothering to be diagnosed but if there was an emergent issue where you were sent to hospital you would rather have that on your file than having cold fluids be put through your body.", "Possible CU or another allergy? Not looking for a diagnosis I am currently waiting for an allergist appointment but I was wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences. \n\nAround two weeks ago I went out with a bit of ankle exposed, it was pretty cold maybe -12C with wind and pretty damp with snow. Maybe 10 minutes after getting inside my ankles were bright red which is normal but swelled up which has never happened in like one large hive. After this I looked up CU and tested my skin with ice cubes, ice packs and no reaction. I can drink cold things and I am fine and I thought nothing of it. \n\nWell yesterday I was out again, much less cold but still windy and damp. My eyelashes were wet from my hot breath from my mask but this is not unusual since it happens almost every time I wear my mask. Anyways again ten minutes after I get inside my eyes are extremely itchy red and hot and it progressed to swelling and patches on my face and a bit of throat itchyness that I took a Benadryl and was fine. Called my doctor and got an epipen just in case and am trying to get to an allergist ASAP. \n\nI just find it weird because it is not a constant thing, I have went out in between these events and had no reaction, even my hands were exposed and they had no itchyness or swelling. \n\nAlso, I have had a full body reaction but it was in the summer, hives all over etc which leads me to believe it may be an environmental factor idk I have intense anxiety surrounding a potential future reaction Seems unlikely from my experience. Start keeping a diary of every detail for your allergist prior to the visit so they can help rule things out Thank you! I am trying to do that it is just so hard since the reactions seem so random and delayed from anything I can think of that would trigger it Potentially moisture?  I know people get similar breakouts from sweat. Hopefully you get into the allergist! I hope, whatever the outcome, it is something you can live with and that it is the least annoying of all that are possible. \n\nI wish you freedom from suffering and all the joys possible.", "I think I may have Cold Urticaria Hey guys,\n\nJust found out what this allergy was and I think I may have it. I have always noticed hives around my body and bumps on my knuckles that really hurt during the winter, but did not know where they came from. I am also super sensitive to the cold, like going into the pool in the summer would make my body feel weird. It got worse this November, I had come home from standing out side in the cold for 2 hours to vote. I wanted to get warm and so turned on the heat in my bedroom and got under the covers. Within 10 minutes, my whole leg was itching, red, enflamed, and COVERED in hives. I had always had this and thought it was just dry skin. But this time, it was completely different, I mean, my entire leg was covered in hives. I almost started bleeding from scratching so much. I had to distract myself to not scratch. Now every time I go out in the cold, I notice the hives and they are getting worse than from before. So what do you guys think? Where exactly does this come from? Do I have to move out of cold climates? Yeah certainly sounds like it.  I went to an allergist to get \"officially\" diagnosed.  I mostly just wanted to say that I moved to Maine after my diagnosis and make do.  You do not have to move, it is about your comfort and ability to manage it.  I take claritin daily in the winter and it helps. Sounds like it could definitely be CU. Maybe try administering a ice cube test on yourself, hold an ice cube against your forearm (maybe leg in this case) for five minutes and see the reaction.\nI do not think you have to move out of cold climates unless it becomes more severe, but it would be more convenient to live in warmer places.\nGood luck! Thank you! I will try this!! Thank you! And that is good, I wanted to possibly go to school in Hokkaido, Japan and it gets as cold as -4 degrees in some areas, so I was worried. I will probably have a plant by then. I did the ice cube test. Broke into hives at the spot. CU screws you over no matter where you are. Its your skin chilling from outside cold, even sweating does it.  \n\nDo not ask people on reddit for medical advice though. That is not being smart.  Call your general doctor or go to a walk in clinic (wear a mask properly and keep a good social distance) tell them  what you said here and ask to be referred to an allergy specialist, does not hurt to ask for one that specializes or at least deals with other CU patients. \n\nDo not take any allergy meds. (BTW benadryl studies have proven that it leads to dementia later in life 5 doctors told me the same thing and said not to take them anymore)\n\nThe test for CU is putting an ice cube or an ice pack on your bare skin for 5 minutes to see if you get a reaction or not.  \n\nMine swelled.in under 2 mins so mines not sever but its not super mild either , I got a prescription for an epi pen (expensive little bugger if you do not have health coverage) that day.      \n\n\nI break out all year round from exercise, cool wind etc. I live in alberta Canada.  It gets pretty cold. I take up to 4 rupal a day , sometimes 1 is enough, sometimes its not.  \n\nYou will learn where your hiving point is (temp wise.  Mines anything below 22 degrees Celsius) and learn to be preemptive.  Opening a window when its 15 degrees out and maybe has a light breeze (right by my desk top computer) I have to wear mittens, 2 sweaters, a toque, socks ,sometimes  winter boots, a full face mask, scarf and my fave thing a HEATED THROW.   dead serious.  CU fudging sucks.\n\nBut a doctor will tell you, not to get your medical advice from random internet people.    Go see a doctor. Because if you have CU, your eventually going to need prescription antihistamines.. try Rupall.  I take it, helps a lot during a full break out.. 20 mins and everything starts to slowly go away.\n\nAnd ya CU can be so itchy you want to peel your skin off.   And once you have it you have it..for life.  AC can give you hives if you have CU.   It like diabetes, or any other other serious allergy.. you will have to make some serious lifestyle changes to help protect and prevent break outs.  \n\nGood luck. /u/pigcozie, I have found an error in your comment:\n\n &gt; \u201c~~Its~~  your skin\u201d\n\nIt might be better if pigcozie had used \u201c~~Its~~  your skin\u201d instead. \u2018Its\u2019 is possessive; \u2018it is\u2019 means \u2018it is\u2019 or \u2018it has\u2019.\n\n ^(This is an automated bot.

What were your  findings?", "Vitamin D is HELPING! Wanted to update everyone here with something that has reduced my cold hives considerably.  I am taking 2000 UI of Vitamin D3, daily.  Hives are almost gone.  I am going to try 3000 UI and see if they completely go away. May i ask you if this was suggested by your doctor as a form of treatment? Nope.  I simply read a clinical study done on hives and Vitamin D deficiency.  Also noticed that there were comments on a web page (article about vitamin D and hives) and a lot of people were commenting on the positive effect vitamin D had on their hives .. Please be careful, excess vitamin D in your body can actually be very toxic I verified that up to 4000 UI daily is safe.  In fact, up to 10,000 UI daily for many months has NOT shown to be toxic.  \n\nYes, higher than that has shown to be toxic. But have you checked your previous level of vitamin D? What type of brand do you take? Nope.  I will let my body tell me if something is wrong via any weird symptoms that I notice.\n\nRight now my body is having much less hives than with no VitaminD supplement.  Think about it.  If your body gets better because of an added vitamin, that shows that it is ok (assuming no other symptoms) .. Costco brand .. Vitamin D3. I had to take 50,000 UI once a week for 8 weeks to get my vitamin D up. So it is definitely more of a long term build up of vitamin D. I never got my levels checked after this and I think I am low again, hopefully I can take more and it will help. Definitely talk to a doctor though for long term use, even just to mention it. so. as a VitD non-professional expert (long story why), I would not rely upon your body to tell you. If you can, just get a simple D level check via blood draw. It will allow you to know for certain for one, and it will prevent you from harming yourself. Then about 3-4 months after increasing your will need to test again. You are right though 4k is nothing. I am on 10kpd and barely keep my levels up. VitD toxicity is a dumb thing to die or get very sick from since it can be avoided. Just some non-clinical, but experiential advice. And side note, this is something we have been investigating with my daughter for her CU. This is worth a try. Thanks.  I may do that.  Right now the maximum I am taking is 3000 UI daily. And I only will take it for a few months.  I am lucky that with warm weather (May to October) I do not need it.\n\nI will check my levels soon. to give perspective, the test my Dr uses is normal 50-70ng/ml. We aim between 60-70. When I first had my test done, I pulled an 8... I was sick all the time. Now, rare to get sick. \n\nNow the reason I mention this is, I drove a convertible, in the phoenix area, with the roof down ALWAYS. And I still pulled an 8. sun constantly, but no D. I suck at making D. 10kpd makes sense for me. My mom only takes 800 I think, and she is around 60ng/ml. Figure the more info you have the better. And good luck with the D, hope it helps. Just remember, it takes months, to build your level up. not something you can take today and boost it today. Convertible and not much D ... I did not know that happens.  Thanks for the info.", "Frustrated with on going breakout I had suffered since I was a teenager. Never found a right way to handle it but I finally had about 2 years of free CU up until my most recent flu shot. I do not think it is the flu shot since last year, I was fine with it. But I think it is the recent going back to work stress, cold weather, weakened immune system from flu shot, etc., all together acted out badly and had a huge breakout. And ever since then, I have been having hives non stop every single day. I take 10mg zrytec everyday now and it does not help really. They go away eventually but always new ones come up. I once read someone is post about once it flares up, it is hard to control and I believe that is the case. I want to try new things or add another regime but not so sure what to add..  \nI also have an upcoming trip in December and kind of feeling dreadful about this hives situation. I just wanted to vent :\u2019(  Everybody, hang in there Ugh, I am so sorry you are going through this. I get some relief by totally and completely cutting out all foods that are high in histamines. I practice a low histamine diet. \n\nThis is the site I use:  Thanks for this! I should incorporate this into my diet. I generally eat healthy but definitely not a low histamine diet. Oh boy, lots of food that I like is to be avoided Lol Talk to your Doctor about increasing your antihistamine. I take a combo of Claritin and Pepcid. I started reacting the this summer after I moved across the country, just after getting the Covid shot. Really curious if that is what is triggered it for me, although I do not regret getting it.  I take Claritin as needed so I do not have any advice, but I have been getting almost daily reactions with the changing weather. Do you ever feel like stress or something else causes hives but it is related to the outbreaks from the cold? I have started getting them just sitting in my house, when it is not particularly cold. It is pretty rough, I hope things get better for you soon!! Oh yeah. I think stress is the big factor. Also for me, it is not always just the cold weather. I once got during summer vaca. I believe it is the season change, stress, and prob some other factors. I went to few allergists but they all just said it is not life threatening and cannot really do much about it other than me moving to a warmer climate and also taking zrytec. I just wonder how I was able to not get any for about 2 years. Warmer climates are not that helpful when you rely on air-conditioning. I moved from the northeast to Utah, and could not use air conditioning in my car because I kept breaking out on the way to work. It is how I figured out i got this allergy. I am sorry the allergists were not helpful to you. Yeah it is really strange how some people can have a break for a while.

My son has CU, eczema, dermatographia and very sensitive skin.  His dermatologist told us to not wash his skin unless it was visibly dirty (basically wash the underarms and \"bits\" frequently, but face, arms, legs, torso do not get washed with any kind of cleanser unless they are visibly dirty, otherwise just plain old water if for cleansing. We were told even water strips the protective barriers on his skin.)  If he does wash frequently because he gets dirty several days in a row, his skin does start to rash up more.  It is not the same as his CU break outs though, it is more like an eczema flare that gets worse with each wash and gets badly inflamed right after washing, so we have to put his eczema lotions on immediately after he washes - literally, he applies the lotion as soon as he steps out of the shower otherwise we know to expect a big red rashy flare up.

Balaclavas work great. I have loved having to wear masks this year, made a huge difference with keeping my face warmer and reducing the hives. What kind of wetsuit did you get?

O'neil full suit - I believe 2mm. I did not care about design or aesthetic so was able to get one relatively cheap on sale. I have been contemplating this. I got a base layer but it is so thin I do not think it does anything. What material/style do you get? I just have Hanes brand, nothing crazy.

They are so nice to have when my hands start getting hives in the winter. The fastest treatment Ive found when I get a reaction is Benadryl cream. My CU seems to be triggered mostly by changes in temp, ex wind, going from cold outside to warm inside or vice versa, so i try to lessen the effects by introducing myself slowly into different temperatures.

I take the basic brand of allerga. 180 mg twice a day I did it when I saw the allergist a few years ago, was 25 at the time. It is really not bad. i had a ziplock bag with an ice cube in it and had to hold it in place for 5 to 10 minutes. I felt like it was a waste of time for me because I already knew that I was reacting to the cold. \n\nAll they need to confirm is a reaction, so if it gets too bad from him I am sure you can take it off earlier :) Aw thank you everyone, you have put my mind at ease \u263a\ufe0f I was crying pretty hard when did it as a kid I was 5 YOA at the time. It is really painful but it all depends on the severity. But mine was borderline anaphylactic 80% of the time. I would say a stuffed animal or something for them to have is the best. I remember getting monsters inc stickers when I was there. Made the biggest difference because I had a sticker book lol. Also as a kid it would hurt to sit on a desk chair or a hardfloor because it was too cold and it would burn so badly so a small pillow for them would help with quality of life. :) good luck with it all and hope that the urticaria fades away soon!", "Did your CU ever went away forever? (kind of scared lol) Hi, I am 17F and I was diagnosed with CU a couple months ago. I was wondering if any of you guys had your CU gone forever because my allergist said it should go away within a couple of months or at least within five years. I am really worried considering that I live in Toronto which can get so freaking cold in the winter.\n\nAlso my CU is kind of weird because I got hives one time 4 or 5 years ago and then I never got it again. Fast forward to 2020 and I got chicken pox and then 2021 I got covid and that is when I started getting hives more frequently. I later went to my allergist and I got diagnosed with CU :/ (i take rupall but I have not seen anyone say anything about it in the other posts) mine said i could grow out of it, but so far i have not. i first had it happen when i was 12 or 13 and now i am 20\n\nedit: by \u201cmine\u201d i meant my ENT doctor :) omg no :((( I hate this allergy so much like reading these posts, people have said they still have it after so many years Same. I think mine will continue to fade away. I do not get hives everyday anymore, it takes a lot more cold for a lot longer now. It no longer impacts my daily life, so there is hope! I am 18M, so far it has lasted 5 months. I pray every day it goes away. It is not as bad as it was when I first had a reaction but then again, it is getting warmer. Stay strong, I know how much it can affect our emotional state. Got mine when I was 18 or 19 i think. Went away after 5 months give or take then this year (now 22) i got hives for just one night and it went away. So irdk 20f mine started sometime in 8th or 9th grade and has not let up since so do not be disappointed if it does not go away. yeah me too, my hives do not really come as often now that summer is approaching. I do not get hives immediately when I touch something cold or my room has the ac on full blast. yeah me too, mine are pretty mild and not too serious but it sucks to not be able to do stuff  in the summer like swimming. I really hope it goes away one day. yeah that is what happened to me a couple yrs ago except I was not diagnosed with CU at the time and then it came back this year out of nowhere I got CU @ 36. That is around the same time my son was born. The stress of taking care of him probably got to me. But now @ 40 I am more into the routine of taking care of kids. My CU seems to have gotten better. A breezy day does not affect me any more. but strangely enough my wife now have CU. A windy day will cause her to break out in hives. From what my allergist has told me, sometimes CU can be caused by viral infections, so the CU can clear up as soon as the infection goes or soon afterwards.  It all depends on what is causing it in the first place, really. Everyone is different, unfortunately 16 years after being diagnosed I still have it. I got mine from being too cold for too long in basic training, I can remember the day, my bones hurt.  It took a couple years to fully develop. That was 25 years ago.  I have learned to wear an extra layer of clothing and cover my hands and neck to help.  I have taken zyrtec and Allegra over the years.  They do reduce the outbreak about 80%.  I live in Washington state. If it is cold, I still itch.\n\nI would buckle up for the long haul.  If it goes away for you, you are lucky. If it is not serious, I do recommend slowly taking cold showers. Slowly ease into cold water every time. It feels amazing and increases your cold threshold. Yes!! I have been doing that for the last couple of days and so far I have not gotten any hives from it but I try not to stay too long in it just to be careful. Have your reactions gotten any better just from doing that? Yeah I am going to have to be extra careful when winter comes especially when I start commuting to uni which is going to be hell. I am taking rupall at the moment but I only take it whenever I get a reaction. I have seen alot of people mention zyrtec in the the other reddit posts which probably helps the most considering how common it is. However, I do not know if anyone's tried rupall and had gotten better results. oh whattt :(( That is so wierd, this whole allergy makes zero sense!! OMG THIS MAKES SO MUCH SENSE literally I was completely fine but then I got  covid and the moment I got it around the winter time, I started to get hives much more frequently. I found a reddit where someone talked about cu post covid because that was the only viral infection I had this year.\n\nhere is the link to the reddit:\n\n I still get reactions in the cold but it allowed me to get used to much colder temperatures. So lets say if you went swimming like in a pool, would you still get a reaction after getting used to cold showers? lmao I swear that was one of the things I was looking forward to this summer and then CU happened. Recently I did go swimming in a pool but not for a long time. Depending on the temperature of the pool, if it is fairly warm I will not get a reaction, but if it is freezing cold then yes 20 years... And all i can say i still cant swim but i can drink cold drinks anyways", "I think I might have cold urticaria?  Those are hives. What caused them? Ice cube test. Welcome to the club...the club no one wants to be in. Sorry you are one of us now. The hives on my hand came from walking to work thinking I didnt need a jacket my arms got really cold then really itchy I thought they came just because I scratched at it but a few days later my fingers were swollen from the cold and I didnt even scratch them then as you can see I tried the ice cube test. I am just happy I figured out why it was happening. Hi just happy I figured out why it was happening, I am Dad! :) True, it is nice to have an answer. Never swim alone. If you swim take an antihistamine before and bring a change of clothes to quickly change into.\nMany reactions will happen when you are warming back up. \nI do not let it stop me from snowboarding. I just take meds, put hand warmers in my boots and gloves. Wear lots of layers and take one shot of Vodka. It warms me up! \ud83e\udde4\ud83c\udf78\ud83d\udd25 That is how it starts... Lol Welcome brother Welcome to the family! did your ice cube test cause itching? Only for a few minutes then it was calm", "Cold Weather Hiking So the last three days I have done some winter hiking (20-40\u00b0F) weather. I know probably not the best thing for someone who has pretty significant CU. I did layer a ton and was not to cold but my hips/legs did break out quite a bit. I had on two pairs of leggings that were pretty tight and rubbed against my broken out skin and I now have a painful rash around the waistband area and on my bum where I sat on a cold rock for a bit. I think it might be from friction on top of hivey skin but I am not sure. Has anyone else experienced this?", "I might of got cold urticaria from getting a cold/getting sick I do not know if anyone here can relate but I am a 24 year old male I never had CU once in my life at all and now if I get cold I get hives it is that simple. \n\nBut it all started with a burning in my throat that was thought to be acid reflux from getting sick with a normal cold and my throat hurt while I was sick, I was sick for 5 days did not take anything while sick at all I wanted to heal naturally. I felt better in 5 days but the pain in my throat did not go away. It was within a few months of that winter came and that is when I started to have breakouts and even trouble breathing if I had to stay outside for a long time. \n\nI took antibiotics a few months ago for 5 days when I was suppose to take it for 3 weeks to see if it could get rid of this but the side effects were too bad so I stopped but the pain in my throat went away after 2 days of the antibiotics and I had that for over a year after getting sick but I think I needed to take it longer to get rid of the CU if that would work.\n\nI wonder if CU can be caused by getting sick from a bacteria making your immune system overreact.\n\nMy mom has it too and she is 50 but she never had symptoms till within the same year of me having it which is weirdly coincidental. \n\n\n here is the article saying antibiotics helped some people with Cu", "Gluten possible cooperate in CU issue Hi! After cutting gluten from my diet over past 2-3 weeks the effects CU have decreases dramatically. I believe there is something going on with wheat processing all over the country. There is a chance the wheat is damaging your stomach lining which is causing bad gut health and in return creating deficiencies and autoimmune issues. I would suggest cutting gluten to see how it effects you also take a daily probiotic to try &amp; repair gut health. Wow that is really interesting! What were your symptoms before vs now? Is diet the only change you have implemented during the period you noticed this? Face, hands, and feet would get really cold and I would suffer these extremely nasty hives on my hands &amp; inner forearms which would burn, itch &amp; tingle. Also My feet swell along with coughing if I drink a cold liquid. I would also deal with a brain fog and get really tired. ( I have been gluten free since before my symptoms started. I think dairy is the thing that is hurting my tummy. I quit dairy just a couple of weeks ago and I am less pain, much less bloating, and more normal, uh, bathroom visits. No difference in CU yet but I am hoping as I continue to heal my stomach it will get better. Now I can actually jump rite in my car in 20 degree weather drive with cold steering wheel and have no effects. It is literally been the only thing that is helped was stopping gluten intake. Not at all am I saying this will work for everyone else but definitely work for me Damn that is nuts! I will have to see if mine is diet related too. I started breaking out at 29 and am 32 now and it is still happening. Hoping it goes away but will definitely experiment with this (no blaming you if it does not work though lol)", "\u201cGrowing out of\u201d cold urticaria Hello everyone,\n\nI found I had cold urticaria when I was about 8 and it got progressively worse in my early teens. However, it all kind of started to fade when i was about 17. I am 21 now and I still get red and a little swollen in the cold but never break out and have trouble breathing anymore. Has anyone else experienced a decrease in symptoms with age? No. I have had it since I was 5 with no improvement of symptoms. Sometimes it gets better or worse though depending on how often it gets triggered Have you lost/gained weight or moved to a new climate? I have not moved I have been in the South East for my whole life. As for my weight, I am an avid cyclist so I will fluctuate from being skinny to being overly skinny from race season to race season. Only extreme conditions cause me to have full blown hives, and chilly conditions just give me a slight red rash like when my office is too cold. When I was first having symptoms all I had to do was look at an ice cube to break out lol. Even more recently I have noticed that if I gradually cool myself down I will not have a reaction or at the most a very mold one. I had it quite bad when I was in my late 20s and then it subsided for quite some time. I had almost no symptoms except in extreme situations. It has now just come back with a vengeance (I am in my late 40s). I have no idea what has triggered the recurrence. Late to answer this, but my brother grew out of it completely. Mom told me he would go outside when he was 4 or 5 and his hands would swell so much it would look like he had mittens on for a couple of hours. By the time he was 10 or so it had nearly completely went away.\n\nI grew into it. I got progressively worse until I was 20 or 21 when I started getting breathing problems and my face would start swelling when I went out in the winter. I moved across country to the coast, where it is more stable temperature wise, and my reactions have lessened after a couple of years. I still get breathing problems, mostly coughing and wheezing in the cold, but no where near where it was. \n\nMy allergist told me it was probably due to exposure. When you are exposed to something more frequently, it can cause the reaction to become worse. Which is also why my reactions have not been so bad since I do not have to deal with freezing temperatures much anymore.", "My family wont believe me So this is my second post on here and this is about my family not believing me. My mother laughed at me the first time I told her. She said it was just something I got off of Google when I was calling her from my doctors office. I had to do the ice test a second time in front of her for her to believe me. My grandmother on the other hand does not feel the ice test is proof enough and is trying to find the true cause of my allergy. Shes accused strawberries, mold, and then straight up said I was being dramatic about it. When I told her they do not know why I have it and there isnt a reason she told me to find the reason for it. I just really need help dealing with my family. The process of learning to live with CU has been hard for me and my family's negativity does not help at all. I went to the Dr. recently with bursitis in my knee.  They told me to put ice on it, and when I told them I could not or I would break out into hives,  the doctor laughed at me... And I was like... No,  seriously.  I asked if heat would help,  but he said,  no,  ice is best.  I am just like,  WTF do I do?! I am so sorry you are dealing with this. Most people I have told have never heard of CU and I have been asked if I am making it up or joking. Has your mother or grandmother seen your hives/rash when you are outside and cold (e.g. not from the ice cube)? Do you think it would help if you print out and show them some stuff from reputable websites online that explain the condition? It is hard to know how to get them to be supportive but I guess I would just try to talk to them and explain exactly how you are feeling by their lack of support. My hope is that with a little education and hearing how their actions are affecting you, they will become more supportive. \n\nPlease know that this group knows what you are going through. We are living with it just as you are. Please reach out if you need someone to talk to. Thank you! I will definitely send her some articles about CU and see if she will read them. My moms gotten better after I took a sip of a soda and my lips ballooned up from the can. Its comforting to know there are others out there who understand. Um, I am sorry to say, but the only way to convince someone your conditionnis real is by showing them the effects , if it causes you massive discomfort do not do it , but if it is a few bumps , the argument will be convincing enough I would not really be too concerned about if people believe you or not, its not really going to make CU any better. I would, however, see if you can get a doctors note if you need to for work or something. When I worked at a restaurant, I could not work dishes and it took me a little while to convince the managers that it was not the soap that was breaking me out. Take photos or even better, videos and show them what break outs do to you. That will make them believe. I love this Dang I am sorry. I have it too and my family also does not believe me. I remember holding maybe 5 water bottles that I took out of the fridge to bring to ppl and my mom\u2019s friend asked why I had hives on my arms and I said \u201coh I am allergic to cold temperatures\u201d and my dad said not to listen to me that I was making it up. My doctor diagnosed me yet my family does not want to believe it \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc4d I have struggled with painful generalized itching for about 7 years winters, everytime I talk to my parents they tell me that it is psychic and that it is probably stess, and that I am being overly dramatic with it\nFOR SEVEN FUCKING YEARS.\nNobody will ever understand.", "Should I be worried I have been diagnosed with CU around 2015-2016, and it has been consistent overall symptom wise. I have read on here about people having Epipens after the symptoms getting worse.\n\nShould I be worried about needing an epipen in the future? Would moving somewhere cold make the symptoms become worse? Moving somewhere cold could exacerbate symptoms. I went from getting urticaria on exposed skin when cold to developing cold anaphylaxis. I only had urticaria for about 10 years and then one day I had to run into the ocean as my 6yr old sons canoe tipped over. I developed urticaria all over my body and started wheezing. I have an epipen anyway due to a bee venom allergy. \n\nLuckily its pretty easy to avoid for me ~no swimming basically. Thanks! Good to know.", "Is cold urticaria an autoimmune disease? I know for sure that I have cold urticaria as my skin breaks out into hives, swells, turns red, and itches anytime I am exposed to cold air and gets worse as I warm up. I can eat cold stuff but usually after a few bites it makes my tongue hurt and swell. It has not ever been actually diagnosed yet but I was wondering if it was an autoimmune disease as I believe I may also have lupus or something else that is affecting my joints.  Some people with cold urticaria, like myself, have it as a symptom of their autoimmune. Go to a doctor and get them to test you for everything. I have masocytosis. I have heard others with different diagnosis though. \n\nThey gave me an epi pen when my cold urticaria got worse and made my mouth swell. So just be cautious of that and definitely get checked out  I am supposed to see a rheumatologist soon I am just waiting on a call back. Thanks though. I have seen different things saying that it is an autoimmune but saying it could be apart of one. I think I may have lupus or RA though.  They thought that for me too. I had positive ana but rest of lupus and RA tests were negative. Which was frustrating as I thought it was solved and I was back to not knowing. Then,  Few months later and different doctors and I got the masocytosis diagnosis. \n\nNo matter what they say, keep pushing for more tests if you think something is wrong.  Yeah I was tested for it before but I think the Ana came back negative but this was years ago and I have more symptoms so hopefully something comes up positive this time. Thanks  What happened? Did you find out? How long did you have these hives after cold exposure? I still dont know what it is. I had more tests done last month and they came out negative. And it depends on how long I was exposed to the cold, if it was for a short amount of time, they usually last about 10 to 20 minutes while if its been awhile then normally 20 to 30 minutes and sometimes longer.", "Possible CU? Hi, I am a 20 year old female looking for an explanation to this crazy itch I get! I walked outside today and my legs became uncontrollably itchy, to the point where it was painful to ignore the itch. I had to run into a cvs bathroom so I could scratch and scratch and scratch until I felt it was bearable. Now my skin feels red hot and is still itchy, but less. \n\nThis is not the first time it is happened and I have sensitive skin in the first place, so I was just wondering if this sounds like CU to anyone who has it! What does your skin look like when this happens?  For me it is red with lighter bumps (the hives) scattered across the skin.  For it to be CU I \\*think\\* there needs to be hives.  I do get a weird 'hot' feeling on the affected skin when it is warming back up after getting cold / getting the hives. Honestly I am not sure. I was not able to look at my legs I just took my pants off and started scratching like crazy Put an ice cube on your arm and see if you get hives if you want to test it out.", "Allegra vs Zyrtec I am currently on Allegra once everyday but I have noticed that the 24 hour pill only works for 12 hours now. I am thinking about switching to Zyrtec but wanted to know how it is completed to Allegra. Everyone is different.  Zyrtec for me does not work. It just depends on your body and what works for you. Try different ones and see what is better. I noticed if I take the same ones to often over a long period of time my body starts to create tolerance.  You have to switch to different ones after a while. I sometimes take two 24hrs to get me through the day. Also try Xyzal. That one works great.  Hope this helps. Stay warm. Talk to your doctor about a double dosage. I take Allerga twice a day. i second this. i have severe year-round environmental allergies (not CU though). my allergist recommends switching brands every so often and doubling the dosage as needed, more so than every day, though that is an option too if nothing else is working", "not sure if i have CU my doctor said it is very unlikely that i have it. i put my arm under cold water for 40 seconds &amp; it just turns red, would not that be normal because it is cold water in the same spot? no hives no itch.  ice cube test, no hives no itch just red where the ice was due to having ice on my arm for a long time. can be in an air conditioned room with shorts on and got no hives even tho my legs were really cold. i even put my arm in front of an ac for a minute and nothing happened. maybe slight red skin from the cold. idk. \nbasically my question is, if i had CU would not these be affecting me? i am a hypochondriac &amp; this has been my recent medical problem i am caught up on. it is so so stressful &amp; my stress &amp; anxiety has not been so high. been avoiding cold food and drinks for weeks. i need reassurance &amp; help. my doctor sent me to an allergist for my own \u201cworry\u201d  but it will take 12-18 months to get into see one. my doctor said it is very unlikely i have it because i live in Canada &amp; there would have been signs before. Most get raised hives when not taking any allergy medication, so if you do not see that you are likely good. sometimes i get really tiny bumps from ice cubes or like the ice pack but it goes away fast &amp; does not really look like hives. is that classified as CU? or would that just be a normal reaction to ice on skin Likely just normal reaction! When I get hives they are around for 30 minutes to an hour. Everyone is is different: I do not react to ice cubes either but prolonged cold makes my arms and legs break out. More of a mild case but typically it is pretty clear when you have it. ahh okay makes sense, so i should assume i do not have it i guess? aha. i am so sorry that happens to you but thank you so much i appreciate you answering. \u263a\ufe0f You keep posting here and everyone keeps telling you that you do not have the signs of it. You would know. You would feel itching and burning. You are fine. i am sorry, my anxiety/hypochondria gets the best of me sometimes. i will not post here again I am sorry for being perhaps too blunt. It is not that you should not post here necessarily, I just do not think asking the same questions repeatedly is going to help your anxiety. No one here can actually observe or diagnose you but from what you have said, you do not have it, and even a doctor agrees. I would encourage waiting and seeing the allergist if it will help you feel better. You do not deserve to feel this anxiety, and if it helps you feel better, the fact that you cannot really tell if you have CU or not most likely means that you do not, because it is an uncomfortable condition. Even if you *do* end up having it, most people do not have it as severely as you may fear. I know how health anxiety can feel sometimes, and I hope you feel better. If it is at the point where it is affecting what food and drinks you consume, I would focus on addressing the anxiety first (if you are not already) as opposed to the potential allergy. It seems to be affecting you more and you might get better results by targeting the root of the problem no it is okay! i totally agree, you are right about that. you are honestly so right, i guess i needed someone to straight up tell me this. it is definitely annoying for me and others. i definitely need more work on my anxiety, i have not been able to see my therapist in a long time. thank you so much, i appreciate your reassurance and your honesty, it helped.", "I have these all over my body. I live in the colder regions that is basically -30 to -40 celcius everyday. Any tips on how to prevent it?  Plus the home is always heated. And the place i work for is in a hot kitchen. Everytime it has been like this Antihistamines help some people, and are reasonably cheap. They did not do much for me though.\n\nXolair made a huge difference for me, but it is expensive if your insurance does not cover it ($700-$1,000 every 4 weeks) and requires an injection every 4 weeks. In that kind of cold temperature it seems worth considering if your insurance covers most of it.\n\nI actually combine antihistamines (currently Reactine) with Xolair which seem to work best for me. \n\nXolair is the brand name in Canada &amp; USA, omalizumab is the legal name in case your country uses a different brand.\n\nYour situation of going between hot/cold extremes is pretty much the worst case scenario for CU, so good luck! Thanks might look into that. Have you tried wearing SKIING BASE LAYERs? It looks like hives but it could be from anything and not necessarily the cold. I hope you find out what is causing it and can get treatment.", "COVID-19 Vaccine Hi All. \n\nI was diagnosed with CU back in August, but I have been displaying symptoms since March.  I think that my case of it is pretty mild, I still break out into hives and itch, but they are never painful. My worst reaction was going into the ocean this summer resulting in copious amounts of swelling and lightheadedness. I was planning on getting the vaccine whenever it would be made available to me (I live in the US), but now I am wondering if I should wait as I heard that after the first rollout of the Pfizer vaccine in the UK did not go down well with people if they had a history of allergic reactions. Does that include people like us? Any response would be much appreciated, I am just very curious about everyone is thoughts on this. I would also like to add that this is no way an attempt to undermine the credibility of COVID-19 vaccines/cures, simply an expression of my own curiosity. I am not a doctor or an expert but I do know a little bit about the process and have a scientific background. What is sounds like is that only 2 out of the thousands that received the vaccine has adverse affects. They had an anaphylactoid reaction, which is not as deadly as anaphylaxis. While it is something to be aware of, likely, the media is blowing it a little too much or of proportion. You could also wait to see how the moderna vaccine does as well. It will all come down to the risk versus the benefit though. Would it be more beneficial to get the vaccine and risk the reaction or would you rather take your chances with covid. If you are not high risk, it might not be worth it, but if you are around people who are it may be. Talk to your doctor though and they can help you decide. I was just talking to my husband last night about if I would have a reaction or not simply because the vaccine is supposed to be kept quite cold. From what I have seen as far as warnings go, they have been saying that people with allergic reactions requiring they carry an epipen should not get the vaccine. I follow a vaccine researcher who is currently involved in the safety and efficacy of the Moderna mRNA vaccine.  When Pfizer announced this information, she said that basically anyone who has had a history of anaphylaxis (carries epinephrine) should wait until they can isolate what exactly was the trigger for these reactions.  The individuals who had the allergic reactions were identified to have had a history of anaphylaxis so they were already prone to possible severe allergic reactions, but they are working on narrowing down what specifically was the trigger in these cases (hooray for transparency and research for even rare reactions.)  She said if you have allergies, but do not carry epinephrine and never experienced severe allergic reactions and anaphylaxis, it was likely not going to be a real problem. Jessica Malaty Rivera, an Infectious Disease Epidemiologist with the Covid Tracking project got this question in one of her weekly ask me anything stories on her Instagram.  She said the vaccine is brought to room temp before injection, it is only stored at freezing.  So if you do get it, you will need to ensure that the person doing the injection has brought it to room temp, but most providers should be trained on it.", "dizziness? does anyone ever get dizzy/lightheaded with their CU?   \ni went for a short walk today and did not realise it was drizzling until i would stepped out of the house, but my symptoms have not been too bad lately so i thought i would give it a try. spoiler alert: it did not go well, i was itchy and spotty within minutes and basically ran through my walk to get back home.   \nweirdly enough, almost as soon as i got back inside (about 15 minutes after starting my walk) i got the strongest dizzy spell that lasted for about 1/2 an hour, and it is only just now abating as the rest of my usual symptoms have calmed down. i can only assume that it is related to the CU due to the time frame, but i have never experienced this before in my almost decade of CU. does anyone experience this? Yes. Whenever I get back inside I prioritize warmth and laying down so I do not pass out I also feel super drained and like I am not right. Its the most annoying thing. Yes! I get very dizzy, but for me, at least when it is cold outside, and I am breathing in the cold air, I feel my throat closing up so it is much harder to breath it cod be something like that for you oof! does it happen every time? i have had the drained feeling but never the dizziness, it was a bit of a shock! okay throat closing up is where i would start to panic, that sounds pretty serious! Honestly I am used to it by now, it is pretty slow. And a quick puff of an inhaler and I am good. After a decent amount of exposure, yes. If I just hold something frozen, no have you ever spoken to anyone about carrying an epi-pen? i have read that CU can turn into anaphylaxis if you are unlucky :/ Yeah, I do carry an epipen with me, for that exact reason. But luckily I have not had to use it yet! Knock on wood lol Do you use albuterol? In the evening when it gets cold it does feel like I have a tickle in throat and it almost starts to feel like it is producing mucus and a wheeze in my chest. Is that what it feels like for you? Cause I do use albuterol for that. Yes! That is almost exactly what it feels like. I also start coughing a lot. I am pretty sure I have albuterol but I am not sure Omg I am relieved to know that someone else feels the same as me! I wish we did not have to worry about this during a pandemic, but here we are. I have another appointment with an allergist/asthma doctor and they are going to do some tests. I am so paranoid during this pandemic! I feel you! I hope you can get something that works! I used to take a zertec every day during the winter, and that would help make it so that I do not react as easily, have yoy tried that maybe? Thanks, me too! I have tried Zyrtec, but it just makes me super tired in the morning.  It is been trial-and-error and I am just fed up so I am going to a specialist lol I am scheduling all of my doctors appointments now before my employer possibly terminates my coverage due to covid19. :/ thanks for your help!

So I am having trouble figuring out the deal, because it does not always happen under the same circumstances. There are some definite cold exposure related symptoms but not always repeatable the same way. \n\nHow did you all figure out your triggers? How long did it take? It took me quite some time. I was hospitalized after going into shock, and nobody could figure out what was wrong with me for years after many doctor\u2019s visits. I would say that I found out roughly 3 years after my first incident. Only about 18 months - my mum happened to read an article in a magazine about it and brought me to the GP with the article, and I got diagnosed that summer. I work at a health clinic so I found out the same day I had a reaction at work. My director had only seen it once before. I am still figuring it out, but very windy and damp days will definitely cause me to breakout in hives instantly, even if it is not that cold (think 50s). I just wish there is a way I can keep my face from blowing up and getting blotchy About 24 hours. \n\nOn Friday (yes, that Friday just there) I got burning ears and itchy head and legs on the way home from work.  Same thing when I left the house on Saturday morning Visited the pharmacist with a red, blotchy head and he said it looked like an allergy and suggested antihistamines. I have had a bad cold for a while and wondered if this is a rare symptom of the cold, so googled \"cold allergy\" and \"cold allergic reaction\" and found out about cold urticaria. \n\nIt seemed plausible, so later that day I ran cold water on my wrist for 30 seconds to test, and sure enough it soon provoked a reaction.  Since then I have had red itchy skin on my hands and head each time I have left the house.  Visited my GP and I am getting blood taken for tests on Thursday. Blood tests found nothing. Guess I have it for no reason.", "Does anyone else\u2019s ears burn and get really hot fast when they come into a warm area from the outside when it is cold? This has been one do the hardest symptoms I have dealt with since it started. I have never got hives on my face  but always on my hands or arms sometimes lower legs near socks and I have lived in -40 Celsius. Yep! Or just ache terribly when any cold wind hits them yes! happens with my ears, fingers, nose, and sometimes other exposed skin on my face. Yep, it is very uncomfortable That is a normal thing and has zero to do with CU I never had it happen till I had CU. I do not have to be in the cold for long and it is a pretty intense burning. When I lived in a very cold climate it was near unbearable. And before cu in that same climate my ears would just be cold there was never burning. It is just means that they got so cold it was going or has already gone numb and the burning is the feeling and heat coming back into them.  Happened to a lot of ppl where I lived in Quebec.   Also it is happened to my husband since he was a child and he does not have CU.         Your extremities can get so cold the blood stops circulating properly and things go numb, left too long you get frost bite.   It is a normal human experience.    When it happens, just dont leave your bare ears out in the cold, that is what earmuffs where created for.\ud83d\ude42 I never had it till CU and it was night and day how fast it happened. It is also +10 Celsius where I live when this happens. Well no matter what I am saying or regardless of what anyone else says you believe its CU causing it, so go see a doctor and discuss this with them and let them tell you.    Posting on here to get sympathy is tacky.   You asked a question.  Someone gave you an answer and also how to test for CU..  but your defense is to say \"no ,really it is all CU symptoms because I have CU and it didnt happen to me personally  before I was told I had CU\"      to anything that my suggested it is not CU related. \n\nI have to have an epi pen on me 24/7 because sweating gives me massive hives (just so there is clarity on my empathy and understanding of CU). I dont wish someone to have hives on their ears (which you did not specify if they did or not as CU is more a leave-a-welt-like-mosquito-bites-or-bigger)  because the itching I imagine would be hell to me.

But would be curious to hear what others think and about your experiences. I am going to seek professional medical advice from a doctor ASAP but I am curious if anyone has thoughts on if I have it in the meantime or any general advice for me as I go through the potential diagnosis process and manage this.\n\nI am 27F, recently moved to much colder weather climate than I have ever lived in since childhood. \n\nHere is my history. \n\n* When I went on a long run this weekend (about 1hr + in maybe 30 degree weather, not super warm clothes?)  I felt skin irritation and noticed a bunch of hives on my upper thighs when I came home. They seemed to get worse when I got in the shower. I thought it might be bug bites at first because it was so large, but there are no bite marks, and they came up when I was running then went away eventually.  The hives were located in areas of skin where I was sweatier/mostly my upper thighs. \n* I have often gotten back from running in shorts in warmer weather (maybe 60F?)  and have incredibly intense burning/itching/redness on my thighs. I never knew what caused it. This is my first time getting visible hives, also on my legs, with colder weather. Before I think it was mostly just rashes, redness, itching. \n* After the hives I am now seeing these lingering tiny red dots on my skin that almost look like a rash. I have noticed these dots on my upper thighs for years and always wondered where they come from, they come mysteriously then always fade. I have never made the connection to hives/cold weather until now.\n* A few years back in college I had one incident where I swam in the cold ocean and both of my hands got swollen up to about 2-3x their normal size, bright red, itchy, painful. I could not even close my fingers to make a fist. Almost like the blood was just stuck in my hands and they were puffed out to an unimaginable degree. It was really scary and I was about to go to the emergency room, but the swelling went away after a couple hours and so I never did.\n\nThink I have it? Any advice for someone very new to this?\n\nI am on an intense running schedule outside, just came back from the warmer weather out West. I really do not want to quit my running schedule for mental and physical health reasons :(. I am wonder if I just bundle up super well if you think it will be safe for me to continue.  Never had any throat issues so far and assuming I have a mild case, but I am a bit scared at the moment.\n\nDid the ice cube test for 5 min on my arm today and I did not get a hive on my arm.\n\nTHANK YOU for your advice and thoughts. Hey!!! OMG the same thing happens to me. I have noticed it for a couple years now. Same exact thing as you. Upper thigh. It is happened when I have gone just walking with my friend in the cold for awhile. I also have pics as well. Never have gotten it checked out but want to Thank you for replying! glad to know im not alone w my upper thigh issues. Do you have hives there or just redness/itching rash? I am so curious if this is cold urticaria hey!! My case sounds a little similar to yours - I have never had any throat issues, but I do tend to break out in more severe/widespread hives than what you have described. That said, as someone with a more mild and external case who has been living with this for about 15 years now, I have a few tips that might help you out! \n\n- I always recommend trying allergy medication and seeing if any work for you. I have been taking Zyrtec once daily for about 7 years and it is my LIFELINE. As long as I take my allergy pill daily, I usually do not break out on hives unless I get extremely cold. For example, a run in cold weather would not cause me to break out, but sitting on a cold surface outdoors for a while might cause me to break out where the cold surface was in contact with my body. If I do not take my allergy medication for even one day, I notice a huge difference. Without it, I break out into hives at a cool breeze or from sweat on my skin. So I would definitely try and see if any allergy medication works for you!\n\n- Before I found an allergy medication that worked for me (or when I forget my medication and break out now!), I got rid of my hives with a hot shower or bath. Not too hot to burn yourself, of course. But I have found that taking a fairly hot/warm bath or shower helped get rid of my hives quicker. I would recommend taking a hot bath next time you break out and seeing if that helps.\n\n- I also use a heating pad to get rid of my hive sometimes. If I am only broken out in a small area (it sounds like this is usually the case for you, from what you have described) instead of on my whole body, I put a heating pad over that area for a bit to get rid of the hives and itching. \n\nI hope some of these tips are helpful!! Yes, I am absolutely certain you do. I have got the exact same symptoms as you do. I do not know about the severity and at which temperature your body starts to react, so take this with a grain of salt. But please try to avoid cold water (could be anything under 22 Celsius, really) and watch for symptoms if you plan on swimming. Watch for dizziness, shallow breathing, fainting, skipping heartbeats. \n\nIf you plan on swimming in rather cold water, hold a foot or arm into the water for 20 minutes and then take it out and wait another 20 minutes to see if hives form. If they do, it is pretty safe to say you cannot swim there without risking your health. \n\nFirst time I swam with the condition, I nearly fainted. I had been in the water for about 6-10 minutes and my body was filled with hives. Go to a doctor and get checked if you can, this is not something to be taken lightly. Never let your friends tell you 'it will be fine' or similar, swimming with cold urticaria can become dangerous really quick.\n\nOther than that, get some gloves, thicker clothes or more layers of them when you go running in the cold. Running should generally not be that dangerous to you, since only parts of your body (such as your thighs) overreact. I go out running even at -4 celsius at the moment and I react strongly to cold. You might get hives on your body from sweat in the summer, too. Thank you so much for the advice. I really appreciate it. I will be very careful. Plan to invest in warmer clothes ASAP.  Yes, I hope that I can continue running especially if I dress better\n\nI do think I have had sweat reactions before. Never made the connections to the cold until yesterday, but I never had such intense hives so I am assuming it is cold urticaria. Thank you so much, I really appreciate your advice!!  Yes , they are very helpful! It starts with and itchy feeling, then redness and the hives!! I am not sure what to call it, since I only get like this during physical activity in the cold", "Newbie Here Hi there! 22F and newly diagnosed with Cold Urticaria. \n\nI first noticed it in the summertime here actually, where it was a chilly day and I was doing outdoor activities with my boyfriend. I was wearing leggings at the time (so thin tight fabric) and noticed my legs getting itchy. No big deal, just thought it was mosquito bites or something. As soon as I got home I changed into shorts and realized how red and bumpy my legs were and they started BURNING. My bf made an innocent joke saying I looked diseased, lol. \n\nNow that it is pretty much winter time here (-20 Celsius today) I have been really struggling. My legs, face, hands, chest will become fully red with itchy hives even after being outside for only 2 or so minutes. Its then followed by a hot burning sensation and will go away after about 10-20 minutes. \n\nSorry I am rambling. I am already diagnosed with it (I am just a mild case so far, no anaphylaxis or anything) so let me get to the point. I recently lost weight this past year (5\u20193 and went from 156lbs down to 130) and was wondering if there was a study linking this to weight loss? I have always had sensitive skin but it was never a problem until now. I went from overweight to a healthy weight so it is not like I am underweight and my body is freaking out about being too skinny and having no warmth. Just wondering if anyone\u2019s gone through something similar with weight loss? \n\nThanks in advance guys! I actually have noticed a connection with my cold urticaria and weight loss...  I lost 15 pounds last year and it was the worst year for my break outs... Fast forward to now,  I have gained it back and I have not had any hives yet, even though it was definitely cold enough to have them!  \n\n It is still early in the season, but it has been cold. I usually break out when it is about 34 Degrees Fahrenheit or below. Hey it is very interesting you bring this up. I was also recently diagnosed and just joined this sub. I talked to my MD, and did some research myself. One thing is sure, there is very little research on the topic. But I lost roughly 25 pounds this past year. I wonder if having less interstitial fat makes the reactions worse, basically leaving people with less insulation. \n\nA side note that may be of interest. My aunt has this allergy as well. She is also very skinny. There was a time in her life that she was not. I may ask her if her reactions were better when she was a little heavier. Odd, my aunt also has cold urticaria!! I should ask her more questions about it too. Interesting. I have been doing a lot of research on it. Pub med has some good recent studies on management and criteria. Seems like 50% of cases resolve in 5 years, but that is no guarantee. And recommended treatment is H1 Antihistamines, up to 4x the daily dose.", "Best medication for Cold Urticaria What medications seem to work best for everyone?

Do you have a doctor who knows what they are doing? Who are the leading doctors in this field? HELP! My nine year old boy has been recently diagnosed (by me, and finally affirmed by our doctor) We live in a rural area and I am having to send our doctors to google to learn more about this condition. I am flying blind here, as I am not a medical professional. I am also a bit on edge, because I cannot quite face what life will look like while keeping a boy his age out the water, sweat-free and out of the cold.\n\nI am committed to getting him the best help I can, even if that means traveling.

This was the place I came to to figure out what was happening to him, and you all solved it for me. It has been so much more manageable since I have understood what the stimulus is. \n I think Dartmouth might be the place where they are doing research on this? I know rarediseases.org links to various associations that might be able to point you to a local(ish) physician. I know I just use an allergist (even though I have familial cold urticaria, so I really should not), so you might be able to find a good children\u2019s one.  Thank you so much for reaching out to me.  I will look these resources up today.   Hi there, I just wanted to wish you good luck and offer some advice.  I was diagnosed with cold urticaria by an allergist when I was 6 or 7 years old (I am now in my 30s), but have mostly been managing it without doctors since then.\n\nAn allergist should be able to make a diagnosis for you.  There may be be a new test now, but when I was diagnosed all they did was press an ice cube into my arm for a few minutes and look at the reaction.  An allergist may also recommend carrying an EpiPen or something similar if they believe anaphylaxis is a possible risk.  I have never experienced anything other than skin reactions and do not carry one, but I would definitely recommend talking to an allergist about it.\n\nOver-the-counter antihistamines (Zyrtec, Claritin, store-brand equivalents) have worked really well for me -- they do not do anything to reduce redness, but they reduce the itchiness down to almost zero for me.  I switch brands every six months so my body does not get too used to any one medication.\n\nI believe there are also cortizone/steriod injections that can help with skin redness, but I have not ever looked into them personally -- an allergist should be able to offer more guidance if you are interested.\n\nI do go swimming if the water is not too cold, but I do not just jump right in.  It is a bit of a pain, but walking down the steps slowly and standing on each step for a couple of minutes seems to make the skin reaction less severe.\n\nThat is pretty much it, other than making sure I always have a sweatshirt/hat/gloves handy when the weather is chilly.  Again, I would definitely recommend consulting with an allergist, but in my experience (and Googling) cold urticaria is not very well understood -- most of what I do now to manage it is just the result of trial and error and finding what works for me.\n\nGood luck! Thank you for responding! It is so nice to hear from someone who has dealt with this for a long time.  Your comments confirm what I have concluded.  It is mysterious, and our best bet is OTC antihistamines and lifestyle adjustments.  We have seen an allergist, who confirmed the diagnosis, but there really are not any treatments that 'cure' it.

I am a 19 y/o male and I think I have Cold urticaria. I get rashes that itch from cold and last summer I went for a swim in our pool and I vomited and passed out, found nothing at the hospital. Should I get a urticaria test? You can test yourself. Grab an ice cube and put it on your arm for a few minutes, take it off and see if you get a hive. This does not work with everyone who gets diagnosed but for a majority I would say it does. \n\nIf you get a positive reaction go to your doctor and bring photos (most have never heard of it). If you vomited and passed out your going to want to get an epi pen. Otherwise they usually give you a lot of antihistamines to control it. They will also do blood tests to see if you have an underlying cause. I have an appointment to an allergists but I managed to swim in our pool even though I suffer from cold urticaria. I just went in very slowly, the first time I had a bumps all over my skin but the second and third time nothing.

I have had them both since I was about 13-14 years old. I honestly have no idea how I managed to get both of those allergies, but for the most part it is what I live with.  \n\n\nOne thing that has always confused me about my Cold Urticaria is that it tends to come and go in ways I do not personally understand. Sometimes I go Months, to even a year sometimes without my skin reacting violently to cold, and then suddenly one day my hand is in really bad itchy pain because I held an otter pop. Then after I have a bad reaction I usually have to be very careful of cold things for a while, to avoid any more reactions, but like I said for some reason it just comes and goes.  \nTypically my Aquagenic Urticaria is much more consistent, and I know how to play around it to avoid bad reactions, but the problem is with my Cold Urticaria I never know.  \nI was curious if any of you have had similar variation in reactions over time. I have no idea if this is a common thing, or not as there is sadly not much information on allergies like these. I am sorry I cannot shed much light on your situation. My CU is constant. I take cyproheptadine (periactin is the brand name) every night for it. It flares up if I miss my meds. It started randomly about 8 years ago, but I feel as though it is gotten better over time. \n\nI cannot imagine having Aquagenic Urticaria. Hopefully you can catch a break with both of them soon \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb I am on team inconsistent over here.

My Aquagenic Urticaria is fairly mild only causing actual pain in rare circumstances, and I know how to avoid those usually so it is usually just itchy and uncomfortable. My Cold Urticaria thankfully is not usually a huge problem, but I have started getting outbreaks again recently, and they have not been fun. Thankfully I was able to avoid them during the winter though which was really nice.Having both Cold Urticaria and Aquagenic Urticaria makes winter absolutely suck, if it is cold I break out, and it hurts pretty bad, but if I bundle up too much I sweat a bunch which also causes me to break out. I basically just have to avoid outside during the winter. I am also inconsistent. does the periactin help prevent any hives when you get cold? i am looking into taking something for my CU and am just wondering about your experience? do you still break out and is it just less severe? I have never tried periactin. A while ago I was prescribed Doxepin for the urticaria, which did help a little but made me so drowsy all the time I could barely function. Ever since then I cant take benadryl without falling asleep.\nFor the cold urticaria it is hard to tell because its inconsistent. I have no idea of telling if something helps, or works for it because for all I know It could have just stopped reacting temporarily Purely inconsistent. I can go skiing and not have an issue but if a breeze hits me the right way on a run in the summer it will trigger. It definitely reduces the severity of the cold hives for me. So far it is been the best CU medicine I have been on. \n\nAlso, I was taking Allegra everyday for seasonal allergies, and my dermatologist recommended that I switch to Zyrtec because it works better for CU. I have also found this to be true and can tell a difference when I take Zyrtec vs Allegra or Claritin.", "Got COVID and my CU returned.

I will keep this as concise as possible:\n\n* First symptoms last year (age 28) when my fingers/hands began to get a weird blue/non-welp rash in cold temps. When the winter rolled around, I began getting cold rash and welps on any exposed skin. Usually this would be my face and hands. My skin (mostly cheeks) would swell and turn almost purple. It got so bad that only a few minutes in anything below 55 degrees Fahrenheit would yield reactions that lasted hours.\n* Appointment with GP I was advised to try virtually every OTC allergy medicine such as Zyrtec, Claritin, etc.  None of these helped or slowed the symptoms.

I wake up this morning (October 7, 2019) and I still have a bit of discoloration on my face (over 12 hours later). I go see my GP who prescripes be soliris and schedules me an appointment with a local dermatologist. \n\nI will make another update post with the effectiveness of the soliris and my appointment with the dermatologist. \n\nIf you have had any success with any particular treatment, please share it. Um I am a Canadian 14 year old male , I have the following conditions , anxiety , migraines , and cold urticaria , my best recommendation, is to see an allergist and get a treatment that works for you and you only , if reactine is available , then try it . If you are in a severe reaction , ( hard breathing , sweats , paleness , and stomachache ) , then these reactions can be made worse if you have anxiety , so calm down , bundle yourself up , drink warm liquids , and lay down . One minor thing I wanted to say is to research your type of gold urticaria , and see if it runs in your family and how to prepare for it , if it runs in your family , like mine , then prepare for the worst and hope for the best . If you need any research I have accumulated ( I have got too much spare time ) , then PM me , and I will try and see what I can help you with However , judging from your symptoms I do not think it is severe , but if you go swimming or take a drive during cold weather , then bring a blanket in case you get stuck on the side of the road Hey there. Thanks for the feedback. Since my symptoms began, I have not exposed myself to freezing temps for more than a few minutes at a time. I think if I allowed myself in freezing weathers for 30 minutes + then I might have some more severe reactions. A 10 minute walk in 55 degree weather left me with a stomach and facial rash that has lasted nearly 24 hours. I would love to see your research. I cannot live like this. At least not in Missouri. I am literally going to be forced to move to have any quality of life. That is assuming I do not find a treatment. I think I could copy and paste the different types for you , I will just have to grab it This website ha da lot of the basic info , the different types are harder to find , they were a specific doctors thesis or some thing \n \n\nThese two talk about the genes and inheritance in case you have children , you should get them diagnosed Listen , you should also check something for me in case you also have raynauds, which is connected to cold urticaria , are your toenails and fingernails having a purpleish tint to them ? Since if so , research raynauds and make sure to talk to your doctor", "Wow. This Sucks. Guess im the new guy in the group. \nSoo when i was around 15 i started noticing that my right arm (and only my right arm) had a purple marbled appearance whenever i was even the teeeeeniest bit chilly. Im 18 now and have just been diagnosed as it has gotten continually worse and more noticeable. \nDoctors are a bit useless, I suffer from Raynaud\u2019s as well so the cold is pretty much a killer for me - and i live in the UK where its only warm for 2-3 months of the year. \nLuckily I dont break out in hives, there is not itching or any other symptoms apart from the very mottled look of my skin around my elbow. \nFor my job i am required to be COLD AND WEAR SKIMPY CLOTHES. This just majorly sucks and people often dont believe me when i say I am allergic to the cold. \nLet me know if there are any hacks or medications which you have tried as i feel like ive run out of options :( I live in an extremely cold country too, and my \u201ctimeline\u201d is about the same as yours. I would recommend working and getting educated towards a career that will shield you from the cold, such as white collar office jobs, and to quit your job as soon as possible if you cannot be accommodated. Your health is the number one priority, do not risk your life. As for medicine, cetirizine works for me, but talk to your doctor regarding this. I know you said you have to wear skimpy clothes, but could you wear arm warmers at least? I am sure there is a way to make those look appropriate if they will allow it I am sorry , I am 14 and Canadian , so this is hella wack and relatable , my suggestion is to get a job that you love and that works for you , maybe wear yarn socks , those always work for me", "I get this purple rash from cold weather. What Is going on? Anyone familiar with this?  Possible to be a reaction. I get reactions in cold weather and when my skin makes contact with cold surfaces. For example, a cold tabletop or even really cold water (kayaking and canoeing). You can further test cold urticaria by exposing yourself to cold stimuli like an ice cube or putting a wet rag in the freezer for awhile (but before it is frozen).", "Cold Urticaria fading? I developed cu halfway through last year and everyone says it should fade before like 7 years and I was wondering if anyone has had this happen I have had it for roughly the last 8 years and I would argue it is gotten worse. However, a daily claritin chewable (OTC - 10mg I believe) has reduced its impact maybe 90%! Bike rides in even moderately chilly weather would render my fingers sausages; now it is practically normal! Thank you I will have to try that I am really tired of my fingers swelling up everytime I get a little bit cold Mine lasted for almost 20 years went away for one year and came back. \ud83d\ude2d\nI am going to go get my metal dental fillings replaced with non metal. I read it is terrible for Heath. I have had it for over 10 years and it has definitely gotten worse. \n\nThe daily Claritin works for me drastically reducing inflammation. \n\nI do not do chewable but I do 10mg. \n\nThe bottle says not to take it every day for too long so confirm with YOUR doctor before you do. \n\nMy doctor said it was ok for me but I am not one and do not want to give bad advice. always talk to your own doc who knows your situation before you try anything with a warning label. I have had mine for 20+ years and it is still the same if not worse I would say mine is fading. It started around 10 years ago and the first few years were way worse for me. And then every year it slowly gets better. It is not gone 100%, but it has improved probably 80% for me. The last few years have been the same, no noticeable improvements or changes. I had it for about 2 years and it faded. Probably because I was stress from newborn baby. And now I am comfortable taking of them. I have definitely heard that cold urticaria goes away fro some people after a few years. I am not one of those lucky ones. I have had it for over 30 years and it has not gotten better. Fortunately, the pandemic has meant I get to WFH in my preferred temperature and I am not required to go out for any reason.", "Birth Hello,\n\nI work at a doctors office and I recently ran into a woman who had just given birth. I did not know this but you have to ice yourself after you give birth! Has anyone on this sub given birth with CU? What did they have you do for the pain? Also just a side not I am only 20 and have never had a child but would like to further down the line in my life. I have had 3 c sections and had to ice my incision after each one while still in the hospital. I did not have an issue at all because they gave me an antihistamine (some of the drugs from a c section make your whole body itch uncontrollably) so I suspect you could take an antihistamine prophylactically (depending on how severe your CU is) I luckily can control my CU with antihistamines so I made sure I took them and it was fine. \n\nIt is a good time. \ud83d\ude05 Mines pretty bad. I take 360 mg of antihistamines a day (doctor prescribed) and I still get reactions from ice I did not Ice. They told me not to.", "What temperature are you triggered at? Hi, i am wondering what temperatures you all are triggered at?   \nI am just learning that I have this. It seems like I am only triggered at really low temperatures (I think in the mid 30s) and/or after being out for some time particularly when exercising.  I am wondering if this is normal. From what I read the average is about 60 degrees Fahrenheit and lower is enough to get a reaction. That seems about right, but wind and stuff also makes it worse so \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f 70 to 75 Depends on wind/humidity, but 65 is probably a good bet So many variables. It depends on weather (cloudy vs sunny...wind vs no wind...etc) but also what I am wearing or if I am inside. I cannot really spend any note worthy time outside unless it is like 75. But I can also have reactions at higher temps if I am sweating and AC is blowing or even a breeze. It depends, so for example at an indoor pool, which is 80\u00b0F, I will get blue tinged lips and hives if I am not constantly swimming. At the seaside or if it rains, I can get hives from about 70\u00b0F and below. Inland, it is about 55\u00b0F if it is not windy.", "Does this look like cold urticaria ? I have had this the past couple of days when i go into the cold ", "Allegra is working to stop the itching, but I still get the hives. Has anyone tried taking desiccated kidney supplements for CU?  Desiccated kidney??? No, I have never heard of that. Did you find some studies on it? And yeah, that happens especially after you take it for awhile I personally take Claritin the outdoor allergy relief and definitely makes a difference I have to take two or more sometimes. It does not take my hives away forever by any means but I notice for me they do not seem to come on as quickly as they would normally but I was told by my doctor to try outdoor allergy relief I am not sure it is what your looking for but it might help!", "Are you guys able to swim in lakes or rivers on warm days? I am 24 male, diagnosed with CU for 2 years now and today on a 30 degree Celsius day I went to a River, I went in high up on my legs but now higher but I did not have any itchiness or hives or anything even though the water was still cold.\n\nAre you guys able to swim if the water is a little cold? Last time I swam in a river it was a sunny 27-30C day, the water must have been around 21C. I was able to enjoy the water for around 30-40min before I started to feel a mild itch and preemptively got out. It stopped itching and I had no hives. Though the thing is there is no way of reliably predicting if I will have a CU episode, the only thing I can do is cautiously assess my reactions as I go. I can do temperate lakes or a warm tropical ocean for about 10 minutes at a time on a hot day, then I get out once I see bumps forming on my hands and warm up for about 15 minutes and get back in. I cannot seem to do rivers for more than a couple of minutes because they are usually colder (I am in Washington state). I take a Benadryl and Zyrtec before I go swimming which seems to help. I usually do well in lakes if there is not a huge difference between the water temp and air temp. If there is a big difference, the moment any of my skin comes out of the water I usually begin to itch and have hives forming within a few minutes.\n\nHowever, if there is not a large temp difference and both the air and water feel \"warm\", I can swim for almost an hour before I start getting a little itchy. Lakes are definitely my friend in comparison to the ocean. No. Last time I did I went into cold urticaria induced anaphylaxis. Scared the shit out of me. Luckily I carry epipens due to bee venom anaphylaxis. Would you be able to share a little more about yourself for context having that reaction such as age, male/female, if you take any medications prior and how long you have had Cu? Sure. \n41f\n\nMeds ~ asthma preventer/reliever, thyroid, birth control, reflux med, antidep (at the time I developed it)\n\nCold urticaria for about 12 years. \nRecently developed heat and pressure urticaria. \n\nI knew I had cold urticaria as whenever I carried cold drinks, my hands would itch and be covered in lumps. \n\nIt then progressed to if I were outside and it was cold, any exposed skin would itch/welts. \n\nI honestly did not think that much of it. I just took  an antihistamine daily as I have grass allergies. It seemed to help both. \n\nThen about 5 years ago I was at the beach. Autumn. My son was 6 and in a canoe a few metres off shore. I was walking along the shore, just keeping an eye out. It was not very deep, about up to my waist at most. He had a life jacket on etc. \n\nAnyway he somehow tipped the canoe. I ran straight into the water to help him. He was fine, a little shaken as it was unexpected. I pulled him and the canoe into shore. \n\nI started to feel weird. Woozy. I looked down and  every part of me that had been in the water was covered in urticaria. Red. Itchy. But I felt different. I started swelling and knew it was an anaphylactic reaction. \n\nEpipen, antihistamines. \n\nCalled my Dr, we were about 2 hrs from a hospital. Said it had settled down, did I have to go to ED. \n\nShe asked if I had another epipen. I did, I always carry two. She said if there were any respiratory signs still, I had to go. \n\nThere was not. \n\nSo I went to see her the next day and got a referral to Immunology. \n\nHad a bunch of allergy tests, knew I had a lot of allergies.

Sorry to hear. The only interesting thing I wanted to say was I developed acid reflux when I got cold urticaria. Is that by chance what happened for you? Ah no. I had acid reflux for about 6 yrs prior", "Do you guys swim?? I have had cold urticaria for a couple of years, plus dermatographic and cholonergic! Lucky me!!!\nAnyway, wanted to ask, do you guys go swimming? That is the biggest bummer for me, originally from Greece and now living in LA, my doctor told me swimming could end up in an anaphylactic shock which I find the most annoying part. I can handle everything else so far but that \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21.\nBefore I went to the doctor every time I would go in the sea, after getting out and starting to warm up my whole body gets red and itchy/burns.. Now I just do not go anymore! My doctor told me that it would probably be fine to swim in pools but not lakes/oceans. I have actually done both, with caution, and been fine (luckily) Can you elaborate \u201ccaution\u201d?! Thank you for the response! I have not swam in a pool for years, so I would not know. But I did go into a lake 2 years ago on a warm summer day... I got a sunburn, and only got itchy as I was drying off and the wind was hitting the wet skin.  \n\n\nLast year we had no hot water in the house, and I ended up taking a cold bath (accidentally), broke out all over. My best advice, dry off and get warm as soon as you get out. As soon as you get the chill from the wind that is when you get hives all over. Yes, it sucks. Go in slowly. I just put my legs in for a while and see if I break out at all. Then If I feel confident I will go in further. My cold urticaria is rather mild compared to others so it has worked out so far I have had allergic reactions from all of those; Lakes, oceans, AND pools. Beware, my fellow cold sensitive being. I am able to swim during the warmest months of the summer, but I have been blessed geographically, and live in South Florida. But anything outside of the hottest months will certainly give me grief. I have not been swimming either which is a major bummer because I absolutely love being in the water. I am just too afraid to try it. :(", "Suggestions please! Even when wearing warm sweatpants outside it is not enough to keep my behind from breaking out! It happens on other parts too, but I get it worse on my butt. How can I protect my posterior from the cold better? Any suggestions? Thanks Tight undershorts/thermals, or tie a jumper around your waist. Layers in any way possible I start breaking out in hives on my butt too! And it is also the worst place for me. At work I sit on an electric heated pad and also wrap myself in a heated blanked.\n\nWhen moving about, I will use those self-heating packets and stick them in my back pockets. Layers always help I usually wear long Johns under pants to protect from the cold Skin color leggings lined with velvet underneath everything. It helps so much. Thanks so much for responding, it is been very uncomfortable. I will use your suggestion :) Thank you! Thanks so much It is the worst! Thanks so much for the suggestions. I will look for some heating packs and try this out. Thank you!", "CU or something else? Hi guys!   \nI have the pretty average CU symptoms, just hives that break out on my hands, wrists, and feet when I am too cold, but something weird happened a few days ago and I am wondering if you guys have experienced this too. Basically, I got what I thought was just another hives outbreak on my hand, I started scratching it, and suddenly I noticed (or created?) a tiny bump in the middle of that rash. The next day, that rash seemed to have spread to two of my fingers, but it also made them swell up, itch, and burn at the same time. It has not gone away in two days; those two swollen fingers will be hot and itchy (and feel like they are burning) while the rest will be freezing. I am wondering if this is something you guys have ever experienced as part of cold urticaria or if this is totally different.   \n(I plan to go to a new doctor about this soon, but my problem was my old doctor did not seem to know cold urticaria existed and simply printed me a page from some website about it when I told him I thought I had it. In case this new doctor also has no clue what CU is, I would really appreciate responses from people with experience!)  \nThanks for any input! I am not a doctor, and am speaking only of my experience, but that is not a symptom I have with cold urticaria. I have a fairly rare type, and a strange list of symptoms, but I have not heard of that being a symptom even of the rare types. But sometimes, bodies are weird, so I would not be surprised if someone out there had something similar happen. CU goes away when ur not cold anymore. First part sounds like it, second half sounds like something else Thank you! That is a good point Late to reply, but are you seeing a gp or an allergist? Most doctors I have seen had no clue what cu is, but my allergist knew and pointed out other things I did not realize were connected (breathing problems and painful joints in the winter) since no one else in my family has those issues. \n\n\nIt does sound like 2 separate problems to me, like someone else had suggested. I have never seen an allergist before, maybe I should. I never knew that was an option honestly, but it sounds like something I really need. Thanks!", "Hives with tears?! Just commiserating here. I do not cry very often. I have had CU since May and today I see that I get burning hives on my face when I cry. Real cute. Can you all relate? I cannot relate to this, but damn I am so sorry! Crying is such an important emotional release and it sucks that you are experiencing this. Oh yeah, cold air on the eyes do it everytime for me, do not sweat it though, buckle in for your new life with CU It is just icing on the cake, I reckon. What a weird ailment to develop. I keep thinking I will uncover the meaning behind it and heal myself. Not so far. Ah yes, I do try not to sweat as that causes hives too, haha! Got To laugh, or else I will cry some more! Oh you are fucked, fucked. Yo idk if it is applicable to you or not, but try cutting down a lot on sodium for like a month and see if it gets any better Interesting, I will try it. Can you tell me how cutting sodium might help? The mechanism? Not even a little lmao, however, I can tell you that my sodium levels do not affect my CU, but it does affect my brother\u2019s. He started to break out like me in the cold and the doc suggested he tried to cut sodium and it worked within a couple weeks. If he binges over a weekend it will come back for a few days it is pretty wild Hope that helps! I have been taking desiccated kidney to nourish my kidneys, in case they are the problem. It could be that lowering salt unburdens the kidneys. I will try it!", "Cold Urticaria, So thankful to have found this group! Hi all, \n\nI remember the first time I had an \"episode\" as I call it so clearly! I was riding home on a motorcycle in Uganda in a rain storm about 3 years ago. It was semi-warm out, but now I believe it was the humidity and mostly the wind that gave rise to my first episode. I was so confused what about what had happed. When I got back to Minnesota I noticed the same thing started happening more frequently, for obvious reasons. \n\nSince then I have noticed that the cold, along with humidity and wind (wind almost being the worst) cause me to have an episode within about 5 minutes of exposure. I went to my physician and she pretty much just recommended staying out of the cold and trying an antihistamine. Obviously avoiding the cold works, but I love being active outside + live in MN. I have tried the antihistamine but have had little luck. Also my rash seems a little different than other peoples in the group. I am 25. I also do not seem to have any problem drinking cold drinks, which kind of throws me off. I am wondering if any people have the same symptoms?  \n\n\n1. Skin reacts the worst upon transitioning into a warm environment, it never seems too bad when I am actually outside. \n2. Skin gets a waxy and kind of rubbery texture.\n3. Feel faint / mentally foggy / tired for about 30 minutes after an episode starts.\n4. Wondering if anyone can explain the science behind what is happening? How does the temperature/wind/humidity level cause the body to release histamine on the outside yet does not react to drinking cold water?  \n\n\nIm uploading some pictures. First is the texture of my skin changing, my boyfriend commented it looks like I have aged years when I am having a reaction. First picture is me around 30 min after the peakthe peak of the reaction. Second picture is me during a reaction. Last picture is from walking outside for less than 5 min. \n\n\n\n\n\n Nobody has found the cause of CU yet, but from what we have seen on this subreddit, some have it from childhood, and the rest of us have adult onset.\n\nEveryone has different levels of reaction. the more severe are fainting and throat closing (very similar to a nut allergy).\n\nFor #1, it is possible the skin does not react until it is warming itself up releasing histamine accidentally.  \n\n\nI myself have an issue being outside in the heat too long, causing my body to cold sweat to cool down, causing a reaction all over my back and torso. I have done some research on this since I was diagnosed earlier this year. I would suggest going to PubMed and searching for it. There are some systematic reviews and case studies that are really informative. \n\nMost of the time it does occur when the skin is warming back up, and for some reason the body releases histamine in response to this. That is the best explanation I have gotten from research, but it seems that people experience a good variety of symptoms and all to a different intensity. For example I can eat ice cream, drink ice cold water, and drink smoothies with no issues whatsoever. However, if the temperature drops below 55ish and the humidity is low I can start to get a reaction on my hands and feet that will slowly worsen by spreading up my extremities until I return to a warm area. \n\nSome individuals have found a dosage of over the counter antihistamines that knock the issue out completely, while others have not been so fortunate. Next winter I will likely start experimenting myself since I have not found anything that makes it better for me. In severe cases like my aunt, she needed steroid injections to stop it. Due to the side effects of that, she just decided to live in a warm climate area. \n\nDo some research, adjust accordingly, and find something that works for you. The antihistamines work for me but the moment the antihistamine wears off, the hives react 3x harder than normal. So sometimes I just try to avoid the antihistamine in general, in fear of ultimately becoming fully dependent on them for the rest of my life. \n\nI do hope to find a way around this or if my body will ever adapt to the cold without the need to release the histamines but I do not think this will end up being the outcome.", "Itchy Hives - Itchy Hives Causes - Hives Itchy Skin - Hives Itching - Hives Itch Relief ", "Can cold urticaria be caused by a wheat allergy?

I still eat ice cream and do not really have issues other than anxiety  Sometimes my mouth feels a little weird, but nothing severe has ever happened to me, thankfully.

We can voluntarily opt of situations that would put our bodies at risk as well. I do not consider myself disabled unless of course part of the job required me to do something that I could not. Such as if I were in the food industry for example, I would not go into a freezer- my face blew up looking inside my own freezer too long so no thanks. If I needed to explain that to a job I may say disabled so that I could not be required legally to do that. In normal circumstances or for a job that did not require me to be in the cold  no I would not say disabled. I have the same symptoms, itchy skin and light headed. \n\nI almost went into anaphylactic shock wich is when your allergy reaction is so severe in my case my blood pressure drops and I faint, I have only fainted and puked but if I am in a pool that is 20 celcius or below it could make my heart stop beating and stop my breathing and ultimatley die. It is not fun to live with all of this but it is my life. I just have to learn to live with it. You are not alone. I would not consider myself disabled at all. I just need to be really prepared with layers and choose to not put myself in places where I am exposed to the elements (like park ranger or oil rig worker). I worked as a nurse and just wore extra layers and woolen socks under my scrubs. The NICU had a bare below the arms policy which was too cold for me I just did not work there and I worked in ICU and emergency which somehow had less strict rules about wearing long sleeve shirts.\n\nNow in medical school I would wear a full out winter jacket under my lab coat and look ridiculous during anatomy lab which was really cold but I have passed and finished anatomy so it has not impaired my ability to learn although I got weird looks (cadavers need to be kept really cold). I can still perform like anyone else as long as I can dress warmly and just need to choose to not work in environments that are cold. I personally do not see myself as disabled. I think of having a disability as being unavoidable. I can avoid negative side effects of my allergy on a daily basis while other people with very different life long problems (mental or physical) might struggle to get even minor day-to-day tasks done. My office is very cold all the time so I make sure to keep warm layers in my office.  I have explained my allergy to most of the people I work with and they are always willing to accommodate me (the IT guy even loaned me a sweat shirt one day).  If I were you I would just make everyone you work with aware of your allergy, no need to get lost in technicality. I do but due to other autoimmune diseases ~ rheumatoid arthritis/sjorgens/ehlers danlos. I am anaphylactic to cool water but consider my CU a nuisance more than a disability.", "Do preventative antihistamines work for you?  Yes, I take a daily Zyrtec and I have not experienced a symptom in years. Yes. I take Zyrtec when I am going out in the cold.", "Does anyone else know how one gets cold urticaria? What is your story? And does anyone know if there is any new advances in a cure? I have had it for a few years now I am 24 male. I went to a naturopath and I mentioned I got CU from a viral infection so he gave me oil of oregano on pills to clear the gut and see if that regulates the immune system.\n\nAnyone else try anything or recommend anything? Unfortunately no cures that I know of, I have had it for over half my life. I think you can get allergy shots but they are not cheap I have had it since I was around 10. Since it is autoimmune it will fluctuate in severity. I was told it would go away when I became an adult but I am 22 now and it is still pretty bad. I wish there was a cure! I hate explaining it to people when they notice my hives and rash as soon as a cold breeze touches my skin. 2 years ago I caught a horrible virus. I was in the hospital for a few days, I came in not able to walk on my own, delirious with a fever of 105\u00b0F and auditory/visual hallucinations. They put me on seizure watch, ran every test, xrays, cat scans and could not pin what kind of virus I had. By the end of it I lost 20 pounds, I had to go to PT and it took the rest of the semester to recuperate.\n\n4 months later I was walking up a hill to get to class after it had snowed and noticed my throat and face were covered in bumps. I thought I ate something weird and it was just a particularly bad winter for asthma (my throat was actually closing when I went outside since it was cold) so I got on steroids and it suppressed my allergic reactions. I did not put two and two together till I told an allergist about it and showed her pictures. I just recently was able to get officially diagnosed!\n\nAsk your doctor about Omalizumab (Xolair). If you can prove you have a chronic urticaria with some tests then they can approve you for treatment. It is a once or twice a month injectable. I just developed this condition a few weeks ago!  I am 38, cannot even remember the last time I was sick so I cannot think of anything that would have triggered it.  I am taking Zyrtec on chilly days and that seems to help. Immigrated to Canada in 2016. Developed CU in fall of 2017. I was 19 at that time, am still have it till this date. Mine did! It started when I was 27 and was severely diminished by 31. Still get itchy eyes and red skin that kind of hurts a bit with cold, but not the horrible bumps and pain that came with them. My sister 8 years younger than me started at 23, she is 29 now and hers is just as bad and when it started. It was also worse than mine from the get go, but not as bad as yours by your description (she does not get the bumps on her throat, but she swells horribly if any cold water or ice touches any skin). I am fairly certain mine started after a family trip where I got very sick for just one day. High fever and had to just lay in bed. Magically recovered by the next day, but I felt absolutely horrible the night and day I was sick. After I got home from the trip and back to my cold country my feet would itch like crazy every evening. Then 4 months after summer came and I stopped noticing it until I went swimming one day and got huge red marks all over my thighs. Was diagnosed by a dermatologist a few months after that. After about 7 years after I finally started to get better, but I still have it from time to time if I am cold for too long. Got my CU few days after a giant wasp sting while bicycling. After all the swelling of the sting went down, I noticed I would get really itchy hives especially when I work up a sweat. Riding my bike I work up a sweat, the wind would cool that area relative to dry spots. Just a tiny bit of difference in skin temperature would cause bright red itchy hives. I would be covered in it and often got embarrassed to work out and sweat in public. Riding in the winter or just in the rain was super miserable. Even my palms and the bottom of my feet would get itchy. The only relief was too take a super hot shower and take some benadryl. Even then it took few hours for the itchiness to subside. I have been atopic since I was a kid and grew up eating junk and processed food. Now in my 40s I have been on paleo diet for 5yrs and now switched over to keto diet for 3. Since I have gone super strict keto (dirty keto does not work), intermittent fasting and OMAD, my symptoms have subsided 90%. My seasonal allergies that plagued me for decades are completely gone and joint pain from all the power lifting disappeared as well. \n\nI would recommend you do a elimination diet for a few weeks and see what allergens you are consuming. Doctors cannot really help you, they can only sell you drugs to mask the underlying issue. You should also be aware of what you are putting on your skin, moisturizers, soap, the material in your clothing, latex mattress toppers, pillows, perfume, air freshener can all be creating micro additions to your histamine level. Think of histamine as water filling up a cup. Once that cup fills and spills over it manifests into a rash. I would also look into \"disbiosys\". Good  luck. Oh wow! Sorry to hear about your experience. So xolair is like allergy shots but reduced the severity of CU? I am going to start a trial of xolair hopefully soon\ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffc\n\nHow was it ? Did you have any reactions? I know everyone is different just trying to get a feel for it. Glad I found this section...Here is my story, hope it gives someone info to compare against. I am not a doctor of course so any recommendations please consult a doctor. My urticaria (M) started around late teens early 20\u2019s. I am now 33 and symptoms and flare ups have reduced gradually over the years, thankfully. I went to many allergists and doctors and none were able to suggest or prescribe anything that helped significantly. Over time I was able to identify various factors that I felt would cause a flare up. For me a flare up would be 2-3 days of intense hive cycles every time I stepped outside that would get worse before they got better, generally lasting for 30 minutes or so before wearing off. My entire body almost would hive including face. I found that these would coincide often with the change in seasons from winter to spring or fall to winter. Over time I also avoided using anything other than allergen free detergent and tried not to change brands. I also take 10mg of loratadine daily...if I go more than a week or so without taking, I will often have a flare up. Finally, I also have found a consistent practice of moving from lukewarm to cold showers every day has reduced the flare up frequency and trains the body to accept cold better. That last item could be risky so please be cautious and DO NOT do that while experiencing active or recent symptoms. It has seemed to make a difference for me however. I can almost SENSE a flare up happening, and know that I simply have to deal with it for a few days until it goes away hopefully for a year or so. There may also be a stress/anxiety factor at play, but unsure. Also, last but not least, consistent exercise helps. Again, be well, be safe, let me know if you have any questions or thoughts.", "Cold urticaria or something else? I get hives from cold weather. They appear only on my face. The wheals (each wheal) last for 2-3 days. Usually everyone says their wheals last for less than an hour? Yeh, mine lasts until I warm up again and then they go away. Not sure if it is possible for them to last for days. Same mine last for about half an hour to an hour until it starts to settle. Maybe see a doctor for your symptoms, always good for a check up. Mine usually goes away within an hour. There are other more rare types of cold urticaria where hives can stay for days. \n\nThere are also other conditions that are responses to cold. Definitely recommend talking to a doctor. We have the same exact condition, but Idk how I got it. I started noticing 2 years ago one time i left my house to go to school and it was windy(not that cold since i left without a jacket) but of course on my way back home i started shivering a bit then my arms started itching i looked at it and I was covered in bumps. What are the rare types? Thanks for the answer :) Btw i have had this for like 15 years atleast familial urticaria is more rare", "When it is 72 and sunny, but also windy \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f  Yeah !

Red spots, then swelling, and they just got worse as I scratched.\n\nI had an ear infection in 2018 and developed a fever which threw off my temperature and I developed the same rash. This is the only other especially severe time I remember getting it - I am not 100% certain I experienced it at all during that year gap until the infection.\n\nSince, it is been induced by air conditioners, and seemingly just the cold? I do not get it all the time when I feel cold, hell, sometimes I get it when I am warm in many layers with a heater on. But it is evolved from those little red spots to proper hives - angry, red, and spreading with scratching.\n\nI seem to develop two versions, sometimes simultaneously- pink itchy patches, that I know if I scratch will turn into hives, or already just\u2026hives, that are not itchy unless I actively scratch them but I can ignore so long as I do not touch them (these also usually stay for hours, slowly fading until they go).\n\nI just\u2026I hope someone can help me fix this. It is so incredibly inconvenient and I feel like I have tried everything I can to fix it and nothing is working. Why did I develop this so randomly and why is it worsening?\n\nI feel like I have lost hope. I already have anxiety and it is infuriating to constantly fear every time I go out, especially at night: \u2018what if I get cold? What if I get hives?\u2019 I am 19, I feel like I cannot enjoy being young if I am constantly afraid.\n\nThank you so much for reading this through if you have gotten this far and I would appreciate any advice at all that you can provide \ud83d\udc9b You can use ice cube on arm to test for CU. After 5 min, then you remove ice cube, if that spot has hive, then you got CU. \n\nTry vitamin D and avoid the beach. Eventually, you will notice there be no hive. My CU went away after a while. I did not do anything special. \n\nKeep your head up. Get out more and enjoy the sun. Just sitting at a park for half hour will help you physically and mentally. Definitely try the ice cube test; I cannot tell if it is CU or if it seems to be stress-induced. I have severe anxiety and health-induced anxiety (it is a nicer way of saying I am a hypochondriac lol) and anxiety can absolutely manifest in physical ways so it is worth doing the test so you can narrow it down. If it is CU, try taking a good allergy medicine about an hour before going out. I take one every morning and that has been a game changer. I moved from a cold climate to a warm one but the CU has worsened (it is like it is adapted haha) so it is still really annoying, but you can work with it; always have layers (I keep a little bag on me with some leggings, a thin, long-sleeved thermal top, a warm hat, gloves, allergy meds, and an epi-pen). It sucks, but do not lose hope - you can totally live with it.  I tried the ice cube test twice now- once in the evening after taking an aerius in the morning (although I would gotten hives that day), and just now without any itchiness immediately or after the numb patch began to disappear (some tiny &lt;1cm sensitive welts but they were not itchy or hives/rash-like - perhaps just from the painful numbness of the ice?). Does this mean I do not have CU? Like I said, I do not develop hives every time I get cold, just sometimes (which is also why I am not sure if it is actually CU or something else). I take vit d supplements, and according to a recent blood test my levels are healthy \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Oh hey fellow hypochondriac!\n\nI am worried about taking antihistamines every morning in case they stop being effective after a while.

Even washing my hands in anything other that hot water will send me in to a reaction. I have not quite figured it out - because sometimes I break out more easily and sometimes when I think I will break out I do not. I asked my allergist about it a few months ago and according to her CU is very unpredictable and it can go either way in terms of severity without warning. Interesting!

I am always layering up the hats during winter. It is not too bad when I have my hair down but if it is up I have to wear a fuzzy headband. Once it hits the 30's I have to cover my ears all the time.

I need to scratch the itch!!!! Ugh, whyyyyyyyyy the butt! I am always scratching it, I look crazy! \nSo any helpful tips? Tomorrow I am planning on looking for some pants that will maybe be windproof, im thinking that will help. I just rush anytime I am outside. I do not do any fun activities outdoors.

I am not a doctor, but I had a very similar situation to you a few months ago! Thanks a lot! Will call up my GP. I take Rupal its a prescription strength antihistamines.   U should get an epi pen.    Ask for a referral to a allergy specialist that has/does work with CU.   Apparently you can just randomly get it and once you have it it does not go away.   Yours is sever enough that I would also consider the allergy shots... super expensive but it might be the only thing that helps.   It looks like what I get when it get to be 16 degrees Celsius or lower.  I was told that for mine long exposures to cold  could kill me, hence the epi.  And that like maybe half hour + in negative temperatures and consistent exposure during the period of time.  It happens when I sweat too, swears purposes is to cool your skin down so you  do not get a stroke etc while exercising etc.\n\nDo not put it off. Go see a doctor.

Yeah it is itchy also I forgot to mention that", "Is it mostly cold water? Okay so I am fairly new here. I have had CU since, I believe, the middle of June. It was first noticed when I was riding my bike home in the rain and it was pretty cold. My family pointed out the bumps on my face which had never been there before. Other situations later, which one of them was swimming in a cold pool while it was raining. Looked it up and then had a doctor tell me officially that it was CU. Something I have noticed is that I mostly react to cold water. While I still react to cold weather, for example, my ears will swell up, my fingers will swell, and my face will stiffen, I only really seem to get hives and bumps from cold water. Is this the case with other people? I get hives from touching cold tables and other cold things. Water makes it much worse for me. I even get hives getting out of the shower because of the change from hot water to a not as hot room. Cold surfaces against my skin and being submerged in cold water for me personally.\n\nHave not had any issues with cold air temp/wind yet. Cold water is a huge trigger for me, too. I was out walking on a cold, rainy day. My right hand was exposed to the cold and rain because I was carrying a bag and did not have gloves with me. When I got inside and started to warm up, my hand was extremely itchy, bright red, and began to swell. That is what made me go to the doctor and I was officially diagnosed.  I used to love to swim but I have not been in a pool in over 5 years because I am too afraid it will cause a reaction.", "I have had cold urticaria my entire life and I am now in my 30s &amp;#x200B;\n\n(\n\nMan...what took me so long to discover Reddit. I honestly felt so alone until I discovered Reddit and found people who experience the same things I experience. I apologize for this extremely long rant, but it is such a relief to know that I am not alone in this! I have read so many of your posts and I just wanted to share what it has been like for me living with CU.\n\nI also have cold urticaria. I had it my entire life, I am in my early 30s now. It is such an uncommon allergy, so I had no idea I had it when I was really young. I just knew I was itchy a lot. Even in elementary school, during PE, I would break out in hives \u2014 swollen, itchy, red, bumpy. I justified this was normal because everyone else would at least turn red during physical activities.\n\nI continued life thinking it was completely normal to be itchy nearly everyday. Even on the days when my K-12 teachers would turn on the AC to \u201ckeep us awake\u201d, despite knowing that I felt like I was going to pass out from the cold. I would literally get so dizzy that I would be light-headed for the next few days. But again, I assumed it was normal and everyone experienced this.\n\nIt was not until I was in high school when a family member brought up that I was probably allergic to the cold. I Googled it and sure enough, there were articles on cold urticaria. I had it confirmed by a dermatologist. I felt a lot of relief when I was able to put a label on what I was experiencing, but also really sad that I lived with this for nearly 18 years of my life at that point, thinking that was normal life (maybe ignorance is bliss though?).\n\nFor me, my cold urticaria starts on my butt (what a lovely sight to imagine\u2026but boy does suck to not be able to scratch your butt in public!), knees, hands, then elbows, then legs, arms, face, stomach. As silly as it sounds, I hated that I missed out on being able to wear shorts, skirts, or dresses because the symptoms are so unattractive, and it makes people think I am diseased and contagious or just plain disgusting/repulsive.\n\nWhen I started working after college, it was hard. I have worked at a few companies where the building is maintained 70-72F, which is far too cold for me. I am a software engineer so being able to type is important, but if it is cold, my hives take over my hands to the point that I cannot move them. Not to mention the dizziness and shortness of breath I experience. Even after several discussions with HR, they would not budge on allowing me to have a heater (at my own expense), they would not allow me to WFH b/c I do not have a family (really strange rule), and they said the building\u2019s temperature cannot be changed because the building is fixed at 70-72F (/shrug). At one point they had me work in a tiny tiny tiny closet, thinking it would help, but it did not because there was a vent that blew directly in there \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.\n\nMost of the time, people do not believe me, so I totally get that frustration that so many of you have mentioned. Even with family, co-workers, friends, etc. I am very honest about the fact that I am allergic to the cold, and most people just assume I am being a \u201cprincess\u201d about it or I am making it up to get special treatment (trust me, the last thing I want is special treatment or any form of attention). Or they think I just do not like the cold (?????). I have overheard coworkers ask each other, \u201cWhat is wrong with her?\u201d \u201cShe does not like the cold or something.\u201d as I am about to pass out from the cold. And it is so belittling and frustrating to hear those comments. \n\nMy dating life sucks too. When I go on dates, I will bring this up and despite this, the guys I go out with will insist on walking outside at 2am in the freezing cold because they \u201cenjoy the cold air\u201d or they need to vape or smoke. Once it got so bad my lips swelled to 3 times their size, and not even in the popular-Kylie-Jenner-esque style\u2026it was just unevenly swollen and HUGE, and it lasted for 3 days. I could barely drink or talk normally because I could not close my lips. I had to take 3 days off work because it was so humiliating and I just also felt so lethargic for the next few days. I have also dated people who were upset at me because I did not want to go swimming, skiing or snowboarding or travel to areas that snow. So even dating is hard and nearly impossible. To be clear, I have never requested that my previous partners not go swimming/skiing/snowboarding/etc, it is just something I cannot partake in. \n\nI do try my best to be as \u201cnormal\u201d as possible. I just try to suck it up and fit in. The majority of people do not know/realize or believe it until they go on a hike with me and question what is wrong with my skin when I do break out.\n\nBut there are times I cannot just let it go and be \u201cnormal\u201d. If I am at work and I cannot type, I have to speak up because I cannot get my work done. If I am out with people who are very inconsiderate of my allergies, eventually I just cut them out of my life. It sucks to feel like this and to know that so much of my life is controlled by this allergy. \n\nI once read that people eventually grow out of this but I have basically lost hope. I have had it for over 30 years. I have tried every allergy medication out there and none of them help. I tried different ones consistently nonstop for months (at the suggestion of my doctor), and I have also just tried them before going into an environment that I know will be cold, and I have also tried them right on the onset and after onset of hives. None of it has ever worked for me. I have seen mental health therapists for the mental toll it has taken on me, but unfortunately, they are human\u2026it is not something they are familiar with so they give the generic, \u201cRather than focus on your allergy, why not focus on all the good things in your life.\u201d Lady\u2026cold allergies are my life. \n\nOh, and I am also allergic to my own sweat (I get rashes, not hives from my sweat)\u2026so people who tell me I should just bundle up\u2026I am sorry\u2026that is not going to work. I would not mind living in a temperature-controlled bubble. Hello! I know you said you tried allergy meds, did you try xolair?\n Have cold urticaria and cholinergic\n (what you said about sweat) and this is the only thing that significantly helped. Thank you for sharing your story!! Dude boys who do not understand &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;\n\nI am so sorry! CU is very very real and can be very very frustrating, especially when it is so un-talked about. Sorry for ur past experiences, ur not alone at all! Your s reactions seem pretty severe. Has your doctor suggested allergy shots? It probably will not solve your problems, but it may decrease the severity. My dermatologist told me that it is a very high histamine allergy and to take double the dose of benedryl. \n\nIf it is affecting your life this much and your doctors and therapists are not listening to you get new ones. Also people who cannot be empathetic to your body\u2019s limitations are assholes and are not worth it to have as friends. One of my many doctors recommended the shit. She said that she had people with CU who were going to college in places like Boston where it can be very cold and it helped them a lot. \n\nI live in an area that is not super cold ever, but it never really gets warm, so I get a rash basically every time I wash my hands. Even with my symptoms not being that bad, I do have to plan my life around it. I was close to deciding to do it, but then Covid hit and I do not really go anywhere anymore, so I have not. It requires going to the doctor\u2019s office once a month.\n\nGet new doctors, it does not matter if you go through 10 different doctors, you are not getting the help you need. I tend to pick female doctors because at least for me they tend to listen more. \n\nBefore you have your appointment write down the things you want them to know. Let them know that other doctors have not listened to how much this affects your physical and mental health, and that you need their help to get some relief. You have missed out on a lot and have been extremely uncomfortable because of it. It is so hard to advocate for yourself, but you can do it. Do the same with the therapist. Hope it does work for you. Was a massive relief for me How do you even find a doctor who has actual experience with patients with CU??? All of my doctors just say something along the lines of, *\"I have heard/read of this allergy but never met someone in real life with it.\"* \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nI will definitely check with an allergist once this pandemic is over, thanks!\n\nDefinitely agree with you on female doctors. They are, on average, less dismissive than male doctors, in my personal experience.\n\nIt is super difficult to get a doctor who listens. I have had doctors just prescribe drugs to me that made my situation so much worse and the only thing they reply with is, \"This is the only available treatment.\" \ud83e\udd2c I get that doctors deal with a lot of patients who over-dramaticize their symptoms, so I kind of understand why none of them take my concerns seriously, but it is frustrating. As for therapists...I feel like they often want patients to \"pretend\" that things are okay, and I guess that is what mental health is...pretending that things are okay even if they are not. /shrug I would see an allergist, they should be able to help you more than anyone. \n\nIf your therapists make you feel like you need to pretend that everything is okay, then you have never had a therapists that was a good fit for you. Hi. I am really happy to read your story. Today I discovered Reddit.. and I have been reading and reading.. I too have Cold Induced Urticaria. I have had it for 27 years and I am now 35 years old. Nobody knew what it was until I was 24 years old, however I knew the exact moment I got it. Absolutely everything you mentioned I have been through. I moved from Michigan to Arizona and it really does not matter much. I get hives going into doc offices, working out.. cold drinks (lips and throat swelling), etc etc etc. I take Xyzal and Zyrtec every day. Have you tried cutting foods high in histamine? Also histamine blocking foods. Basically that consists of anything fermented: pickles, wine anything aged: aged cheese, cottage cheese.. no left overs, no avocado, no chocolate, no tomatoes.. no lunch meat. It is a difficult lifestyle change but works great for people with CU. I carry 2 epi pens every where I go, I avoid putting myself in situations where I could possibly be cold. I get so annoyed when people say \u201coh I do not like the cold either\u201d.. ugh. My husband is a surgeon and had never heard about it before.. took a while before he started getting serious about it. All of my IV\u2019s have to go through a warmer. Every single night I give myself a shot (non related) but without fail ALWAYS break out in hives.. usually not even only at the injection site. Even the alcohol swab is too cold for me. I do leave the soliton out so it is room temp, I even will set it in hot water for a few seconds..  nothing helps. I take photos every time I break out and write what made me break out, how long it took me to get a hive, and how long it took to go back to normal. I too get them on my butt first. But also knuckles, knees, elbows etc. This lives with me day to day and it is very taxing. I am seeing these things come up on my 6 year old.. I really hope I did not pass this to her.

You are definitely not alone, but that does not mean people will not look at you like your crazy when you try to explain this allergy you have. I have had Cold Urticaria Syndrome since I was 7, and am now 50. I do not mean to sound dramatic, but I am about to anyway. You absolutely need to see an allergy Dr. as soon as you can get in. If your first reaction was this extreme, it is essential that you carry an Epi-Pen and where a Medic Alert bracelet. This allergy is manageable but also life-altering and can be life-threatening, as you know. If I drink a cold drink, it will make me cough and if I hold a cold glass, I will have a reaction on that hand. I cannot go into any body of water and I have some level of reaction with every shower, bath, and anytime I sweat. The amount of time I can spend comfortably in any location is based on countless variables. Windy or breezy, cloudy or sunny, humid or dry. I can be out in the 85-degree sunshine, begin to sweat from the heat, and as soon as a slight cool breeze hits me, I will develop hives. With time, you will learn your limits of exposure. An Allergist will able to shed some light on your limitations as well, but honestly, I have not had much luck in finding one that truly gets it. It seems to be just rare enough to not warrant many studies. I am just speculating on that though. Please feel open to ask any other questions. It can be very isolating, to say the least. But it is also doable, and that is what you need to focus on.", "J and J vaccine? Anyone take the j and j vaccine? How was it? Should we worry about side effects for CU?

I had Moderna, but have multiple patients old and young with plenty of health issues and they have all been fine with J&amp;J. If you have the opportunity to get vaccinated, my advise is to take it. My CU did not act up at all with Moderna, I have had both jabs. Is it cold? I took pfizer and had no problems due to CU. First shot mild pain in arm. Second shot pain in arm and I was really tired next day then I was fine.

Obviously was sceptical and found it odd, but figured it is worth a try since a can of that was the same price as antihistamines for a month.\n\nI took a teaspoon every day, although the first few days I took less and would immediate get stuffed up. After a week or so I was not getting stuffed up at all.\n\nAnyways, after a while I noticed my pollen allergies were not hitting me as I am sitting in parks.\n\nThe crazy thing though was that I noticed at night biking with a t shirt, I did not get any hives on my skin as I usually did from the wind. Also afterwards from sweating I would normally be covered in hives after taking off my shirt (from my sweat turning cold)... and that too no longer happened, just a bit of redness.\n\nI just put ice on two parts of my arm for 5 minutes, and no hives! Not to jinx it but my CU has definitely become much more mild to say the least from the teaspoon of bee pollen that I have been taking every day since March. There has been no other lifestyle changes or otherwise that I am conscious of, so I can say the cause must be the pollen. Makes sense since it is all just my immune system over responding.\n\nJust wanted to share to see if anyone else had considered this or has any thoughts. damn im going to try this for sure. where did you find pollen? at a local store or? Yeah just a local health store. Like the one I got is frozen and from just the town over.", "Any advice for an upcoming derm visit? Hello friends,\n\nI have been dealing with what I believe is CU for a few years. I live in a cold climate and I have symptoms all year round, even in summer if its windy outside. I first saw my GP who suspected Reynaud's and referred me to a dermatologist. The waitlist has been LONG but the appointment is coming up soon. I have pictures of some of my hives I plan to show. The ice cube test left a massive welt. Can anyone offer any advice on questions to ask or what I can expect on this visit? I want to make sure I am prepared. \n\nThanks and stay warm out there! I was officially diagnosed when I was in middle school, but I have had it since I was born. (I am in my 30s now) \n\nBut when I was diagnosed and even during my more recent dr/dermatologist appointments, whenever I asked if there is anything that can be done, they just suggest allergy pills (that do not work) and then fallback to, \u201cit looks like you will just need to find a way to stay warm\u201d. So it is possible that is all your dermatologist will tell you. \n\nBut from other Redditors, they have mentioned that a drug named Xolair is promising and maybe look into allergy shots (for desensitization). So consider asking your doctor about those two treatments. \n\nAlso keep in mind that a lot of doctors do not know or believe cold urticaria is a real allergy so you may want to be prepared to be adamant about your concerns. What kind of allergy shots would potentially desensitize to cold? I already did over 7 years of allergy desensitization, but I am willing to go back if they can do something for CU. I do not actually know. I do not know if there is actually an allergy shot for CU, as allergy shots are essentially a tiny injection of the allergen, on a scheduled basis until the patient is reasonably desensitized. I do not know how cold could be injected, but this is my very basic understanding of allergy shots. It was brought up to me here: (\n\nXolair was brought up to me here: ( There is some promising research on the effectiveness of Xolair on CU: ( A warning, though this is late, that Xolair is expensive and hard to get. I am a lot like thewldflwrs, in which I was born with cold urticaria and nothing helps it. I have a monthly Xolair shot and it was the most difficult insurance red tape I had to forcibly cut through (It is covered and I still get 80% red tape when shipping it in!). My doctor had to reach out and technically lie on my medical records for my insurance to consider approving it. They only give Xolair to people with severe asthma, or people with Idiopathic Urticaria (my doctor took the idiopathic route by honing in on my rare occasions of random hives). You have to have a great insurance for the $1,188 shot to be covered, and I take two each month. I am so lucky I do not have to pay a copay anymore. I heard for some Xolair is like a miracle drug. For me, it basically gives me extra time (around 10 minutes) to get out of a bad situation. 10 minutes is not a lot, but I would rather not be shipped to the ER again to be stuck with a cold IV when I am already in shock. That time not blacking out goes a long way when those few minutes can be spent moving somewhere warm.\n\nOther than that, to the op: The doctor will likely not believe you. My mother spent Too Much on me when I was young because the doctor we went to refused diagnosis unless we tried for tuberculosis (the test for it broke me out). My later childhood doctors treated me like an interesting specimen, and if you are not comfortable with doll treatment and pictures, call them out on it. Even my most recent and best doctor does not believe half of the stuff I tell him. It is great that you took pictures, though! It is really good to start a CU journal of your experience. Write down bad days, what happens, etc. It does not have to be much, but that little book can go a long way with doctors in my experience. I otherwise recommend being adamant about having CU, and go in there expecting issues. At the worst, you will have to see a different doctor. At the best, the specialist has already had Urticaria patients and understands the struggle.

", "Possible Cold Urticaria Diagnosis Hello everyone,\n\nFor the last seven years I have had on and off weird reactions with the cold. This included facial swelling when warming up too fast from the cold a long with swelling of the hands. I did get itchy from time to time but I cannot say if that was for sure related to the cold. On ONE occasion I felt like my throat was tightening after drinking a frozen cappuccino BUT I do have issues with anxiety attacks so it is very possible it was an anxiety attack as I was constantly drinking frozen cappuccinos not long after that initial incident with no issue. Also these symptoms were for the most part rare and I mostly did not experience anything at all. I estimated I dealt with this 3% of the time the last 7 years. I also have not had any of these symptoms for about two years although I still do get random hives and rashes and odd sensations but I am not sure if I can pinpoint the cold as a cause. \n\nFor most of that time I did not even think about it and it did not effect me whatsoever. Until about a year and a half ago I was scared I had this condition and I have had extreme anxiety over it ever since. I went to an allergist about 6 months ago and they did an ice cube test and all that happened was it was red and cold to the touch but no itching or swelling which they deemed to be a negative test. They also did lab work and it came back negative. For some odd reason I still cannot shake the feeling that something is wrong. \n\nI have developed debilitating anxiety over it as I am afraid to drink cold things or indulge in the cold in any way for the past year or so. I am seeing a psychologist and hopefully that will help. I was wondering if anyone has any advice for me when it comes to my anxietys over this condition, also if there is a way I can 100% figure out what is going on if anything is going on at all. It would be much appreciated. Hi :) sorry for the long reply &gt;.&lt; my \u2018journey\u2019 of cold urticaria started quite similarly to yours. I had very on and off reactions for most of my early and mid teenage years. Much like yours it was swelling of my fingers, and my skin in general just turning a funny blue/red colour. But it really progressed in the last two years and I am now aged 20 and have more severe reactions. I also understand how scary that is to have your throat go tight like that and feeling so out of control. I have another allergy-esk condition that has led to that and it is terrifying so I feel your anxiety over it. My cold urticaria can lead to my gums and tongue going incredibly itchy and swelling when I consume cold food. It can be distressing. But the great thing is you have found what causes you to react! You know what to avoid or try your best to. Funnily enough I also get very bad reactions when I warm up too quickly from being cold. To help with your anxiety I would suggest you carry around anti-histamine tablets (hay fever tablets); hives and swelling are caused by an over production of histamine and whilst it is the cold that causes this and ultimately you need to remove that to stop it from happening, anti-histamines will seriously help with the swelling especially your anxiety of a closing throat. The great thing is you cannot overdose on them so when I feel my throat is getting tight I tend to take at least 3-4 and within 10 minutes it already feels better. They can be a huge reassurance and make you feel safer. You can also enquire if you are truly debilitated by the anxiety, about getting epi-pens (I have them) and those are even more reassuring to me! I feel safe and relaxed knowing they will always save my life if my throat was to close up. I would suggest keeping some sort of journal of your reactions, just Incase this is something that continues and worsens and you have evidence to show your doctor. Unfortunately cold urticaria is something people grow in and out of and has no cure.

You cannot really guarantee when that egg is going to do it is thing and 2. I guess I would rather be alive than pregnant. \u2026. Any success stories? I have had 3 healthy babies while on Zyrtec and breastfed each of them on Zyrtec as well. My OB said they are considered safe since I was just taking the dosage on the label.  Not sure if it makes a difference by my CU is less severe than yours (I just need an OTC antihistamine, no Epi pen). Good luck, the first 2 took almost a year each to conceive so I know it can be a long, sometimes frustrating, time! Thank you for your reply. Yes- very frustrating! But hopeful to hear that you conceived on Zyrtec. Fewer babies here (just one!) but also successful - though via IVF so my experience is not specifically about conceiving but pregnancy was fine - I went with as little medication as I could, but IVF sent my urticaria crazy so it was a bit tough at the start. I was lucky enough that the urticaria calmed right down during the second tri. Still, I was advised to have a hospital birth (i.e. not a home birth or midwife led centre). All was absolutely fine though. Best of luck.", "What medication works for you? I am going to have to take medication for my work. I work in -20 Celsius outside and I do not really break out in hives I get red wherever gets cold I have got hives before but it is rare, but lifting heavy stuff outside makes it hard for me to breathe for like 20 minutes. ", "I have Google diagnosed myself (I am going to ask a Dr) I am 35 and have noticed this summer it is now affecting my hands while holding a cold drink and maybe when I drink cold stuff.  Basically I am wondering for those that are affected by cold drinks, what does it feel like? I had a SUPER mild case of covid a few weeks ago so idk if it is from that but my chest will feel funny like I have to constantly clear my throat whenever I have a cold drink with ice. Ugh that looks like the worst :/ generally cold drinks do not trigger my CU personally ? CU typically is just an itchy and sore exterior and does not really cause any internal discomfort, but I mean I am not a doctor. Best of luck figuring that out tho that looks like a nightmare I have pretty severe cold urticaria now ( it was mild 10 years ago and has gotten worse ) I have not had it whole drinking a cold drink but my hands breakout when holding anything cold. \n\nI have had an oral reaction when eating ice cold foods. \nThis year I was eating watermelon that was very cold and my lips were tingling and hurting and so was the roof of my mouth. \n\nYou should avoid it if you are having that reaction or make sure to have an epipen handy as you may have a severe reaction to a cold drink and it could be dangerous. These were the only 2 times I have had reactions like this bad. I forgot to layer up yesterday while shovelling the snow. The weird chest feeling is new so idk if it is a coincidence or not. I am going to keep track of that now, my lips/mouth randomly get a bit swollen and itchy but I never make the connection with cold stuff. I have gotten a few super mild food allergies since having my daughter 15 years ago, plus random allergies that make my ears and pallet itchy. Now I wonder if cold does that... It varies each time, usually not an issue, but at its worst with a really cold drink or like an otter pop, my son's fingers swell so he cannot bend them and sometimes it triggers a throat tickle which triggers a cough which then triggers his asthma. We use neoprene sleeves and double wall insulated cups now, but he is got to drink room temp or warm water while eating anything cold if he starts feeling any kind of tickle in his mouth.\n\nI will add that our allergist said that these more serious reactions are likely happening when his \"allergic cup\" is filled or overflowing - so if environmental allergens are high, or he is coming down with a cold, or anything where his immune system is already in hyperdrive, then his other immune system reactions are likely to also be more of an issue. Could be that you are experiencing more sensitivity because your immune system is still working hard on Covid related recovery. Ohh that makes a lot of sense. We also just moved and the previous people had a cat, my allergies were bugging me until we cleaned the filters then covid hit. I will just avoid cold drinks and other triggers for awhile I guess. I tried treating it naturally and with diet but eventually had to resort to taking Allegra. It is helps quite a bit, but not 100%. Stay bundled up! And be careful with cold drinks, they can cause your throat to swell up. \n\nEdit: I thought I was in r/askdoctors or whatever it is called lol. Shew, I am having such a hard time with formatting replies tonight! I get a tickle in my throat and me lips and tongue itch and burn when drinking cold drinks. My fingers swell painfully from holding cold drinks. Thanks, I love Allegra D, it is the only thing that helps with my itchy ears and itchy palate. I have not had a reaction like this for quite awhile though but I forgot to layer up. If you have the chance to get a food/ environmental test and ask about the cold allergy too I think it will be beneficial. I know not everyone has great insurance ( if you are in the US. I have always had shitty insurance but just got a great plan )\n\nI just got mine done and I knew of some allergies such as an oral pollen allergy and most trees/ grass. I did not know I was allergic to carrots and almonds. \nSo now I am more aware of it so I do not accidentally eat something that can be dangerous for me. That is a good idea, I live in Canada so it is free just a long waiting list. I am not so sure if this looks like CU to me (not a doctor, just a sufferer) as what I have personally, and what I see with others is usually more bigger hives, these look quite small... more like a rash?\n\nLike another comment I think it may have something due to you have COVID and it is still your immune system fighting something! \n\nWhatever it is, I hope you are doing well otherwise and find relief! For me it is really itchy and burns as if you put your hand on a stove and kept it there The first pic if from almost 4 years ago, there was no covid back then.", "Worst Reaction? Hi all. I have had CU for about 8 years now, but about a few months ago, I had my first full anaphylactic attack from CU. I have went into anaphylaxis previously as I also have a severe tree nut allergy. \n\nAnyways, my anaphylaxis with CU proved to be completely different from my tree nut accident. The tree nut allergy just immediately made my throat close, and then my whole face swelled up. Standard stuff. But with CU, my experience was different. \n\nI went swimming in a lake with friends and it was a pleasant 70ish degrees out. At first I was not going too but the water did not seem much colder, so I got in. Eventually I started getting itchy feet (get that daily anyways from CU), but then I started getting hives on my back so I got out. I started going up the stairs to go back into the lakehouse and I forgot where I was going. Full on confusion. Then as I remembered where I was and my vision started to black out. I was only out for a minute or two but when My buddies ran out to get me up I felt that my throat was starting to swell. I struggled to remain conscious until the ambulance arrived. And then it is a standard anaphylactic story. Point is, anyone else black out/suffer confusion from CU? Or have a horror story? \n\nProbably one of the scariest days of my life so far. I did not think I was going to wake up again haha.

So for the longest time I just assumed that it was what everyone experienced and that it was just what being cold felt like. IK yikes but this is seriously a whole revelation for me and I am looking back to every singe time I have gone outside and never thought this was not what everyone felt. i totally relate!! my skin also gets super swollen when i am in the cold. i remember, as a kid, telling my mom about how i hated when my ears got puffy from the cold and she had no idea what i meant. i just assumed that happened to everyone...

Has anyone else also been diagnosed with any kind of thyroid issue after your cold urticaria diagnosis? Maybe this is a long shot, but my sister (who suffers from an autoimmune disease) has recently had a problem with her thyroid and in doing some research found that \"cold intolerance\" can be a symptom of a dysfunctional thyroid. Has anyone else found any links between thyroid and CU? Actually yeah , my mum has a thyroid problem and the same allergy that I do , I got my thyroid tested , no result yet I have had CU for years, only recently got it diagnosed. It is been increasingly worse through the years, but I was tested for thyroid three years ago and it came back negative. My mother has hashimoto's thyroiditis. I believe that cold urticaria and autoimmune disorders do have a relation. For those who have had your thyroid tested already, it may have just not presented itself yet. They can lie dormant until you either have a traumatic event, exposure to radiation, or birth (yeah birth can make your thyroid disease activate) which kind of sucks. So I would suggest getting tested again, just because that one TSH test does not define if you will ever have it in the future. Yes. I have Hashimoto's and have CU. I have had autoimmune disorder, allergies, eczema and colitis since I was young, but never CU. When I turned 43 I was diagnosed with CU. It was right after I was stung by a giant wasp. I have had CU ever since for over 5 years now. I try to control my histamine level by diet (KETO) and my CU outbreaks have gone down.

This feels like a dumb question but I feel like when I go in to cold weather but cold pools especially I shiver way more than normal. Like there was this one time that I was in the pool with my sister but it was too cold for me. My allergy isnt really too bad in the sense that everything so far is just external. So I tried to tough it out. I could feel the fact that my body was going to be covered in hives but that wasnt really going to be a problem until I got out and we were trying to clean the pool so I wanted to help her. But I was shivering really violently when she wasnt shivering at all. Like it was causing really bad twitches. I dunno if this was just one of those times where you just are cold but your friends arent or if this is because of cold urticaria. Have any of you had any similar experiences? Yup, other people may be fine, but that is hypothermia but it can turn into an episode-pen situation, (have not experienced an epi-pen myself). I have had hypothermia several times in my life when other people were perfectly fine. Unfortunately, that means you can not swim in cold water. \n\nIf you are getting hives while you are in the water, you need to get out. One specific time I thought I would be fine, it was not. Luckily I decided to get out a few minutes later I was conscious but could not see for a few minutes and could not hold up my head.\n\nIt is one thing if you get out of warm water and it is chilly so you get a rash or hives as your warming up, but our bodies do not react well to cold water and it is much more likely to drop your entire body\u2019s temperature. Just going off of personal experience..... my kids make fun of me because when it gets really cold, sometimes I am shivering so much that I cannot barely talk without my mouth tightening up it is weird.

Anything i should know or any tips would be great. Ok that is a loaded question. So, your sweat cooling on your skin will almost certainly cause a reaction. Be careful of the temp where you workout. The colder it is and the sweatier you are the more dangerous it can be. If it is cold in your gym I would wear layers and have a towel to wipe your sweat. Over time you will figure out how far you can push it. I avoid taking showers when I have just worked out because my internal heat mixed with the cool air when I get out has caused the beginning of anaphylaxis for me. Everyone is different.

That is how mine started (only bad in winter) but it has since worsened  and now I can get hives even on a blustery 70 degree day, from the wind hitting my skin.  I take Zyrtec every day and that takes care of it. Yes mine is the same It is been pretty much the same for me.

For the past few months I have not been walking outside much (versus before, e.g. 2 hours most days, to once every two weeks) and my stress levels have risen, so for me there is another two factors at least, that to me feel as if they play a part in my CU.

I am currently in Chicago, so I assume it must have been the weather change? I recently graduated from navy boot camp but I never experienced hives even when it got cold... this is just worrying me more because I hope it does not interfere with my naval career. Cu can develop at any time, especially after some sort of sickness. Several people report having it after Covid. Depending on the severity, you might be able to just take some allergy medicine and bundle up more and be just fine.

I am a 14 year old who has no underline health conditions.However I notice that when I go out in the cold I start to get hives and when I go back inside I get an extreme amount on my legs,hands,and sometimes arms and stomach (it depends if im wearing something in that area).The areas with hives also get hot to the touch.I do not get hives when holding cold things or anything  like that ,just going out in cold weather.My mom does not seem to be concerned though so I do not know.I was wondering if I had cold urticaria or I just have extreme temp reactions as I sometimes get a few hives when I take a hot shower.I have always had sensitive skin so I do not know.Any thoughts would be appreciated. :) I started to get it when I was around your age, but it was not all at once, it got worse over time. For me it started with a rash when I went swimming in cool water, later I got hives and swelling. \n\nYou can always try the ice cube test on your arm to see if you have a reaction to it. Next time you go for a check up, make sure to bring it up to your doctor if your mom will not let you go exclusively for this issue. It might be CU or it might not, but you should get it checked out either way by a doctor. Hey twins, I was 14 as well when it first showed up. For me though we first noticed it on my face when I biked home in the rain. And yeah I agree with the other comment to try the ice cube thing and then when you next go to the doctor for a checkup just let them know. \n\nI dont know how much it will help but I can share my experience with cold weather in case you relate. See mine primarily shows up with cold water and touching cold things and not so much cold weather. But when I am out it the cold my fingers will swell up as well as my earlobes. My face gets little bumps on it as so do my thighs. Once I get back in to warmth my body feels really warm and kind of itchy. The bumps go away after like 30 minutes but the swelling stays for like an hour. Yea I already know that I usually get like one or two hives when I have an ice cube pressed to my skin. CU can come without warning.  And I started with just some hives on my fingers, now I have to have an epi pen with me at all times because I break out in hives when I sweat too, or when I get out of a warm shower and my skin starts to chill.  I get them outside in +25 degrees in the summer.   \n\nCU can get so bad it endangers your life (hence the epi)\n\nIt is a serious allergy, like those who are allergic to water, sun  it means a lifestyle change you have to be more aware how how the temperatures effect you and how you can help yourself,  like when getting them or feeling that itchy put on socks and other warm clothes like a sweater.   \n\nI have to wear mittens a winter hat, and sometimes a scarf in my own house because 20 degrees Celsius is just too cold for me. \n\nI also need to take prescription antihistamines because over the counter like Claritin or reaction just do not work for me anymore. \n\nI live in alberta Canada.   I have paid 45$ for the allergy tests. I specifically told them I wanted and need to be checked for CU. I went to a specialist that has dealt with CU patients before.   They usually put an icecube (or an ice pack) wait 5 mins and see if its just red cold or you are starting to form or have already hives.    My skin was red and itchy and I was forming a giant ice pack shaped hive.\n\nIf you have CU with it sounds like you  have a serious case(go see a general doctor and ask for a referral to an allergy specialist for Cold Urticaria,  pay the fee.) It is worth a little bit of money because if they say you do than depends on how bad they say it is you might need an epi pen and a prescription for antihistamines (i recommend Rupall. No not the drag queen. The meds).        You mother should take this more seriously.   I had to have surgery,  and if they had not given me medicine to keep my hives in check and give me extra blankets to keep me warm   I could have stopped breathing or had other serious complications if they had not known about my CU.\n\nGood luck.

If you can advocate for yourself find a grown up that you trust and would take you seriously to advocate on your behalf.", "my doctor told me today that she thinks i have cold urticaria. i had my first flare up yesterday after swimming in the ocean. i had red skin and hives/welts on my legs &amp; hip.does anyone know how common/rare anaphylaxis is from this? i have an epi pen but i am so scared to have a severe reaction.  my doctor said not to go in cold water. when fall turns into winter you will know at what temperature you will have an allergic reaction to. if you want to be extra safe you can bring a thermometer to test the degrees of the water you will be swimming in I got diagnosed a few weeks ago and my doctor said avoid large bodies of water, so naturally I went wakeboarding same day. Just be smart, I dipped my hand in for a few minutes and waited, and then dipped my arm in and waited before jumping in entirely. Antihistamine before swimming helps to slow down the reaction as well.\n\nEdit: if you react at all to the water when testing do not jump in, than can lead to shock. I have cold uticaria diagnosed after swimming in very cold beaches, and i also have an epipen for it. I was told that as long as I take allergy medicine either the night before or that morning before swimming, the epipen would just be there for precaution.\n\nSome key information for you as a person worried about anaphylaxis:\n\u2022do not swim in cold water alone\n\u2022do not swim for too long\n\u2022get your skin warm right after swimming\n\u2022be cautious but still live your life! My allergist told me to keep away from bodies of water outside, especially lakes and the sea, as it is not just anaphylaxis that can be dangerous, but also the lowering of blood pressure.  Apparently getting cold lowers blood pressure in the first place, but having an allergic reaction can also cause pressure to lower further, so going for a sudden dip in cold water can cause bad issues.  I do live in a country known for generally being a bit cooler though (current heatwave aside), so I think the advice was general rather than specific. I passed out getting out of the water at the beach. The water was a bit cold &amp; was fighting the waves trying to get out.\nMy family helped me out of the water, and took some minutes of laying under the sand to recover. A bit scary. I have pushed it a few times and got hypothermia along with the allergic reaction. It is not fun. I was a beach kid that grew up swimming in the Pacific Ocean, but now I basically can only stick my feet in the water. In the past 15 years I have only safely swam in Hawaii and the Caribbean.\n\nMy worst reaction I had it felt like I could not hold up my head and I could not see. My mom freaked out and would not let me lay down. I pushed my poor cancer patient mother off of me and laid down in some rocks and said mom it is okay I can see now! that is not fun at all:( sorry you had that experience. does this only happen when you go in water? like can you be in an air conditioned room or out in the winter? are you able to go into air conditioned rooms? drink or eat really cold things such as ice cream or an iced coffee? this is all new to me and i am scared of any sort of cold. my doctor just told me i can try these things but i am worried to. i am terrified to be cold \ud83e\udd72 does lowering of blood pressure and bad reactions only happen when you go into cold water? i am trying to find out if i will be okay to be in rooms with AC or drink iced drinks or eat ice cream. without having a reaction You have every right to be scared but at the same time this should not be very life threatening at all. Conditioned rooms should not affect you because personally I can only get cold urticaria from cold air if it is colder than 40 with wind, and a conditioned room is usually not colder than 50-60 degrees and does not have wind chill. I can drink iced things and really cold water. You just have to try things out and figure out if your version of the condition is purely external (hives on skin) or combined with internal (itchy mouth or throat or anaphylaxis). The latter is so rare with this condition and ive heard it only happens when you literally jump in ice cold water (think the freezing beaches of the east coast that can be like less than 50-60 degrees or colder). I still eat icecream! Being cold is a natural response and unless you are in freezing temperatures for an extended amount of time where you cannot warm up easily, you will be fine! If you live somewhere with moderately rough winters like me, usually my exposed skin that is not easily covered (like my face or hands if I am not wearing gloves) will get that hivey reaction. \n\nI promise you do not have to be scared of being cold. Live your life as normally as possible while just having some precaution! I live in California so my weather is never too extreme. I have also had bad reactions in the snow, but I was a dumbass playing in waist deep snow wearing jeans not snow pants. \n\nWater tends to be a catalyst, and cool water makes it worse. I have small reactions almost every time I wash my hands. I break out in hives or get a rash all the time, but bad reactions tend to be because I am in a cooler body of water. I have been out in 115 degree weather but because the water was very cold I still got hives but no hypothermia. \n\nIt is best to never swim alone and to test the water for a few minutes before putting your whole body in.\n\nAir conditioning can be okay sometimes other times not. It depends on how direct the airflow is. I do get somewhat acclimated and more tolerant over time, but if I am on a hot place and then go back to the cold of the Bay Area, my tolerance for cold depletes. thank you so so much, this is a huge anxiety reliever. i have had a cold drink from the fridge and nothing has happened! so i am not sure if that means i can have frozen stuff (ie. popsicles?) sorry if this is a dumb question. but does every reaction have to have the hives with it likeeee is it possible to have a reaction and do not know it? from you experience. also, if i do not have the kind where it effects my throat or mouth after having something iced, does that mean i will not get anaphylaxis if it is just the skin reaction? sorry for all the questions. you are so kind to reply to me i am general. i appreciate your responses!! Hi!! Do not apologize at all. I was going frantic when I found out about this a year and a half ago. Yes, even when your only reaction is hives, you will always have a risk of anaphylaxis but it is a low one unless you shock your body by like jumping into freezing water. Popsicles and frozen food should not be an issue mostly because the inside of your mouth is warmer than the outside of your body. Im no scientist but that is my take on the risk of frozen foods. Just try things little by little and see how it works! thank you so so so much. you are a life saver! I was finally diagnosed w cold urticaria after a full year of having hives and not realizing why. I had never had hives in my life or any type of skin issues. My diagnosis came after swimming in a cold pool and I became very dizzy, overly tired, and my heart was racing. My whole body was covered in hives (mostly the fatty parts, like thighs and stomach). I felt itchy, but didnt notice the hives til I got out of the pool from feeling so unwell. That resulted in an E.R. trip, but I was not yet going into shock. So they only gave me super strength benadryl, no epi. That doctor was the first one that mentioned to me it was possible to be allergic to cold. That was 13 years ago. I would take 180mg daily of Fexofenadine to keep hives at bay. I had  a very low threshold...I would break out if an indoor or outdoor room temp was below 70 degrees. Pretty much anytime the skin felt slightly cool to the touch resulted in hives. I would get hives walking from my car into my office in winter (Chicago). I would get hives after sweating and then cooling down after exercise. I would get hives just existing in a classroom or office that wasnt over 70 degrees. I would get hives from everything. It was miserable. I was an anxious mess for years always worrying about anaphylaxis.  Or worried about my car breaking down while traveling alone during winter or snow storms. But anaphylaxis never happened to me from any normal events. I even shovel/snowblow my driveway in zero degree weather, but I wear layers and immediately soak in hot bath plus drink hot coffee when coming inside. I eat ice cream, I just make sure to chase each bite with a warm coffee. But I NEVER would swim in cold water after my diagnosis. There is no way I can ever swim in lake Michigan again. However, I have been able to swim in the Gulf during summer when water is warm enough and I made sure to install a heater for my pool when I had it built :). I strongly recommend you follow instructions and avoid the cold water. The reason the water is the biggest risk is because a large portion of your body is exposed all at once and the histamine release for a full body reaction could overwhelm your system. If you start feeling dizzy, heart racing, or weak/tired, you are pushing your limits I think. So I would not push the limits of swimming in cold water since I nearly went into shock, but dont fear anaphylaxis from normal activities. Just prepare, wear layers, buy warm coats, keep a blanket/hand warmers in your car, etc. P.s. By some magical twist of fate, 13 years later, my urticaria has subsided substantially. I was eating so much cleaner during lockdown, plus started taking vitamin C daily along w a multivitamin. And I stopped eating meat. No clue what really made the difference, but I can tolerate cold much better now and barely even think about my condition anymore. I no longer take Allegra daily either. I might get hives 2 times a year now as opposed to 4 times daily when I was first diagnosed. thank you so much for your response. i am so happy for you, that it is gotten better!! :) \nwhen you had your first flare up, did you JUST have hives on your thighs and stomach or were they everywhere just more so in those areas? my body was fully in water and i only got hives on my legs/top of my thighs and hips and 1 or 2 on my arms. but i also applied sunscreen to my legs and arms and i think my hips before getting into salt water. i did not apply any sunscreen to my back, breast/chest area and and i also has those in the water and did not get red or hives on those areas. i am thinking i may have been misdiagnosed but i am not sure because when i put an ice cube on my arm or leg for a few minutes to do a test, nothing happens. no hives, just redness from the cold ice like normal. i think i may have had a neutrogena sunscreen/salt water reaction? i used the sunscreen before but it was my first time wearing that sunscreen in an ocean. The pool incident was not my first reaction/flare up. It was just the thing that sent me to the ER where a doctor finally realized what was going on. My whole entire body was in the water for over an hour, but the hives were very concentrated mostly to fatty areas like stomach and upper thighs, maybe a couple on backs of arm. Those are still the areas where Id get hives today even if my whole body was cold. It is weird, it is like certain areas are more sensitive or prone to it. I will also get some on backs of my biceps and near elbows, but really no where else on my arms. And I dont think ever on my shins or calves or anywhere on my back. And Im sure it is different for everyone. You can test again by maybe putting coldish water in tub and just try with your one leg or something. Dont get your whole body in there! Just see if your leg gets the hives. If that was the same spot you put the lotion, you could be misdiagnosed. But based on what you described, it could also still be cold urticaria even if it was just certain body parts. It is just weird that way. oh my bad! i am sorry i misunderstood. i am really sorry that happened to you :( i did what you recommend but i just used an ice cube on my thigh for about 1 minute exactly where i had the hives and it is been 35 minutes since i removed the ice and nothing has happened yet Oh no worries! Well that is good news if your leg isnt reacting! I hope you dont have it. It is so annoying. I guess you could still have it but possibly just a very high tolerance. Maybe just be very careful next time you swim and pay attention for any sign of feeling unwell or itchy. But maybe it is the lotion! thank you so much again for responding to me! i am very scared of it so i am hoping i do not have it either. i will be very careful!! thank you again \u263a\ufe0f I think it is the shock of the cold water that causes it, but I am not sure.", "Antihistamine long use Is there anyone who has noticed any changes in there body or health for long time use of antihistamine? I take antihistamine in the winter practically every day. I live in southern California where it often does not get cold  but my body is sensitive to the cold regardless. That is why I take it everyday. I have asked my doctor about this he said it was fine. I worry about liver damage, but have not read anything conclusive", "Process of finding antihistamines Hey, I have CU for 2 months now and still have not found antihistamines that work. What was your process and what is a realistic goal when you are looking for working antihistamines?\n\nI tried Desloratadine so far, I do not have any side effects, even after increasing the daily dose, but I am not sure they are really working. I would have to do more experiments (not really looking forward to that), but I am not sure they have any effect.\n\nI do not even know what the effect is I am judging it by. Is it exposure time until I have reactions? Is the threshold temperature lowered? Are the hives/swelling reduced?\n\nThe only thing they have helped with is the time it takes for a reaction to go away.\n\nI switched to Levocetirizine three days ago and I would not say they help (a lot?) either.\n\nAlso, would you say the effect increases over time? I know the half-life period of antihistamines is kind of low. Like most rare conditions, with CU everyone is immune system are different &amp; require different treatments. It takes awhile for patients to figure out what works for them, if anything.\n\nRecently, I joined a CU Facebook group &amp; lots of patients in there have tried a combination of Xolair, Zytrec, Pepcid, Allegra, Claritin, Hydroxyzine, Singulair, &amp;/or Prednisone. To my understanding, most allergy meds are not instant &amp; you have to build them up over several weeks to reach full efficacy &amp; see results. Nothing will fully make your outbreaks stop, but rather slow down the reaction time &amp; lessen the severity.\n\nFor extremely sensitive CU patients (like they break out really bad under 80 degrees or go into anaphylaxis just transitioning from a hot shower to room temperature air) getting their outbreaks under control with medications are extremely necessary &amp; lifesaving. However, if you are less prone to severe outbreaks &amp; anaphylaxis you may choose not to be on antihistamines all together.  \nPersonally, I took allergy meds as a kid (for a sinus infection, not CU) &amp; have always been sensitive to the drowsiness. So I do not take any drugs for CU treatment &amp; manage my hives with layers &amp; warm up breaks. I break out all the time &amp; year round, but after living with CU for over 2 decades &amp; adapting to harsh midwestern winters the last 12 years, I know my thresholds &amp; how to prepare for the cold. \n\nNo matter what you decide for treatment, you should have an epipen in case of anaphylaxis, especially since this is a new condition. Unfortunately, it will take awhile to figure out your cold limits &amp; temperature thresholds. Some CU patients like myself can indulge in ice cream no problem, while for others it would send them to the hospital. So it is a wide spectrum, but no matter where you land on it, it is inconvenient but livable. Good luck! :) Personally, I use Cetirizine (Zyrtec) during the day because it is non-drowsy usually, and diphenhydramine (Benadryl) at night, or if cetirizine does not work.  Be sure not to take too much; read the instructions on how often you can take each med.", "Diet/exercise contributing to Cold Urticaria and Dermatographism  Some people experience urticaria that is not specifically triggered by cold alone, but by a rapid change in body temperature.  I think it is cholinergic (sp?) urticaria, also goes by \"CU.\"  So they get urticaria in not particularly cold temperatures, but when going from a warm area to an air conditioned area or vice versa and their body develops hives from their change in temperature, not from the actual temperature.  This might be the culprit here depending on what the outside temps were as sweat is essentially evaporative cooling and the outermost layers of your skin are rapidly cooling.  Edited to add the wiki link:  ( Thank you!", "What my CU usually looks like. Is yours similar?  This is what happens after a 30 minute walk with the dog Mine looks exactly like this. Stay warm! Yep! Very similar! From being outside for more than 10 minutes in damp cold, especially. Yep! Spot on! When I am not on my medication that is exactly how I look! I can feel the itchy burning feeling through the phone. yeah. ugh its the worst. do you sometimes get it so bad where while you are scratching it feels like your hives have hives?

No treatment. How long have you had it?\nTake allergy medication before you get a reaction or when you know it will be cold out. If you take it while you have it, it will not really work much. How well does the medication work? What is the best one for it? i take fexofenadine 180mg and i am usually chilling for the day, as the guy above me said take it before u step out not while u got hives or it will not work In terms of over the counter meds, I take 10mg loratadine daily (generic Claritin). I have found that to keep the symptoms and severe reactions at bay for the most part for me personally. Honestly dude I wish I freakin knew. I am 17f and honestly honestly what works best for me is just a hot therapeutic bath. Like hot-hot. And a thousand layers obviously I recommend zirtec and cortazone creme Have you tried medications to help with this allergy? I use any over the counter antihistamine (does not have to be name brand like Zyrtec Or Allegra etc. because they are more expensive. The most common types of antihistamines to take are certizine, loratadine, and fexofenadine non prescribed. Thanks for letting me know. I have tried Zyrtec and Cortizone creme yes! No lie, the cortizone doesnt really help me in particular, but I know it is been known to help CU in the past. Zyrtec does help me with inflammation it just takes 15-30 mins. Fastest way to get swelling down is submerging affected limbs into hot water Are those the only kinds I can try for CU? How long does it take for Loratadine to take affect? To be honest it is not any kind of immediate effect for me. If I am already experiencing hives or swelling and I take it, it is not going to do much at all because at that point it is too late. I simply take it as a preventative which for me seems to reduce the frequency of reactions. I am not a doctor so please consult one if you are unsure. I am sure there are tons more that work for CU, I do not know any of the others though. Still looking for some myself tbh! I have had Cold Urticaria for over 32 years.  I find that taking one of these long-acting medicines daily through the winter helps a lot, Claritin, Zyrtec, or Allegra.  If I need a fast-acting medicine, I take Benadryl or Chlorotab.  It would be best if you spoke with your allergist about a treatment plan that you can improve upon over the years, as it can either go away or become a lot worse.", "Hives on Hands - Hives on Hands Treatment - Hives on Hands Caused by Stress ", "My Odd Case of CU -- anyone share similarities with me? Currently 20M and noticed symptoms when I was 16. Did not make the connection that it was triggered by the cold until I was \\~18 (ice cube test positive yay!) My CU mainly affects my face, but oddly enough, everytime CU acts up, itchy bumps will show up on the same small place on my left wrist as well as the center of my chest.\n\nI had previously thought that my CU was triggered from contact of another allergen. For example, when my breakout occured, it was in-line with me applying a new brand of face wash. Once I stopped using it, I saw my CU go away. Another allergy I have is to shrimp (makes lips itchy) which I also connected to another possible breakout of CU. Once I cut these two, I thought I got lucky &amp; had rid myself of CU, but it recently came back without any contact with these two.\n\nJust wanted to know if anyone shares a similar experience or has relevant info bc I may be completely wrong that it is even being triggered by another allergen.\n\n1) Has anyone connected their CU to another allergen other than the cold? \n\n2) I see some people have perpetual CU at any contact with the cold, but I have only had a few breakouts a year lasting a few days which I attributed to my other allergies. Sometimes I forget I even have it bc majority of the time I go from *cold* to warm environments, my CU does not act up *at all*. Is this common as well?\n\nI am trying to figure out if my case is unique and if my recent breakout was due to another allergen (thinking it may have been from my cheap metal chain). I think this is like referred pain, not the same, but closest example I can come up with while watching crappy tv. Essentially, I think you may have patches of skin that war more responsive to the histamine released during an attack. It is what makes sense to me but it is a total guess on my part. 1. nope it only ever happens when i am cold\n2. in the past 8 years that i have had CU, ive always gotten hives from any colds weather or substances touching me, never had any flukes where it did not happen. \n\nim not sure if everyone else has the same answers as me but it sounds like you might have a different allergy than CU! did you ever get an allergy test where they test for everything? I am basically self-diagnosed and did not feel like it was a serious enough issue to get tested.\n\nBut maybe I should considering it is a yearly occurence at this point. Thanks for your response! I never considered something like that. Your answer got me to do a little research and it may be connected to histamine release from exercise. I had worked out two days before the breakout (its been a while since I did anything intense) and interestingly, I had no soreness the following day, but somehow on the second day the soreness hit me which coincided with the breakout.\n\nNow I just have another culprit to the problem haha, but thanks for your answer!", "Chronic hives and warming up I have been having chronic hives that comes every 24 hours and I need to take anti-histimines. I have however recently realized that it is triggered when I am cold but goes away in a few minutes when I warm myself in a blanket. Has anyone had a similar experience? Yes. Cold hives should go away when you are no longer cold, in minutes to hours. They also tend to not show up immediately, and can take ten minutes or more to develop when exposed to cold.", "New symptom of CU? Hi! I have just stumbled upon this thread and read everything, however not one of you mentioned having severe headaches as a symptom. The headaches usually start after I have had the allergic reaction or after I have went into the cold. Does anyone experience the same thing or does anyone know more about this? I have not got any headaches when exposed to the cold, this is my first time hearing about this. You might check the CU Facebook groups. There are some people who do not have the typical symptoms of CU. I have and my dr at the time attributed it to the fact the blood was rushing to my skin and not my brain. I was a kid when he told me this so I think it is an oversimplification but yes after a severe breakout or sometimes during depending how long the swelling last I get a headache and slightly dizzy I am now starting to think that with me, it\u00b4s only related to moisture \u00e1nd cold.

Started happening about two weeks ago. I first noticed when I would get iced coffee in the morning and my hand holding the coffee would swell up. Carried a bag of ice to my car and my arms broke out into hives. Honestly this is the WORST thing that could happen to me. I am a snowboard instructor who lives in the upper midwest and was planning on moving to CO to live in the mountains after I graduate this upcoming semester from college. Life is not fair sometimes. Anyone have any tips for keeping it under control during Winter? Check with your GP, but a daily chewable 10mg claritin has almost eliminated mine over the last couple months. I did start taking claritin for an antihistamine yesterday, hoping that works. Have you had any negative side effects from taking it every day? I have had it for a very long time. I have been to the snow and had a very bad reaction and I have been to the snow and had minimal reactions. I went sledding just fine, but we are talking Tahoe not the Midwest cold. \n\nGet a referral to an allergy doctor. You can get an allergy shot which should help with reactions.\n\nThe best advice I can give you is to minimize skin exposure and dress in layers. Nope, but I have also been self medicating with it. Will be talking to my GP soon to ask about taking it perpetually, but from all my research it is fairly low risk and ok to take long term. Thank you for the information I ended up having to go on xolair. It takes a few months for it to really take effect, but it has helped a lot. I can lay my arms on my desk at work again! Hey that is awesome! I went wakeboarding in a lake today and nothing happened, but drank ice water when I got home and my hands swelled up lmao. I guess my threshold is around freezing. Does xolair have any other effects on you? Just curious because 6 months of my year revolves around being cold and I am ready to try anything the doctor recommends lmao. Hi - so kind of similar thing with me. I got diagnosed a few weeks ago (age 25). I already take a daily antihistamine due to airborne allergies so my allergist told me that I can up to quadruple (4x) my current antihistamine dosage when I know I will exposed to the cold (please dont do that before checking with a doctor). I am no snowboarder but i swim and surf in the northern Pacific Ocean often and its pretty dang cold in that water even with a wetsuit. I have not tried what was suggested yet but I also recommend seeing an allergist to see if they may give you suggestions specific to your situation. wish you the best! Thank you for sharing! Sorry to hear you are in the club\u2026 I normally take Zyrtec as needed depending on how cold the day is. As said earlier by someone else, you will likely be told you can up the dosage. Mine is by x4 and so I will take four Zyrtec in the morning at least 45 minutes or so before going out. After taking zyrtec are you able to be comfortable outside for longer periods of time? Personally I think I have a pretty moderate case of it. I also have a special type called familial cold urticaria that comes with some extra symptoms. Although I am less likely to get hives and the itching with such a high dose of antihistamines, due to having familial CU, the antihistamines do not help against feelings of nausea and fatigue I get typically after being out in the cold for longer periods. If you have the standard type of CU, and it is a generally mild case, I think you will be okay as long as you take the right measures to bundle up and take the medicines you are prescribed haha. Thanks for sharing, really glad all of you guys are commenting, makes me feel a lot better to be honest It seems like for me, xolair just gives me more time until I start breaking out. I will still break out after 5 minutes in 40 degree weather though. I live near Chicago, have had it for 13 yrs, developed after giving birth to my daughter. My tolerance was pretty terrible....hives from room temps 70 degress farenheit or lower. I took Allegra 180mg daily (fexofenadine is drug name, generic is fine). That keeps hives at bay for most part, but wont stop anaphylaxis if you have pushed your limits (likely would happen while swimming in cold water). If you are going to actively be in cold often as an instructor, I recommend seeking a doc to prescribe an epi pen, for emergency use. Especially until you learn your limits and tolerance. For winter, I wear layers. Im female, so I find that wearing fleece tights under my pants is helpful. Keep a thick blanket, hand warmers in car for emergencies/car breakdowns. I snowblow/shovel my drive wearing tons and tons of layers plus an actual snow suit. There are actually battery powered heated jackets and coats that exist, but I never did get one. When it is 0 degrees out, sometimes I can still only make it shoveling out there 15-20 mins before I get chilled to the bone and start getting dizziness/heart palpitations. I soak in hot bath when I come inside plus drink coffee or hot lemon water right away. Im not sure if the hot drink helps at all since the reaction occurs bc of the skin temp, but it makes me feel better lol. I dont swim in lake Michigan or unheated pools. \n\nI was depressed about this for a while. I tried to get perspective and I did get over it eventually, but I agree it doesnt seem fair sometimes. And no one understands it or they think it is made up. Lol After 13 years, my symptoms have subsided from multiple outbreaks per day to only a few per year. I still bundle up for shoveling and I still wont swim in cold water, but I finally no longer feel prisoner to it anymore. I also live in the upper Midwest, my main issue is winter(obviously) and from my sweat during/after a workout. I am a big fitness person and did not want to give that up, so I take Claritin in the morning and Zyrtec in the evening. As long as I do not miss a day or two my reactions are pretty minimal. Everyone is CU is different but if a doctor considers yours to be fairly mild then that might be a good route for you. I just climbed a peak in CO in March and was completely fine, just kept every inch of my skin covered! Were you also diagnosed with an underlying condition? Still looking into it, my mom had thyroid problems so it could be that, fingers crossed it is just an active immune system thing I have heard elsewhere on this sub that we may be low on vitamin D.

May be you can help me.\n\n I have read a lot of posts about CU and all people, who have it, report that they have itching. I have a strange form of cold allergy, that is very similar to standard CU, but I do not have itching. Reaction is not immediate, when skin affects to cold, in 15-30 min it starts to burn and become red. Skin remains flat, without any wheals. Very sensitive condition, breakout may start from +20C. Also reaction depends on time skin is affected to cold, if it is less than \\~2-3 minutes, reaction does not start. This condition lasts almost 4 years, any antihistamines and other standard allergy cure absolutely has no effect.\n\nDoes anybody have such strange type of CU as I have? Or this is normal for cold allergy. As I understood, CU is a rare condition, I live in a small country, may be our doctors have not enough knowledge about it. Since I have been on high doses of strong antihistamines, I have had mostly rashes without the itching, but I am not particularly sure about what you describe. \n\nHave you seen a doctor about it?  I know that some forms of CU (possibly familial I think) can have a delayed reaction, but only a doctor can give you a full diagnosis. Yes, ofc I have seen a doctors lot of times. I thought about familial CU but I have doubts: as I understood it starts in childhood, my problem started when I was 25. Also I pass ice cube test, people who have familial CU usually fail it. I hope here are people who have it, may be they can explain me am I right or not? I cannot help you there then, I am afraid, as my own experience does involve reactions to the ice-cube test.  Hope you get an answer soon, though it may also be useful trying to see if anything else in your environment might be triggering your reaction in the meantime.  I know there can be allergies to water, and also to sweat for example, so it may be worth having a look at it. I have these same symptoms, from around under 20+ too. I was Diagnosed with CU about 4 years ago and that seems to be the ongoing view, though I have been told to get tested annually to check it is not developing into something else (though what I am not entirely sure of - I have moved countries twice since then and there are very different views...).

Specifically the areas around my knees and arms would get the worst of it. And I would feel it. In my brain. I would get all foggy and nauseas and if I did not get warm, and fast, I have passed out on a few occasions. After I started working out, and taking pre workout, probably about 5 years ago, it stopped happening. I have heard this is likely due to the beta alanine in the pre workout. However, I still try to avoid extreme cold and quick dropping body temps. So I do not know if I am just preventing it, or it is gone. Can you go swimming in cold water and not break out in hives? That is the one thing that bothers me the most about cu. If not then that seems promising! Good to hear you are doing better.  I can do everything now without the fear of hives. I can organize the freezer at work without constant breaks to warm up, I can swim in the lake water up north, have cool showers after I work out. Everything I never could do before.

I have not done it myself, but even with my amazing insurance it was going to cost hundreds of dollars every month and I am a California girl so my reactions are manageable. In Finland the cost will probably be very reasonable if anything at all. I try to wear longer coats that cover my upper legs. Tight pants/leggings are a problem for me if it is a colder windy day. My son (who has not been formally diagnosed but we believe he has it as well) has an issue with ripped jeans. He has experienced swollen itchy legs from exposure.

I have tried several brands and they all make me zombie:( From this sub I have discovered a homeopathic remedy to take right before I will be in the cold.  Apis Mel 6x has been incredibly effective for me and very inexpensive.  I have had no cold hives since taking this and I ride my bike all through the year in Northern Utah.

Otherwise, if I have the opportunity, simply immersing the burnt area in cool water until the pain is bearable does the job (ex: put the burnt finger in a glass of water). Obviously this is good for minor burns, not for the extra bad ones where the skin peel and such. Burns? Can someone elaborate on this symptom as do not know if I have experienced this before. I think they just mean when they get a burn. How to treat it when you cannot use anything that is too cold because they have CU.

How did that go if you do not mind sharing?  I have an upcoming surgery and will be under general anesthesia which can lower body temp by 3-4 degrees F.  I wonder if this is going to trigger my CU Maybe mention this to the surgeons prior to surgery. They can likely drape you with warming blankets during the surgery to keep your temp slightly higher. I had to have warmed IV bags and they put me under warming blankets during surgery and I had no issues. I have been under general anesthesia twice since developing CU. i had no idea anesthesia lowers body temperature \ud83d\ude2c but i had my wisdom teeth taken out a few years ago and woke up hive free so i think you will be ok. if you are concerned you can bundle up or wear a blanket like some people have said I had a c-section and spinal block. No CU issues associated with the surgery. Thanks that makes me feel better! I had knee surgery which involved fluid being pumped through my knee which can lower your body temp. I had to meet with the anesthesiologist prior to the surgery to discuss the CU aspect - they were very cautious about this. They had warming blankets over me during surgery and afterwards, and I was first on the list so that they could monitor me for longer afterwards due to it being a clinic with no overnight facilities. All went well.   \nI have since had more general anesthetics  - one where they switched the AC off in the theatre (in 35 degrees - I am sure I was popular) and one where they had heated blankets ready just in case. I did have a lot of shivering, but was told that was normal for any experience! No hives though. Yes, I have. You just need them all to know. They  will cover you in nice warm blankets! \nThey will probably put a bracelet on you that says it. If they do not ask them to.", "My journey with CU I have had mine since I was born. I lived in a colder climate and my mom kept bringing me into the doctors office because of the really bad hives. Doctor had no idea what it was for the longest time. They finally diagnose me with CU after a few years. My family then moved from the cold to Las Vegas to help with my skin disorder. As I grew up I always got hives from room temp running water, but only if the water would run over the skin between forearm and upper arm. I then started having issues with exercising then breaking out in hives. I figured those last two reactions were all part of CU. Was not until today I found this channel, and realize all three are likely different types of urticaria. I have asked all my family members and I did not inherit CU. It is been pretty rough at times, but not as bad as explaining to someone I am allergic to the cold, \u201cno really it is a thing\u201d.\n\nIs it pretty common to have multiple forms of urticaria? From what I have read, it is not uncommon to have dermographia or sweat-based urticaria alongside CU, but of course it varies from person to person. With my CU water that is not 80-90F will always cause a reaction. Where ever sweat pools for a while will also trigger them. Makes sense if you think about the cooling mechanisms of sweating. Mine can set off just by keeping my wet arms out of warm bathwater, so I know where you are coming from there. Absolutely feel your pain. Seems that mine has gotten more sensitive triggers as time goes on. It is been about 13 years since my first reaction in high school. I trigger less now that I am on like 900mg of fexofenadine a day plus montelukast, but even then I still get rashes and my throat swells with cold food and drinks :(  They will be breaking out the Xolair next by the looks of things TuT That is wild! I am very fortunate that mine is purely external. I have not taken meds in years unless I know I am getting in water. Got the the point where I will just avoid or deal with it. Few weeks ago I went down a river and my tube popped but thankfully I took 5 Benadryl prior or it would of been disastrous. Like to live life on the edge \ud83d\ude02 I developed CU in my early 20's, and I have lived with it for about 4 years now and also have dermatographia which I believe is another type of urticaria; and as someone said is also common in people with CU.", "Is it common for CU to go away after your body \"adjusts\" to the weather? Hi everyone,\n\nMy experience with CU started when I moved to the East Coast from the West Coast for college and I have just learned to suffer through it, because there is a point where if the day-to-day temperature does not drastically change, it does go away! Unfortunately when I am in an AC room in the summer, I also get the same reaction, and that is always weird to be wearing a jacket to adjust to it. I have never considered it a real problem but thinking that making myself suffer through the constant inflammation is probably not a good thing... but if it goes away eventually, is that ok? I have a similar experience where usually during the seasonal changes I have one bad reaction that lasts for a few days and then my body adjusts to the cold. After that I can ski, go out in the snow, etc. with no problems usually for about 6 months. \u2019m not sure if that is everyone is experience, but for me it usually has to get worse before it gets better. This happens to me too!!  Once you have CU is for life.  Basically you are body is freaking out over your skin being cold, even coldish.      If you can just suck it up for the rest of your life that is amazing.   But I know when I get hives I want to peel my skin off, and my allergist told me I gave to keep an epi pen because it could potentially kill me if get too cold / allergy becomes much worse. \nI live in Canada  so if I ever get stranded for  an X amount of time somewhere the temperature is under 22 Celsius I could definitely die from CU  ( most likely will never be in that position).\n\nYou have a very mild case or something.  You should ask your allergist though, they would give you a better idea. Ugh, I am so sorry that is the case for you. It does seem like I have a very mild case compared to you, but definitely you are right about following up with a doctor to make note of the problem. CU fluctuates all the time. I would not be too worried! Yes, this happens to me too!", "New aufferer of CU I am a late teen who has been sick for about 4 days and after i was feeling well i decided to do my usual and have a shower, turning the water full cold at the end and to my surprise my entire face and chest down to stomach became bright red and covered in hives. i was wondering if anyone could give me insight as to if the condition can be temporary or cured, i have never had anything like this in my life and am extremely healthy and follow a strict workout regimen etc I think it is possible that it can go away. I have read it can go away after like 5 years, but it does not have to. I have this condition now for 7 years and it has gone better but not completely went away. I have had this condition ever since I was born. Once I reached the 10 year mark, it began to fade (I still have the condition, but allergic reactions are now very rare for me personally). Obviously the condition may be different for people who got this condition genetically, but that is my personal experience.\n\nOther than that, I have heard that the condition may go away in a few weeks or months for some, and in around 5-10 years for others. OK, so..\n\nDo not freak out. Sometimes it is short-lived. It is only called permanent if it does not go away within the first 6 weeks. So there is a chance it is over soon.\n\nIf not.. The average length is 5 years. Some have it only for a couple of years, some have it for their whole life. It is annoying, but in the majority is cases, it is just an annoyance. In rare cases reactions are more extreme and can be dangerous, but this is the rare case of an already pretty rare disease.\n\nThe reasons why it appears is unclear. There is not a real underlying thing apparent as far as I know. It is just bad luck.\n\nThere is no cure, but antihistamines help some people (not all, me included, at least so far) and there is injections that might work as well.\n\nOtherwise, just stay safe, test out your limits slowly. Just wondering if you had the Covid vaccine! I live in Whistler. Myself and a few others in town have suffered with CU since the cold snap but have lived here in the cold for years and never had it before", "Hives/itchiness only ever occur on my legs? I am just doing a little research on my own before seeing a dermatologist to confirm my suspicions. \n\nIs it possible that rashes occurring in only one area on the body is Cold Urticaria? I only ever get symptoms on my legs. All my symptoms in that area of my body seem to match, though. Anyone else that has been diagnosed experience this? Your body, your histamine reaction. I tend to get it around my belt line and eyelids first, followed by my upper arms.\n\nIt is probably related to your clothing in the cold as well, try some thermals under your pants. I also cannot overstate the usefulness of a trenchcoat or duster, they tend to keep you warmer lower, which is pretty much what you need. Agree with this, I get CU really bad on my thighs because that areas takes the brunt force of wind exposure, rain and overall coldness. Definitely invest in a longer cost Do you know if the reactions vary in size/shape as well? I mostly get clusters of pinpoint bumps. They look like goosebumps but are extremely itchy and the itchiness gets worse when I start warming back up. From my searches I have not found any images of reactions that look just like mine. \n\nI just ordered some heattech leggings to layer. I will start searching for a long coat too! Thanks for all your help. My legs/thighs are hands down the worst area for me and much of the time the only place I get a rash. It is possible to be CU and only present in one spot. Looking up hives or CU? Because that sounds like a lot of the photos of hives. Again, your body, your histamine reaction, lot of different manifestations from the same source.\n\nAnd yeah, very itchy and then getting worse as you warm up is definitely within the same category. Mine tend to warm me up and be itchy of they get brushed/touched and will increase in area when they are. Images of CU. I am def experiencing something similar to you. It does make sense that it might look different like you said. \n\nI have a dermatologist appointment tomorrow so hopefully she can help me figure this out ASAP.

", "Newbie hoping for advice on dealing with healthcare professionals Hi all, glad I found this subreddit! I have recently discovered I probably have cold urticaria, but never been formally diagnosed as such. My symptoms (started this summer) all suggest it is CU, I get all the typical signs/symptoms and I have done the ice cube test and clearly had a reaction. \n\nHowever my GP is completely clueless on this. He had never heard of it when I spoke to him about it, and told me, \"Well, Google says antihistamines are the recommended treatment, so I can prescribe you some and see if that helps\".  He did refer me for bloods checks on my request, which all came back normal. \n\nThe thing I am wondering is, where do I go from here? He said (as he scrolled through Google during our telephone appointment) that if the ice cube test I did suggests it is CU, that is all there is to it...   \nI am waiting for a call back from him next week as I asked for a follow-up phone call - what else can I ask for? What are people's usual experiences, do you see an allergist to determine how bad your reactions can be? Do you get prescribed any emergency medication in the case of a really bad reaction? Apart from prescribing me antihistamines, my GP does not seem to know the next steps - nor do I, so just looking for some advice on what might be a good course of action from here. \n\nThanks all! What are your symptoms?\n\nIt really depends what they are. This is my first year having it. I thought it was something else due to finger swelling/itchiness during cold exposure, but the tell all sign was when I came back inside from shoveling and noticed welts all over my face.\n\nIf all you are dealing with is swelling/welts/hives on skin all you can really do is take the appropriate amount of antihistamines daily and avoid the cold as best as possible. But if it is worse (throat swelling from cold beverage) then I would suggest seeking out an allergist if possible. Because it can start to get dangerous at that point and you might have to carry an epipen. It still kind of sucks but it is manageable. Some cases disappear entirely within a few years but some do not. It is annoying but it is what it is, my personal experience. Thanks for your reply.   \nAt the moment I have not had any severe/life threatening reactions fortunately, just redness/itchiness/swelling/hives anytime I go somewhere cold (including the supermarket) or if my skin is exposed to cold wetness, and it can be really painful and uncomfortable but I have not had any reactions from drinking/eating cold things. But this is all new to me so I am just tying to make sure I am doing everything I can/should do in case I am missing something.   \nYour feedback is helpful, thanks for sharing your experiences! also would not hurt getting bloodwork either, since allergies are sometimes due to an over reactive immune system Thanks! Yes I did actually have bloods taken and all tests came back normal, which I did not expect! Welcome to the world of being your own health advocate. There is not much info out there, because in the end, it is an allergy, and it is also hard to believe. So... at the base level, you treat it as such. An allergist \"might\" help, but frankly, you are pretty much on your own (in my experience). The vast majority of people handle it by way of allergy pills and avoidance. Also an understanding of the risk is important, if there are any for you.\n\nSo risks and what meds or methods to use? If you only ever get hives on your hands for example, but your face is exposed to the same cold and does not get hives, then generally speaking the health hazard is low. If you get around your throat for example, that is a concern, just like any allergic reaction. It also matters how quick your recovery is. My daughter is lucky, she recovers in minutes once she is warmed up. However, I have read plenty of people on here who take days to recover from even a small little reaction, which would imply that more exposure would potentially just tack onto it increasing symptoms and potentially risk. \n\nIn the end, very few allergies are life threatening when measured against the number of people who have them. CU is pretty low (almost zero) from my empirical/research evidence, though you have allow for bias because of lack of knowledge of the allergy in general. \n\nSo, do a couple experiments frankly. do the ice cube test for lets say 60 seconds, and record the time to recovery. Maybe take a picture of the welt. Then, once recovered, take a Benadryl (others work, but Benadryl is quick and standard), wait an hour, then do the test and record again. compare. see if there is an improvement. Does it spread far from the ice cube and less when drugged? etc etc. Carry Benadryl as a just in case. Probably will not 'need' it ever, but may 'want' it because of itching, etc. But that said, if you would feel better with an epipen being around, then get one if you can. The likelyhood of needing it is almost zero, but if you would feel better, why not have it around?\n\nIt is a very freaky, unknown, and frankly unbelievable disease to anyone who does not have it. You are not alone, and that is the important part. But you are VERY rare, so congratulations on winning the WTF lottery. Good for party tricks in a pinch. \n\nFinal thought. Think through the couple months prior to it starting and to now. Is there any stress/event that has been added/increased since before? The most common and fairly accepted reason for CU is stress. A minor trauma, increased generalized emotional stress, physical systemic stress (illness, injury, chemical, environmental, diet, medication/vitamins) etc. I do know a few who did recognize a change in their life that seemed to connect, dealt with it (these were physical things) and they reduced symptoms quite a bit. Just a suggestion, but it can also just be bad luck. \n\nNot a doctor BTW, just a nerd with a kid who has this annoying fucking allergy and researches things to death. Guess I was avoiding work, monolog over... Wow, thank you so much for such a detailed and thoughtful response. \rI have tried to read as much as I can about it online, but your advice is particularly helpful. I have not come across much about recovery times being different for different people, nor the idea of trying the ice cube test under different conditions, so you have given me a lot to explore! I will definitely be trying the latter to see how my body reacts. \n\nI also did not think to carry a Benadryl on my person at all times \u2013 funnily enough I always have aspirin/painkillers/inhalers/etc on my person just in case \u2013 but for some reason I did not think about a Benadryl for myself. I guess I am still figuring out what I need to do/how to adjust to this new reaction - so it is really helpful to hear tips like this from someone who knows much more about it! \n\nAs for triggers, the strange thing was that I noticed my first ever reaction a few hours after getting my 2nd vaccine dose \u2013 and to be clear, I am \\*not\\* by any means suggesting that the vaccine caused this, but perhaps my immune system was already overloaded and that just kicked it over the edge? I do not know. But yes \u2013 no major acute stresses, but I guess I am always a stressed person so it may well all be related\u2026 \r\n\nAnd I did not even think about cool party tricks! Thanks again so much for your thoughts and sharing your learning, this has been incredibly helpful. Glad to help. And just realize and accept that everyone is different. So all advice is JUST advice, based on their experience. So good luck! I would look into an allergist and call around to a lot of them. I was able to find one that not only knew about CU but he had also treated two other patients with it before. Unfortunately the only treatment is antihistamines (and usually a high dose). I have been on them for about a year and a half now and it is the only thing that works. \nA lot of heath care workers do not know what CU is at all. I have been in the field about 3 years and every place I have worked no one has heard of it. I try to inform people about it though to help people like us. Thank you for your advice, I will definitely look into an allergist. Glad you have found a dose of antihistamines that work for you! And that is great to hear that you are letting people know about CU as well :)   \nIt is really nice to read people's experiences as this is all new to me so thank you for sharing. You are very welcome! This thread helped me a lot when I was diagnosed. If you ever want to just ask me a bunch of questions I will answer anything so just shoot me a message. That is incredibly kind of you! Thanks so much :) I was diagnosed in 2018 although I had been having reactions for years. The produce section of the grocery store (wet cold) was a nightmare. My allergist prescribed antihistamines and an epi-pen. I was instructed to avoid full body immersion in water.  My PCP said that it might go away on its own but so far no luck. Thanks so much for sharing your experiences! I have also been finding that the produce section is really difficult! I have started wearing gloves and extra layers everywhere I go, which does help. As the winter is coming I will not look so out of place, but I am getting a bit worried about how the winter will be generally. I am planning on visiting family who live in a very snowy country in the winter, so slightly dreading it. Do you have any experiences with that, or have you been alright in colder climates generally? I am a hockey mom ;) Dry cold air is tolerable for me but \u201cwet cold\u201d and wind are the issue. Make sure your skin is covered and if you can, take your antihistamines regularly.  I had an outdoor game to attend and did fine\u2026but was bundled to the max. I have a long down coat that covers my legs. I know everyone is different but I get through it.  Good luck to you! Interesting, I did not think about differences between dry and wetter cold! That is actually a great point, this will be my first winter with it so I will see how I get on, but your tips are great! Thanks again so much!", "My story with cold urticaria I live in south Florida (which I feel pretty lucky about, due to my CU) but it was so frustrating and confusing to me because I did not even know that being allergic to the cold was a \u201cthing\u201d. I remember being 13 and my hands started to itch. I tried to wash off whatever was making them itch and nothing worked, so I just walked around a cold mall with burning hands  until they stopped itching. My first skin reaction was in the winter when I sat on a metal bench that left my legs covered in hives. And the hives became more frequent when I would wash the dishes (I splash a lot) my whole stomach would break out in hives. At this point I told my parents that I thought I was allergic to either water or the cold. With more experience we discovered that it was the cold. But that the cold water was worse since it stays on the body longer.  I really do not have to worry about much being here in Florida. Just warmers under my clothes at work. And gloves to wash dishes. My main problem is my dream to be a marine biologist. I have a bachelors in marine biology but I am scared to pursue an actual career because for most of my labs when the water was cool or cold I would break out in hives or I just sat outside of the water taking notes. Does anyone have advice on how to stay warm in the ocean for long periods of time? Do you take medicine for your CU?\n\nAnd I would say a wetsuit but that could be cumbersome I wore a winter wetsuit once. Broke out on my face and neck. I am really sorry. I hope you are a lucky one and grow out of it. I do not take regular medication since l just avoid the cold. I tried over the counter antihistamines like Zyrtec or Benadryl. But one gets me dizzy and the other one sleepy. I guess it is time for me to get a prescribed medication.. I used every antihistamine for my CU. I am from NYC where the winters are sometimes extremely cold. \n\nI spent the last 10 years darting from one indoor location to the next to avoid the painful hives. \n\nFinally in September 2020 I started Xolair injections. I can hold cold drinks, sit in the cold, and take cold showers now !!! \nIt sometimes tingles but I think that is what everyone feels form the cold. \n\nIf your insurance approves it. I would say try to get it.  You may still be able to have your dream job and be safe. \n\nI do not know how severe your allergy but mine was severe enough that I was prescribed epi-pens. If you have it pretty severe, being in cold water is not just uncomfortable but can be dangerous because it may cause anaphylaxis. \n\nGood luck ! I recommend cyproheptadine. Also Zyrtec works really well. If it makes you sleepy/dizzy, try to stick it out. Your body will adjust to it. It used to make me sleepy but not anymore how often do you get the injections? I am a yachty so I work on boats around water all day long and have recently gotten CU (self diagnosed), i am going to see a doctor to diagnose it soon I get the xolair shots once a month. I felt a difference after the second month. oh I do not think that would work for me, I travel a few months at a time with the boat If it is okay, can I ask you a bit about the Xolair injections and their effects, what to expect, etc.?  My allergist seems to be suggesting them as my next course of action, but when I asked on the sub a few months ago, I did not really get a response. Yeah of course. \n\nI had it back done I believe early this year/ maybe late last year. \n\nI had no side affects except soreness at the injection site which is totally normal. \n\nWhat exactly would you like to know ? Do you still have to take antihistamines alongside the injection?  Did it reduce cold reactions quite a lot and very quick, or was it a minor change or gradual? \nAlso, I know that it knocks out part of the immune system, so has it made any differences to catching illnesses at all? \n\n1. Do you still have to take antihistamines alongside the injection?  \n\nYes I did. I have environmental, dust and food allergies. I guess it depends on your allergies. I think if you only have CU then you may be fine without it. \n\n\n2. Did it reduce cold reactions quite a lot and very quick, or was it a minor change or gradual? \n\nI live in NYC and most winters I am running from train to building. This year I did outdoor winter activities ( outdoor movies, hung out by the pier in february ) and I was fine. I felt cold like I use to before I got CU. \nI felt a difference after the first shot and I think it took shot number 3 ( the third month ) before I was able to hold like a cold drink against my arm without any hives. \n\n3.Also, I know that it knocks out part of the immune system, so has it made any differences to catching illnesses at all?\n\nOddly enough, I started this during lockdowns so I had the mask on all the time anyway. Which I think really helped not come into contact with viruses and illnesses. \n\nI am sick quiet off, with allergies to life lol and I have not been sick since lockdown started.

I have been getting this every winter (except last year) for the last few years. It is incredibly itchy and ends up covering the entire back of my hands and fingers. It gets more red and the bumps become more prominent and prevalent. It is in the beginning stages now. This is about three days in. But it never fades, it just keeps getting worse. I have been indoors and warm all day today and it has not gotten any better. Usually it goes away with heat (unless you are sensitive to hear too). This might be more of eczema or some other rash. Does it go away if you put your hands in warm water for a while? my wife has something similar. It looks like winter eczema.\n\n( Cu is not just hands.  It would be large hives.  Bout nickle dime sized  almost like a mosquito bite. And it would be on other parts of your body too.  Not only hands.

Yes, although from my research it is very rare. When I talked to my allergist about it he said it would likely take you plunging into an ice bath with no anti-histamines in your system. Yes, my allergist insisted I be prescribed an epi-pen to have on me when I am near large bodies of water, in case I fall in Yeah it just depends on how bad it is. Mine has progressively gotten worse so I am not sure how bad it is now, but two years ago I went to ginne springs in florida and swam until my entire body broke out (30 minutes and I could not go anymore) and the water is &lt;30 degrees. Just depends on your severity same with me! mine said even a swimming pool would be dangerous Right pools are now out of the question for me. Hot tub okay as long as I can dry off and change right away Yes. I once had an anaphylactic shock from swimming in cold water (was not super cold) in the middle of summer Yes. It happened to me before! And what did you do? And what did you do? Did you have epi pen just in case? Nope, I just got one recently because I was never diagnosed in my hometown. The dr said \"just keep yourself warm\". It was scary because my friends did not know what was wrong with me and just thought my blood pressure dropped. I woke up to find my legs elevated, my face paper white and my lips so blue but it passed That is completely wrong. Everyone is different. I cannot drink cold drinks or food. That would send me into anaphylaxis. Rain and wind on a chilly day will do it. It is not rare among our kind with this allergy. It is a real and present danger and your severity can change on a dime. Per medical research anaphylactic shock occurs in about 1 out of 50 individuals with allergies, so 2% of people will experience an episode. Research on cold uticaria is difficult because of how uncommon it is (0.05% of the population). Some research will show higher numbers for worse reactions, but there is reason to believe that those numbers are inflated since people who experience reactions warranting medical care are the only ones being counted. People with lighter reactions certainly fly under the radar. Also some evidence suggests that cold urticaria can be self limiting. Prevalence is slightly higher in northern climates, since warmer climate individuals may never experience a reaction. Unfortunately research on the allergy is limited. I was just passing along information my allergist told me and what research shows. Obviously if you want better more individualized info go consult with your allergist. \n\nYes everyone is experience is different and a lot of variables can play into your level of reaction. Reactions can also vary depending on the stimulus so just because I never experience symptoms such as yours does not mean I cannot. I am sorry to hear that yours are so severe. It is not just the weather outside that gives reactions, tho. I know people who live in Arizona and have problems because everywhere inside is absolutely frigid. Cold drinks and food give reactions.

Mine started back up in December last year after a few months of no symptoms at all, and is now so clearly triggered by the cold - but I have never had that link so apparent before. So while our situations are different, I can definitely relate to a) it coming back all of a sudden and b) the triggers changing. Hopefully it will be a very short term thing for you.

The only thing that makes it better is antihistamines but without then I am a walking hive lol. Lol I lived in a tropical climate for ~2 years and that definitely made my symptoms worse in warmer weather when I normally would not get hives. Mine too! I just depends. One time at work it lasted for hours because I did not have the medicine or any way to warm up. But normally probably 30 min to an hour! The only good thing about getting hives is people believe you when they see them in person. Forreal! So many people do not believe me and then when it happens they are like \u201coh you were serious\u201d and I always say \u201cuh yea\u201d.

I am so confused because he will break out in hives even in an air conditioned room so I do not understand this at all.\nThe only explanation I can think of is it was not on long enough.

Could be your sodium levels! My brother only breaks out when his sodium levels are high I have honestly what I would consider violent CU and the ice cube test does not work for me. I am 17f,, maybe it is an age thing? Or maybe it is more of being encased in a blanket of cold rather than one concentrated area,, I have never broken out from holding a cold drink u know? I think it could be related to the exact timing of the ice cube test. For me, my symptoms come and go, and during an intense flareup I would certainly have a positive ice cube test. However, a few days later, I could have almost no reaction to cold. In fact, when I am not experiencing symptoms I have no issues with even ice cold showers. As I have gotten older (33 now) I have found that the flareups are less frequent and less intense. Isnt there a link between familial UC and neg cube test? I did the ice cube test for 5 minutes and nothing and then I did it again and did not press so hard so it burned my skin to hold it and I had hives in 30 seconds They have called him back in the repeat it and maybe do it for longer. Did they put it over a bandage on your skin? My son had his arm in a light bandage then the ice cube put on top then bandaged into place so it would not move. Had a follow up call today and at first the paediatrician tried to suggest maybe it is something else such as things in the air causing a reaction.

I have the same thing like you Yes! It is most likely from the skin cooling down from that hot temperature. Happens with sweat, the parts of me that are not directly under the shower, the parts of me that were in the bathwater and then are not, and my hands after washing them no matter the temperature of the water. Talked about it with my allergist and she agreed. Yep same here, although the cold is much more bothersome because its more severe of a reaction for me, and harder to avoid. \nI have seen some sites call it thermally induced hives, which encompasses both Yes. When I sleep under a heated blanket or workout. When working out you produced sweat which is designed to cool you off.. any wind that touches the sweat or skin (does not need to be cold wind) will cause hives. Try wearing tighter clothes when working out like skin tight. It works really good for me stopping the sweat running down my back and legs. If your heated blanket does the same I would also wear skin tight pj\u2019s to absorb the sweat. Stick to materials are quick dry like sportswear No but that sounds fucking terrible Yes! Me too.

I lost almost 30lbs around the time I first noticed my CU. No idea if it actually had anything to do with it though. I found out about my allergy at the same doctors visit that I was diagnosed with alpha-gal syndrome. Maybe? I also think that it is related to my mother having Hashimoto's thyroiditis. (I also have Reynauds syndrome which worries me) I had some weird flu like bug with a sudden onset and only lasted 3 days. Mine happened a few days after getting surgery on my jaw. Could it be coincidence? I doubt it. Same. I had never experienced this type of reaction until my first Northeast winter after losing 40 lbs. Did you take any antibiotics because of the surgery? So long ago honestly cannot remember. Its quite possible though. I got a normal cold/cold symptoms for a week and got it, if I got a antibiotic I feel it would help. Less weight means less fat to keep the body warm which means more reactions or increased sensitivity. Losing weight can be related to thyroid issues or losing weight could still affect the thyroid inducement to cold sensitivity. I have cu and raynauds. Got them years apart though. I got raynauds after my first tattoo but there are very big extremes with the condition and most people do not have it as bad as it really can be THAT IS BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENED TO ME.

I thought it was a reaction from the dirty water in the harbor so I took a hot shower and then wrapped myself in blankets the rest of the day. But, the next day I went to my 8 am class and noticed the rash forming in my hands and feet. This happened every day since then. Now I am diagnosed and do not know what to do about it. I did not get prescribed and medication but I do have an epi pen. Welp, now I have to say good bye to outdoor activities I guess. I remember getting them during college and only thinking it was because of stress , only realizing like a year or two later they were caused by a sudden drop of temperature especially first thing when getting out of bed \n\nI wish there was a cure \ud83d\ude2d Do not give up on the outdoor activities!  I got it about 2 weeks ago and I have been given antihistamines.  I have been out running in the cold 3 times since then and experimented with different layering and I have been able to cut down on the size on the rash.  But yeah, I think it will be a while before I feel brave enough to use my kayak again.  \n\nI joined a few cold urticaria FB groups and they are more active than r/coldurticaria but there is very few members who jog - got a few tips tho'. I realized I had it when swimming in cold spring water. I do not know what could have started it. I had just turned 27, I lived in France a year before that, been in Florida all my life. I usually get triggered staring at 50 degree temps. I found out about it because the itching would start up whenever I went to the pool, at first we thought it was the plants or maybe the chemicals. But after getting it at the beach too, we realized it was because of the cold.", "Acute Urticaria - Acute Urticaria Treatment - Acute Urticaria Home Remedy | Acute Urticaria ", "Soft Cold Urticaria Hi! I am a 22 yo, and I started to have this weird hives when I went for a swim in the ocean a couple years ago. Not too serious, between 50 and 75 on my back and 3 or 4 on my chest, plus some small irritation on my arms. It disappears within an hour or so. I think it may be a light case of cold urticaria, I am going to see a dermatologist, but from your knowledge, will some prescription allow me to swim without worries again? Thanks! I find a non-drowsy h1 anti-histamine (such as Zyrtec or Claritin) with an h-2 antihistamine like Zantac taken together makes any symptoms go away or not come at all.  (This article is about using h1 and h2 antihistamines for urticaria  \n\nAll are available in the US over the counter and minimal side effects ! I just take them to avoid a rash when doing winter activities. Though depending on your insurance, you might be able to get a larger quantity with a prescription for a lower cost. Good luck. \n\n(Note - A Benadryl will sure the trick too, but they make me quite sleepy). Thanks! I am actually from Europe and sually have Zyrtec at home for aby necessity, I will try it for sure! Although they make me a bit sleepy, but I guess that it may go away once I get used to it. Thanks! Maybe try 12 or 24 hour ones and take them at night? I find adding the Zantac/ranitidine when I needed it really helped. Good luck!", "i did a coldurticaria test with aice cube on my arm a few times &amp; on my leg and i didnt get any hives just red from having an ice cube on me.does that mean i do not have cold urticaria and i may be misdiagnosed?i had one weird thing from cold beach water with red legs &amp;hives that went say in an hour.  My daughter did the ice cube test at the allergist and did not get hives either. Doctor said if we left it on longer (15 minutes instead of 5) it would likely get a response. He said we did not need to do that since she had all of the signs otherwise. (she did not want to do the test again) She really only has ever had hives on her exposed face skin in Michigan winters and luckily not all over like some people get. not going to lie after reading this i decided to try it for longer. i made it 12 minutes before i said f- it. i wish i could attach a picture of what happened. i have normal bumps on my skin and it kind of just looks like they got raised from the cold a bit. i really cannot tell if it is hives or not. looks nothing like the hives i had before. they are not itchy or irritating. and you can only really tell it is there when i use a flash light and angle it weird to see the texture of my skin. not sure what that means", "CU, not so fun, just want to be \"normal\" \ud83d\ude14 So glad i found this group. Was actually watching an ask reddit YT vid and this group was on it. Ive had CU for 27 years now and it is not fun. I still remember my first episode like it was yesterday, I was 10 and living in Northern California and we were headed back to town from a week in the woods. It was hot, very hot outside (101\u00b0F) decided to go swimming in the stream. Was in for about 5 mins when I got cold and got out and climbed on a rock to warm up. I fell asleep cause I was tired, woke up after a few minutes as it was time to go. I got on shore where my shoes were and I remember my dad telling me to hurry up cause its hot. I blacked out and said I cannot see them and he said \"they are in front of your face\" next thing I know I am waking up in my dads arms being rushed to the truck. Thankfully my dad was a volunteer EMT as he knew what to do. My gums were white and he recognized it at hypothermia, he jumped on the CB and called to see if a doctor was in one of the camps on the way down and luckily there was. I got warm milk and my body temp came back up and he rushed me to the hospital on the military base we lived on. Doctors tried to say hear stroke but my dad knew it was not. Fast forward years later I finally got it diagnosed about 3 years ago as CU. Im on more of the severe side as not only do I get hives but my body temp drops rapidly. My last bad episode 2 years ago my body temp dropped to 86\u00b0F. I love swimming and unfortunately cannot be in the water long and it sucks cause both my kids love swimming and it upsets me to see the other fathers in the water playing with their kids. \n\n\nTL:DR had CU at age 10. Undiagnosed till 3 years ago. I have severe CU and cannot play in the water with my kids like other dads can. My heart goes out to you! Thanks so much. We are not sure how I got it but all we know is only one other person (distant cousin) has it as well. Ive tried benadryl per docs orders and it does nothing. It sucks too because I live in the pacific northwest and love hunting, fishing and swimming. I am on allerga and it seems to help a lot! Have you thought about going to heated pools? I do not know if there are any near you, but it might be worth calling around and asking your local public pools what temperature they are at and if they have any heated pools. Best of luck, someone I know has it and I know how tough it can be. I am sorry you go through this. I am just wondering when you have bad episodes\u2014what happens? I notice I have a low temp in the morning and my body shakes and has hives, I think to warm up. And I noticed lately I also feel a little faint with a slight breathing problem\u2014does this happen to you too? If so, what do you usually do to treat it? The first thing that happens is I start to break out in a rash, then I get hives and get really itchy. If I do not seek warmth at that point then my body temp starts to drop quickly then my eye sight starts to fade, and then I pass out. Usually I can get  warm once I notice the hives. I either get under a blanket or put on warmer clothes and drink hot tea or i get in the shower and get in warm water then slowly increase the temp as you dont want to shock my system. Then dry off and try to keep warm after that. I usually ache for a day or two afterwards but recover. The lowest I have seen my body temp get was 87\u00b0F but I am not sure if that is the lowest its ever been cause my first episode when I was 10 my temp was not taken. Thanks for the response. I hope there is something out there that will be able to help us live a normal life. Looking into finding a new career too and finding a doctor that can help!", "I have been struggling with this \u201callergy\u201d since I was younger but I do not know what it is. I usually get this on my legs after I have been exposed to colder temps. I got this yesterday after a boat ride, it was freezing. does anyone know if it could be cold urticaria?  the weird thing is that I usually only get them on my legs/butt. usually it only hurts when it gets really bad like this. Seems like it! Try taking an ice cube and holding it onto an effected area for a few minutes and see what happens. I tend to have my hands and feet swell up but when it is cold my butt and legs are the first to break out lol. Stay warm Yup, that is how mine looks! Take a hot shower then get under some blankets. That is what helps me The blood circulation to the skin surface of those areas is not as much as others so the blood cannot keep it warm as easily. Same w the backs of my hands. It is probably why my face does not get it unless it is very cold. Lots of blood. Yep my cold urticaria affects my lower body the most Looks like it. My breakouts are the same. I get them on my thighs first and my forearms. Looks like me! Yes it definitely is, mine is almost always on 'fattier' parts of my body w less circulation like my thighs, butt, and stomach, and backs of arms. yes", "my legs in my 76\u00b0F home  My legs feel itchy just looking at this. Literally me too! Me too! I am bundled up all summer long in my house set at 75. Yep. Same. It is ridiculous", "It had to be done, did not it?  Do you have a fat finger now? Or did you wear a glove ha Swollen itchy fingers because I helped build a snowman too haha", "Allergic, itchy skin reaction aside, has cold urticaria been proven to cause people to be less tolerant of cold in general? Setting aside the allergic reaction, does cold urticaria make an individual less tolerant to cold general? Do they feel colder than the average person?\n\nI have cold urticaria but i dont really get the allergic itchy reactions anymore. But STILL, i just feel like im just much colder in general in cold weather (compared to the average person). I always get the \"winter blues\" and dress warmer than the average person, and not to avoid the allergic reaction. Is this common for everyone else?\n\nI moved to Houston for three years and i think honestly that was one of my happier periods in life. I just dont know how you could measure one person against another regarding their 'tolerance' to cold. I would imagine it would be difficult to distinguish whether an individual was just 'tougher' or if they actually have a physiological weakness...\n\nThank you Not sure. Kind of curious about this too.\n\nI feel like everyone is temperature-preference/tolerance is so scattered so it is hard to tell. Like someone who has not eaten in a few hours will be more sensitive to colder temperatures than someone who has just recently eaten. I am guessing you are asking about a constant situation -- where everyone got to eat at the same time, had around the same weight/fat, etc?\n\nI cannot speak for anyone else nor have I read any papers to support or oppose your inquiry, but for me, I do not think I am less tolerant of the cold than those without CU. I feel like I am generally middle-of-the-road -- half the people I know tend to feel colder than I do, and the other half tends to feel warmer than I do. Thanks that is helps. Damn i should have made this question a poll to see what the consensus is Not sure but I think I am definitely more aware of it then my friends. I was taking PSATs a few weeks ago and washed my hands during a break but did not dry them cause I did not have time and the rest of the test I was a shaking mess from it making me cold.\n\nGoing to football games in the cold? Funny. Just last week I went to one (social distanced, I was in the band away from the stands) and had to go inside during half time because I was shaking so bad and looked like I had Tourette\u2019s. I have not seen anything online or any case studies explaining it but seems so.\n\nMasks help keep your face warm and from breaking out with hives surprising well. \nanswer.. depends on the person, but I would honestly day yes they are less tolerant because you are actually having an allergy telling you that how cold you are is getting dangerous and your body is not handling it very well and if left too long or you get too cold..it could kill you.        \n\nI mean if your midly allergic say to strawberries would you  think that means they are less tolerant to strawberries in general......they would say.. um dude it an allergy so I avoid them because I am allergic it just will not kill me if I have one compared to some whi if they even touch it could die in under 5 mins.\n\nUTICARIA refers to the allergy.  And the cold part refers to what your allergy is , there are 3 types that I am aware of.  Cold, Sun and water.         \nCOLD URTICARIA  means allergic to cold temperatures.  So if your personally always ran warm like some people the temperature difference between warmer people to people who usually run a little colder might seem more drastic but it means that when your skin is getting too cold your body basically thinks its under attack and put out too much histamine to counter it... which really is cause the problem to begin with.     \n\nSo your left with a low tolerance due to your body being allergic to your body and skin cooling and for those who need epi pens like me  if left too long in the cold.. it could be deadly.       But that threshold can be different based on severity and how warm you usually are to begin with.\n\n\nEg.  At 20 degrees Celsius I start to feel cold ,but I run 1.5 degrees colder than what the average person.    So that means I get colder just that much quicker. So at 20 Celsius  I am starting to get itchy , no hives just.. itchy.  At 19, you can see hives dotted on my bared skin.. at 18 that are much larger and I feel the need and want to just peel my skin of due to itching. I do not let myself get much colder than this...I do not want to find out how cold I need to get before I have to use my epi, and any smart person with CU will try their best to avoid their hives as it not a very pleasant experience. People also loose the most heat from their further most extremities  like fingers, feet ,nose and head.  These things tend to get colder much quicker and when covered helpnto warm us up faster too.  If I get too cold at night inout on a pair of socks and I feel really warm in 30 mins.

Whenever I transition from two extremely different temperatures (like getting out of a hot tub in the winter or going inside after sledding) I get a rash.\nThe parts of my body that were most exposed to the temperature before the change swell up and turn red, sometimes to the point I cannot move my fingers. The rash is painful, itchy, and very warm. It is just a small problem and has never gotten to the point I need medical attention.", "Covid Vaccine Hi all. I have had CU for over 20 years now, diagnosed as a child.  My allergist kind of freaked me out during our consult about the covid vaccine.  I was advised to dose up on H1 and H2 antihistamines and keep EpiPen on hand.  I will be receiving the Moderna vaccine this week. My internet searches came up empty; I am wondering if anyone with CU has had the covid vaccine who can tell me it will be ok. \ud83d\ude4f Wish I could but please keep us posted! Best of luck to you!! I got the Pfizer dose 1 vaccine last week and I was totally fine. I take Singulair every day and I also carry an epi-pen because I am anaphylactic to the cold, so hoping you will be fine getting the vaccine as well! I guess I am most nervous about the concept of CU being connected to the immune system.  It is such a rare illness to began with there are such limited studies, in general.  I really appreciate everyone taking the time to share their experiences because it truly is helping to make me less concerned. I have that as well. My doctor recommended the same plus try to get the vax scheduled for Monday-Thursday so if you have a reaction, it is easier to get in touch with your allergist or schedule an appointment. Also wait 30 minutes instead of the standard 15 minutes. By chance, did your allergist recommend taking such precautions for ANY vaccine or is it something about the covid vaccine, specifically, that you should be concerned about ? I intend to try to get into my online portal and ask the same question of my allergist. This was specific to the covid vaccine. All vaccines have some sort of side effects for a small population and each vaccine is different. With the 2 mRNA vaccines (Pfizer and moderna) there are slightly elevated risks for allergic reactions. It is very very rare. Non-covid vaccines typically do not have as many allergic reactions. Since there is not enough info out yet, my allergist was advising me what to do to put myself in the best possible position. He also strongly encouraged me to get the vaccine, which was fine because I really want it. A really low risk of minor side effects is worth it compared to how I might handle covid. I have other health issues too so covid could be hard on me. My plan is to sign up as soon as it is my turn. I should also mention that I take a refrigerated shot once a month for migraines. If I take it straight from the fridge and do the shot I will have a reaction but if I let it sit out for 30 minutes I am fine. The Pfizer and moderna vaccines are cold but they do take them out and let them warm up some before they inject them. I have heard others with CU suggest making sure the shot is definitely warmed before administered. I feel like it is wise to follow the allergists recommendation. He instructed me to take xyzal and pepcid 2x a day a few days before the shot.  Then double my xyzal the day of, timing my dose to be an hour before the shot. And have my EpiPen with me.\ud83e\udd74\ud83e\udd74\ud83e\udd74 Mine gave the nearly the exact same advice. Take the Zyrtec and Pepcid days before and then double Zyrtec 1 hour before. Keep epi and liquid Benadryl handy. He also said to call him if I start having a reaction as a nurse may or may not have a lot of experience with allergic reactions and to definitely call if I have to go to the hospital or something. It seems like a good plan. My allergist made me \"promise\" to call and let him know how that works out for me because he \"needs the feedback \". LOL. That was the other part that made me a bit sketched. Say what?  I can hear the record screech. On a serious note, it is a lot of theory. What did make me feel better is that one of the nurse practitioners I see when my allergist is not available has cold urticaria and she did fine with both shots. She did not even feel the shot go in or have any hives/rash, only soreness. I am hoping it will be the same for me. What country/ area are you and when will the vaccine be available to you? I am in the US in the Southeast. And when will it be available to me? I have no idea. Everything seems to be changing. They keep moving people into the 1a and 1b categories. If I had to guess maybe April-May-ish. That is perhaps a bit too optimistic. I am in MA and it is been less than straightforward here as well. I am in 1a but just found a place where I can get the vaccine.  I am pretty sure I am going Thursday this week. So, in that case, I will be letting you know how it goes. \ud83d\ude01 Hi. Just letting you all know I got the Moderna vaccine this morning at 10:30am. I only took the pepcid. I did not take the xyzal because I was nervous it would make me too drowsy to drive.  I am about 5 hours out from my shot and did not have any reaction at all. Best of luck to everyone else \ud83d\udc98 Hey, i got the moderna vaccine. I was perfectly ok after the first dose but The second dose was bad - I started feeling really awful some 20 minutes after the dose. But not bad enough to use the EpiPen. Hope yours goes better xx Oh wow! What were your symptoms? Light headed, started feeling chills, and felt nauseous. The arm was sore for like 2 days and I got hives at the injection site. \nEven people without CU that I know have experienced similar-ish symptoms after their second dose so idk My arm def hurts like a mfer and I am FREEZING but no allergy like symptoms that I was expecting. Do not want to scare you but good luck with the next dose! I appreciate the heads up\ud83d\ude2c Current recovering from 2nd Moderna dose. What a doozy! No CU reaction as the vaccine was room temperature (i checked! Lol) but the chills, stiffness, headache in the evening \ud83d\ude2b Normal mRNA vaccine second dose reaction. Did not have to do w CU, most likely. Did you have any reactions days later? Thanks! Hi. About ten hours after I got the shot, I started feeling very cold and could not get warm.  I know others without CU who have had the same experience.  I developed chills and a fever.  I did not get much sleep because my chills were so intense.  My fever was gone by morning and was replaced with a headache.  I took ibuprofen in the morning and felt much better.  Sunday I woke up with pin like hives on my forehead.  Maybe about 6. Could be totally unrelated.  By the 3rd day I was completely back to normal although on the 4th day my hand swelled up from taking the trash barrel down and I got hives from going to my car and driving it without warning it up. Both of which I have been able to do with no issues lately.  It seemed to make my CU more sensitive for about a week. I had a follow up appt with my allergist who seemed to think I was crazy but I definitely noticed my reactions were quicker and more severe for a few days and then back to normal. Just wanted to say thanks for posting this question, I have my vaccine scheduled for tomorrow and was worried about it but it is such a relief to see other people have been fine! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f my second is Friday"]
