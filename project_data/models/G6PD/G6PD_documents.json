Good to know! I take NAC and milk thistle daily because both boost glutathione production which protects against oxidative stress. G6PD causes increased oxidate stress as a protection against malaria and I suspect other parasites and even possibly viruses that cannot withstand the unusual levels of oxidative stress that persons with g6pd can. I also supplement with vitamin C in RDA doses(no mega doses) and I take iron along with the B vitamins necessary for red blood cell production. From my years of being aware of this condition and managing it I find a lot of the medical advice to be nonsense. G6PD is an evolutionary advantage, not a sickness. Evolutionary advantage becomes a sickness however when the number of RBC's hemolysing starts having an effect on your liver, spleen, oxygenation etc (ie a hemolytic episode).\n\n PS: well done on your supplementation regime btw! I currently only take ALA and a general multivitamin. meh the pros out weight the cons. people with g6pd have lower cancer risk and lower rates of heart disease.

I doubt it. You would be as susceptible to it as the flu. No one actually yet how COVID and G6PD will interact. Most likely is that the virus will affect us just as strongly as it does the rest of the population. There might be a connection as COVID 19?  seems to be highly selective in who comes down with symptoms. There are far more people with COVID-19 than reported we only hear of those that are symptomatic.  The drug hydroxychloroquine is being used to treat COVID-19 but as you know that is an anti-malaria drug that can harm/kill those with G6PD. G6PD might confer some type of protection.  This needs to be studied. Or maybe it has the opposite effect and kill us... I do not know the answer to your question. I have more questions. \n\nHas anyone been able to find any research about G-6PD deficient patients in Italy, Iran, and other countries strongly impacted by Covid-19? Specifically, has it caused hemolytic crises? \n\nAlso, I have read conflicting information about ibuprofen for patients with Covid-19. Has anyone seen anything definitive, since Tylenol is contraindicated for G-6PD deficiency? How else to treat a fever?\n\nThank you to anyone who has any information. as far as I know, we can take Tylenol, never tried it tho  Thank you for your reply. Tylenol (acetaminophen or paracetamol) is on a list of drugs that may cause hemolysis for individuals with G-6PD deficiency. I understand that this means it would not definitely cause hemolysis in all patients. However I personally would avoid it. \n\nThe drug is safe for G6PD. Chloroquine is the one that can trigger hemolytic anemia. On g6pd.org it is listed as a drug not to have And if considering high dose vitamin C it is a bad idea for G6PD deficiency people to do that.. Paracetamol is a safe drug. I consumed it since the day I was born. Please consult your doctor. There is no medical proof that VitC is harmful to us. Excessive take of VitC is harmful to everyone tho. \n\nHere is one case post high dose C via IV @ 75g\n\nAcute lack of vitamin C during disease state is harmful for everyone.

Have never had any problems from it nor Advil (ibuprofin). I have found the same to be true. Found out when I was 5 (1965) that I had G-6PD after being given Sulfa and had to go to the hospital for a transfusion due to severe anemia. After finding out I had it I was told that I could not take certain medications, namely Sulfa and aspirin, and avoid Fava beans. Later with the advent of the internet I found resources that had a much larger list of medications that I was supposed to avoid which I had been taking my whole life up to that point without problem (that I knew of). Never had to worry about antimalarials as I never traveled to countries requiring me to get shots. I took Advil and Tylenol my whole life for headaches and pains. Never had problems. Supposedly tonic water is a problem but do not know if I have ever had it. I have taken Royal Camu, a potent natural vitamin C, and have never had any issues from it. In fact I strongly believe it has helped keep me from becoming sick from the flu or upper respiratory illnesses in the past. I do not know if there are varying degrees of sensitivity between those who have G-6PD. I think it might be possible as it has never really been a problem for me other than when I was given Sulfa when I was 5 many many years ago. Found this subredit in my search for links between COVID-19 and G6PD (which I have). I also found this article which I found very interesting as it speaks to some of the issues in regard to chloroquine (which we should avoid) and hydroxycholoroquine (which we can take) and what the differences are and why malaria and these drugs affect us differently than those who do not have the deficiency.   ( I got the at risk of severe illness if you catch COVID19 text message from UK_Gov today... Waiting on formal letter but some googling confirms there are concerns regarding G6PDD and COVID19... Firstly the fact it may attack faster due to our weakened RBCs and secondly due to the potential treatment they are trialling in the US being dangerous for G6PDDers due to risk of anemic shock and potential blood transfusion...\n\nSo that is me in for 12 weeks...

Not professional either; It is possible from childhood to adult transition to have less or no reaction, but do not assume. might to worth it to see a dr and get another genetic test AFAIK, females are known to be more of carriers of G6PD and suffer far less to no symptoms associated with it. That is what I read and have been told by the staff at the hospital. Also not a health professional but born with G6PD. At birth I was really sick and jaundiced requiring a blood transfusion and had to lay under special blue lamps for light therapy. Two weeks later I came home and was fine. Then when I was 5 my I got sick and my mom gave me some sulfa medication. I had a severe hemolytic anemia episode which sent me to the hospital for another transfusion. That was when a doctor friend did a bunch of tests on me (had to have bone marrow blood drawn - incredibly painful - thought I had leukemia) and he figured out I had G6PD. I do not think you can \u201cgrow out of it\u201d as it is a deficiency which is part of your genetics. There are varying degrees of sensitivity and I believe I am fortunate to have a mild sensitivity to many of the \u201cdo not take\u201d items on the list. Have not had any further episodes since I was 5 and I am almost 61 now. There are just a few things that I stay away from (fava beans being one of them) and any medicines containing sulfa. I have no idea if fava beans would effect me but I am fine if I never find out. You should do a blood test and see how much g6pd enzyme you got. If you have some then you have some tolerance for it.\n\nSome tolerance for fava beans but perhaps not for henna. \n\ng6pd cannot go away.", "Onset of hemolytic anemia So I have gad trouble finding answers to this elsewhere online, but how quickly does a hemolytic episode begin after consuming a triggering food?\n\nI have had what I think may have been episodes in the past (hot flashes, upset stomach, dizziness, blurry vision, weakness, etc.) and am trying to figure out if there is a way to tell what foods triggered this, if it was in fact an episode. I also seem to eventually be able to drink some water and sleep and wake up feeling okay, so I am guessing this means my body has been able to replenish its RBC count while I slept? From my own experience, I happens within the first 5 minutes of eating the trigger (in my case a bite of fava bean falafel). I have a mild g6pd so most triggers on the list does not affect me.\n\nAs for what happens if you have a reaction depends on how strong your reaction is. If you start to turn purple or pale, and the symptom continues, head to the hospital and get an immediate transfusion. If it is just weakness and such, you might be able to wait it out (I went to the health center and waited around 1hr to be absolutely sure it is not worsening).\n\nHope this helps. Just logged in to say, you should not be using aspirin!  Any pharmacist or Dr should be able to verify people with g6pd should not be on it.  From what I understand, the severity of the episode has more to do with how well your body can recover from it.

Recently though, I started to get many symptoms and had to go to the hospital. The doctors are still trying to figure out what caused it, and so am I. Recently I have not taken anything I am not supposed to, like aspirin or fava beans. The only thing that I can think of is the disposables of been using. For the past three weeks I have been using lemon mint flavored myle minis only, and only those. I have used that flavor before, but not as much. Like maybe one pack or two. I usually buy enough to last me for around 3-4 weeks, which I have enough with 3 packs. For reference each pack comes with two disposables, 200 puffs each. So basically I had 6 lemon mint myle minis in the past 3-4 weeks. This is the first time that I buy all packs the same flavor, usually I mix it which is why I am a little bit skeptical. So could those lemon mint myle minis have caused it?

It really depends on how much fava beans you actually ate. But if your G6PD deficiency were chronic, you would not have gotten such a mild reaction I do not think. \n\nI do not know how the medical system in your country works, but it might be good to have your G6PD deficiency noted somewhere, since it oftentimes entails problems with some drugs. It was probably a  mild hemolysis I  highly recommend that you see your doctor and even a hematologist.  If you have G6PD deficiency, you will need to not only learn all you can on what to avoid regarding medications and foods, but if you have any children, they will likely inherit it.  When babies with G6PD are born, there is the potential that they suffer severe jaundice just a day or two after birth. Called Kernicterus. This condition causes the bilirubin (dead red blood cells) to cross the blood/brain barrier and the children can go from healthy and perfect, to severely brain damaged for LIFE. Also, if you ever need an operation, or become sick and need medication, the hospital MUST know what you cannot take.  Even some antibiotics can put you into hemolytic anemia which can kill you if your blood levels go too low.  I am 62 and have learned all I can about the condition, and yet I experienced things like emergency surgery where I had my hematologist ready to give me a transfusion if needed and it WAS needed.

I enjoyed reading all of your posts and am grateful I stumbled upon all of this information! \n\nNow the rest of what I am about to say may be TRIGGERING so please proceed with caution if you choose to read...\n\nI was diagnosed as I began testing for recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) after my last miscarriage this year. I have experienced 4 miscarriages over about a 2 year period. My sister also has the deficiency but had no issues carrying my nephew so this may not be your experience. One of the possible causes of miscarriages is low glutathione and my OBGYN is suspecting that may be the issue with me. Unfortunately, not many providers in my state are well versed with G6PD deficiency so this is all an educated guess as to the cause of RPL.\n\nI started taking liposomal glutathione, NAC, ALA, whole food prenatal (methylated folate &amp; B12), CoQ10, selenium, and I changed my diet to exclude foods that may be a trigger as my last pregnancy resulted in me feeling very unwell up until the loss. \n\nRight before I miscarried earlier this year, I realized my eyes were mildly yellow as I experienced abdominal pain around my spleen, liver, and some joint pain. I ate a plant based diet because i figured that would prevent me from miscarrying but I ate a LOT of different kinds of beans, legumes, and processed vegan food. Basically food that was on the do no consume list. No energy, complete fatigue, but then again I have been feeling that way for YEARS. I just thought I was depressed. \n\nSo now that I have started the supplements above my entire life has changed! I feel like a new woman with less brain fog/more energy but I mostly want to know:\n\n(1) Was anyone diagnosed in adulthood and did you experience any difficulty carrying to term? I realize everyone is different just curious...I am giving my body a year off to heal myself but just want to know if anyone else has experienced these issues. \n\n(2) If so....Did supplementation help you? Did you experience any issues with pea protein? I tried to reintroduce pea protein in my diet but became more anemic which confused me bc i did not see it on any list no-no\u2019s, so I went back to a Whole Foods diet, no processed foods, low carb, minimal meat consumption diet. My new daily protein shake is made of hemp and I have had no issues. \n\nThank you if you read this far! I was diagnosed in my twenties. I have never been pregnant so I cannot comment on that, however my uterus is prolapsing and it is causing all kinds of complications when combined with g6pd anemia. I need iron infusions every 6 months or so,  but i feel like i can flip a truck for a few weeks after.  I am vegetarian as going full vegan makes me sick from all the restrictions for g6pd. I will say that NAC is a life saver and having any medical person that knows about g6pd is a plus. My wife is vegan, she has a pea protein powder and it made me nauseous for a while when i tried it.  It could be a coincidence but I do not know.  Take what works for and does not make you sick. Thank you for your reply!

I also prefer CBD in small dosages throughout the day. I cannot take THC for some reason it does not agree with my body. LDN prescription is made at a compound pharmacy. The therapeutic dosage it is usually 4.5 mg. Doctors usually start with 1 mg and slowly up the dosage within 2/3 weeks. Some people feel the benefit during the first few weeks others after a few months. I felt a difference within a month, so that is why I do not have to take pain meds like I like I used to. My thanks for the great advice and explanation above. I will check out LDN and ask my Dr about it. I was going some reading on LDN a few moments ago and it found that some patients could settle inflamation after it is been taken and weened off after a period of time. Is this how you understand it as well?\n\nCan tissue ever heal completely if it is been through trauma through exercises or physical therapy or is it all about management now?\n\nWould LDN also help with central nervous system issues as well or purely immune system?\n\nShould I also consider a Keto diet, or should I get myself checked for food intolerance to see what I can and cannot eat?\n\nThank you again for the great advice About the LDN: Low-dose naltrexone has been used off-label for treatment of chronic pain and inflammation in multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease, fibromyalgia, and other diseases. Some people take it long term. I personally did not have too much faith on taking it but was really surprised on how effective and life changing it has been for me.\n\nLDN has helped my chronic pain, nerve pain, and I have a pretty bad immune system, LDN has not fixed that part for me but, I do not want to take steroids meds at this moment for my immune system. I am have been maintaining not sure if the LDN has something to do with that. I consider LDN a maintenance medication. \n\nI have tried everything you can think of. Chiropractor, physical therapy (made my pain and inflammation worse) all kind of electrical stimulation of muscles. Nothing helped but the LDN, Diclofenac 75 mg, and CBD. That is my cocktail.\n\nAbout your diet. Start by checking food allergies, I think an ENT Doctor can do those tests. That is the one that did all mine. I am allergic to a few things and came to find out that most of those things I already disliked because I could not tolerate eating them, like Garlic amongst other things.\n\nDo not make all the drastic changes at once. Start slowly but please do not deprive yourself. That is not the goal. Just start by cutting off processed foods whenever possible. I found out throughout my journey that eating clean nutritious food is expensive so that is what I suggest you start with things like cutting your sugar intake like sodas and white flour anything. \nI did work with a nutritionist for about 8 months so that is why I suggest what I mentioned above.\nI personally do not call it a diet but a change on eating habits. Do something you can sustain because you do not want to put yourself in the position that you cannot enjoy life. I do not smoke, I do not drink alcohol, I only use real butter, drink unsweetened almond milk but I was already doing those things before I started my journey. Look into anti inflammatory diet for beginners so you can have an idea what to stay away from.\n\nIf your current Dr is not familiar or comfortable prescribing LDN then find a Dr that has experience with it. Wish you the best on your journey\u2026  Have you also used or heard of Polysaccharides from fucoidan, aloe and lions mane mushroom, and copper, when used in these kinds of cases? I have used the Lions Mane Mushroom Supplements for a few months did not get any relief. I tried the Copper for two months and it did not work for me. Polysaccharides are found in \ncereal, cornmeal, pretzels, flours, oats, instant noodles, pasta, rice. Potato, corn. Also, it is found in small amounts in other root vegetables and unripe fruit. That being said all those foods I have listed were foods the Nutritionist told me were not good for me. She told me not eat those type of foods often. I have never tried the polysaccharide fucoidan as a supplement in the pill form. It sounds like you have gone through everything I am trying to go through now and really appreciate getting back to me on this one. Was the nutritionist also against taking large doses of Beta Carotene if she ever told you if it is good or not for inflammation? Beta-carotene is referred to as Pro-Vitamin A because it is converted into Vitamin A as the body requires it. I take Vitamin A 10,000 IU every  other day because my PCP and the Nutritionist were alarmed after checking my blood for vitamins levels. I was taking too much even though it was one time a day the dosage was too high and since it is fat soluble one can experience hypervitaminosis. Never knew about getting sick from taking high dosage of vitamins. Through those tests I found out I was low on vitamin D3. I personally tell you that Beta Carotene or Vitamin A only helped me with my immune system and made my skin flawless along with vitamin C. It did not help my inflammation at all. I have used a lot of supplements in the past because I was trying to find relief from my aches and pain. Turmeric (Curcumin) is the supplement that helped with inflammation and pain but it started making sick so I sadly had to discontinue taking it. Maybe it works for you. Any supplements that you want to take make sure that you understand the side effects before you start taking it. Also, there is an App/website called Drugs.com they have an option called interactions were you can add all your medications and check if there are bad interactions. That App has saved me a few times from allergic reactions. So many things to consider and I appreciate your thoughtful reply. I can see you have been in this space for a while and really hope you come out of it too.\n\nIs it best to go to a pain specialist with all of the info and they tell you what to try first or do you think I should try the natural options first like copper and the other mushroom one Fiucition and then go down big pharma like the low dose option.\n\nDo you see the LDN having an impact long term or would the low dose help get you back on track? Try the natural stuff first. Whatever supplements you decide to try I suggest you do it for up to 90 days so you can really assess if it is beneficial to you. By the time I had to see a Pain Management Dr for my herniated disk on my lower back I already had tried a whole list of supplements, I had been through physical therapy (no results, inflammation and pain got worse), saw a Chiropractor (no improvement), had tried different meds and prescription balms for pain  without success. So my last resort was the pain management Dr. I will be getting a nerve block injection in the next few weeks. The reason the Pain Dr offered me that it is because I had tried everything possible without sustainable success. I like to paint and design but my injuries are stopping me from living my best life. I have the pain on my ankle and knee under control by taking the LDN, CBD, a Diclofenac 75 mg cocktail so I am looking forward getting the MRI for my back done next week so I can get my  blocking injection procedure. Thanks for that. Would the pain specialist also recommend natural stuff or best to try them first before you book the appointment? Did you also try McKenzie Method physio for your knee and ankle? I was never a candidate for the McKenzie method (MDT) because I have combat injuries so the military does things very differently. I suggest you try the natural route before you see the pain Dr because most Dr are not fans of treatment with supplements or alternative medicine. Some pain Drs like to treat inflammation with steroids like Medrol (methylprednisolone) but in my case I am not a fan of that medication because it suppresses the immune system and I got sick easily wherever I took it for the required 21 days.\nIf you do not know how serious is the problem you are having with the elbow see a Dr as soon as possible so maybe you can get an MRI. Will do and I really appreciate all of your help. The ankle a d elbow, although painful is the lesser issue for me. The bigger on is the head pain and tension, neck pain and tension and tinnitus after having a chiro neck adjustment several years ago. :(\n\nI also want to give my thanks to you for your service. Thank you. Just want to let you know that blocking injections are also given in the neck for the type of issue you described. Just make sure you go to a reputable Dr and do your research as far the Dr ratings. The neck is very delicate and physical therapy/neck adjustment can sometimes make the situation worse. If you get migraines due to your neck problem ask your PCP if is possible for you to try taking Sumatriptan for the onset of your headaches. That medication is used for tension headaches/migraines  I am unable to see your message on Reddit but I read it on my email. You asked about the Boron 3 mg. Yes! Take it and make sure it is in its purest form, either Chelated or Glycinate for major absorption. Thanks for letting me know. May I ask which you think I should start with from the below if you had to choose one or two \n\nCopper\nFucoidan\nLions Mane\nMagnesium\nVitamin D\nCalcium \nBeta Carotene\nBoron\nIodine\nB12\n\nThis is basically based on my symptoms of neck pain and tension, head pain and pulsating headaches when triggered, and tinnitus. I was hoping it may help with some of my other injuries like tennis elbow, golfers elbow, and a sprained ankle  CFL partial tear. Start with one at time so in case you have a reaction you will be able to pin point the cause. I would start with Boron 3 mg. If you do not feel any improvement you can up to 6 mg. For reference be advised that 9 mg is the highest mg a human can take per day of Boron. Do not take more than 6 mg. Boron helps with arthritis, bone growth and maintenance, central nervous system function, cancer risk reduction, hormone facilitation (in your case Testosterone), immune response, and inflammation. Take a multivitamin while taking the Boron as it helps the body activate vitamins and minerals. After 2 weeks you will probably be able to see if it is working. I suggest you talk to your PCP about your tension headaches. You should be referred to a Neurologist about the headaches to rule out any other issues that you are probably not aware of. I say this because I suffer from migraines and I never thought that my sinus infections and a head injury years ago contributed to my migraines issues until the Neurologist ordered a CT Scan. That CT Scan showed the damage the sinus infections did along with other stuff. So basically you must rule out that those headaches are not caused by something else before you continue adding any other supplements. Indeed and thanks for the great advice! I have gone down to a few specialists already and have the following conditions, cervical radiculopathy, cervogenic headache, occipital neuralgeia, central sensitisation, and I think that is it from memory.

Hi! The only food that you have to avoid are fava beans, so remember this and go on with your diet with no problems! Thanks for your advice! Is there a specific book and/or diet plan that you would recommend for weight loss and weight gain for us? I am not an expert on diets :) but we G6PD people are not different from anyone else on this matter, I think you should just follow a good diet that do not includes fava beans. too general but do not forget to buy multivitamins to cover up your deficiencies. you do not want to end up with stretch marks or with other conditions. they help with the mood as well. What would you recommend? Normal balanced diet I say OP.\n\nI have g6dp and I have eaten fava beans many times. Not sure why I have not had a reaction \ud83d\ude2c\n\nHas anyone had a reaction? This depends on how much you want to invest. Multivitamins might all look the same on the label behind but the more you can spend the better. Their difference is the absorption rate. Bad quality vitamins do have the nutrients shown but not in the form that the human body can absorb. I recommend you to choose something out of the 4-5 star multivitamin on Amazon that is on discount. Otherwise Optimum Nutrition vitamins are my suggestion. Trust me you do not really want stretch marks and bad mood due to deficiencies. Low carb-diets are also causing depression. \n\n\nI had three times horrible surgeries and I could barely walk however I did manage to lose some weight by walking 1 hour a day slowly and eating mainly breaded chicken + eggs + no carbs 4 times a day at about 1200 calories. I have never heard of a diet with tofu and soya beans and that makes me think you are looking at the wrong places. Those dieticians try to reinvent the wheel by coming up with new exciting things that are not better than the standard MEAT/EGGS(+ a bit of fat) + VEG + LOW/NO CARBS. Basic recipe that grants you good amount of nutrients and keeps you full for many hours. Eat blunt tofu and 1.5 hour later, you will be staring at the fridge. From my understanding the hemolysis that is triggered by eating fava beans depends on a lot of factors (including your diet, health, other factors). Also, the reaction would not be a reaction like a typical allergic reaction, but would likely follow after a meal and could (in a mild case) lead to lethargy, weakness, or tiredness. I have personally never had a reaction, but that is my understanding of what to expect from a mild hemolytic event. YES! Diet wise, it is always best to err on the side of caution, however there are a few things you can look at to help you build a better diet with G6PD deficiency in mind.\n\n1. macronutrients \n   1. protein \n   2. fat \n   3. sugar\n\nSince G6PD deficiency is mainly a problem concerning the penthose pathway for glucose specifically, too much sugar in most types of G6PD people will increase oxidative load which may hasten hemolysis.   \nMy suggestion is to eat more protein than fat and more fat than sugar. Most amino acids a part from Lysine and Leucine are glucogenic so after they will turn to alpha-ketoglutarate will then turn in to glucose and will then help replenish your glycogen storages.   \n\\*\\*tyrosine is both ketogenic and glucogenic. \n\nA lot of the time people with G6PD need more protein than most others as well as protein is the chief way to increase lean body mass.   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n2. Micronutrients  \nStock up on Vitamin D since Vitamin D is responsible for activating the g6pd gene and is also a steroid hormone that helps regulate a litany of hormones and processes in your system including your testosterone. ( University of Rochester Medical Center. \"Vitamin D Protects Cells From Stress That Can Lead To Cancer.\" ScienceDaily. ScienceDaily, 13 May 2008. &lt; )   \n\n\nIf you are taking Vitamin D, then you may want to consider taking vitamin K to help with tissue decalcification and also because Vitamin D and K interact to help with bone health ( ( )   \n\n\nVitamin K also helps with testicular, kidney and prostate health.. so you may want to check if you are doing what you can to get it from enough food sources. ( ( )  \nWatch out with this vitamin since it depends on your calcium status as well as how well you can convert some forms of this vitamin to the other more usable form since it is a family of molecules. Also.. having a polymorphic VCOR1 genetic variant that does not favor your conversion of any K1 forms to K2 forms G6PD may worsen side effects since the oxidoreductase enzyme required for this vitamin is, you guessed it, dependent on NAPDH (which we do not produce enough of) \n\nVitamin B1   \nThiamin is reaaaally needed for sugar consumption and glucose conversion \n\nVitamin B2   \nRiboflavin is REALLLY needed for Glutathione recycling and fat energy extraction. People with G6PD need a larger amount of this vitamin since it reduces oxidative stress without hampering strength gains, since it seems to have a natural cut-off for its own activity as well as the average human body (yours might be more or less) can only absorb about 27mg at a time.   \n\n\nRiboflavin is broken down in to FAD and FMN and G6PD people use a crap ton of FAD to clean up the excess amount of oxidized Glutathione \n\n ( \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n (   \n\n\nHaving G6PD is a kin to having a really bad MTHFR genetic polymorphism ( ( ) Vitamin B2 helps relieve some of the stress that may be caused as far as migraines and mood stabilization ( ( ) \n\nVitamin B3\n\nIf you are eating more protein usually your body will convert excess tryptophan in to niacin, \n\nG6PD causes the reduction of the phosphate form of this vitamin NADPH, NADPH is reaaaaallllyyyyyy important in activating enzymes such as the ones in the biopterin pathway( ( ) --&gt;I call it the yum yum pathway.. since it activates erections and that feel good dopamine   \n\n\nThe main problem with G6PD is that we cannot convert many things in to other things we need so we often need all the other supporting cofactors to come prepackaged or for the thing to be easily available upon consumption.  Also most detoxifying metabolisms are regimented through NADPH dependent pathways as well as the antioxidant pathways which are HEAVILY dependent on NADPH.   \n\n\nI found a few nutritionists have helped me understand the mechanisms with useful tools.   \n1. Chris Masterjohn. --&gt; ( ( )  \n2. Rhonda Patrick  --&gt; (( )\n\nHope this helps! This diet seems to work for me too. but I eat about 3500 cals. I really appreciate your detailed reply. At one stage I went to the g6pdeficiecy site and the foods and medicine to avoid as an endless list which made me think that a normal diet is impossible based on not being able to eat most of the stables that the human body needs - or at least i thought that was the case. I also wanted to ask you about Vitamin C and Soy Lecithin. There appear to be great benefits with these type vitamins and nutrients. Are we still able to consume them? Do you recommend a specific multivitamin that contains the above vitamin s that you mentioned ? I will also check out the two references at the end as well. Vitamin C is used in the glutathione pathway with NADPH. Because G6PD slows down glutathione recycling and vitamin C helps with that metabolism. But if you have trouble with the penthose pathway, oxidized left overs of ascorbic acid stay in your system. The good part is...with more fat than sugar you will produce more glutathione from the g4px system which means you will be able to tolerate more vitamin C. \n\nMain take away vitamin C yes but with more fat. \n\nAs far as supplements...I stick to 3 things...natural factors B vitamins since all of the vitamins are coenzymated..  vitamin D. Trophic factors makes  good one . And a Good B2 non coenzymated for extra measure. \n\nBonus for thiamin if you are planning on eating a lot of sugars that day..cause you need to schedule a cheat day. \nSoy lecithin... Hit or miss for me, but you should try it and see what works for you. I usually try to stay away from soy products since some soy products also contain phytonutrients that some people with G6PD cannot metabolize. Try to avoid things with nutrients that cause a hormetic effect on the immune system. The whole concept behind hormesis is to poison the body a little so it can super compensate later..Lacking enough NADPH will lower your tolerance to these chemicals because of the lowered ability to clean these from your body. Thanks for the great information here. I am astonished by the level of detail. May I ask what your eating day would look like from breakfast till dinner? Hmmm.. well..I work out on the daily..so bear that in mind.\n\nI will start my day with \n6 eggs and 800g chicken hearts\n6g of mct oil+ vitamin D+ vitamin B complex\n1 avocado\n\nNoon\n800g of extra lean bifteck\n\nPre workout\n.5g of KAL bone meal+ 0.05g of Creatine + 3g of citrulline\nWorkout 2hrs\n\nPost workout meal\n25g Egg protein powder + 2.5g of bcaa + vitamin B2\n\nAt night I have some 10g of glycine with 10g of collagen to help with sleep\n\n\nWith trial and error..you can see what is best for you. For me this worked since I also have another type of anemia that drains my energy storages. \n****\nI forgot to mention you if you are going to have Vitamin C then you can lower your need for it by having vitamin E since it recycles used up ascorbic acid HI, I also have G6pd. as someone who shares the most common genetic deficiency, many people do not know they have, I have gone down the rabbit hole of research.  had to break down the WHY and WHAT leading to no to low salicylate foods. Salicylates are naturally found in all foods but to varying degrees also high nitrate foods are a no-no. spinach ect, most foods in the nightshade family, eggplant, tomatoes ect. I went from any allergies.. ah nope to ...Yes, this will take a minute. also, there is a website the G6pd Association that was helpful re meds we can and cannot have.\n\nThere are foods that are an absolute NO for us. like fava beans, tonic water, blueberries but there are foods in the 'why' that we also have to avoid like peanuts, almond,  tomato paste, broccoli, capsicum ( think lectin-free diet &amp; Autism diet re anti-inflammatory ) avocados, most fruit.. as a health science student, It is worrying regarding the nutrient content we can actually have!\n\n so I am careful to supplement where possible, mainly with daily smoothies. the link below is to the salicylate free cookbook and also has a PDF on what foods are  0 - high in Salicylates ( however this can vary due to farming practices, environment etc) but I have found I feel pretty good following it, just sad about having to give up some of my favorite things...wine, almond milk, broccoli,.\n\nI have also looked at the 0 - low and made recipes from it. beef stew, cabbage rolls, shortbread. \n\nalso while it says processed flour is ok for as we know that white processed flour and sugar is NOT ok generally so I replace it with SPELT flour. a nonhybridized grain,  more nutrients and have found it a reliable replacement. It is really about looking at the why and what then working from there.  Inflammation and stress can be an impediment to proper body function and therefore weight loss. Hope this helps!\n\n(", "Do you guys eat raisins and other dried fruit? I decided to look at the ingredients of this pack of dried fruits that I had bought.

I am wondering if alcohol has a bad effect on G6PD patients . I drink occasionally and I do not notice anything bad Apparently with G6PD, our body lack an enzyme to break down alcohol. From what I understand it is definitely harmful to take in too much alcohol if you have G6PD and it is not recommended. I do take alcohol once in awhile, but it seems fine. Though too much can be dangerous. I cannot tolerate alcohol. As in 1 beer makes me feel ill (not in a drunk way). Whether this is g6pdd related, who knows. I do not know where you got your information, but G6PD people do not have any problem with alcohol (at least, not more than any other person). I learned it in my nutrition and biochemistry module.. With that said, I am sure it varies for everyone with g6pd. trigger factors do not vary between people, at most certain persons have a more severe deficiency than other while others can have a super light deficiency, meaning that they can eat fava beans (the only food that can cause a reaction) without consequences.\n\nI am not sure why your module said something like that, but it is definitely wrong. You can Google it up. Effects of ethanol on G6PD :-) google is not a good source for medical information :)\n\nedit: after having a look I found ( article that says something like that: \n\n&gt;In conclusion, the present study suggests that patients with G6PD deficiency should avoid ethanol intake. If they consume any ethanol, they should not be administered oxidant drugs such as analgesics and antipyretic, which frequently inhibit G6PD activity \n\nnote that it does not say that ethanol will cause a reaction all by itself, but that it might cause some problem when mixed with certain drugs. anyway, it is known that G6PD deficient people should avoid certain drugs, alcohol or not.\n\nnow it is your turn to google stuff. \n\nI suggest you to go with research such as ( \n\n&gt;very few articles have examined the safety of other food ingredients and food additives for people with G6PD deficiency. Some articles that associated specific foods with hemolysis appeared to be speculative and based on limited information. The objective of this review was to examine the association between foods, including food additives, and the triggering factors of acute hemolysis. The literature was searched for studies and case reports on food consumption and G6PD deficiency. In this review, fava beans were found to be the only food for which there is conclusive clinical evidence linking the risk of hemolytic anemia to individuals with G6PD deficiency\n\nor (\n\n&gt;Only 38 articles, describing 14 different types of food or chemical, were found (a full list of the articles retrieved can be obtained by contacting S.W.H.L.). We noted that only the consumption of fava beans or food cross\u2010contaminated with fava beans, as well as the use of naphthalene and aniline dyes, were consistently associated with haemolysis.\n\nor read something like ( interview with an hematologist that studied G6PD. I will translate the relevant part: \n\n&gt;**Many say that you should not only avoid fava beans, but also green peas, beans, chickpeas, lentils, shells and soy. Other say to avoid red wine, blueberries and drinks with quinine, like tonic water and some liquors. Personally I only avoided fava beans, did I risk something?**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;You did the right thing, since fava beans are the only food that can trigger hemolysis. Here we enter the field of anecdotal: there is no data that show that an hemolysis can trigger for any of those foods. Since few decades ago, fava beans were bags containing something unknow: we knew they could trigger an hemolysis, but we did not know why. Today we know that it happens due to two substances that have clear names and chemical structures: vicina e convicina \\. Those substances are present only in fava beans, other legumes do not contain them, or they have only negligible traces. It is a shame that in many websites, especially from the United States, is happening something that I would almost call psychological terrorism about soy, something that is everywhere as an addictive: this is a totally unjustified alarm.

The scariest thing is I sent an enquiry to Japan Rail if the chemical they use for cleaning the trains contains naphthalene. They replied yes, liquid napthalene, mothballs, camphors, all 3. I tried to rationalise it with so much traffic going through the train, the chance of any residue remaining would be very low.

Did you ever take the bullet trains?\n\nI have contacted enough accomodations in Japan to qualify myself as a keyboard expert in accomodations, 97% of them uses mothballs either themselves or the third party vendor they use.\n\nI confirm this with my Japanese friends and she agrees, it is used prevalently and in her words she is not sure if I would ever be able to find a place which does not use it. I was stationed in misawa Japan for 4 years.  I have cousins that live in Tokyo and would visit them monthly by train. I never had an issue while there. I stayed in hotels, got tattoos, took the trains, ate the food. I had no problems as long as I did not eat what I already knew to avoid. Being exposed to naphthalene (the main ingredient in moth balls, carpeting, some paints) can trigger hemolysis for some people with G6PD Deficiency. My best educated guess would be the variants of G6PD Deficiency who are also susceptible to Favism (fava bean induced hemolysis). I got severe hemolytic anemia and ITP two years ago from being exposed to naphthalene in paint). I had bruises from head to toe (even on my tongue), had bleeding gums, bleeding from eyes, and ears, I had trouble breathing, I was jaundiced, my liver enzymes were elevated and I got severe pancreatitis, my hemoglobin dropped down to 8 and my platelets dropped down to 3,000 and normal is 150,000 . It was one of the scariest things I have ever experienced. I had to get two plasma transfusions and 4 biologic med infusions. Now I take precautions like wearing face masks when I am out in public and I have made my landlord aware that I cannot be around this chemical. If I were you, I would not take the risk of having a hemolytic crisis while traveling. Just wear a mask like a lot of people do anyways in Asian countries.", "How do I wear my G6PD identification? A few years ago, I ordered a medical bracelet that was supposed to identify me as G6PD deficient, and it never came.  I had forgotten all about it until I joined this community.\n\nI have been looking for some sort of bracelet, necklace, or symbol for a tattoo (I have 6 tattoos, all from the same shop, so I am not afraid to get one).\n\nWhere should I look for one, and what should I have it say?  It would be nice if I could get something stylish OR low profile, but obviously it is more important to me for it to be straight forward about my condition. honestly I never heard of symbols or anything that would identify you as a G6PD deficient person.. but you could put some note in your documents that say \"G6PD Deficient\". So if anything happens to you, whoever help you and take you to the hospital might notice it. This can be very important because some drugs could induce an hemolytic crysis. The military gave me red dog tags... You could get something similar made dirt cheap.

I have the Asian variant of G6PD, but I do not understand what the implications are.\n\nFor example, it seems like the same list of food and medication sensitivities applies for all G6PD.  (Of course, there are variations because individual people are all different, but this does not sound like it is necessarily related to the type of variant.) The only difference I was ever told by hematologists is that some variants constantly hemolyze while others only do it in response to stressors like fava beans or anti-malarials. I likely have one of the two variants that constantly has low-level hemolysis, so I have been on folic acid supplements to help my body generate new red blood cells. Thank you for explaining! The constant haemolysis is still in response to something. I will let you come to your own conclusion about what it could be responding too. G6PD is not complex at all.", "Oxford-AstraZeneza Vaccine Firstly I want to say this community has been so active since the vaccine rollout in many countries. So grateful and happy for everyone that updated us with their shots. \n\nI am seeing mainly Pfizer and Moderna vaccine takers. \n\nUK today has announced that under 30s will be given alternatives to the Oxford-AstraZeneza shots, which came to me as great news as I was worried about the blood clots.

Has anyone here ever had issues with their wisdom teeth removal? I asked my doctor which medications I will be given for my wisdom teeth removal later this month and am considering postponing the surgery. \nI was told I will be given:\n- Decadron(dexamethasone)\n- Versed(midazolam)\n- Propofol\n- Fentynal\nApparently the first two should not be taken by those with g6pd deficiency so I was curious if anyone else had issues and/or suggestions I have personally had no issues. Surely if you tell the doctor you are g6pd deficient they will not give you anything you should avoid. I do not think you should postpone the surgery. I had gastric bypass surgery two years ago.  Day of they had to revise the protocol for putting me under because the anesthesiologist did not realize I had G6PD.  He and my surgeon told me they were going to knock me out \"the old fashioned way.\"  The result was pretty bad nausea when I woke up.  But I woke up! Is it all four or just one? I have always just gotten a local anesthetic and the doctor sited my g6pd as the reason. I am getting all 4 removed :( I will be going in to talk to the doctor tomorrow I have had teeth removed but I have never been put under for any dental procedures. When I had my wisdom teeth removed, I did not know that I have G6PD Deficiency. Although now I realize why I reacted so badly to the Penicillin, Benzocaine, and Vicodin I was prescribed. I had to get a root canal about two years ago and my dentist used the benefits over risks when it came to my treatment. I had to get medical clearance from my Hematologist because I have G6PD Deficiency, Beta Thalassemia, and I was being treated for ITP during that time. I had a severe infection (which is a bigger trigger for me than most contraindicated medications are). So my dentist prescribed me Erythromycin prior to my root canal. He used codeine and the lowest dosage of lidocaine he could use to perform the root canal while keeping me comfortable (although now I am wondering why he did not use laughing gas or something comparable \ud83e\udd14). He did not prescribe me Dexamethasone because I was already taking Prednisone as I also have Lupus. He did not prescribed me anything for pain to use at home and told me to eat ice/ice cream instead. I had to get a couple of stitches, but the pain was not too bad overall. I am currently on a low dose Fentanyl pain patch for chronic pain and I have not had any hemolytic crises from it. I recently got an cortisone injection and forgot to tell the pain specialist that I cannot use lidocaine. Well it triggered a severe hemolytic crisis unfortunately \ud83d\ude1e. I am jaundiced, my spleen is enlarged, I am short of breath, have upper back pain, and I am anemic. I am not sure if small therapeutic levels of lidocaine are okay for people with G6PD Deficiency or if the reason why I did not notice any hemolysis during my root canal was because I was already anemic from the ITP.

All I am concerned about is if my eating habits and general lifestyle will noticeably change. Up to this point I have never even heard of broad beans. Hi and sorry for the late reply! I have had G6PD all my life and had a hemolytic crisis from broad beans but all of the other stuff that you find on the internet that is supposed to also be bad never had an effect on me (chickpeas, vitamin C, legumes). I usually stick to what the doctor orders; ie no broad beans at all, and avoiding certain medications (anti malarials, some antibiotics), and so far no issues :)  The military tests for G6PD because anti-malaria tablets they issue before a deployment can potentially cause an anemic episode in those who have the deficiency. You will receive a special dog tag or identifier, and you should not be issued anti-malaria tablets for a deployment or overseas TDY. Be careful of what you read about G6pd, there is an amazing amount of bullshit out there. Stick to what doctors say. Lots of very credible looking website are full of terrible information.  I agree....lack of evdence based information and bullshit was what prompted me to start this subreddit in the first place!\n", "Symptom recovery? Hi, \n\nMy doctor thinks that I am G6PD deficient. I took an antibiotic (fluoroquinilones). My body reacted very badly. I now feel dizzy, short of breath, looking a little\npale. While some days are better than others, I generally feel kind of blah. I am doing the blood test tomorrow, but I just want to ask the people who have had symptoms, how long before they recovered from the situation? I was reading that it usually takes a few weeks. \n\nAny help/advice would be greatly appreciated.  Hi! \n\nSorry to hear about your reaction to the antibiotics! Depending on how severe the hemolysis was, if you have recovered from your initial infection, your age, physical condition, etc, it might take a few weeks to go back to 100 % as your bone marrow needs to replace your used up RBCs and lost iron. \n\nDid the doctor prescribe  iron supplements? transfusion? If you do not mind me asking of course! I do not think the hemolysis was that severe, again, the doctor is speculating based on my reaction and the information I gave her. I have a family history of G6PD. We are doing the blood test to confirm. I am 28, I was fairly healthy prior to all of this, exercised regularly, ate regularly, have a healthy liver, healthy level of RBC and haemoglobin. The doctor did not prescribe a transfusion, or iron supplements, but I am taking some methyl folate. \n\nWhen we get the blood results we will go from there. Generally, I just feel tired all the time. Headaches, brain foggy, muscles ache, abdominal pain, and I have loss of color to my face and body. \n\nI was prescribed IV fluids. That helped a little :-)  I know its been ages but thought to ask how the treatment and diagnosis went?\n\nWere you positive for g6pd  deficiency?\n\n\n", "Exercise and Eating Correct Foods Hi,\n\nI am G6PD Deficient Nd have always had a problem with gaining weight when exercising.\n\nMy aim was always to building muscle/mass but find it hard due to not being able to eat specific foods.\n\nWhat foods are easy to make to help me gain weight/muscle/mass whilst I exercise through kettlebells/bodyweight training, and running.\n\nI am 193cm and my current weight is 85.5kg.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nbp00 Welcome to my world! Honestly I tried everything (ate so much it I had IBS symptoms, took supplements and protein shakes, gained a few pounds then lost them within 10 days of holiday). \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat I found works was just sticking to going to the gym as a lifestyle/fitness goal, to get that rush, keep any anxiety at bay, and it helped, and in the process, I gained 6+ kgs over 1 year, not much, but they are much more resilient gains that take longer to melt away than Creatine gains. (which gave me a 4kg boost that melted within a week or so after stopping the gym!)\n Any quick and easy foods you recommend preparing for lunch to aid in muscle growth?  Sure! I usually go for dishes with a very high protein content, but with low amount of fat, and a decent portion of carbs. (the low fat keeps digestion easy and allows you to eat more but allows you to feed your body at the same time).\n\nA few easy and tasty favourites of mine are:\n\nSoup:  just chuck in veggies and pasta/orzo/rice and fish/chicken/meat (I usually buy frozen as its more convenient and cheaper) and some stock, water,  some fresh diced garlic and herbs and add heat, and its pretty much done. \n\nCurries: You can make a watery mild thai style curry or red curry or a full on indian curry, but that is also easy to make as you can get premade sachets, you just need to cook your protein and carbs. \n\nFor an even easier option, I sometimes just get 1 or 2 trouts, or 2 salmon fillets, or some chicken wings, add some simple seasoning, throw in the oven, serve with some salad and potatoes and done! :) \n\n\n\nWhat helped me as well is eating throughout the day; instead of eating 3 big meals that are each around 800ish calories, I eat 5 meals that are 500ish each. It works :) \n\n\n\nI hope that helps! ", "Is Vitamin C dangerous for us? I know that ascorbic acid is dangerous but what about vitamin c from vegetables and fruits? Should not we eat lemmon or pimiento? Depending on what research you read. I have had vitamin c supplements for years never had a problem, then stumbled on sites that said it is. \nAsk your doctor. \nYou cod just Google , you will see new researches that says vitamin c is not harmful Thanks. The reason why I am confused is because of the internet. Some says do not drink orange juice because of vitamin C, and some says do not take vitamin C pills, eat natural things. Internet is full of contradictions. And every doctor I went said different things. So I do not trust them either. Depends on many factors, severity of your g6pd deficiency, its type and etc. For me, my doctor told me I can eat 1 orange or lemon per week, but if I squeeze many and drink the juice it is not fine. Ask your doctor, it depends on many things. Our doctors usually do not know that much about g6pd. That is my opinion after having had many doctors over the years. They usually have less of an understanding of g6pd than I do and will usually look it up and regurgitate what is in their reference book. I feel that many strong antioxidants are bad for us.\n\nThat is what Sulfites, Fava Beans, Blueberries, Quinine and Vitamin C have in common. Our blood cells break down easily when exposed to strong antioxidants. Yeah, my current one knows a little more than others, but still checks these regular online sources to find out what is good and what is not. Not vitamin c but ascorbic acid found in like fruit juice etc avoid at all cost it is synthetic vitamin c. I use to drink vitamin water and I would feel like I was on fire it is 200% vitamin c You can have naturally occurring Blueberries. Artificial blue dye like  **Methylene blue** which is used to give blue color to processed foods should be avoided.", "G6PD Deficiency and COVID19 susceptibility  Still no concrete answer to our question... More research is definitely needed in regards to G6PD Deficiency and COVID19. G6PD deficiency is inherently a blood disease that leads to anemia and thus all of the side effects of anemia. Avoid diseases that could cause hemolysis or exacerbate other side effects of anemia. So yes, stay away from COVID 19. Some of the the known side effects of COVID 19 are consistent with the side effects of anemia.", "Covid Vaccine Hello people. Do you know if we can get the vaccine with our deficiency? Yes. You can read more ( Thanks Yes, you can. Did you get vaccine?", "Got my vaccine shot today (Pfizer) It is been about 10 hours since I got the shot, they injected me with 0.3ml of the Pfizer vaccine\n\nSo far I have not felt any side effects besides slight soreness around the area which is completely normal, I took allergy shots for years and always felt soreness in my arm after anyway so I can handle it :)\n\nI seen many people with G6PD asking if they can take the vaccine so I wanted to give my own experience, prior to taking it I did a lot of research online, asked my family doctor and even at the pharmacy where I got my shot and everyone said it should be fine My son with G6PD got his first Pfizer shot two weeks ago with no side effects but a sore arm. Ive gotten both Pfizer shots. No side effects but a sore arm both times. I have got both doses of Moderna- no problem. Same Hi.i have a G6PD too. And age 27. i think , i should get vaccine shot or not. Yes get it, millions of people in the world have G6PD and have gotten it", "Effects in female carriers In my country years ago I was told that I had g6pd (even though i was told that it is rare in females). Everytime i eat lentils, chickpeas or fava beans i get jaundiced for weeks. My baby son got tested for g6pd a few months ago and confirmed that he did not have it; meaning I cannot be fully ill either due to how X chromosome inheritance works. Hearing about this I went on a fava bean and lentil binge and got very ill, to the point of having abnormal liver function tests ans terrible jaundice. This is really puzzling me as I read before that females who are only carriers do not show symptoms. Are there any other females out here on this forum? I am keen to hear about your experiences.\n\nTldr: Female carrier having really bad reaction to lentils and fava beans. I thought carriers were not affected. Wondering if there are others out here like me? I am a female that carries two markers. If you listen to medical science this is supposed to be extremely rare, yet both I and my mother (and possibly other female descendants?) have two markers. I share this to say that there is still a lot of research that needs to be done in this area. You also cannot fully rely on things found on message boards and the like because everyone is experience is totally different. Some people think it is only fava bean related. Others have issues with all beans/legumes and the various other oddities. Listen to your body and keep a good journal. Thanks for your response! It is good to hear from other females who are in a similar situation as there is virtually nothing on the medical sites about this. I am guessing it is because it is a very underfunded and under researched topic. Especially in the country i now live in it appears to be extremely rare and every time I mention this to doctors they go \u201cyou are not male and you are an adult so you should be okay\u201d. It is quite frustrating as I would really like an evidence and science based approach to knowing what I should and should not avoid. I agree that it is very frustrating. It actually took several years before I was diagnosed because doctors never even thought to test me when I was experiencing really bad symptoms because I did not fit any of the scientific norms.\n\nI have even had some not great interactions on this board because people will swear up and down \u201cit is only fava bean related\u201d. My boyfriends mom is a carrier as well. My boyfriend got g6pd bit his brother do not. Never the less she still got the symptoms. So even if it is inherited x-chromosomal recessive you can still show symptoms.", "Found out I am G6PD deficient in bmt is it really something to be concerned about ? Lately I have been having weird health issues and I think I do not get enough oxygen in my blood stream. Could this be an affect? I also found out in BMT. It is good to know. Avoid fava beans and get more testing to see how severe you have it. Medical did not care when I asked. I hope you have a different experience Hey bro I also found out about g6pd about 5 years ago in bootcamp. The doctors there were not concerned at all then. I do not think they new much about it. I am going to get a referral to see a doc out in town for more testing. Been feeling fatigued every day lately. Been also reading about g6pd and cov19. I do not like what I am seeing. Strange.. I also found out 5yrs ago in bootcamp! Doctors (at least in the military) do not care. I had one of my PCM prescribed me nitrofurantoin and within 12hrs I was feeling it. Showed up to work and my coworkers told me I look like shit so I double check the prescription and called the clinic that I had G6PD and cannot be one this medication. Was put on hold for 45mins and they just said ops my bad. Just stop taking it. \n\nBest of luck to you man! Hope you can figure out more about it. shouldnt be a prob. only trigger is broad beans. a lot internet junk that says soy beans also trigger but I have been soy all my life and not have any issues. Also when eating malaria pills in bmt u should declare and they will give u a different pill to eat for malaria I, also, found out in bootcamp. I have been out of over 10 years. You should be fine.

I honestly feel like it is more about the foods that you ingest that can cause hemolysis yeah I am just concerned bc henna exists lol Salicylic acid is different from Aspirin which is acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) if that is what you are worried about. so is salicylic acid safe? i thought both were unsafe for g6pdd Just do not use henna lol I got henna done before and I am a carrier but I am honestly fine but do not use it !!! There is a Facebook group you can join it is called G6PD support group ! And it is got a picture of a dr that says G6PD  help the admins name is Beckie I am into skincare, and always gets a reaction when using SA (cleanser and leave on), I do not know if that is the g6pdd causing that,  but after experiencing with it for long time, I know SA is not for me. update: it is fine and it works well lol I am not sure. I am no chemist, but I think SA might be a bit different from ASA. Would love further discourse on this I think so too. It has a different structure/function (and thus name), even though it is a metabolite of ASA. Plus it is not even ingested.", "Is it safe to get the COVID Vaccinations? Does anyone know if the COVID Vaccines (i.e. pfizer, moderna, sinovac) safe for people with G6PD to use? They absolutely are. You can bet that hundreds if not thousands of people with G6PD have also likely already been through Phase 3 trials. See how mRNA vaccines work ( Okay thanks for the info! Wasnt sure if I wanted to get the vaccine because of this originally What about the people who do not have access to RNA vaccines? My country will buy vaccines from russia and they use the older type of vaccines. Until the Russian vaccine is scientifically proven effective, I would not be taking it regardless if I had G6PD or not. How can we be sure that ANYONE with G6PD has been through the vaccine trial? Because over 400 million people have the deficiency and phase 3 drug trials are conducted on diverse populations all over the world. That is still not enough, how do we know that they turned down people with G6PD for trial? 4/70=0.057\n\nI do not know. If you told me 6 out of every 100 people had G6PD, and about 300k got trials, that is not nothing, but it is still only 1800 people, and of those, only 1 in 10 has a severe hemolytic response, it is not quite enough for me to feel super safe. It is closer, but I am still nervous. I understand your concern, but the way the mRNA vaccine works, it attacks a specific protein structure in the virus. It has nothing to do with red blood cells or their production. The vaccine is perfectly safe for those with G6PD. You can read more about the vaccine ( I can assure you that you are more likely to get COVID-19 from some random person than have a hemolytic response to the vaccine. You can read more about what the vaccine does ( It has nothing to do with red blood cell production. I am looking forward to people on this thread getting the vaccine. The more people who have suffered a hemolytic attack receive the vaccine and then have no unexpected reactions, the better. What evidence do you have that there could possibly be a hemolytic response? Do you avoid trying new foods or drinks because you could have a response? What about detergents and household cleaners? Do you paint your house or work on your car? Do you breathe in fumes at the gas station or nail salon? Have you received any other vaccinations in your life?\n\nThe point is, despite all these foreign substances entering your body, you probably do not give them a second thought about having a hemolytic response UNLESS there is evidence to the contrary. I bet you do not avoid these things because there is a LACK of evidence. Over 30 million vaccinations have already been administered.\n\nThere are plenty of things in life to worry about. Vaccinations are not one of them. You are much safer with them than without them. G6PD has nothing to do with \"red blood cell production\" either. Rather it affects the longevity of the red blood cell. \n\nAnd you are in no position to give assurances for something you do not clearly understand, even if you are g6pd deficient yourself. Actually yes, I do avoid new things because I know how severely my reactions can get. I now suffer from kidney failure as a result of hemolytic attack (of course I did not know I was g6pd deficient because I lost kidney functions). So yes, this is a serious issue for some people. \n\nStop trivializing it. If you do avoid new things (not just food, but even that) because you are afraid of a reaction, then you probably have a condition in addition to your G6PD. Read the actual research on G6PD and you will find that there are very few triggers -- mainly just fava beans and malarial drugs.\n\nI am trivializing the vaccine. It should be trivial. Vaccinations are much safer than driving your car to work in the morning. The *vaccines* do not have any impact on red blood cell production. Nor will they cause any oxidative stress.\n\nYou are in no position to cast doubt on vaccinations -- something you do not clearly understand. You know there is a difference between statistics and reality right? Driving your car to work when it snows on a windy road is not the same as generally driving yourself to work. Not against vaccination, but for informed decisions. \n\nAnd no G6PD is not just about fave beans and malaria drugs. Scouring the few publications on the topic and the hospital and medical centers hosted websites listing food and drugs to avoid, I think caution is the name of the game when dealing with g6pd deficiency. Many of the authors writing about G6PD deficiency will also reference the need for caution. \n\nG6PD deficiency is a silent killer, because hemolysis crises happens only at the extreme, but hemolysis itself happens more often. Most people will be exposed to triggers but never feel a strong symptom because their exposure is not broad enough to create enough damage that becomes an acute anemia, but it is still there. So rather than confusing people by telling them to ignore the warnings, be humble about what you do not know.", "How safe are the mRNA vaccines for people with G6PD deficiency? Reading about the impacts of COVID on people with G6PD deficiency on people, I am now a little worried. I was waiting on Novavax due to some of the things I was hearing about myocarditis in young men (I am 19), but now I am sort of changing my mind a little. Any anecdotes?

Been vaccinated for 3+ months at this point We need a real change in the way\u00a0G6PD deficiency &amp; drug interactions are handled.   \nI am 25 and wondered this with G6PD too + I also have an issue with anaphylaxis to be addressed but I have already had COVID which thankfully was mild / more irritating than anything else and personally the flu is worse.  \n1 thing I suspect that would increase the chance of side effects is accidental IV injections instead of an IM injection as there appears to be a lack of knowledge/concern regarding the need to aspirate prior to\u00a0giving an IM injection.  Basically the medic giving\u00a0the vaccine should pull back the plunger to look for blood.  So personally I would ask the medic to aspirate prior to\u00a0giving an IM injection just to reduce the chance of bruising. Tiredness.\nHeadache..\nFever.\nNausea.\nDizziness. Thank you!

Same goes with some alternative crisps and snacks Everytime I buy meat substitutes I check the ingredients as good as I can to avoid giving beans to my bf. But thanks for the hint. I will be more careful in the future. What sort of reaction, and why do you think it is related to g6pd? Whole foods has a bunch of options, not just Beyond Meat,  and I have been eating them just fine for a while.

Eg I am sure someone somewhere makes fava bean patties. I agree. I will add it is better to eat real meat, if possible from a local organic farm! Meat is very important. Has all the amino acids you need. Precursors to dopamine and other body functions like GSH production I have had a impossible burger which is soy and I have had the beyond meat burger which was made of just peas. I am more concerned about the favs beans as chicken is really popular in America right now. I would not touch a Fava bean. I do not know anything about the impossible brand, as in Europe it is not available. But yeah stay away from everything else.

Always read what is in it. \n\n\nSame goes with medicines and the forbidden list Does \"pea flour\" have fava beans in it? (My son has G6PD so we have easily avoided fava beans but he has never reacted to peas or any other legumes). I have never heard of pea flour being a G6PD trigger. I will say that I was initially skeptical. The whole \"fake meat is bad\" argument holds no water with me, and I wanted evidence that the new Chicken Tenders contained fava beans. The new product certainly does, and here is that evidence:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n(\n&gt; Beyond Meat's new offering, which is primarily made with fava bean protein, is available at hundreds of locations nationwide starting today.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n(\n&gt; The new recipe is largely made of fava beans and peas...\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n(\n&gt; OUR PROTEINS: Pea \u2022 Mung Bean \u2022 Faba  Bean \u2022 Brown Rice\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI was not able to find evidence that fava beans are present in any of Beyond's other products, but as always we have to read the labels carefully. Pea flour should not have fava beans. It is simply an easy protein to add. \nPeas can be harmful as they share some DNA with fava beans, that is why you stay away from either.

We were initially both quite concerned because the list was incredibly long. Written at the bottom in big, bold text was g6pddeficiency. There was nothing else in the way of references. I wanted to check out the website, but it is currently down. I found ( What a bunch of trash information!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**GARBAGE WEBSITE**\n\nThe author, Dale Baker, is not a doctor. ( He makes his money selling membership access to his terribly designed site to search his Avoid List, a recipe book, and another book that appears to be a paper copy of his website. He also now has a GoFundMe. Watching the video on the GoFundMe page makes clear he is trying to raise money to develop \"an artificial intelligence powered app that will run on all common computer and phone devices\". Artificial intelligence? Right. I bet it is just a cheap rehash of his Avoid List.\n\nBaker claims to have over 250,000 visitors to his site and hospitals are now referencing it as a legitimate source (take a look at the first reference ( -- I am sure there is many more). Baker has a clear financial interest in coming up with as many \"foods to avoid\" as possible to sell books and access to his website. He also ( I cannot trust any information on his site nor in the brochure.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**GARBAGE RESEARCH**\n\nI will trust peer reviewed journal articles that deal with specific foods to avoid, but it has to be **good** research.\n\nI am not talking about **ascorbic acid / Vitamin C**, because ( most cited and it talks about a *40g* intravenous dose (over 400 times the recommended daily dose).\n\nI am also not talking about **blueberries** since ( details a case of only *a single child*.\n\nEven ( is suspect since they intravenously administered 2ml/kg of 96% ethanol to rats (their only tests on humans was on actual blood). That is the equivalent of an average adult consuming over 5 ounces of pure alcohol!\n\nThe brochure mentioned **Tylenol**, but the only \"( (actually a letter to the Editor) I could find mentioned \"there has been only one case report of an isolated acetaminophen\noverdose leading to hemolysis in a patient with known G6PD deficiency\". That patient \"ingested an unknown quantity\nof acetaminophen, fluvoxamine, and clomipramine in a suicide attempt\".\n\n**Aspirin** was also mentioned, but according to ( \"very old case reports documented a potential association between high doses of aspirin and acute haemolytic anaemia; while, no systematic study assessed the safety of low-dose aspirin in G6PD-deficient subjects\". ( looked at patients suffering from acute coronary syndrome who were given Aspirin as a standard treatment and found that in G6PD patients \"there are no reported cases of haemolysis following aspirin use in this patient group and no guideline is established to date.\"\n\nI am not interest in single patient cases or research where a near lethal dose of something has been administered.\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**REVIEW ARTICLES**\n\n( does a review and concludes that as far as herbal and dietary supplements, only **henna** can be conclusively considered to be avoided.

It has a references list that includes a list of scientific articles that might be worth a look:\n\n\nThere is a link down the page called articles and research papers. It was my understanding through reading this that there are actually 400 variations of this disorder and that they all have different interactions with different foods and drugs but the only food that is shared amongst the variations is fava beans. Cannot remember which article stayed that though so happy to be proven wrong.\n\nHope this helps. I guess what I am after is more of a:\n\n\"This clinical trial shows that turnips trigger hemolysis in G6PD patients. (link to paper here)\"\n\nI ( from that site and in almost 9500 lines of bibliography, \"food\" is only mentioned in two article titles/notes: one with a single patient and one with five Nigerian male patients. Maybe try a university library? I do not think I can help you with that. Sorry. Hi, I am from a region where around 10% of people have G6PD deficiency. This means more than 100.000 G6PD people in the same area. I know that I have the condition since birth, like many of my relatives or friends. As you can imagine, doctors here know the condition very well.\n\nWhat I know based on this is that the only food that can trigger a crysis are fava beans. I know this based on what doctors that work here said me, and based on my personal experience, given that this is common knowledge in the area, I suppose we would find out pretty quickly if any other food could trigger a crysis, and doctors would reccomend a different list of foods to avoid.\n\nSince I discussed this here in reddit several time, and since I cannot use my personal experience as my only argument, I have also done some research, and every time, this confirmed what I already knew; I could not find a single research paper that proved that any food other than fava beans can be dangerous: some speculate or report some personal experience about other foods, but the scientific proof is there only for fava beans.\n\nRegarding my research, I usually point to ( article, but you can find others \\.\n\n&gt;*very few articles have examined the safety of other food ingredients and food additives for people with G6PD deficiency. Some articles that associated specific foods with hemolysis appeared to be speculative and based on limited information*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*\\*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*fava beans were found to be the only food for which there is conclusive clinical evidence linking the risk of hemolytic anemia to individuals with G6PD deficiency*\n\nI also wrote an email to an italian hematologist that studied G6PD... He confirmed my knowledge and pointed me to ( interview (to another hematologist). It is in italian but I can translate an important part for you:\n\n&gt;**Molti sostengono che \u2013 oltre alle fave \u2013 sia opportuno stare alla larga da altri legumi come piselli, fagioli, ceci, lenticchie, lupini e soia. Altri aggiungono alla lista il vino rosso, i mirtilli e le bevande che contengono chinino, come l'acqua tonica e alcuni amari. Personalmente, a parte le fave, non ho mai rinunciato a nulla di tutto ci\u00f2: ho rischiato?**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cHa fatto benissimo, perch\u00e9 le fave sono l'unico alimento a poter provocare un'emolisi. Qui entriamo nel campo dell'aneddotica: non vi \u00e8 alcun dato pubblicato che documenti emolisi a seguito di qualunque degli altri cibi e bevande che ha elencato. Fino a qualche decennio fa le fave erano come dei sacchetti contenenti materiale ignoto: si sapeva che potevano essere pericolose, ma si ignorava il perch\u00e9. Oggi invece sappiamo che i fattori scatenanti dell'emolisi nel favismo sono due sostanze che hanno nomi e struttura chimica ben precisa: vicina e convicina. Queste sostanze sono presenti solo nelle fave; gli altri legumi non le contengono, o le contengono solo in tracce trascurabili. \u00c8 un peccato che su vari siti web, soprattutto negli Stati Uniti, si stia facendo quello che chiamerei quasi terrorismo psicologico riguardo alla soia, che come additivo si trova un po' ovunque: si tratta di un allarme ingiustificato\u201d.\n\nTRANSLATION:\n\n&gt;**Many say that you should not only avoid fava beans, but also green peas, beans, chickpeas, lentils, shells and soy. Other say to avoid red wine, blueberries and drinks with quinine, like tonic water and some liquors. Personally I only avoided fava beans, did I risk something?**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;You did the right thing, since fava beans are the only food that can trigger hemolysis. Here we enter the field of anecdotal: there is no data that show that an hemolysis can trigger for any of those foods. Since few decades ago, fava beans were bags containing something unknow: we knew they could trigger an hemolysis, but we did not know why. Today we know that it happens due to two substances that have clear names and chemical structures: vicina e convicina *\\*. Those substances are present only in fava beans, other legumes do not contain them, or they have only negligible traces. It is a shame that in many websites, especially from the United States, is happening something that I would almost call psychological terrorism about soy, something that is everywhere as an addictive: this is a totally unjustified alarm.\n\np.s.: I would be careful with drugs anyway, for example, I always knew that aspirine could be dangerous, so I do not reccomend trying it without talking with a doctor first. Thank you for that. I had read your comments on here before as well. I would really like for it to be the case that fava beans are the only food that pose a danger, but I am trying not to fall into the confirmation bias trap. I am digging and digging for articles that study other foods, but there are none! please let me know if you find anything. I am interested as well", "Why is my g6pd tolerance suddenly low? I have had g6pd since birth, as my dr told me to avoid taking fava bean. But when I was a kid I took it too and did not have any problems. This also includes soy products, tea, mint, and others.  No problem!\n\nBut when I turned 20 and older, I can no longer take any soy products or drinking green tea, or I will feel short of breath / feel like I want to faint. Now that I am 30 years old, it is getting worse, now I can no longer eat mint candy, because the dizziness and shortness of breath are also back.\n\nIs the increasing of age factor causing my tolerance to weaken?  Now I need to abstain over 300 products and foods based on recommendations?  This is very sad. is not scientific evidence that g6pd intolerance increases by age , but is a fact that the hypochondriac mentality does. Do you have actual symptoms like change in urine / skin color? Make sure its not something else going on, like pulmonary hypertension. Maybe it is because your body does not make red blood cells as fast when you are older, or something related to that? Basically if your body can replace RBCs faster than it is being destroyed, you will not feel the effects too much. Classic perspective bias of \"it is in the head, because I do not experience this\". This poor dude cannot even drink green tea without being fainted and we still have people coming and saying he is hypochondriac. Seriously this has to stop I do not doubt he is feeling the dizziness and the shortness of breath, that is 100% real for sure , that the cause is g6pd is very unlikely, anyway he should see a psychiatrist (or any other medical profesional) not just asking random opinion in Reddit good question..   \nthis is due to the fact that you must have had other elements that could have upregulated your enzyme.. certain hormones such as dopamine and vitamin D upregulate g6pd enzyme and thus increase your napdh storages and thus increase your ability to tolerate many things. Also.. during your teenage years.. men and women produce more testosterone which also increases g6pd -(   \n\n\nI hope this helps !", "URGENT! Is this Fava Bean  i think that is normal beans It seems a fava bean to me Okay so I got a list of beans used by the hotel and the beans used are: great northern beans, pinto beans, black beans, turtle beans, navy beans. Are these okay to eat? Got the list from the hotel, not fava :D. But could you please see my comment above and reply. Never had turtle beans (at leas I do not think so...) but never had issues with navy or pinto beans!  Clinical guidance wise fava beans  is the only food that will cause a reaction, nothing else.\n\nAs a rule I always avoid bean mixes in restaurants for exactly this reason lol! I wish I could avoid too but I am under the mandatory quarantine for travellers program under the Canadian government. I am given all my three meals by them so I got to eat what is given. I had mentioned my allergies to them and they have been avoiding those but I was not expecting a bean mixture. The bean in the picture looked dangerously similar to fava so I felt it is better to post it here and be sure. I went through a phase of fear with all these. After much research. These are all fine. Fava is the only problematic one. Some people say skip beans and lentils in general but I checked with the Singaporean and Malaysian medical consensus and it is not true\n\nI eat a bunch of black beans but I think the rest is fine too Thank you so much Food Stress has been my major problem for almost 2 years and now I feel so much better jus focusing on the big nonos.

I am not sure if I have ever had any symptoms related to this or what to look out for. There are nice online resources that detail what exactly you should stay away from if you just search \u201cg6pd\u201d. I would recommend you also figure out what spectrum your deficiency is (ie more severe the level, the more foods and drugs you have to stay away from; ABSOLUTELY STAY AWAY FROM FAVA BEANS). I have the light asian version, so I can eat some of the prohibited foods without triggering the symptoms.\n\nThere are also supplements that people take such as NAC that has been shown in rodent models to partially help g6p activity.\n\nBasically certain foods and drugs oxidize (damage) your red blood cells more than others. For normal people it does not cause too much issue, but for us, our immune cell (macrophages) see it as too damaged and proceed to destroy it. When you have symptoms, it is because you do not have enough RBCs left and you get anemia. The only treatment once this happens is to be rushed to the hospital and receive a full blood transfusion. If you have mild symptoms, you could also wait it out as your body naturally makes more RBCs.\n\nFinally I would recommend you read through the past posts to learn more. Stay safe. There is a lot of disinformation on the topic, that is not well known especially in zones where it is not common. A lot of articles on the subject are inaccurate and even doctors most of the time tend to be safe and will tell you to avoid a lot of foods that are not dangerous to us.\n\nBeing hydrated it is important but not related to G6PD. You should avoid fava beans and certain medicines (always ask your doctor to check if a certain medicine is fine for you before taking it). You can eat any other food so do not be worried. 2nd this.

Is this why my blood work is always weird? I had not given the health test result any thought until it popped up in the warnings on my new acne medicine. Definitely have heard a jaundice story from my mom about my birth, but other than that nothing. Honestly do not know if I have ever eaten a fava bean. Anyways, my blood works always comes back with high bilirubin, mcv, and mch; and low rbc and rdw. My PCP almost sent me to a hematologist, but decided not to. Maybe I should bring it back up? I would say so. I did not know that I have G6PD Deficiency until I ended up in ICU after being prescribed Plaquenil, Lisinopril, and Nitrofurantoin. My mom told me that I was born jaundiced and premature but I did not think much of it. I was also told that I had Chronic Anemia all throughout my childhood and young adulthood. My mom cooked beans all the time, and they always made me sick but I just figured that I hated beans. When I was pregnant my OB prescribed me iron supplements and that was disastrous. I ended up having a stillbirth because of it because we are prone to iron overload. Now I am very aware of the signs of hemolysis/hemolytic anemia. My qualitative test for G6PD Deficiency came back negative probably because of x linked inactivation aka lyonization. It was confirmed on my health DNA test. I have Class 1 G6PD Deficiency, chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. Since discovering that I have G6PD Deficiency I have been trying to spread awareness because not a lot of people or doctors know much about it. My blood results usually show high RBC (indicative of hemolysis, young red blood cells are longer than older ones), low MVC which indicate smaller than normal red blood cells. Low Hemoglobin sometimes which indicates anemia, low haptoglobin which indicates that red blood cells are being damaged quicker than they are being made. And low MCHC which indicates that the red blood cells do not have enough hemoglobin in them. My biggest triggers seem to be medications that trigger oxidative stress like NSAIDS, Sulfa based drugs, Antibiotics, Antimalarial drugs, drugs with sulfites. I try to avoid foods with blue food coloring, tonic water, beans, soy lecithin, glycerin. My last hemolytic crisis was last month but it was triggered by an infection. I had to get two blood transfusions but I am finally starting to feel better. I hope what I shared helps you better understand G6PD Deficiency. Yes! I am definitely going to push for a test once my doctor reopens. I do not want to assume I will be fine forever just because I have been fine this far. Thank you for all the info!

From that I believe me and my daughter are carriers. Although none of us has ever been hospitalized for it. \n  \n\nThis is my typical bloodwork.

I take iron a couple times a week and I feel like it stops lethargy. I have read that g6pd should not take iron but that makes zero sense to me because you need iron to make more red blood cells because ours get destroyed quicker than normal.

It was not life threateningly serious, and I was working from home, so I ignored it thinking it would go away with a bit more rest and less drinking (I drink much more than most people, but considerably less than the raving drunk on your corner holding a bottle of cheap vodka).  It did not.  Not a fan of going to the doctor at the drop of a hat (though I will when things are bad), I was looking into possible causes of why I was sick.  On a random trail I was looking into the possibility I was having a bad diet that conflicted with my body, possibly due to my body being different from most people due to G6PD.  Found out that henna can kick off our anemia, I did a lot of research when I first found out about my condition and never came across that bit of information.  \nEverything clicks into place, I understand why I have been sick and exactly what caused it.

Left that poisonous mud on my head for hours wrapped in a plastic bag.  Looked great, loved how dark and multi toned of a red my hair was, I was wanting this to be my new signature thing.  I must have shrugged off the effects of the initial application, but having that beautifully deadly red hair on my head was slowly poisoning me.  \nStarting shortly after I dyed my hair I started having the following symptoms that slowly got worse, by the time I figured out what was happening they were almost bad enough that I was willing to go to a doctor about it.  Pale skin that felt different to the touch than normal, nausea, irritability (I was fighting with everybody in my life), lack of appetite, lack of energy or desire to do anything, dark colored urine.  Nothing progressing to the point of getting jaundice, though I have not had that symptom happen to me ever.  I did not think of the symptoms being from my G6PD blood at the time, but then it all made sense.\nThis realization came to me while I was working from home and toughing through my symptoms.  Luckily my partner who is a barber had the day off and had her clippers handy.  I got out of work early and had her shave my head right then.  Might by psychosomatic, but I felt MUCH better withing an hour.  After a bad incident years earlier where I thought I was a badass that could drink a vodka tonic, I learned the best treatment for my body after an anemia attack.  I got a bunch of iron rich food, most notably an iron rich green smoothy, and medicated myself with that.  Within a handful of hours I felt completely healthy and very energetic.  I felt like Theoden, King of Rohan, when Gandalf freed him from the venomous influence of Grima Wormtongue.  Life and health just returned to my body at a rate I have never experienced before.\nThat said, probably should have gone to a doctor and if you suspect anybody is going through this get them to the ER.   Maybe after a trip to a barber, but I think they have clippers in the ER.\n\nTL\\DR: Put henna in my hair, which caused a G6PD reaction that made me sick for weeks before I figured it out and cut my hair off to save my life. Hey, Puerto Rican mommy of a G6PD diagnosed one and half year old. We had a scare when he was born and needed 2 fully blood transfusions because he developed jaundice and his levels would not go back to normal. I was just wondering if you had siblings and if they had G6PD too?\n\nI am glad to hear you are feeling better. We will definitely make sure we tell our little one as he grows to avoid henna after your story. That is pretty wild, glad you are feeling better! Nope I am the only one, neither of my two brothers has it. I am glad your son was diagnosed, even though I came out premature and extremely jaundiced for some reason doctors missed it.  I did not find out about it until I joined the military. oh dear.. yeah.. henna is a kicker.. I got some on my hands while I was dying my ex-fianc\u00e9's hair.. got sick for a week.

In order to avoid that, you avoid the triggers.\n\nI am aware that we still produce G6PD, and that is why you could take triggers (for example eating fava beans) and not have any crisis, but since we do not always produce it, there is no guarantee.\n\nSo if you are feeling random fatigue, that is not due to G6PD deficiency and it must have some other cause, and taking a random list of substances is not going to help you! tried NAC.. tastes horrible.. but yes.. it has an effect.\n\nI have noticed my maximal dose is 500 mg a day before it starts making me feel queasy.

These effects were contrasted on silencing glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, the key enzyme in pentose phosphate pathway, or inhibiting Akt. BFT benefits post-MI recovery through stimulation of pro-survival mechanisms and containment of neurohormonal response. These results may have implications for the treatment of myocardial ischemia.\n\nThis means\uf0e0 by increasing VEGF receptor 2 and AKT and Pim-1, pBad and Bcl-2 levels, you end up having some effects that yes.. curb the lack of g6pd\u2026\n\nWhile the g6pd enzyme is not affected directly, it is helped along by increasing various signaling molecules.

Hi Marcus,\n\nI am hoping this response finds you in good spirits. I apologize for the long wait as I was occupied trying to bring that paper!\n\nFatigue can occur from G6PD since it affects your energy metabolism. In short, you ingest glucose and the glucose triggers your g6pd enzyme which triggers NADPH. NADPH triggers many anabolic metabolisms as well as enables you to recycle many vitamins. This means, glucose enables you to produce neurotransmitters, vitamins, and co-enzymes, that will help get you going. \\*\\*not just ingested glucose, but recycling glucose in your system also does that\\*\\*\\*\n\nChris MasterJohn Pdh noted that having g6pd is like having a really bad mthfr gene mutation, which I am inclined to agree with ((\n\nWhile he suggests using riboflavin, I believe that should be used sparingly especially if you have the COMT val158met gene variant of val/val for your neurotransmitters which makes you get rid of neurotransmitters faster than usual..(4x) Riboflavin will only accelerate that.. leaving you feeling anxious since it can, if you take too much, reduce your dopamine status to unhealthy levels. (\n\nRiboflavin + MAO = dopamine reduction\n\n(\n\nIf you are talking about feelings of tiredness.. it makes sense...

Eating some sugary foods and see if this relieves symptoms. It did not help. Had been feeling like that all day and still some this morning. I drank and ate sugary stuff and there was no change. Mines was diagnosed by the Air Force. I have those symptoms frequently so I have done pretty well to avoid most triggers I am not sure what triggered it. I woke up feeling like that on Friday. I have been dealing with this for long enough that I can tell the slight differences between this and other similar issues. I eat sugar and complex carbohydrates constantly to avoid low sugar. I am thinking it may be something environmental but I am not sure what. I do not take NSAIDs at all.  The only thing that comes to mind would be a possible cross-contamination of food that I was not aware of. as far as I know, you should have an hemolytic crisis and you should go to the hospital or face serious consequences...\n\ndid you go to the hospital or did you self-diagnosed an hemolytic crisis? The Air Force diagnosed me with it. The VA has been taking care of it since my discharge. Basically, I have been told to monitor my symptoms and go to the ER of things get really bad. the air force diagnosed you with g6pd deficiency. this means that you might have an hemolytic crisis after eating fava beans or in few other cases.\n\nnow my question is: how do you know that your current state is an hemolytic crysis? Call made to VA nurse who got me in touch with my doctor. This not being my first time, my doctor advised this since this has occurred before. My last blood test came back a little abnormal, for me at least. ok, so if your doctor said that you should trust him.\n\nbut... I am asking because I come from a region where 10% of people has G6PD deficiency, I know tens of people with it (relatives, friends and myself included) and I NEVER heard of someone having mild crisis or often feeling bad cause of it.\n\nusually people feel completely normal, or get an hemolytic crisis after eating fava beans and need to go to the hospital. there is no middle way and is not normal to feel what you are describing.\n\nI might be wrong, but since I know that G6PD deficiency is not very well know in the US I would suggest you to try to speak with your doctor and discuss with him the possibility that your problems are something else, different from the G6PD deficiency. Bear in mind people feel moderate symptoms if they are females and only have on carrier. On my experience, women that have a moderate deficiency do not experience symptoms at all... G6PD deficiency makes carriers prone to hemolytic anemia. Anemia means your hemoglobin (red blood cells) level is less than 14% for men. When your red blood cells levels are low, your body's ability to transport oxygen is reduced. If untreated, the condition could lead to organ damage.\n\nYes, the impact of hemolysis could be gradual based on the severity of exposure, and in most cases, it self corrects over time (since red blood cells are continuously being created and destroyed as they age). However, when it is severe, you need help and may required blood transfusion. Hemolysis could be a continuing experience for some people. And different people tolerate low hemoglobin differently.  For example, there are times when I felt ok at 7% hemoglobin (I am male) and other times when I feel really sick at 9% (I check my blood every other week at least).\n\nDepending on where you live, physicians tend to know very little about G6PD and often give broad advices. Do your research and keep tab on your blood levels and how you feel. Managing G6PD could be a challenge without knowing the facts.\n\nAlso, fava beans is not the only food item that could trigger hemolysis. The is no conclusive research about the full list of food items, medications or other chemicals that could be potential trigger.\n\nRemember, hemolysis simply means your red blood cells, which normally have a life span of about 6 weeks, die too young, too soon for the regular replacement cycle to be completed, hence the rate of depletion is faster than the rate of replacement. Also, note that red blood cells die early when they are exposed to oxidative stress and there is not enough G6PD enzyme to protect them. And finally note that a lot of factors, including food, chemicals, drugs, and emotional state, can contribute to oxidative stress.\n\nParting words: Ask your doctor to check your blood panels very often, say once monthly, depending on your medical history and current state. Keep a good diary of your condition and your blood work. You will quickly learn to decipher when you need to go to the emergency room and when you can rely on supplements, also your doctors will have better information to make more informed decisions. This practice is working for me. This week is a far better week for me. And my doctor has been doing a good job helping me with this What do you use to check your blood every other week? My doctor knows next to nothing about g6pdd so want to make sure I can keep tabs on it myself My clinic send me tubes, I draw the blood during dialysis and ship it in a pre-paid box to their lab. They test and send the results. I keep a detailed log of the result and use the data to analyze. For one I am able to note that I am in continuous hemolysis because my RDW (red blood width) is always in the hemolysis range.", "Diagnosed with G6PD as a kid, but have always been eating fava beans I was diagnosed with G6PD as a kid, my parents always told me to watch out with certain medications (I carry a paper stating I have G6PD and a list of medications to avoid in my wallet) and they have always told me to watch out when eating fava beans, but... I have been eating fava beans ever since I can remember... when I eat them, I eat a lot! In fact, their one of my favorite beans :) very delicious when boiled, eat them like a snack.\n\nI always wanted to go get a g6pd test as an adult but kind of always wrote it off, I basically live life like I do not have G6PD...\n\nSo I am curious, what is the deal? can people get it and it goes away? could I possibly have been misdiagnosed? Wow. That is interesting. I would be retested if I were you. Thanks for the reply\n\nI agree, its time for a retest! (I just hate needles)\n\nI have gone my entire life carrying this \"G6PD6 deficient, medications to avoid\" piece of paper in my wallet and I always have to print a new one because the ink fades... it also makes my wallet bulky! What is the point in retesting if you do not really follow the G6PD avoid list anyways? \ud83e\udd14 If you retested as positive for G6PD Deficiency, would you change anything? Good point.\n\nI would not know what to change If you really want a definitive answer, you could always take a Health DNA test. The pros of doing so are that you will know for sure if you are G6PD Deficient or not, you would find out what class and variant of G6PD Deficiency you have if you have it (this is important because a person with Class 1 G6PD Deficiency has to take way more precautions than a person with Class 5 G6PD Deficiency), you would find out if you have Favism or not, and lastly you would get a more accurate confirmation test that does not require needles to be performed. If you plan to have kids then you may want to know if you actually have this genetic blood disorder because you can pass it on to your children. It is also good to know especially during a pandemic because people with G6PD Deficiency are more at risk of getting COVID19 and dying of a severe cytokine storm response and G6PD Deficient people have to take precautions with Hydroxychloroquine and Dexamethasone. I did not know I had G6PD Deficiency until I was prescribed Hydroxychloroquine and Nitrofurantoin and it almost killed me. Now I know that I have Class 1 Ilesha variant G6PD Deficiency and Favism (I cannot eat any kind of broad beans or legumes without it triggering a severe hemolytic crisis). I had my son tested for G6PD via blood test and DNA test. His blood test came back negative as did mine, but both of our DNA tests came back positive for G6PD Deficiency. He has Class 5 G6PD Deficiency though and is asymptomatic. Thanks for the comprehensive reply, scary stuff about the covid-19.\n\nAlways wanted to do a health / genetic DNA test, price and privacy always was the issue. I was also a little unsure about the privacy issue but I was willing to risk it so I would have answers. Medical data breaches happen all the time despite the HIPAA laws. I wanted to be more educated about my medical conditions so I could become  more proactive in my medical care and treatment planning. Sitting back and expecting medical professionals do their due diligence to provide me with the best treatment options, have almost killed me too many times. I also like having evidence of my medical conditions because I have had too many negative experiences with medical professionals dismissing my reports of symptoms because \"I am too young to be so sick\" or \"I do not look sick\" etc. Plus now I use the Drug Bank database that was linked to my raw data report to identify medications that could cause an adverse reaction or hemolysis depending of my genome. That is really smart.\n\nYou are your best doctor after all.\n\nI think I will actually do the same, which health DNA test do you recommend? Hi! You should stop eating them. What happened to you is perfectly normal, there is no guarantee that an haemolytic crisis will trigger after you eat fava beans, and you could literally go all your life without having one. But the opposite is also true, the next time that you eat them, you could have a crisis and be hospitalised, so it is not very wise to keep risking like this So it is very unusual for an individual with G6PD to eat fava beans and not get a haemolytic crisis? going on over 25+ years now It is not unusual. There is people that eat fava beans all their life and learn to have G6PD deficiency at old age, after having an haemolytic crisis. Others have it the first time they try fava beans... you cannot know if the next time a crisis will trigger or not, so I suggest to simply not risk it I did the 23andMe Health and Ancestry DNA test and it costs around $200. I had my raw data report sequenced/analyzed using Sequencing.com because they are more accurate and precise than 23andMe with their analysis IMO. Like for instance, 23andMe reported that I do not have G6PD Deficiency because I did not have the African variant of G6PD Deficiency. They only test you for the most common variant amongst people of your race. The problem is that there are well over 400 variants of G6PD Deficiency. Sequencing.com identified that I have two variants of G6PD Deficiency, the ValMet variant and the Ilesha variant which is closely related to the Sardinia variant which is prevalent amongst people of Italian/Moroccan ancestry. That is why 23andMe did not think to test me for this variant. Btw-Sequencing.com offers their own Health DNA tests now, but I do not know much about it since was not an option when I did mine. Thanks, I am learning something new :) How old are you? I am a female with two markers (rare) and was never tested as an infant or a child.

His mom told me that he should not consume menthol or camphor but I never found any studies that approved this. So my question is: Is there anyone that could tell me if that is right? Because he never had any problems with menthol, but when he accidentally drank a tea made out of camphor yesterday he got really bad stomach ache. \nThanks already to anyone that can help me ^^ Hi. The only food that G6PD deficient people have to avoid are fava beans. So menthol and camphor are fine.\n\nOther than fava beans he should be careful when taking medicines (always ask a doctor if a medicine is fine for a G6PD deficient), avoid henna ink (not common, but used for certain tattoos and in some hair dyes) and mothballs.\n\nThere is a lot of disinformation about this topic on the internet (you might find super long lists of foods to avoid, ignore them!) and even a lot of doctors, in zones where the condition is not well know, might tell you to avoid things that are completely safe.  Here is a systematic review on things you should avoid ", "Is alcohol ok to drink? I heard that some people advise against drinking alcohol. Yes, the only food that is dangerous are fava beans. It is much more than that my friend, but fava beans are the most dangerous. Do some research before you harm yourself. Stay safe! Our bodies have harder time breaking down alcohol. As long as you dont drink in large amounts/often you will be fine. A beer or two once a week will not hurt you. hey my friend, I come from a region where 10% of people have G6PD deficiency, I know since birth that I have it, many of my familiars and friends have it and doctors here know this condition very well. I have also done my research and there is not any scientific proof that any food other than fava beans is dangerous. this is simply not true, where did you get this info? Only fava beans are dangerous. I discovered that I was G6PD deficient eating pees when I was 9 months old, my mom also has that disease.\n\nDoctor always told that I cannot eat fava beans, pees and haricot vets (green beans). I have been drinking since I was 18 (36 now), never had any issues!

Thanks for the reply, so lets say i eat 1 boiled fava bean, how fast does the trigger/crisis happen? 30 mins, 1 hour, etc?\n\nAt one point I ate so much boiled fava beans (they are one of my favorites) to the point I got a stomach ache and gas, but no crisis \n\nI will do a g6pd re-test before I get my vaccine the crisis will happen after 12/48 hours, and even a single bean can trigger it if you are unlucky! interesting, thanks for the reply Do you mean you are a carrier or fully G6PD? If you are a female, you most likely have a working X chromosome that is making enough the enzyme to prevent full blown hemolysis Male here, 30yo\n\nNot sure what is carrier, always thought I had fully g6pd Females have two X chromosomes so they have a backup (ie one X with g6pd and one without). Their g6pd gene is recessive so it does not affect them. They just carry the gene in their dna. Male is xy so no backup/ fully affect by the g6pd gene Interesting\u2026 Id like to hear your results if you do get re tested. I discovered I was G6pd deficient when I was in my early 40,s ! Unfortunately our neighbour gave us some broad beans from their garden and my two kids were eating them straight from the pod,! Within 6 hours my boy felt tired and went to bed which was very out of character. That morning my girl asked me to look at her funny wee! It looked just like coke\u2026 hmm something was not right. My son got out of bed and his whole body was yellow including his eyes. He was rushed to hospital and they could not figure out what was wrong until we showed them that my girls was now also passing blood and they both eat thr fave beans! It was so scary to suddenly have both kids in hospital\u2026 My boy had multiple blood transfusions, oxygen etc yet my girl recovered within a week on her own due to having the xx chromosomes. I still feel so bad for passing this on to my kids and cannot believe I would been lucky enough to never of had a broad bean in my life! On the bright side, they now know of their condition and I have been able to educate them about it so they do not run into any trouble in the future. for me I did not know that I have g6pd  until now and I am 27 years old \n\nI was eating fava bean my whole life", "23 and Me now includes testing for your risk of having and transmitting G6PD deficiency  I just recieved my results last week and definitely they do not include it.

One of the doctors I spoke to said that the vaccine should be given under the supervision of an endocrinologist and the doctor should plan the vaccination. Those who have received the Pfizer/Biontech vaccine experienced any side effects other than currently known sore arm and headaches? Thanks! I did not even have headaches, only sore arm. I got the Pfizer/Biontech vaccine, ahead of others in my age group *because* of my G6PD and possible complications if I got Covid. It was administered by my GP, no endocrinologist or haematologist or anything involved. My side effects were pretty mild, just a little tired the next day. No sign of any kind of haemolytic anaemia anyway. Same here in Turkey, I should have vaccinated way too earlier due to being in high risk group but I think I have not recorded as G6PD patient in our health system. Anyways, one of the doctors I spoke to said something similar to yours. If I got covid, I might be very bad because covid can cause something like hemolysis just as G6PD patients face, so go and get the vax asap. G6PDD is rare here in Ireland so doctors are not very familiar with it but my GP put me down on the list just in case. Good luck with the vaccine, hope you get it soon! My boyfriend has G6PD and got the BioNTech vaccine. He only had the normal side effects. So I think it should be safe In UK maybe 1 gp knows about it. Which is weird considering the amount of African and Asian living here. I got the Pfizer shots, and specifically asked the medical researcher on staff to make sure there would be no issues with G6PD. She made sure to look it up right there, said it should not be a problem at all and asked me to stay an extra 15 minutes in the observation area just in case, I did not have any kind of reaction!

I followed that list until i was 15 and then i started eating hummus and realized it was not causing me harm, but i was too scared to try beans and others. Anw, i have been experiencing fast heartbeats, dizziness and the need to throw up when i exercise even tho i am a big guy and usually move a lot and never felt that sensation before. I read somewhere that people with g6pd are not supposed to push themselves a lot and i wanted to see if this is actually the cause of it. \nThank you everyone for your time! Plenty of people with g6pd that push very hard, very frequently. Several Olympians, many pro athletes, etc. I mountain bike almost every day and more often than I ought to, push all out on Strava segments. The more I do it, the better my cardio gets, and the more accustomed my body gets to it.\n\nFast heartbeats and dizziness are commonplace amongst people who are out of shape and push hard either too soon or too often. I am not going to say this is for sure what is happening with you, because it could be a number of other things, it is just what I tend to see as a fitness evaluator in my organization and its held true for myself as well. For a number of years I almost exclusively did weights, cardio maybe once or twice a week for 30 mins. I thought this was good enough, but have realized I personally need way more to be able to feel cardiovascularly fit. no g6pd does not cause this afaik This happens to me too", "Swordfish Hey can we have swordfish?

If it is fava bean gainer you might have a problem. Other than that, you should be fine. Just remember bulking without cutting is just getting fat. Yeah, i am skinny so the only way to gain muscles is bulking As a teenager and young adult I felt the same way and bought mass gainers. However, this begins to become financially unsustainable.\n\nEveryone bulking has to learn to keep eating even if the chicken starts tasting like wet cardboard. I cant even tell you how much I despise sweet potatoes at this point. Its way better and healthier to be eating the whole foods. Oatmeal is the og mass gainer. I understand you, but lets say every month you need to buy chicken breasts and beef and potato and tuna and salmon etc.., all these every month will cost way more than a bag of mass gainer every month. I do not know bro fitness is complicated, nutrition is more complicated than just working out \ud83d\ude02 I have never heard of fava bean gainer in top brands. Stop fear mongering. Just check the contents op. \n\nAlso op. Mass gainers do not work. Just calorie count and eat more. It really works Eat more brown rice/ beans/ dal depends on your culture. Eat your fav requently. Few times a day. No need so much meat anyway. Just checked 150g a day is adequate even then eggs and why protein \n\nThen get whey protein and eat a scoop each morning. Mass gainers usually have bad quality protein anyway I see, but i can take whey protein or mass gainer as a g6pd deficient? Skip gainers. Buy optimum whey protein or myprotein isolate. What is your height and weight? One scoop each morning is good\n\nDo resistance training or swimming. One scoop again after. One house after that a big meal with lots of rice and hearthy food. \n\nIf u dedicated calculate carbs. I did mass gainers. They do not works they make you skinny fat  I heard from some people that whey protein alone is not sufficient for a skinny guy to get big, my goal is to get big like big arms and big chest you know what i mean. i am 5\u201981/2 and 55kg You are eating too little. \n\nNo u do not grow big thru whey alone. U grow big through food. What is your favorite food that you can cook or get easily everyday where you are?\n\nBig arms/chest need strength training. Register to a gym and start with a push/pull/legs routine. It sounds weird but to a lot of legs and core. Eat eat eat. \n\nFrom what u tell me weight gainer will not help, just give you big belly and tiny arms Exactly. Did lots of diets and tracking macros is absolute winner I already train with weights, i just stopped for like a month bcz i do not see any improvements i am still skinny with some muscles, i thought mass gainer will fill me up even if a little fat to help me gain muscles Fava bean mass gainer was meant to be a joke. I have seen dozens of guys try and do what you are doing. Friends have done cycles of HGH and Test. The cold hard truth is that it is crazy difficult if not impossible to change your body type. Just look at ( And that is only after a year or so.\n\nYou are going to be sinking ridiculous amounts of time and money into a product that you *must* keep using or lose all your gains. I have seen too many guys pound back the weight gainer only to get a big gut and no arms. You can be eating 3000-4000 calories a day, but you are not going to be able to maintain that and your body will be revert back to your skinny frame once you stop.\n\nYou need to be very realistic with your goals. If you do not have the body type for a large chest, it is just not going to be maintainable long term. Embrace your body, eat healthy, get ripped with what you have, and be happy.\n\nToo many kids see these huge guys and have no idea the amount of shit they are pumping into their body to get that way unless they have prime genetics for that body type. The sad ending that so many kids have after they have broke the bank and their bodies with all this crap, is that they lose their gains and fall into major depression.

T-bar.  One of those pulls for middle back then the machine that is like a pull-up\nBicep bicep curl with ez bar is nice, hammer\n\nLegs\nAll the legs start with squat then, leg press calf raise hack squat etc. If u do not feel like dying later u did not do this well. \n\nBonus - delts\nIf u have energy, slip in a 4th easy day for delts, especially focus on rear and side delts, facepulls are mandatory. if not then put in on push pull day\n\n\nThen eat a lot\n\nGood luck! Okay thanks", "I am G6PD deficient (0.01) and I can eat plenty of lentils! What is wrong here? So I have been G6PD deficient since my childhood and all I know is that I should avoid fava beans and broad beans. I have eaten lentils all my life with no problem and I thought maybe my deficiency was not the extreme case. \n\nRecently, I made a test and found that the enzyme is 0.01 (normal between 7 and 21) which means I have severe deficiency. So could that be because of how much lentils, and legumes in general, that I eat? As you said, what you need to do is to avoid broad beans/fava beans (and also certain medicines). You can eat how many lentils or other legumes you wish, so there is nothing wrong. There is something very wrong if you are at 0.01. Definitely cuz of the lentils But nothing happens anyway. So? Just because you are not going into hemolytic crisis does not mean you are not hemolyzing. All legumes are metabolized by the Pentose phosphate pathway which needs g6pd to work. U do not have any g6pd. This means if you are eating these foods you will be hemolyzing even if you do not have symptoms. Eventually it will catch up with you and will cause neurological problems you are spreading misinformation. people with g6pd deficiency can eat any legume, except for fava beans, and it will not cause any problem. Sometimes when I eat garbanzo beans I have very mild symptoms of hemolysis. This guy is partially right. It really depends on the beans and the amount of oxidative stress it causes. I can eat lentils just fine too, but that does not mean it is not going through the same pathway Are you sure you do not have any other allergy?\n\nI never had or seen any experience of symptoms while eating beans other than broad beans, and I know tens of people with G6PD that follow the same rule to only avoid broad beans, that obviously got their info from doctors (that know well the issue since a lot of people here has the deficiency).\n\nI can change my mind but you would have to show me something reliable to back it up. Yes they are the same bean. As for my case I can only speak from experience as a G6PD person. Having eaten a bite of fava bean falafel, I have had a trigger and had to wait it out in the health center. The feeling was the same in terms of sudden fatigue, mild heat flashes, and general weakness. An haemolytic crisis have other symptoms as well and I think you would be hospitalised in that case... I do not know what you had but I can guarantee you that chick peas are not a trigger for G6PD people and eating them is not dangerous.. G6pd is on a spectrum, not all symptom manifestation result in hospitalization. I went to the university health center and had to be monitored in case it got worse. You are speaking from a standpoint that every g6pd is equally severe\n\n\n I am not speaking on a personal basis but on the basis of a person that grew up in a zone where thousands of people have G6PD where doctors researched it extensively. If common food such as chick peas could cause any harm or reaction to people it would be known.\n\nYour first link is about malaria and never talks about food. It just says there are different variants of the deficiency, and states that the most severe is in my region.\n\nThe other two links are interesting but they just talk about what people reported once having an haemolytic crisis, one of them even lists both fava bean and broad bean, that are the same thing, or falafel, that is made with fava bean. They do not prove anything and are just a survey on what people with haemolytic crysis thought were their trigger. For sure fava beans are linked to g6pd (as the condition is called favism), but there are also tons of g6pd variants ( with the top 4 centered around Africa and the Middle East. The list of foods to stay away from are long, but I have eaten some of the listed items and felt nothing. Chickpeas/garbanzo beans are just one of the items that made me feel like something is wrong with my body that was close to what I felt when I did eat fava beans (and was actually scared for my life).\n\nI am not saying that it is a definite trigger for everyone, but just to inform people and generally spread awareness that these COULD be triggers for some. If they choose to experiment and figure out their own truth, then I am not against that either. I would also like to point out I am East Asian, where G6PD is not a common disease and is a different variant than the Mediterranean or African type.\n\nI appreciate you citing scientific evidence in your arguments to back up your point, it helps keep this forum grounded. Before finding this subreddit I did not know as much about G6PD facts and have been ignorant about researching beyond the list of foods and drugs to stay away from, so it was definitely refreshing to read about tips to stay on top of for G6PD. You just repeated what you said earlier without adding anything new or rebutting anything I said in the previous message.\n\nYes, there are variants of G6PD, but this does not mean that different variants = different foods.\n\nYes, there are long list of foods to avoid, but they are inaccurate and not backed up by scientific evidence.\n\nYou had a reaction with chickpeas but you can have any other allergy on top of G6PD deficiency, or those chickpeas might have been stored or cooked together with fava beans. If you regularly have reaction or do not feel well when eating chickpeas, trust me and go check for some other allergy.\n\nI would also like to point out that the Mediterranean version is the most severe and if eating chickpeas was harmful to you, it should be also for the thousands of people with G6PD that eat them regularly here. Look, for the most part the scientific evidence points to that chickpeas are safe, but you also cannot discount genetic variation does not factor into what foods may possibly be triggers. There is not enough research conducted in those specific cases where people who responded to chickpeas as a trigger are not for real. No one is going to round up those who reported foods other than fava beans to conduct a deeper level of study. 10% (100 of 1000 from the Egyptian study posted earlier) is also significant enough that it is not due to statistical noise even if it is a survey.\n\n I AM NOT SAYING G6PD deficient people cannot eat chickpeas, you are mistaking the difference in our argument. I am casting doubt that In ALL cases of G6PD deficiency that chickpeas are safe (and even in those cases it may even be mild anemia).\n\nDo not be so quick to discount personal experience from someone with diagnosed G6PD and no known tested allergies, who has eaten fava bean before. You are so wrapped up in trying to prove that it is 100% safe that you are ignoring reasonable doubt from the minority. Look, for the most part the scientific evidence points to that chickpeas are safe, but you also cannot discount genetic variation does not factor into what foods may possibly be triggers.

Is there any research that says that different variants are triggered by different foods?\n\nThe lists of food that you reported earlier are just what people with haemolysis reported to the hospital. This is no way conclusive because they might have lied, they might have conflated chick peas with fava beans or, more probable, they ate chick peas that were stored or cooked together with fava beans.\n\nAlso, this discussion started because a person said that eating legumes would damage a G6PD person even if he does not have symptoms.. This is simply wrong and still you joined the conversation giving him credit. ehy sorry for bothering you again, but a few days ago during our discussion I wrote two emails to two italian hematologists that are known for their research on G6PD. today one of them answered me. he told me I am totally right and that the only food that can trigger a reaction are fava beans. he gave me two links, they are in Italian, but I guarantee you that they say that.\n\n ( \n\n ( \n\nthe second one is an interview, I am going to translate this part for you:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;**Molti sostengono che \u2013 oltre alle fave \u2013 sia opportuno stare alla larga da altri legumi come piselli, fagioli, ceci, lenticchie, lupini e soia. Altri aggiungono alla lista il vino rosso, i mirtilli e le bevande che contengono chinino, come l'acqua tonica e alcuni amari. Personalmente, a parte le fave, non ho mai rinunciato a nulla di tutto ci\u00f2: ho rischiato?**  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cHa fatto benissimo, perch\u00e9 le fave sono l'unico alimento a poter provocare un'emolisi. Qui entriamo nel campo dell'aneddotica: non vi \u00e8 alcun dato pubblicato che documenti emolisi a seguito di qualunque degli altri cibi e bevande che ha elencato. Fino a qualche decennio fa le fave erano come dei sacchetti contenenti materiale ignoto: si sapeva che potevano essere pericolose, ma si ignorava il perch\u00e9. Oggi invece sappiamo che i fattori scatenanti dell'emolisi nel favismo sono due sostanze che hanno nomi e struttura chimica ben precisa: vicina e convicina. Queste sostanze sono presenti solo nelle fave; gli altri legumi non le contengono, o le contengono solo in tracce trascurabili. \u00c8 un peccato che su vari siti web, soprattutto negli Stati Uniti, si stia facendo quello che chiamerei quasi terrorismo psicologico riguardo alla soia, che come additivo si trova un po' ovunque: si tratta di un allarme ingiustificato\u201d. \n\nTRANSLATION:\n\n&gt;**Many say that you should not only avoid fava beans, but also green peas, beans, chickpeas, lentils, shells and soy. Other say to avoid red wine, blueberries and drinks with quinine, like tonic water and some liquors. Personally I only avoided fava beans, did I risk something?**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;You did the right thing, since fava beans are the only food that can trigger hemolysis. Here we enter the field of anecdotal: there is no data that shows that an hemolysis can trigger for any of those foods. Since few decades ago, fava beans were bags containing something unknow: we knew they could trigger an hemolysis, but we did not know why. Today we know that it happens due to two substances that have clear names and chemical structures: vicina e convicina *\\*. Those substances are present only in fava beans, other legumes do not contain them, or they have only negligible traces. It is a shame that in many websites, especially from the United States, is happening something that I would almost call psychological terrorism about soy, something that is everywhere as an addictive: this is a totally unjustified alarm. Thank you for the in depth follow through. I will have to consider that the garbanzo beans I have eaten may have been cooked with small amounts of fava beans. Or possibly been prepared along side it even though they did not list it.\n\nI will retract what I argued earlier and say that you are correct as you have expert evidence. Other beans do not trigger hemolysis. We have toddler who is g6pd deficient. His levels are similar &lt;0.01 since birth. Lentils are part of our staple diet (South Asian), so we feed him moong dal and avoid all large beans(Chick peas, fava, etc.).\n\nGood to know you are doing fine eating plenty of lentils.", "Cola Colored Urine Hello everyone. My 16 year old son often as cola colored urine and I found he gets grouchy and irritable. Is there anything we should do in the situation?  We found out he had G6 shortly after being born as both my wife\u2019s brothers have it. Best option is to consult with a doctor, preferably a hematologist. FYI: Your wife has G6PD Deficiency if your son has it and you do not. G6PD Deficiency is a x chromosome linked metabolic blood disorder. It is difficult for women to be diagnosed with G6PD Deficiency using traditional blood tests because of x inactivation. I am sure if your wife reflects back, she most likely was told that she is chronically anemic or has iron deficiency anemia. She may have even been told to take iron supplements, iron infusions, or to eat iron rich foods. This can be problematic for people with G6PD Deficiency if their ferritin blood serum is not low because people with G6PD Deficiency are prone to iron overload. Having too much iron in the body can damage your organs.\n\nOne of the most important things that people with G6PD Deficiency should do is avoid triggers. There are drug triggers like antimalarial drugs, NSAIDS, and antibiotics like Nitrofurantoin, food/drink triggers like fava beans and peanuts and tonic water and black teas, and chemical triggers like chlorine and naphthepelene. Infections is also a trigger including seemingly benign infections like UTIs and ear infections. People with G6PD Deficiency should avoid anything that increases oxidative stress because oxidative stress is what triggers hemolysis (damage to the red blood cells). People with G6PD Deficiency should always supplement with folate and zinc as they aid in red blood cell production. \n\nThe symptoms of hemolytic crisis due to G6PD Deficiency are amber colored urine, back pain, jaundice, headaches, irritability/anxiety, extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, blueish lips/skin, poor appetite/nausea, paleness, and feeling cold. \n\nYour wife and son should do genetic testing to find out what variant of G6PD Deficiency they have. I did not find out that I have Class 1 G6PD Deficiency (the most severe form of G6PD Deficiency) until I was in the hospital dying after taking Nitrofurantoin. Prior to then, I was told I was just chronically anemic. It is a myth that women can only be \"carriers\" of G6PD Deficiency. \n\nI hope that my post is helpful. Best of luck to your son and wife. Also, living with G6PD Deficiency is not that bad if you avoid triggers. G6PD Deficiency has its benefits. We are resistant to Malaria and in my opinion, a lot of infections. Why avoid black teas? (and why not green?)\n\nIt is funny that you say this because I have had the idea that I get fatigue sometimes after having black teas - I just thought I must be crazy and that there is no reason to think that black teas are causing fatigue. Yes. You should not be having cola colored urine.\n\nThat being said, beets and some other foods may causd that. It is green and red teas too. They are all oxidative and oxidative stress causes damage to the red blood cells of people with G6PD Deficiency. Prior to discovering that I have G6PD Deficiency, I used to drink sweet tea (black tea) and rooibos tea (red tea) all the time. I always developed anemia symptoms within 3 days. Now I avoid all teas.

TIA! You should be fine. Melatonin is completely safe. Agree with other poster - melatonin is completely safe.\n\nBeyond that - \n\nExercise more during the day much before sleep time.\n\nDo not sleep in. Do not nap.\n\nRelax. Let go of stress. \n\nWhen trying to sleep - Do not think about anything. Move everything out of your mind and clear your conciousness. I have taken Melatonin before, the highest dosage sold as well, you should be fine Melatonin is an antioxidant, and a neurotransmitter... so in the long term you may develop tolerance, but is at times recommended. \n\n\n\n It was found that G6PD activity in the erythrocytes was increased by the melatonin in 1.5 and 3.5 h", "Donating blood I went to donate blood today and on the form I had to complete was asking if i have G6PD deficiency. Why do they ask if I have G6PD deficiency? Does it make me ineligible to donate blood? Yes, because on the off chance your blood was used in a transfusion to help someone dealing with a hemolytic crisis it would be useless.\n\nPlasma would be fine but blood unfortunately is a no. I just find it weird bc my dad always go and donates blood and they never asked anything like that and he does have G6PD deficiency. I donated once and I think I said I was G6PD deficient. But I am not sure since it was a lot of time ago.\n\nI checked on some websites from AVIS (Italian biggest onlus for blood donation, there are several websites because there is one for each local branch) and there are conflicting information.

Our condition is from g6pd deficiency, so if it has g6pd that might actually be a good thing!

Sorry to hear you ate some fava beans. So G6PD deficiency (G6PDD or G6PDd for short) is ***not*** an allergy or an allergic condition. It is an **enzymopathy.** This means that us with this condition have very little of this enzyme called G6PD or Glucose-6-phosphate Dehydrogenase. Why is this enzyme so important? Through a biochemical pathway called the Pentose Phosphate Pathway, it helps protect our red blood cells (RBCs, the cells that transport the all important oxygen to our tissues, and gets rid of a waste gas called carbon dioxide) from oxidative stress. Too much oxidative stress = our red blood cells basically blowing up, or \"lysing.\" This is not good and, if severe enough (like through the introduction of a trigger), can lead to a condition called **hemolytic anemia.** This is a big no-no. However, it can take days for symptoms to appear. Symptoms can include jaundice (yellowing of the skin), weakness/fatigue, and dark urine. If severe, you could need a blood transfusion. \n\nOne of the most famous triggers is **fava beans**. Fava beans contain divicine, a strong oxidizing agent, among other chemicals. This is not good for our RBCs, which are already at risk for oxidative stress without enough G6PD. Acute hemolytic anemia via ingestion of fava beans is actually one of the defining characteristics of our condition. \n\nIf I were you, I would probably pay very close attention to my body and urine for the next 24-48 hours, maybe even longer. If you feel like your symptoms are getting bad, I would call your primary care provider for advise and/or visit the emergency department. I second this. My son almost died after eating some falafel which contained a few small traces of fava beans. I only discovered afterwards he had the condition- I had never heard of it before then. Keep a close eye on your pallor and urine colour. Also, do not stay alone- make sure somebody is aware of your condition and can quickly take you to the hospital if necessary i had it about a month ago that is the thing lol, sorry was sure i mentioned it in my post Great explanation! OP might have had too low of a \"dose\" of fava beans for noticeable haemolytic anaemia.  I almost died as a child from eating broad beans and had to have aa transfusion, so it definitely can cause a severe reaction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo  OP, if you are in doubt about your current status, I would recommend getting retested as the retest would also show the level of enzyme that your body produces and therefore the severity of the condition. In any case it is great to hear you had no noticeable symptoms!", "G6PD and Fructose Hi everyone, i was wondering because i have some health issues that might be correlated to G6PD, i also have a background of weird Ketones in my body for no reason, and high triglycerides ( im thin, and i dont have diabetes ).   \nI read everywhere that FRUITS are excellent for G6PD cause they are anti oxydant, but Fruits are full of fructose and articles say that fructose isnt digested and go directly as triglycerides into g6pd deficient people.\n\nAny opinion? Have not looked too much into this, but I think leafy greens would work out the best. Lower sugar content and, depending on the vegetable, may have high antioxidants as well. For example mustard leaves (acquired taste, not for everyone) is an excellent source of antioxidants.

And are we supposed to take supplements for it ? I am really curious so please , say all you want and I would be glad to read it ! Thanks The lethargy and tiredness could be a symptom of G6PD depending on your diet and your sensitivity. I did not take a supplement growing up, but there was a period where I felt really lethargic despite no changes in my diet or sleep schedule. I am always tired.\n\nLiterally have been for the past 20 years. I did not have issues when I was younger but I did have asthma back then.\n\nI think it does have to do with diet and sleep.

Can vaccine be risky for G6PD ?\n\nHave you gotten vaccine ? Which vaccine did you get ? What happend day by day ? I am shocked that your doctors have not allowed vaccines. I am fully vaccinated, including with covid (Moderna). I have not had a single problem with it. I am from another country, migrated to the US. And part of moving to the US requirements, we need to fully vaccinated, I have all my vaccines and they have no impacts on g6pd.\nI recommend consulting a hematologist and ask him that you want to be vaccinated. It should be fine Did your doctors provide any explanation to their choice? \nVaccines are completely safe to people with G6PD there are some studies done and none of them show significant adverse effects after getting vaccination. \n\nG6PD is deficiency in the enzyme glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase, which serves as an important enzyme to convert glucose in your body to pentose sugar which will be part of very IMPORTANT mechanisms in your body. It is an antioxidant and a pro oxidant enzyme. \n\nVaccines work by stimulating your body to produce antibodies against a specific antigen ( which can be an attenuated virus, genetic makeup of a virus, killed pathogens) . This stimulation will cause an immune response thus the fever, muscle soreness, headaches and some mild side effects. \n\nI am both a medical student and have this Deficiency, I got fully vaccinated from birth. \nCoronavirus vaccine is totally safe for you. There were no reports of adverse effects in G6pd individuals in clinical trials.\n\nEdit: This is my first reward!! Thanks a lot you amazing Redditor!!

For context I have been eating a chickpea-fava flour mix; 75% chick pea and 25% fava, which if I did my math right it should make for about 28.4g of fava beans. I have not seen any extreme symptoms, but have experienced minor fatigue which may or may not be related to consumption of the fava flour. Your fatigue is probably related to the flour. It largely depends on how low your G6PD enzyme count is, but generally you would need to consume quite a lot (either in one sitting or a smaller amount but consistently) to have severe symptoms - like blood transfusion severe. \n\nMy mum used to eat tinned fava beans kind of regularly in her 30s before she knew about her deficiency and she never needed treatment. But I would probs avoid the flour just to be safe. Are not women more carriers than sufferers of G6PD gene? Yeah usually. Since it is an X-linked recessive disorder, if a female has the G6PDD gene present in only one X chromosome they will likely just be a carrier. \n\nAlthough it is possible to have the gene present in both X chromosomes, making you symptomatic. My mum has this, as she defo has had reactions before that required blood transfusion.

You can live a completely normal life with it. if you do not feel well after going to chinese restaurant, this is not due to the deficiency, if you had a reaction due to ingesting fava beans you would probably feel very bad and need to be hospitalized. also, I do not think that G6PD people get hit harder by cold or this kind of illness.\n\njust follow some simple rules:\n\n1- avoid fava beans: these are the only food that you cannot eat. every other bean, soy, alcohol etc. are fine and will not cause you any reaction.\n\n2- always check with your doctor is a certain medicine is good for you. there are several medicine that can trigger an hemolytic reaction, so you should not take one without first asking your doctor. remember to always mention your condition when at the hospital on in similar circumstances.\n\n3- there are also some other (very rare) cases where you want to be careful: there is a special ink called \"henna\" that is used for certain tatoos and maybe in certain hair dyes that you should avoid. also mothballs can cause you a reaction (this does not mean you should be afraid of going somewhee cause there might be mothballs... just try to not eat or smell them).

Another thing that could cause a reaction (but in the last few years I read this information disputed) are fava bean pollens, so try to avoid fava bean cultivations. Yeah. I know it says not to eat blueberries or any beans but I eat beans and blueberry muffins all the time. \n\n  What about the vitamins tho. What should I watch out for and I also know the hospital one. My local hospital shipped me out cause they did not know what it was.\n\nI had to have a blood transfusion when I was 11 because of it.  I dont remember what set it off. It is fava beans specifically that can cause a haemolytic episode, the rest are fine. Also I have never heard blueberries should be avoided before. Beans and blueberries are not dangerous, there is not actually any science behind this kind of claim!\n\nVitamins are fine too if we are talking about food. But if what you are taking is a medicine check it is safety with your doctor. Huh my blood doctor said I cant have them. I love them but rarely eat them cause I am scared of a reaction I am not going against your doctor but if he said it in relation to your G6PD deficiency, he is probably being overly cautious since the condition is not well known outside of certain areas.\n\nFollow his advice, but if you can discuss this with him and ask him to check with someone more experienced on this deficiency; I am sure that you can eat them. What about green tea? I have started noticing a reaction to soy. But, everyone is different. I feel like I have a minor one if I have alot Yes. I was extremely low on energy it was horrible. Then I found out Rice Krispies Treats has soy. Heartbreaking Oh I eat them all the time. Never had a problem. See. Everyone is different. I have learned to pay more attention to how I feel after eating something and feeling drained. I just always forget to look at the ingredients Have you ever had to have a transfusion or anything? I have not. I have always tried to remain a healthy eater. But I am totally sorry that was something you had to experience. I was maybe 11. Was scary af but was not to bad honestly. How do you handle colds and stuff. I feel like mine last forever and are bad.  Also. Do you have any problems with ibuprophen or other pain releivers? I rarely get sick. But when it has happened it is always like the end of the world. It is difficult to find medication that really works. Ibuprofen does not work for me anymore, and even after explaining that to my doctors they still give it to me. Sadly, only narcotics really work for pain for me and even sadder that doctors do not like to prescribe it. I just try to be careful and cautious especially when it comes to getting colds. I also stopped drinking alcohol. Why did you stop drinking. I have only a handful of times.  O have not taken a pain reliever in years because of mis communication from doctors. Some say i can have it others say I cannot. Gets old quick. But puts me in fear of taking it. It always made me sick and red wine is the worst. I cannot stand even the smell of it. \n\nAre you always cold? Is that a part of the disorder? Yes. I love my heat I got a heating pad for bed and a heater under my desk lol. But when I lay down I am a heater. My body is super hot and I am super cold.  Same when I get colds. If I go into a chilly environment my body temp drops immediately. It is miserable. Yes same with me. That is so weird. Hell I constantly gave my seat heater on to no matter the temp.  I dont feel so alone now. We should become friends lol. I do it too.

It is debatable; also, to much of anything is not good for you :) Green tea is fine Hi There!!\n\nI had already posted about this in another post so you may find that the information repeats itself. I will answer your questions directly in the first part and copy pasta the rest of the information you may want to look in to in the second part.   \n\n\nPart1  \n I have big concerns with it like sometimes when I go eat at a Chinese restaurant I usually get super light headed and dizzy after eating there. Wondered if anyone has had a similar experience \n\nYes, this is because G6PD causes a shortage in the NADPH molecule which you need for detoxification AND antioxidant recycling of glutathione.  You may also have a predisposition to some sensitivity with any of the glutamate salts, which is independent of G6PD. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Also do your colds or any other sickness seem to hit harder with you blood disorder. Seems like colds kick my ass \n\nYes, since your neutrophils use endothelial nitric oxide (eNOS) to fuel the oxidative burst needed to destroy certain pathogens, this uses NADPH to be activated. \n\n ( \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith less NADPH your neutrophils are less able to fulfill their role. Compound this with the fact that your system is generally less tolerant of oxidative stress in general, colds will indeed kick your ass. My recommendation for this is to eat coconut oil (ONLY IF YOU ARE NOT ALLERGIC) coconut oil contains monolaurin which destroys many viruses. \n\n ( \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n folic acid \n\nFolic acid is HIGHLY recommended, since it helps fuel about 8% of your NADPH requirements through the cysteine recycling metabolism. But for this you need to beware if you have an MTHFR gene mutation that makes it harder for you to get rid of artificial folate. \n\nThe difference between artificial folate and natural folate:   \nnatural folate is called methylfolate and artificial folate is just called folic acid. \n\nMyself I take Folinic acid since it acts like bioavailable folate and is generally less expensive. Part 2 \n\nfood advice: \n\nmacronutrients\n\nprotein\n\nfat\n\nsugar\n\nSince G6PD deficiency is mainly a problem concerning the penthose pathway for glucose specifically, too much sugar in most types of G6PD people will increase oxidative load which may hasten hemolysis.\n\nMy suggestion is to eat more protein than fat and more fat than sugar. Most amino acids a part from Lysine and Leucine are glucogenic so after they will turn to alpha-ketoglutarate will then turn in to glucose and will then help replenish your glycogen storages.\n\n\\*\\*tyrosine is both ketogenic and glucogenic.\n\nA lot of the time people with G6PD need more protein than most others as well as protein is the chief way to increase lean body mass.\n\n2. Micronutrients\n\nStock up on Vitamin D since Vitamin D is responsible for activating the g6pd gene and is also a steroid hormone that helps regulate a litany of hormones and processes in your system including your testosterone.

It was the first time in my life because, as you can guess, I have G6PD Deficiency.\n\nIt was a mistake, since I was abroad and did not read carefully what I was ordering at the restaurant (my bad), so I ate a bit of it until I realized it was full of broad beans (ok actually it was a fucking BROAD BEAN BURGER).\n\nClearly this ruined the last day of my vacation cause I spent it thinking every second on the incoming haemolytic crisis I was going to have, and about the mess of having to go in an hospital abroad, where I suspected people would not even know what G6PD Deficiency is.. instead nothing happened and after 4 days I can safely say I avoided any complication.\n\nThe main reason I am writing this post, anyway, is that I wanted to share with you all this information: broad beans taste is nothing special. Just your average, boring legume. Would not think about eat them again even if it was a totally safe thing to do for me.", "Is a ketogenic diet safe with G6PD? ", "Can I take a multivitamin? I recently bought a bottle of multivitamins not thinking about the vitamin C until after. The ones I bought have 60mg per pill. \n\nI have taken vitamin C supplements a couple times in the past and have been fine, and I do not believe my deficiency is very severe but I was wondering if anyone has any experience with supplements? I have only had problems if there is iron or fish oil in it, but I am sensitive to iron supplements, and I am allergic to fish. Sometimes I will take my kids little critters multivitamin and I am fine as the doses are lower. It really comes down to you and what you need the vitamin for. the amount vitamin C is a function of how much glutathione , vitamin B2 and fat you are getting. With G6PD, the vitamin sensitivities are very variable and should be taken on a case per case basis. I use Centrum every once in a while and never had any issues :) Is there a test that can tell you how severe a person's g6pd is", "Do you guys eat at restaurants? I am very confused when it comes to \u201csoy\u201d, as I am not sure if most restaurants use soy in their oil or when cooking. So how to deal with that ? Soy is pretty much in every thing (sauces, chocolate, restaurant food, etc...) so how to deal with that?  I have eaten soy all my life. As a kid I had a problem with milk so I drank soy milk instead, and it actually helped me. And nowadays I eat sometimes soy beans, and really cannot notice any problems. I am not a doctor, so I cannot tell you to not be worried about eating foods with soy, because probably everyone reacts differently. But for me no one ever told me to avoid soy, only fava bean (and some medications). Soy can not trigger an hemolytic crisis in G6PD deficient people so you do not have to worry about it.\n\nThe only food that poses a danger are fava beans, so when in restaurants be careful about them. I\u00b4ve been consuing soy my entire life as well, so I don\u00b4t think this should be a problem. But it\u00b4s good to be aware. Have had soy and legumes all my life, no issues. As others said, foodwise it is just favabeans that you need to be careful of. According to \n\n(\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are more than 400 mutations of the deficiency, each responding differently to certain foods and drugs. Some are more sensitive, others are less so.

Seriously, this genetic mutation that like 100 million people have protects your from parasites and viruses if you are healthy.", "Does everyone who has g6pd unable to eat fava beans? I recently found out that I have g6pd chantam variant. I have always eaten fava beans with no issue. It came as a surprise that I ha e g6pd. No, it is a subgroup of G6PD deficient people. It is called favism. How would I know if I am that subgroup? Favism produces acute hemolytic anemia. After susceptible subjects eat the beans, symptoms can occur in 5\u201324 h. The symptoms include headache, vomiting, nausea, yawning, stomach pains, and a raised temperature Thankfully I have not had an issue like that or any symptoms at all. I havent eat bowls of it at a time. Who could I go to get tested to see if fava beans are an actual issue or what items are an issue? I do not know of any particular test for that isolated issue. I have severe G6PD and while it states that the things to avoid are Sulfa, Aspirin, Fava Beans, high mg of Vitamin C\u2026 I have come to find out that my deficiency is not limited to those things I mentioned above. I am allergic to most antibiotics, I cannot take Tylenol and an extensive list of other things like Plant based protein that is made with Split peas. I was told by my nutritionist to avoid legumes (all). I cannot consume Beyond branded and impossible branded anything. We are all different when it comes to tolerance. Most of the times we find out when we have a reaction. \n\nYour Dr can order diagnostic tests that may be done like include a complete blood count, serum hemoglobin test, and a reticulocyte count. All these tests give information about the red blood cells in the body. Depending on the results of those tests Drs that are knowledgeable about G6PD can determine the patient severity. Technically no. But the typical advice is still to avoid. I have eaten beyond meat burger once (pea protein) and nothing happened,I avoid their products since I found out that they use protein from broad beans on their sausage though. but what about impossible?I see that they just use soy protein. I eat  legumes all my life (except fave beans ofc) and never got sick, Idk how severe my g6pd deficiency is though Some of us are more sensitive than others with these type of foods. IMO the beyond and impossible brands are processed plant foods. They do make me feel sick and I avoid them. I have gotten very ill from Aspirin, some people with the deficiency have not issues taking that medication.  Aspirin is one of the few things that I was told to strictly avoid , as I do with broad beans, bleach, naphthalene I also have severe G6PD deficiency and also I am a beta thalassemia carrier. Do you think I can take Pfizer vaccine? There is no info about that on the internet\u2026 I cannot tell you that answer because I am not a Dr. However, I struggle a lot with allergic reactions not just due to food but also skin care products and a long list of meds. G6PD can also make one more susceptible to allergic reactions to any medication. It depends on the person. That being said, I though about the vaccine for months and due to my medical history I do not want to risk it so I chose not to get the shot. I am a Veteran and I do not have a job. I stay indoors as much as possible and only go out when I have a Dr appt that I cannot do via Telehealth. I get all my groceries delivered. So I prefer to live like this than risk it getting a vaccine that have not been throughly studied. Just my personal opinion. I am not an anti vaxxer. I have issues with my immune system because during my active duty service I received over 37 vaccines and boosters and that has had an effect on my body. I do not judge anybody for not taking the vaccine, it is your personal choice. I live in Germany and from October 11th testing will be 11 euros and you can not go to any indoor place without test, vaccine or natural immunity. That is why I need to get the jab. I will have to find a Hermatologist to discuss it first. Thank you for your service! Have you checked on the Telegram App. That is where I found most the the information about the vaccine that is not posted anywhere. That App is encrypted. Btw, I lived in Germany \ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddea 5 years during my military career. Love the food and the super clean environment. My daughter is on the lower end of it hers is a 7 but she is eaten blue one for so long with no issues and more stuff that is she should not eat I had no idea she could not eat a lot of it til I started doing my own research ! She is 6 How do you determine the scale? You need a cbc RBC AND A quantitive test Thank you. Who does this test?\n. I found I have g6pd through invitae  you will have to make the decision yourself. There are no ingredients in the Pzifer vaccine that are contraindicated. I have G6PD Deficiency and if it helps, I have taken the Pfizer vaccine 3 times with the usual common vaccine side effect which show my immune system is building the antibodies like it is supposed to do.\n\nThe vaccine includes the following ingredients: mRNA, lipids ((4- hydroxybutyl)azanediyl)bis(hexane-6,1-diyl)bis(2-hexyldecanoate), 2 -N,N-ditetradecylacetamide, 1,2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, and cholesterol), potassium chloride, monobasic potassium phosphate, sodium chloride, dibasic sodium phosphate dihydrate, and sucrose.\n\nSource:  Your pcp I have Mediterranean variant, my family is from Sicily; I have no G6PD and have had multiple transfusions.  I took the Pfizer vaccine, after speaking with my hematologist.  I suggest you ask your doctor for advice.  For me, I felt the illness effects could be greater than the shot's potential aftereffects. Remember, if you are a male, you would have gotten it from your mother; it is an X chromosome which is female.\nIf you are a female, you could have gotten it from your mother OR your father.\nAlso, if you are female, and only ONE parent has the mutated X chromosome, you would have one good and one bad. HOWEVER, the body must \"pick one\" and may have picked the bad one.  This is what happened in my situation.  I am heterozygous, one good X, one bad X G6PD chromosome, Mediterranean variant. How did you find that out? Does it make a difference? If you have G6PD deficiency, I HIGHLY recommend you see a hematologist.  If you have a hemolytic crisis, go to the hospital where your hematologist is registered. It makes it easy for when you need help. The doctors in the ER know VERY LITTLE about G6PD deficiency, since they rarely see it. you would want to tell your parent that they have G6PD deficiency.  Tests can show your level of G6PD, but only DNA analysis can determine if both or only one of your x chromosomes (if you are a female) are effected.  It really does not matter if they are one or both, what matters is your level of G6PD. Be careful of GLUTEN FREE items.  I have found some have FAVA BEANS in them.\nI also had a hemolytic reaction (spent one week in hospital with transfusions) because I had pet a dog which had recently gotten the flea and tick ointment placed on the back of it is neck. I did not know, and pet the dog.\nAlso, NEVER keep moth balls in your home, the chemical is naphthalene, and inhaling it can cause hemolytic anemia. just in case you are not aware, naphthalene is moth balls.

Hello there.  \nJust like you, I was born with G6PD, and I have been living most of my childhood in fear of what I eat. But the root cause of my fear was my ignorance of the type of food that falls under the category of food to avoid and what actually happens if I did ingest some.\n\nMy parents are not very knowledgeable and have only ever told me to avoid beans and falafels and that is pretty much it. Yet growing up I have had a lot of peanuts and ate a lot of dishes that contained soy sauce and I think I even tried soy milk one time. However, I do not recall feeling unwell in those times, but then again, I do not exactly know the symptoms or how it would feel if I ate something I should not.\n\nI am here to ask you guys what actually are the stuff someone with G6PD should avoid and how high of a risk to your health it is if you ate any and what to do if you did. NGL I was told that it could kill you and I have been scared ever since and in an attempt to educate myself only made me more scared reading that stuff like blueberries and anything made with soybean are health risks. One time I ate a bag of potato chips, I checked the back randomly and I read that it contained soybean as an ingredient which scared me and I downed an activated charcoal pill in hopes of absorbing it.\n\nSo please share your knowledge with me.

Small amounts of aspirin for example or small amounts of a substance added to foods.\n\nI am not sure if there is any science to the charcoal idea, you would have to google more on that and use reliable scientific healthcare sites, not blogs.

So looking at that I would think it is quite low, about 12 times lower than the minimum range of 5. The way it has been measured on your blood test means regular range your doctor say would be between 0'5 and 1,5 So basically you are 0.1 under 0,5 I myself have 0,02 which is 20x times lower than you. I have 31 and I am trying to figure out if my problems come from it or no and what can I do, but so far my life has been so normal I 100% assure you 0,4 is so fine, it is moderate g6p until you go under 0,1, which means you are in perfect health unless you encounter one of those drug or rare food that make you into hemolysis, which even if it happens should be noticed by you if it is light or taken care of by the hospital very easily. I did not ever imagine it can go under 0.1 and I thank you for your input. You have been tested in u/g HB which means normal range in this measure is 0,5 to 1,5 and not 5 to 15. Hi!

Ignore the websites and the people that will tell you to not eat a long list of foods. Just do not eat fava beans, or food that might have been contaminated by them (for example by being cooked in the same pan);\n\n- certain medicines: I do not have a list but your doctor should.

G6PD deficiency will not give you any symptom if you avoid the triggers, so do not worry too much!\n\nP.s.: you do not need to avoid falafel, but you need to avoid falafel done with fava beans.

I have not seen any literature indicating that it certainly provides immunity, just that it may. Is it a good idea to be g6pd and vegetarian or pescataria. Have not seen any info The only thing I have seen in regard to diet are to stay away from fava beans and red wine because of the sulfites, tonic water and for some people blueberries and soy beans. To be honest I do not know how severe my deficiency is. I have a feeling that it is not that severe. The only times I have ever had any serious health issues due to it were when I was born and had jaundice and had to have a transfusion and when I was 5 and became ill my mom gave me sulfa (this was 1965). I became severely anemic. Ended up going to the hospital and needing a transfusion. I have had no further problems for the last 55 years. I avoided sulfa, fava beans and aspirin early on as those were the only things we really knew about. I took acetaminophen and ibuprofen for years thinking they were on the ok list. Turns out they were not. But since I did not have any adverse reactions I have continued to take them but only when really necessary. I have avoided fava beans but have not avoided blueberries, because I did not know they could be an issue. Well, they have not been so I will keep eating them as I like them. I just will not do like Violet Beauregarde in Willy Wonka. Having G6PD is supposed to offer extra protection as the fragility of our blood cells is higher than normal. This prevents viruses from fully utilizing our cells to reproduce. The issue is that it depends on your severity of G6PD. In theory, it should be much harder for us to get sick with most viruses", "Is soy lecithin safe for g6pd deficiency?

Hopefully this clears my mind once and for all:\n\nWhat tattoo ink did you specifically use?\nWas it at different tattoo parlors, or the same?\nHave you also been told to avoid tattoos?\nWhat is your G6PD level? I always gone to more high end places. I sincerely doubt anyone on here will remember what specific ink they used unless they are an artist. I personally stick to black and greys, but out of preference not because they are better. I have a ton of tattoos I know henna tattoos are something to avoid ( but I have never heard of normal ink tattoos being dangerous for people with G6PD. Are you G6PD yourself as well? I think perhaps the doctor is indeed referring to the Henna which does instigate a reaction. I know I have avoided \"fun\" temporary hair dyes in the past because of Henna. I have g6pd also and I have a tattoo but I would say the most painful thing is what you eat and chemicals are to be avoided as much as possible.

I want to get vaccinated, but first I wanted to know if could be risky. \n\nI\u00b4m living in the Caribbean, so the vaccine my country have is Sinovac.

I\u00b4m still looking information about it and would share here as well. Can i know which vaccine are you getting? In my country we just have Sinovac, so I guess is the I would get. I am getting the Johnson one. My father got it as well and he is the same with us with the G6PD so i guess its fine. Ok. Thanks for letting me know. I got the Pfizer vaccine a while back and worst symptom was a headache I have now had the 2 Pfizer doses and was just fine (Sore arm and all but nothing G6PD related) I think there was a thread here before about this before, but the gist was that millions have gotten one of the vaccines and a percentage of those must have G6PD. And yet no evidence of people with G6PD having adverse reactions has turned up as a trend. I think in general allergic reactions have been very rare, maybe even more so than something like the flu vaccine.\n\nMy son (12) has G6PD deficiency and got his first Pfizer dose five days ago. He just had a sore arm for a couple of days as a result. Been fully vaccinated via the Pfizer shots since early January without any problems. I had asked the doctors and nurses at the site about G6PD and they said it should not be an issue. Thanks for let me know :D I understand. It seems like it wasn\u00b4t an adverse reaction related to G6PD deficiency.\n\nThanks for letting me know! Thanks all for your answer, guess I\u00b4ll be fine then. 12 year olds are also getting vaccinated? In the United States, one vaccine (so far) has been approved to be used for 12+.

Are the effects enough of factor for this to be a consideration in procreating? Thanks in advance for your time! My first son has recurring jauntice when born. This is when we first find out he had G6PD and my wife was a carrier. For the first 12 months I was worried and overwhelmed with everything that might effect him. However over the course we learn how to live with it and avoided the usual stuff like broad beans. Other than this, the only extra things were to inform doctors or daycare about his G6PD.\n\nIn summary, do not worry to much as having G6PD is much common than you know it. I had less fear for my second son, but luckily he did not have it.\n\nGood luck. Hello, i dont think theres a problem with carrying a kid who has G6PD but avoid broad beans and aspirins. Didnt know that i had G6PD and got an aspirin and went to the hospital for 1 month with intense pains. Hi, no issues around passing it on as the list of things to avoid are well defined and few (mainly broadbeans, aspirins and some antibiotics and antimalarials). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHonestly the main lifestyle impact for me has been avoiding eating vegetarian/vegan food that has not been cooked at home or that does not have the ingredients clearly listed, as some of it unexpectedly contains broad beans/fava bean extract (e.g. some vegan mayonnaises, vegan cream substitutes). Second this &amp; also keep an eye on any fevers. Keep them down the second they arise- they are not good for people with G6PD. Not sure if it is the same for every type of G6PD but I have found it the case for myself &amp; my family. \n\nAnd OP unless you have G6PD too your child will  be a carrier if they are a girl or if they are a male either will or will not have G6PD depending on the X chromosome they get from your partner. Get your kid tested for it as they may not have it. Virtually no impact. Most people do not ever know they even have it.

I do not think so but I have had back pain since high school and never knew how it came and read g6pd can cause back pain I am not sure possibly ? Stop jerking off One of the symptoms to hemolytic anemia due to G6PD Deficiency is back pain. I have had several hemolytic crises that led to hemolytic anemia and symptoms including back pain. The only time I seek treatment for crises is if I have severe anemia (symptoms-jaundice, enlarged spleen, back pain, nausea, paleness, headaches, dark colored urine, fatigue, lightheadedness, increased heart rate, nausea) and need a blood transfusion. Doctors usually do not do anything outside of ordering transfusions and IV fluids if need be. Hemolytic episodes are usually self limiting and the advisement includes supplementing with folic acid/methylfolate and avoiding triggers. Speaking of triggers, NSAIDS (over the counter pain meds), Tylenol, and Aspirin are G6PD Deficiency triggers.

But my hematologist has said that chick peas are fine and we have had no adverse reactions from eating them. But if you have doubts, consult your physician. Anything other than kidney beans is fine so yeah. I wouldnt risk it there is no risk, the only food that G6PD people have to avoid are fava beans. I think it is probably a name difference among different regions, but if you meant ( they are totally safe, the only food that G6PD people have to avoid are fava beans (that I know are called in several different ways so probably you meant them) I have eaten hummus and chickpeas before. So should be fine. Hi! The only food that you have to avoid are fava beans. Anyway, certain dishes have fava beans as ingredient, and obviously they are dangerous too. Hummus can be cooked with fava beans, so before eating it, you should ask the cook if he used fava beans or not. This is valid for basically everything. One other food that is commonly made with fava beans is falafel.\n\nChickpeas are totally safe, so if hummus or falafel are made with chickpeas you can eat it! I think hummus can be made with differents ingredients... if it is made with chickpeas it is fine, but if it is made with fava beans it is dangerous, so this needs to be checked before eating it Everyone is different so there is no single answer to this question, it depends the severity of your deficiency.\nIn my experience I had numerous crisis due to hummus/chickpeas/lentils.\nAll legumes are a potential risk not only fava beans sadly. Stop fear monger ling. Chickpeas are fine Nope. Citation please. This is not true You are not the only one I hate when people tell someone who is experiencing something that it is not true. I have had the same issue.  this is not true.  My lung nearly collapsed when i wad young due to eating lentils every day No idea why. You probably had some other illness apart from G6PD deficiency because lentils are 100% safe to eat Fava beans are the only beans known to affect everyone. \nThis site says that different foods effect different people:\n  This says otherwise\n Hi OP.\nId say just test it by eating small amounts and see how you go from there. You should not believe everything that you read on the internet! There is no scientific evidence for any food except fava beans, also the several variants of the illness only affect the severity and the probability to have an haemolytic crisis but they do not react to different foods.\n\n\n\nalso you can read ( comment that I made some time ago, where I explain that I contacted a hematologist known for his study on G6PD, and I report his answer, and I also translate a part of an interview with another hematologist that explains why only fava beans can trigger a reaction. These broad discoveries do not support your allegations. In general chickpeas are fine for g6pd. As with all food if you feel something is wrong after 1-2 meals. Stop taking it\n\nStop fear mongering. I have avoided tons of food last year because of forums like this and people like you. It made me super paranoid till one day I decided fuck this, I am not crazy and started banned foods again in ladder to find which cause me no problems. And honestly most didnt This is the point. It is all different per person, so saying that only fava or kidney beans are bad is wrong. It takes experimentation and self-awareness with the foods you eat. &gt;There is no scientific evidence for any food except fava beans, also the several variants of the illness only affect the severity and the probability to have an haemolytic crisis but they do not react to different foods.\n\nThe second site listed has many articles listed in there citations page. This point I agree with. However this applies to everyone not just those with g6pd. Your initial post hints a broader suspicion of allergy because of g6pd. And the correlation is very loose Can you point me to some scientific research that says that a food other than fava beans can trigger a crisis? I honestly got confused now true favs beans are very bad for you but I heard that there are other food but is it true or not, because lately I have been eating kidney beans and drinking soy milk everyday and my face got \u201cfatter\u201d I feel and I gained like 10 pounds One of the truths about G6PD deficiency is that you will hage to trial foods and see what has an effect for you. Fava beans are known to have a bad effect. There are many other reported foods with negative effects but these vary from person to person.\n\nThere are 400 variations of G6PD deficiency. They all have different interactions with different foods. Does this explain it? True &gt;There are ~400 variations of G6PD deficiency. They all have different interactions with different foods. Does this explain it?\n\nDo you have some scientific source for this claim? I read a bit a never found anything that proves or even claim this. Idk if you have any other allergy on top of G6PD deficiency, but kidney beans and soy are totally safe for consumption.\n\nG6PD deficiency can lead to you having an haemolytic crisis, you become yellowish, have fever, your body hurts and if you do not go quickly to the hospital you die... Having face fatter and gaining weight is not considered something that happens due to G6PD deficiency I linked some sites above. They all cite their claims. They are health websites. Even the nsw of australia health website says the same. They are health websites made by random people. I could not find a citation list, and by the way even if I found one, I am not going to read all of the articles listed to find or maybe not find a research that support your claim... If there is one link it. The nsw of australia is made by the goverment. It are not random people mate. A government make laws, not scientific research... A government can act based on incomplete data or just because a minister feels that he has to be cautious. I saw several times incorrect information about the subject, even coming from official source. But scientific research says a different story. Mate. I am not continuing this. Anything i provide will not convince you anyway. You think you are right and arent really open to other views. what? you did not provide anything... you cited the nsw as a source, I went in their website and they do not say what you said, I even gave you the links... are you kidding me? ( finally you posted something. let us look at it.\n\nthe first document is just an informative pamphlet. It can be made with incorrect data and it does not prove anything. Probably whoever was in charge to made that list went for a safe route and suggested to avoid more food than necessary. as you demonstrate, there is really a lot of disinformation on G6PD. Once I saw a Pakistani pamplhlet, similar to this one, with something like 20/30 differents foods listed.\n\nthe second one is indeed a study, but you should not just read the abstract superficially.\n\nSo how did the study concludes that all those foods are harmful? The abstract says: \\*Data were collected from patient's files, from November 2011 to November 2016, using the pre-designed questionnaires to obtain the complete history, clinical presentation and laboratory investigations including the complete blood count, red blood cells morphology, liver and renal functions and quantitative assay of G6PD enzyme activity by spectrophotometric method\\*\n\nwhat does this mean? I cannot read the article unless I pay 65$ but it is clear that no one experimented with those foods and patients. whoever made the study just looked at the files and made a lists of foods with the answer that the patients put on the questionaries. This means that everytime a person had haemolysis they asked them what they ate and they wrote it down. Since haemolysis can trigger even 48 hours after eating fava beans or taking a certain drug, there is no guarantee that the food listed are the one that triggered haemolysis.\n\nFunny thing: your first link lists tonic water and blueberries, your second one does not. It is almost like they lists random things. Mate. You are never going to be satisfied that anyone elses information is as good as yours. \nI did read that article and found it informative and well designed. I do not really care what you think, you can be as wrong as you like, it will not stop me from knowing that it is not only fava beans that are bad for people.\n\nHave a happy life and please do not contact me again. You are quite insufferable. Well I am going to be satisfied when you provide clear informations and address the things that I say and link. The article is informative but it is not conclusive. I made a comment on why I think it is not, you could address that point or act offended because I do not agree with you. Hi OP. I was diagnosed with G6PD in 1991, the year many readers here may have been born. \n\nThe critical things to keep in mind are Fava beans, and some vegan protein bars that use Fava protein as a plant source \n\nMoreover, if on any medical charts you are ever asked about \u201callergies\u201d or \u201cdrug interactions\u201d please list \u201cASA Sulfa\u201d\n\nAs G6PD humans, we need to avoid Fava and Aspirin Sulfa products. \n\nOn the bright side, we are malaria immune. \n\nC\u2019est la Vie mon amis. \n\nIf you need advice, happy to share my personal experiences (not a physician, just a resilient lifelong learner) Hummus is the Arabic word for chickpeas. \n\nHummus made without chickpeas is just dip. While I agree with your point about trying all kinds of foods, and am truly glad you are unaffected, IMHO you would want to be a bit more careful with advice like this.  \nYou are a grown person where your RBC can replenish in time, avoiding any crisis. While some of the community here have differing severities of G6PD, or in my case, have kids/toddlers with G6PD.    \nIt is bad enough there is not much documentation, so what you perceive as 'fear mongering' may be just some of us not willing to go 'Fuck this' and risk the health of our little ones. And no, I am not being overly paranoid, I am slowly experimenting with tree nuts for my child now that he is above 2 years old.   \nAlso reading as much as I can, and am very thankful for all the comments in this subreddit!  \n\n\nPeace and stay safe :) Hi, I want to say thank you for giving clear information about G6PD (As someone who has G6PD) So many websites and some doctors seemed to have a long list of ingredients that you cannot eat/take and there is so little accurate information about this condition. I always wondered whether if I am ok every time I eat anything that has nuts. (Excluding fava beans of course) you are welcome! When I first stumbled across this subreddit I was a bit astonished by the amount of foods some G6PD people avoid. I am from a region where 10% of people have it (literally thousands of people), and here the condition is well known, everyone knows they has to only avoid fava beans. nuts are fine too (unless you have some other allergy of course)", "How big is the risk of complications when taking Vitamin C?  I am pretty sure it is pretty much zero. at least in my experience. However do still check the ingredients of the supplements you are taking just in case. For me i take vitamine c capsules w no complications I take centrum on a regular basis and on occasion use berocca multivitamin dissolving tabs that have 200ish % of your Vitmain C daily recommendation, so far never had any issues. I have never had issues taking vitamin C either, but I remember being told I should avoid it. Really cannot tell..simce there are over 400 genetic variants of g6pd. You will have to test it and see. Start small though Not an expert but I think the benefits offset the negatives. I have g6pd and I am taking 300% daily. different variants of G6PD do not have different triggers for hemolysis crisis, no experimentation is needed as far as I know. Hi, Vitamin C is no risk for G6PD people. what you have to avoid are fava beans, and this is the only food that should worry you. obviously any food that is made with them or contain traces of them is dangerous too.\n\nyou should also be careful when taking medicines (always ask your doctor to check if a medicine is fine for you), avoid a certain ink called \"henna\" used in tatoos and maybe hair dyes, and be aware that certain kind of mothballs could be dangerous (but I think you should kind of swallow or inhale them to get hemolysis, never heard of a crysis induced by them) interesting, but not exact. The biggest problem with G6PD is that there are so many different types as well as the interaction of specific gene polymorphisms that are individual to each person which can affect the outcome of certain reactions. ( What I said is correct. Read your own link:\n\n&gt; Triggers of hemolysis in G6PD-deficient persons include certain infectious diseases, certain drugs, and eating fava beans: this can cause a potentially serious acute hemolytic anemia known as favism.\n\n&gt; As many as 400 different genetic variants of G6PD deficiency have been reported, and for 186 the precise mutation is known. The World Health Organization (WHO) has classified variants on the basis of residual enzyme activity and of disease severity. Class I are the most severe variants: those in which there is chronic hemolysis even in the absence of any triggering factor. Class II and III are variants with marked enzyme deficiency but no chronic hemolysis; class IV are variants with normal enzyme activity; class V was designed for variants with increased enzyme activity\n\nOnly the severity of the condition varies between different variants, but not the triggers (fava beans, certain drugs, etc). No, what you said was: \"do not have different triggers for hemolysis crisis, no experimentation is needed as far as I know.\" in response to the question about vitamin C. Vitamin C is particular in that it interacts with Glutathione, even as far as that question is concerned, most experiments are barely conclusive as far as the interactions of vitamins and minerals are concerned. The one common trigger is fava beans. but in the article itself it states in the introduction: \"As many as 400 different genetic variants of G6PD deficiency have been  reported, and for 186 the precise mutation is known. The World Health  Organization (WHO) has classified variants on the basis of residual  enzyme activity and of disease severity. Class I are the most severe  variants: those in which there is chronic hemolysis even in the absence  of any triggering factor. Class II and III are variants with marked  enzyme deficiency but no chronic hemolysis; class IV are variants with  normal enzyme activity; class V was designed for variants with increased  enzyme activity.\"  which supports my argument completely when referring to the differences in reactions.   \n\n\nNow if we are talking about the other aspects like the strength of complications or even by which mechanism, those have yet to have been proven but anecdotal evidence keeps scientists guessing.   \n\n\n( I said that what causes the hemolytic crysis are always the same things: fava beans, certain drugs, and a few other things. this does not varies between G6PD variants.\n\nyou cited the same part that I cited, did you read it? where does it say that different variants are triggered by different things? I read what you wrote and what I am saying is that the  ONLY cause that us uniform for everyone is fava..everuthing else is on a case per case basis. you are simply inventing what you said. g6pd triggers are known, do not vary, and they are listed even in the link that you provided.\n\nI read several papers and articles on the subject (as well as having a lot of personal experience) and the only place where I read this thing that different people can have different triggers due to G6PD having variants is here.\n\n\n\n Huh? But everything you are saying is literally being refuted in the first lines of your sources. Which say exactly as I have stated, that there are so many subtypes that only fava beans are a sure thing, but other things should be taken on a case by case basis, since while there is no conclusive evidence of any issues, there are people with g6pd who have reported issues. \n\nThis means there are other factors to take in to consideration like other gene subtypes and polymorphisms since g6pd is essentially an issue with not only glutathione recycling but with detoxification of certain tyoes of toxins since people with g6pd do not produce enough NADPH to fuel certain metabolisms. This has wide ranging effects. To state something so simple as...there is only 1 trigger is too simplistic, since afferrent research is still being done. cite the part that refute what I say please.\n\n&gt; only fava beans are a sure thing, but other things should be taken on a case by case basis\n\nthere is not a single scientific study that proves or cites anything other what I said earlier (fava beans, certain drugs and few other things) as trigger for G6PD people. so there is not basis to basis. do you have anything to support what you say? You can google it and check. You need to do more than just recite data...you need to understand it. are you trolling? I provided sources and real info. you said incorrect things and provided a link that said that I was right. you keep repeating you are right but cannot provide a single source or cite what part contraddict me, and now you even insult me saying that I am not able to understand.\n\ntrust me, you are wrong and you are spreading misinformation, avoid giving health tips on the internet. Not trolling bro..every textbook on g6pd and reasearch done knows this as fact. Or just type in google NADPH + G6PD. Study the topic more in depth and add nuance to your view. i know the topic very well since I got tested at birth and in my region around 10% of people have it. doctors studied it extensively, I have tens of familiars and friend with it.\n\n&gt; every textbook on g6pd and reasearch done knows this as fact\n\nfalse. every research just cite what I said earlier as common triggers for every variant of G6PD. and I never seen a single research say that different variants have different triggers.\n\nstop saying me to google stuff. just give me a link that demonstrate what you say. Your having G6PD and and knowing people who have it does not disprove anything. If anything even in this room I can read of accounts from people who have not had any crises, thus confirming what the article and what most know is true that results vary greatly among the 400 genetic subtypes of the polymorphism.   \n(  \n\n\nTake vitamin K..   \nvitamin K1 uses Nadph in its conversion, extra amounts of it can build up and cause various problems. (  \n\n\nAlso the speed at which your Vitamin K1 conversion occurs is largely dependent on other factors such as your VKORC1 gene\n\n(  \n\n\nVitamin C depends on GLutathione and not g6pd only to be recycled, but if you have too much oxidized Glutathione, than that can cause oxidative stress since dehydroascorbic acid is a hyperoxide ((   \n\n\nAnd that is just the start.. since NADPH is involved in many metabolisms for detoxification of reactive oxygen species(ROS) (  \n\n\nAlso, all this information can be found in many human nutrition books, I recommend Advanced human nutrition  \nadvanced human nutrition 6th edition or to talk to a specialist.   \n\n\nThe article you posted also states that most G6PD-deficient persons are asymptomatic most of the time; however,  any one of them, when exposed to certain triggering factors, can develop  acute hemolytic anemia (AHA), which may be life-threatening especially  in children.  \n\n\nwhich makes what you just said an outright untruth. \n\n\"false. every research just cite what I said earlier as common triggers  for every variant of G6PD. and I never seen a single research say that  different variants have different triggers.\"   \nand no.. the research does not state that.   \n( \n\nevery where I read, the line clearly states: \"Hemolytic anemia can also occur after eating fava beans or inhaling pollen from fava plants (a reaction called favism).\" which means some people will be asymptomatic. \n\nI took a look at the links you provided, and one leads to a dead end and the other.. well.. completed in 1997... I think you should look up more recent articles, and read more. \n\nHere you will have the list of chemicals that may cause hemolysis (  \n\n\nBut all of these are dependent on other factors, since the body is not a simple machine. In as much as your second statement is also, outright false, since no one ever stated everything was known; on the contrary, not much is known at all.. just out of curiosity, which is your qualification?\n\nanyway, we might have had a bit of miscommunication (my bad). my only point is that, regarding food, the only one that can trigger hemolysis are fava beans. obviously, I know that certain chemicals present in certain drugs (and in a few other cases like henna ink) can also be a trigger. do we agree?\n\nI can also confirm most of the things you said, for example that people can be asymptomatic. one can eat fava beans for all his life being asymptomatic, and suddenly have an hemolytic crisis after the 100th time, or never (there is a recent note from the italian national institute of health about covid-19 that warns about a certain drug that is being used to treat it, that says to not use it on g6pd people, even if they never had a crisis in all their life)\n\nanother note on something you cited (*Hemolytic anemia can also occur after eating fava beans or inhaling pollen from fava plants*): this is true and align with what I always knew, but in the very last years italian authorities looked better into the pollen thing, and they said it looks like pollen is not a triggering factor. I think this is to be taken cautiously, but might be true.", "Hello I am a 16 year old boy with G6PD. Could anybody please help me, I am fine and healthy living my best life but I have had jaundice for a really long time anybody know how to get rid of it ???  Are you avoiding the foods that could trigger your g6pd symptoms ? Uhh 16 year old idiot here that is a thing ? I really do not do anything different except I avoid fava beans, Silva drugs, blue dye. I also take vitamin D Keep fevers down as soon as you get them- me and my fam find it triggers everything. \n\nAlso add to your avoid list tonic water &amp; blueberries. Avoid moth balls as well but you will not come across those often. Okay for sure, any vitamins I should take ? Not sure sorry. I would love if there was more research on G6PD but I struggle to find much. \n\nI do know tho, no vitamin C in high doses. That will trigger you too. Personally I avoid vit c in vitamins altogether &amp; just get it from foods. Shit I had jaundice today so before going to bed I took as many vitamins as I could find and I think C was one of them :(. Tbh Idk what the hell im doing i probably just make things worse Try skulling water it might push the vit c through you quicker (you lose a lot through urine) - I am not a doc tho that is just a guess. \n\nDo not stress it is hard to find info!! You will pickup bits and pieces here and there &amp; get the hang of it. It is not much to manage once you know what things to avoid.\n\nAlso bud make sure the jaundice is not from other health issues, there is a lot that can cause it. Best wishes. Ya to be honest it dosent bother me too much except I have insomnia so I am often up until like 4 or 5 and have school at 8 so I am often really tired. The main thing for me is just getting rid of the yellow eyes cause my friends sometimes ask about it and it bugs me You need a cbc rbc and a G6pD quantitative test", "Smarties  What is with the blue smarties? \n The dye (methylene blue) is not recommended for anyone with G6PD deficiency as it is a potential trigger for hemolysis.", "G6PD Deficient - Avoid All Triggers? So, there is A LOT of foods listed on various sites that can act as triggers. I was unaware of most of them all of my life up until now. \n\nNow that I have checked them out, I have found that I have eaten a lot of them and it has not triggered any kind of crisis/negative response for me? \n\nDoes this mean I can eat those things and it is perfectly okay? Or should I avoid EVERYTHING on those lists? The only food that I avoid is broad beans, I have not heard of any others being bad for G6PD What is the long foods list you are looking at? I think it really does depend on what variant and class of G6PD Deficiency you have. If you have the ValMet variant of G6PD Deficiency, you are not as likely to be triggered from eating peanuts or other legumes as someone with the Mediterranean variant of G6PD Deficiency. My son has the ValMet variant and he can eat beans without any issues. I have 2 variants of G6PD Deficiency, the ValMet variant and the Ilesha variant. The ValMet variant is not an issue for me, but the Ilesha variant is a Class 1 variant and causes Chronic Nonspherocytic Hemolytic Anemia when triggered. I have been triggered by everything from black tea and fake mint, to the naphthalene in paint and NSAIDS over the counter pain medications. I have had to get several blood transfusions because of how severe my hemolytic crises were. I did not know I have G6PD Deficiency until I was an adult, but as I reflect back, I have always been negatively affected by certain foods that I now know are contraindicated for some of us with G6PD Deficiency like beans and iron fortified foods. When I was younger though, my doctors always just said that I was chronically anemic due to iron deficiency. Iron is not usually what causes our anemia though, folate deficiency is. We actually are prone to iron overload if we are not careful. The food and medication avoid lists are both very long. The food avoid list includes all broad beans and legumes, soy, teas, processed foods high in iron, absorbic and citric acids, foods with locust beans in them, most oils like canola and sunflower oils, foods with glycerin like parboiled rice, bitter gourds, foods with artificial colors especially blue, black and red teas, foods with sulfites/nitrates, agave, acai, fake sugar, tonic water, alcohol, etc. It is a lot of foods and well over 300 medications and counting. I will try to post up the most up to date avoid lists on this subgroup. I have only been warned about three good items on that list! My experience is there are a lot of things\u2014 especially meds\u2014 that are on the list but they do not cause a reaction in all people. So it is strange; you do want to avoid but like I have never been warned about soy, teas, etc.Literally only been warned about favs beans, ascorbic &amp; citric acids, and sulfite/nitrates. Have not ever had fava beans.  But the other two things I cited have caused problems for me. That said, I can eat an orange and drink lemonade without incident. Meds &amp; treatments with ascorbic or citric acids have caused problems. So have things with sulfites. It definitely does depend on your class and variant of G6PD Deficiency. My son is asymptomatic and he is class 5 G6PD Deficiency and I cannot even use regular toothpaste without it triggering hemolysis. A lot of things that I have had hemolytic crises from, do not seem to be major issues for other people with G6PD Deficiency. Two of my worst crises for instance were triggered by Hydroxychloroquine (which is not a trigger for some people with G6PD Deficiency and can be used with precaution in some other people with G6PD Deficiency) and copper. Both crises required blood transfusions,breathing treatments, and oxygen therapy because my hemoglobin dropped down to 8, my O2 stats were in the 80s, and my kidneys started shutting down. I also seem to be really triggered by infections. I do not think that all people who are G6PD Deficient are triggered by infections. Because I have Class 1 G6PD Deficiency, I try to stay up to date with the latest G6PD Deficiency information and triggers. Thanks for the helpful info! I really do not know much about my G6PDD, I actually want to get re-tested and find out which class and variant I am. \n\nI have recently been diagnosed with Gilbert's Symdrome and it makes me wonder if I was misdiagnosed with G6PDD as a child? Because afaik the only symptoms I have ever shown of G6PDD is my skin turning yellow.\n\nOfc, they must have done blood tests and all that, so I dont know. &gt;ValMet variant\n\nHow do you find the variant of G6PD? Is there a specific blood test to request? Genetic testing. Most developed countries screen their newborns at birth for G6PD Deficiency. In the U.S. however, only a few states test newborns for G6PD Deficiency including Washington State and California. I paid for my own genetic test because my Hematologist never ordered any blood tests for genetic blood disorders or inherited hemoglobinopathies. He is only interested in treating my Chronic ITP unfortunately. The meds are to be avoided (anti-malarials and a couple of antibiotics), but food wise i have had chickpeas, legumes, soy sauce, peas, all my life and never had any issues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFava beans is the one to avoid though for sure, that one put me in hospital as a kid! G6PD deficiency is mostly a silent condition. It can appear dormant for a long time, even a lifetime. There are over 400 variations of the genetic conditions and different variations are impacted by items on the avoid lists differently. Unless you are always checking your blood levels to determine when you are experiencing active hemolysis, it is a safe bet to stay clear of items on the avoid lists. Otherwise, get more information on your specific variation and other propensity for hemolysis and then make a good decision on what items to consume or be exposed to.", "G6PD and Protein shakes Hey guys, I am a gym rat who has been working out for a year now. I had Iso protein that contained soy which I did not know until I almost fainted in the living room. I want to use protein but I am afraid that the soy will have an affect on me, do you guys think it will or will not? I am on the severe spectrum of G6PD. I am actually under a Hematologist care and a Nutritionist. If you can tolerate Soy then there is no problem. I can drink amount of Almond milk without any issues but I cannot use any plant based protein because 99% have Pea Protein as an added ingredient or main ingredient. I also cannot have any blue colorant. Foods that have natural Sulfur like Broccoli (I was shocked because I am a Vegetarian). After landing in the hospital a few times due to Hemolytic Anemia triggered by foods( some vegetables), Menthol, Aspirin and Vitamin C, I was told I cannot consume any Impossible and Beyond brand anything because it is basically a processed food that is made with pea protein or other legumes that are not even listed as ingredients. Be advised some of us have it worse than others. Maybe you are able to tolerate legumes and just stay away from the Fava Beans. Unfortunately for me I cannot consume any legumes at all. It depends on the severity and tolerance on each individual with the G6PD Deficiency. Everyone has different triggers and you have to figure out yours in particular because even on this thread people have different reactions. Some will swear that it is ONLY fava beans. Others have a reaction to all beans, legumes, and the laundry list of meds and variables. \n\nPersonally I cannot tolerate soy or pea protein. It is really hard to find clean protein and you might want to look at rice based protein. I also started using collagen based powders, which vary slightly from standard protein powders but leave me with the same effects. Apparently collagen has 19 of the 20 amino acids to make protein complete. For context, I workout 5 days a week and live on my peloton, run, and do yoga, but I am not a gym rat. Wow, I am sorry you have to go through all of that I hope it gets better. I do not know if I am on the severe side or not but I do not want to do anything that will get me sick, for most g6pd patients are they able to consume soy? I was using the protein for a while until I started getting light headed and stuff I really am not sure what are my triggers, what do you suggest to do ? Yes, most can tolerate Soy. For reference, if you start feeling very fatigued, in my case heart palpitations, a feeling of malaise all day, low fever, looking pale and abnormal red and white cells labs then please let your Dr know about your G6PD. I have noticed that not all Doctors are knowledgeable about this deficiency and your symptoms cannot be misdiagnosed for something else. In my case, one doctor thought it was Leukemia because of the rapid pace my red cells where dying and that Dr put me through so many tests, even a bone marrow biopsy \ud83d\ude44 Just food for thought. I would go and get a reputable intolerance test and also get tested for G6PD (if you have not already) to see exactly what your levels are. Some people have a milder case than others. \n\nBut a food and environmental intolerance test should show what intolerances you may have (not a standard allergy test). I did mine with a lab that used both hair samples and did a blood test. \n\nIt could all be a fluke or unrelated to the protein but better to get to a doctor willingly vs  to passing out and end up in the hospital. What Is is considered mild? Again everyone is different, but this article has some good info:  Oh damn well I hope that is all settled now, by any chance you got Instagram ? No, I do not have Instagram. I do not think I am on the severe side, but I usually drink soy milk and never had any reaction. Have you felt different after consuming the protein? Usually what I really avoid is fava beans, but after that I eat/drink almost anything. But this is only my experience side. As a protein, I usually try to have beef , egg or chicken powdered protein. I put some extra in my soups since Organika has a brand taste I like in hot water and it is usually best to take protein powder with other foods.Since we do not produce enough NADPH, many anabolic enzymes are short changed through our lack of G6PD enzyme (main producer of NADPH) , which is why it is so hit or miss with beans, legumes, and other things that require detoxification and further transformation in our bodies.  (\n\nThe best thing for someone with G6PD is to increase the amount glutathione, NADPH and G6PD action in their system. Personally I purchase specific amino acids that make glutathione\n\n* Glycine 5g ((\n* NAC 100mg ((\n* Methionine 100 mg ((\n* Betaine 1g ((\n\n\\*\\*\\* these are the proportions I use regularly, it may vary for you. You may need to experiment to get your sweet spot.\n\nMethionine increases the amount of NADPH you will produce, while also using up your glycine storages, which is why I use those 2. (\n\nMethionine gets me going and makes my workouts more intense.\n\nBetaine is there to help recycle the methionine and also provide you with extra glycine.\n\nDownside, too much methionine makes you irritable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYour body has different genes that interact with the way it processes different vitamins from varying sources. Usually, vitamins that come from non animal sources require NADPH (mainly from G6PD). Except for certain vitamins from certain kinds of kelp and mushrooms (vitamin D3). This is why you will have wide variation between one person and another as far as reactions go. Since some people may have other supporting genetic factors helping them in different ways. I did not have any direct reactions, but keep in mind I was using it for 2-3 months straight. At one point I felt really dizzy and light headed like I was about to faint. Nothing is certain but I concluded that it was the soy. Damn bro this stuff is really useful I appreciate you taking the time out of your day to write this! I will check all of this out \ud83d\udda4\u2764\ufe0f Ok. Well, as others have commented, I think would be good to seek medical information and a G6PD test, which I should do it myself, since the only info I have is that they told mom after I was born. Or you can try avoid the protein for a similar time and see if you feel the same. I have had a test made like 3-4 months ago I just want to see if my g6pd levels are getting better or not  Do you know why red pepper or okra would cause reactions? Do you ever become extremely sleepy or fuzzy headed with reactions? Thanks for the helpful information! Where can I find supplements in those doses? Everything I see has 1000 mg +. I understand you are likely vegan for ethical reasons but have you considered stopping for your health ever? It is already deficient for people without g6pd. I am sure you are ontop of it though. Just curious I guess? Plants dont like to be eaten and cant run away, so all plants have atleast some harmful factor. I choose to abstain from them almost entirely for that reason and a few others \ud83d\ude01\n\nRed peppers are nightshades, naturally highly toxic but we have selected for fruit with less of these alkaloid toxins. Most people do \"fine\" with them. Many have alergies or other reactions still.\n\nOkra isnt considered a nightshade but contains solinine, one of the nightshade alkaloid toxins. You may even find you can handle an amount of okra if it is less bitter, even if you have had problems with larger amounts or more bitter okra. Depends on you and what you consider to be ok. Hi. I am a Vegetarian not a Vegan. There is a difference in the two. I have always struggle eating meat, chicken, anything animal since I was a child. For some unknown reason I felt like throwing up every time I attempted to maintain a diet with animal protein. I lived through that on and off cicle even through adulthood. Being a Vegetarian It is a choice for me but honestly I did not see or feel any difference when I was eating Animal Protein and then switched to completely Vegetarian. Bahahaha subtle but not subtle enough. Ma man ", "carbamide peroxide gel for teeth whitening g6pd Can I whiten my teeth using this gel? Is it safe? I did use a certain gel for whitening (prescribed by the dentist) and I asked the same question, his reply was that carbamide peroxide is expected to release less than 6 % hydrogen peroxide when active and that due to the conversion of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen, hydrogen peroxide would not be expected to persist long enough in the body to reach G6PD deficient erythrocytes and to provoke an oxidative response.\n\nI ended up using the gel for 5 weeks or so and the only side effect I had was really sensitive teeth, no anemia or anything of the sort! :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBtw He also linked the source, which is a publication by the European Union's guidelines for public health:\n\nunder 6.2:\n\n(\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope this helps!

I am not sure you make your final medical decision based on what the group says. Plus what is partial deficiency? You are either g6pd deficient (not enough) or not (adequate).

I have been worrying a lot if G6PD deficiency has any link with the severity of COVID 19 if I catch it. Should I be concerned ? I have heard there is some concern because C19 causes oxidative stress, which can trigger/amplify a G6PDD crisis. My partner has G6PDD, and so we got a medical alert bracelet a few months ago because of Covid concerns - it is also just generally a good idea, in case you are unconscious and/or do not have someone who will advocate for you in an emergency.\n\nOur biggest concern is what drugs are used to treat it, and whether they are known to be dangerous, or have not even been tested on G6PD patients.

I hit up google to see if anyone had a similar experience but to no avail. I did stumble across this research paper  which seems to convey that G6PD cells are less viable for Stap infections.

As I read more, they also have a dairy free yogurt called Oat Yeah that also includes fava beans as an ingredient.\n\nI emailed Silk to express my concerns for people with G-6PD deficiency and received no reply. Then I called and the representative let me know that they are only legally required to list the top 8 allergens (peanuts, tree nuts, soy, etc.).

It was so terrifying at the time as we had no idea what caused the severe reaction. What a frightening experience. I am so sorry you had to go through that. I hope your son is ok. Thank you for sharing. I think the FDA should require products with hidden fava beans to have a warning label because the risk to G6PD deficient people is so great. It is not like ingesting fava beans causes something as simple as an upset stomach. How terrifying! My parents were the ones in your shoes when I was born severely jaundiced, required a blood transfusion and then again at 5 years old when I had hemolytic anemia after being given Sulfa (this was in 1965) and taking another trip to the hospital for a transfusion. It took several months of testing before a good family friend who was also a talented doctor found out what I had. My mom later told me that she was terrified due to not knowing what had caused my anemia. They feared I had leukemia. Fortunately my class of G6PD is not a severe one and ever since that last trip to the hospital 55 years ago I have not had any further episodes.

Hello,\n\nI just realised I accidentally ate some fava beans (and have been eating them for a few days now almost daily). It was part of this snack:  that I have been eating over a few days. I think the total weight must have been about 300g and there is about 80g left, so I recon I have eat about 50g of fava beans over the last week or so. \n\nSadly this was sent to me and the label does not contain the ingredients, just allergens (classically not mentioning the fava beans). I finally got curious to figure out what that nut was (I have never seen fava beans in this form before) and now I am shocked and panicked. \n\nIs there something I can do to reduce the chance of getting a reaction? Is there something I should be doing now in general? i think as long as you have been feeling fine you do not have much to worry about. there is a persian style of rice with dill and fava beans that i LOVE and sometimes i eat it anyway, but it is such a small quantity i never have had any reactions. my brother did have a an attack from fava beans \u2014 which is how we found out \u2014 after eating 3 bowls of fava bean soup. probably such a small amount is ok. Thanks for the reply, makes me feel much better. I ate a portion (would contain 5-10g of fava beans max) about an hour ago. I read it takes 5-24hours before you get a reaction (if you get one), which is why I am panicking. Especially since I will be going to bed in a couple of hours. Keep an eye on the color of your pee. If yellow turns to orangish or brownish, seek out your primary physician. Keep an eye on the whites of your eyes - that is the first place you see the yellow from the bilirubin buildup if hemolysis is occurring. My husband has G6PD. I have known him for 23  years and lived with him 12. He too has total deficit. For him, these happen to be the 1st visual signs for him. If you see none of this and are feeling absolutely fine, your body must have found a wave to cope. Thanks for replying. Do you know how long after consumption it took your husband in the past to see those signs? Assuming it has happened to him before. you can have an hemolytic crysis even with a small amount of fava, or get lucky and not have one even after eating plenty! you can take the risk and eat the fava beans anyway, but do not think you are 100% safe I am surprised you did not immediately felt lightheaded and faint after eating the fava beans. I think you will be fine since you do not have any symptoms. Just stop eating it and let your body recover, there is nothing you can do besides trying to vomit it up and going to the hospital for a transfusion before you go full anemic. I am definitely not going to continue eating them, would not have done it in the first place if I knew what it was. Can a reaction be so immediate? My understanding is that unlike an allergy, the issue shows up during digestion, so it can take hours before you get a reaction. \n\nIt has been almost 12 hours now and considering it was just a small portion and my stomach was basically empty, I am hoping it is all in the past now. &gt;I am surprised you did not immediately felt lightheaded and faint after eating the fava beans\n\nusually the crysis triggers after 12-48 hours. so this is not surprising and unfortunately he has to wait a bit before feeling safe Hi, Any updates on OP? How are you now? Hi, thanks for checking! Nothing happened in the end, no reaction that I could feel. I am guessing with the amount I ate being really small and a bit of luck, I got away with it.", "Are protein shakes safe for G6PD patients?

So far so good. Read all the ingredients and to be honest a little bit scared because of emulsifier. Yet nearly 6 out of 10 goods at supermarket contains soy lecithin.\n\nNevertheless, not having any issues does not mean it is not harmful. We have to test our blood for red blood cell count and check for any liver damage continuously. Hemolysis might be unnoticeable. Actually protein shakes can be a problem.  I was taking protein shakes as part of a weightless plan. Low carb high protein.  I ended up in the hospital requiring blood transfusions.  I suspect the source of the protein was the issue.  Coming from legumes or something I cannot have it caused hemolysis. Exactly how many days between you started to consume protein and hemolysis occured?

From my experience (i have severe g6pd deficiency) alcohol is fine. I have gotten drunk so many times but nothing happened. Also my sister has a tattoo and she does have g6pd deficiency.

Everyone is very different. For me with moderate g6pd deficiency alcohol is not usually a problem. But if it gets to excess level where the average person would have a hangover, I have noticed my hangovers feel like death comparably. \n\nAs for tattoos from my research and people's experiences you should be fine. The reason tattoos usually get brought up by doctors is because of Henna tattoos which we are allergic to and does not have much to do with actual tattoos. There is no \"trigger\", it isnt an allergic reaction. Thanks for pointing that out. G6PD is a genetic disorder and not an allergy also nothing triggers G6PD deficiency as you have it or not to some severity. \n\nI should have said anything that causes oxidative stress has the potential to cause hemolytic anemia. Henna is one of those things along with alcohol. Yea. On the metabolic side you can think of it like an energy pool as g6pd is part of nadph production, and on the other side it is oxidation protection.

It was an important discovery has i have chronic symptoms that seem to be related to this. According to everyone, Carbohydrates are to be avoided when you are G6PD. Which was a great news because i already made that change in the past, thinking its helping me. But when it comes to research, the only research that has ever been done about consumption of Carbohydrates and the production of G6PD in 1999 said that rich carbohydrate diet stimules the expression of G6PD while a more fatty diet inhibits it. I would be pleased to have any advice or information about this. a good day to everyone I have never heard of that, but the only correlation between G6PD deficiency and metabolising carbohydrates is this study from University of Maryland from 2012 on the effects of G6PD on high sugar diets. The conclusion was good news for us: \n\nLink: ( \n\n\"G6PD deficiency decreases weight gain and hyperinsulinemia with DIO (Diet induced obesity), but elevates serum free fatty acids, without affecting glucose tolerance. On the other hand, it modestly suppressed indexes of glucose flux into nonoxidative pathways in myocardium, suggesting potential protective effects.\"\n\nIt is suggesting that having G6PD deficiency makes it harder to gain weight or become diabetic due to a high fructose/sugar diet. I have seen to avoid refined carbohydrates, sugar, and corn syrup. \"According to everyone\"  Ok who is this everyone? Beacuse about 80% of everything you read about G6PD on the internet is pure trash. Additionally most people would benefit from eating less carbohydrates, G6PD or not. weird I eat a super high carb diet and it allows me to sleep at night. I tried keto and it just made me not sleep. yes.. and no.. while it stimulates expression of the gene it does not do anything for the activity of the enzyme. So It is like yeah you can make juice but your juice has less flavor. Does that make sense? \n\nIt is not exactly true that fatty diets inhibit it... certain types of fats increase it. You really have to start going in to the weeds with this sort of thing.   \nMy suggestion.. go straight to trying butyrate since it increases g6pd activity.  \n Simplest answer to that is you werent eating enough.

I am, and only reactions I had were vertigo and nausea And you are confusing a valid concern if there is a possibility of a hemorrhagic reaction to the vaccine to being anti-vax. I am not anti-vax. I get the flu vaccine every year. I was immunized as a child and I got my own children immunized. I am naturally cautious about any unfamiliar medication and even more so with this one because of some of the unusual characteristics of this virus, how it affects those with G6PD more, the fact that it responds to the anti-malarial hydroxychloroquine, which is on the Do Not Take list, gives me reason to think I need to be cautious.

Ik some of these are really exaggerating, but for some people these can cause an issue, there are many different mutations leading to g6pd deficiency. \n\n&gt;I might as well died a million times by now all these were harmful. \n\nIt is not just about dying or living, it is also about quality of life, how your body is working and etc etc. I have used a lot of items on the list a lot in the past, and I never had any blood tests to see what is happening to me. I move to Switzerland, I see new doctors, I so some blood tests, and guess what? B9 deficiency, low hemoglobin, high reticulocyte etc etc. What is safe for one person is not necessarily safe for everyone, and vice versa. G6pd is inherited there is no many mutation that leads to it. \nYou having g6pd does not make it the reason you contracted any other condition.\n\nAgain ask your doctor. \n\nDo not miss lead people just to justify the things happening to you There are more than 400 variations and 140 mutations leading to g6pd deficiency and all of them have different symptoms, severity and reactions to different stuff. You can do a little research on this, there are peer reviewed articles and papers I can post for you if you are not capable of doing a simple search yourself. All I am saying is there are different types of g6pd but you are trying hard to put everyone in same class and severity. You can read this:\n \n\nThere are many others, peer reviewed, published in decent journals. Just because your g6pd is this and that does not mean everyone else's is. Well, I am sorry. I did not mean to put everyone in the same severity . What I was saying was you in reply of you making a different mutation as a cause. Seconded re that site. On the site they also classify legumes such as chickpeas as a trigger as well...I have grown up with hummus being a staple in the house and never had any issues. Like you, the only haemloytic episode I have had is from fava beans.", "I am father to a 2 year old boy with G6PD deficiency looking for advice. Hello, in my family side, this is the first time we hear about such condition. My son is 2 years plus now, and we have been told from the beginning to avoid certain foods such as fava bean, soy products, and always to inform the doctor about the condition before receive medication.\n\nMy son did get Hemolysis once when he were 10 months old. It was difficult, and we had no idea why, but the doctors concluded continuous viral fever with high temperature could have caused that. \n\nIn the past 1 year, my son have start consume some soy products, it was one of the staple food here, so he took it by accident, but thankfully he did not have any allergic reaction to it.  Since then we have read that not all G6PD deficiency have reaction to soy products, some people does not have reaction at all.\n\nHow about fava beans and moth balls? I understood it could be very severe, especially fava beans? Did anybody accidentally came into contact this, or consumed the fava beans? Or touched moth balls? I have and yeah soy products are fine at least for me. My dad (have G6PD deficiency) ate Fava beans once and needed to go to the hospital. I have always been told not to eat fava beans, green peas and stay away from moth balls. Also a certain amount of paracetamol is okay if you take more than usual there is a high possibility of an allergic reaction. Thanks for your reply. I didnt know paracetamol could trigger hemolysis too. My son is usually prescribed paracetamol for his fever and so far it is okay for him, thankfully. Yes it depends of the level of deficiency he has. I have a severe and i can still take . I take 2 pills with 500 mg paracetamol. I have never took more than that. I have had hemolysis from fava beans as a child but also consume soy and legumes regularly with no issues (no fava beans ever of course!). Re mothballs, my doctor advised that it is the naphthalene in mothballs that affect me. \n\nThankfully Naphthalene has been banned in Europe for a few years now for residential use but to be safe we use cedar wood and dried lavender to ward off moths. G6PD is very much a spectrum with different severity. I only had one episode of clinical hemolysis after a viral infection. I avoid the usual medications which cause oxidative stress, but even then not all people get hemolysis from all medicines especially at low doses.\nI have never eaten fava beans because they are not a part of our culinary culture, but I have eaten lots of soy with no ill effects. I have not ever had clinical hemolysis with any food. Noted, thanks for the input. when you said level of deficiency, I remember now he had a particular test done to check on the severity of his G6PD, but I do not remember now. I should look I up. Thanks for your input, that helps ease my worry. Of course strict control on what my son eats will still be followed. Thanks for your input. It is a little bit strange but TIL that mothball is used to ward off moths. Here in my family, the elderly usually use it in the cloths cupboard because it has some smell. Hence why I asked if coming into contact physically (non consumption) have any impact. But thanks to your reply, I think only consumption will have impact. Hi! First of all, do not be too worried for your son. G6PD is not dangerous if you know what to do, and he will live a completely regular life.\n\nThe only food that can cause an hemolytic reaction are fava beans. Soy is safe, despite many people thinking it is not. I know you might not trust me, but do some research and talk with doctors that know the condition well and I am sure you will be convinced eventually.\n\nAlways tell about G6PD to doctors or when buying some medicine, because there are some that can trigger a crysis.\n\nMoth balls can trigger a reaction, and also a certain type of tatoo ink called \"henna\". Nothing too common and nothing that your son cannot avoid easily! I have been doing a ton of scholarly research myself. ( Basically, avoid fava beans, moth balls, henna, and let your doctor and pharmacist know before taking any medication. Agreed. Soy is safe, me and my family members who have G6PDD consume it regularly with no issues and one of us has a very low enzyme count. Soy is totally fine, I would not worry about this. Only avoiding fava beans is crucial. \n\nMy mother consumed some by accident as they were blended into a dip and had to go to the hospital for blood transfusion. I have also consumed one fava bean out of curiosity (dumb, I know) but nothing happened to me. The severity of the reaction depends of a couple of factors, such as enzyme count and age. E.G since my mother is elderly, she had a worse reaction. \n\nA lot of doctors here in the UK do not know about G6PDD so I carry around a medical card to show them. Ask your doctor if they can provide one. Mine has my enzyme count on it and a list of common ingredients in medicines that we should avoid. This has been very useful. Once I had a UTI and I could not take any of the primary treatment medication because of some stuff on this list. Last time I checked, I also cannot take any malaria medication. No problem at all! My understanding is that with Naphthalene, inhalation or dermal contact  cause also cause a reaction without direct consumption, so might want to err on the side of caution with that. I remember my parents apologising and cutting a visit short to family friends' house after they realised that smell in the house was naphthalene balls (this was in the late 80s)\n\nCouple of examples below of other cases:\n\n (\n\n ( Thanks for your write up. Yes malaria medication is stated as to be avoided as well for my son. But malaria is not common in my country, so the vaccine is not mandatory. I did not receive a card with his condition, but we do have a lab report with the g6pd security and enzyme counts, guess I will make one my self just in case. Thanks again. Hi, I am a female. Me and my daughter 's number are a little below the top abnormal and it appear we are carriers. My son numbers are very low. We lived in Egypt for a few years. We ate Falafel which had Fava beans. This was before I knew much about the G6PD. We never got sick. So it appears that some foods and medicines do not bother some people. However, you still must be careful. I would never eat Fava beans again. In my opinion just because it did not affect me once does not mean it cant affect me. Umm, as far as soy we never had  a problem. My children are in their 20s now and I am 50 + and we never got Hemolysis from foods or medicines. We do carry the list of foods and medicines not to take around with us though and notify the doctors. Good luck with your son. Stay away from all legumes, this includes fava bean/broad beans and soy beans/soy . Both contain vincin, vincin is know to induce hemolysis. Because of lack of the g6pdd enzyme, certain components of fava beans can not be decomposed . They are toxic and cause breakage of the blood cells.\n\nI am a female with G6pdd, I have lyonization causing me to be symptomatic and have I experienced terrible reactions to soy especially\ud83d\ude14.. Please stop spreading misinformation, soy contains vincine and convicine...\nit is the same chemical compound found in fava beans, and is the reason for causing hemolysis in g6pd deficient patients. \nThese chemicals are metabolized to divicine and isouramil, which are potent oxidizing agents. \nIn people with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, these compounds cause hemolysis by disrupting the red cell wall. no misinformation. if vicine and covicine are present in soy, it is in a minimal amount and not enough to pose any danger. there is no evidence that an hemolytic crisis could trigger with any food other than fava bean. They have actually preformed studies on the effects of legumes with different concentrations of vicine and convicine on egg production, hence fava beans are in the same family of legumes ; \n\nThe g6pd foundation completely disproves your claim, It is not just \u201cfava beans\u201d that cause red blood cell breakdowns there is;\nPainkillers\nAntibiotics\nAntimalarial drugs\nLegumes\nnaphthalene\nMethyl Blue\n\n\n\nYou are going off old theories of how g6pd was interpreted when it was referred to as favism. your first link talks about chickens and not humans, also it does not talk about hemolytic crisis or g6pd... no idea why you linked it or what you think you were proving...\n\nI have no idea what the g6pd foundation is, but calling themselves like that does not make them correct on what they say. I have G6PD deficiency but I have never really had an allergic reaction because of that. \n\nOthers have already answered so I will not talk more about the food stuff. Moth balls are only dangerous when consumed. It is ok to touch them. I personally hate the scent of moth balls so I avoid them. My family also uses moth balls in the closet to keep clothes fragrant but my mom only puts a bar of soap(which is packed, of course) in my closet.

Even bought Ehrlich's reagent to make sure it was not nbome. Done shrooms once before so I took 2 tabs, approx. 220 ug. However, my come up was nothing but racing unrelated and mundane thoughts, twitching arms, torso, and legs from discomfort and pain, and slight \"cubism\" (not the art movement, but the effect described in psychonaut wiki), and forgetting to breathe (literally had to remind myself a few times, I would know when visual colours start to turn black and white or whenever I felt my muscles were abnormally tense). The peak went as expected though. Had enough energy to finally get out of bed and listen to YouTube, smoked a few blunts. Come down was also fine, just felt like some part of my brain associated with visual processing went overdrive and burned out. Kind Of like if you seriously increased the contrast filter and then highlighted shades. Took both tabs at 9 pm and high ended around 4 am.

My RBCs have been fairly low for awhile. \n\nI am a runner and that is been my most consistent physical activity over the past two or so years. However, I constantly am experiencing injuries that essentially hat my exercise, but which seem to have difficulty healing. For example, I might have a knee or hip injury and not run for a month because the pain will not go away. It is also not necessarily limited to running injuries - I slipped on my stairs a couple weeks ago and could barely move my shoulder for a week. It is still in pain. \n\nMy nutrition is somewhat good(?), I am vegan but make sure I am getting a rounded diet and my doctors have not had concerns with any vitamin or mineral levels in me. \n\n\nJust wanted to see if anyone else has experienced this. My understanding is that the hemolytic anemia might make it much more difficult to recover from injuries because there is less oxygen being carried throughout my body. Not sure of this checks out and I have tried to do some research but could not find anything specific. \n\nThanks for any help! Hi  ( ,  \n\n\nI am a G6PD Vegan for 6 years too, good to see another one of us out there in the world!  \n\n\nDefinitely had the symptoms you mentioned before about slow healing after exercise during the start of my vegan journey, I noticed however my adding in berries, especially strawberries or any fruit high in vitamin c ( its best not to take vitamin c supplements) , that the wound healing would be recovered to normal, in some cases if you have a lot of broccoli, berries, potatoes the wound healing would be even better than usual folk!  \n\n\nFor the knee, hip injuries and other pain that stays too long, I would highly reccomend magnesium rich foods and also having raw cacao for its high potassium content, bananas work too for potassium  \n\n\nI usually eat lots of lentils that have been cooked for a long time on high heat (20-25mins) or medium heat for 45-55mins, chlorella and spirulina for increased recovery too!  \n\n\nIf youd like I can provide links for the supplements I take daily that have been giving a huge boost fitness wise, Im also exercising everyday with streneous exercises for 45mins and have been sleeping really well and getting lots of gains  \n\n\ndont pay too much mind to hemolytic anemia anxieties, we are essentially normal people if we get good sources of iron, magnesium, potassium and vitamin c (from foods), in fact you will actually see we have got some special traits that allow us to go above and beyond the regular person too! ; )\n\nHope this post helps!

I am looking for the best information to handle this information and my life going on. I have had complications in my life, im 31yo right now. Ive had weird infectious episodes, chronic bilirubin problem, digestive disorders, weakness, and stuff. under average RBC counts and other issues ( kind of dark urine etc). The thing is, since i have been able to lead a fairly normal life until now, I have been majorly dismissed by most of the doctors i encountered. They weirdly say im just a stressed or anxious person on the weak side of health (I keep telling them im a pretty positive and laughing person, i do sport and eat healthy, but by the time i tell them, im outside of their office). Anyway recently my mom called since she discovered she had MILD G6PD, so i appointed with an hematologist who acknowledged that it should be checked for me as much as he made clear he doesnt know a lot about it, especially severe cases.  \n\n\nI am looking for anyone with better informations about what could happen and how to manages problems related to severe G6PD, the internet seems overbusied with articles about moderate cases and just say severe cases can end badly.   \n\n\nThe fact that i had a fairly normal life and that i have roots in medditarean area makes me think that im class 2, which is a bit less worst than class 1.  \n\n\nIm open to ANY advice. Hi! You can live a completely normal life with G6PD deficiency.\n\nThe only thing that you need to keep in mind is that if you take certain substances you risk to have a hemolytic crisis, so you need to avoid them.\n\nBe careful of:\n\n- fava beans: they are the only food that you need to avoid. Ignore the websites and the people that will tell you to not eat a long list of foods. Just do not eat fava beans, or food that might have been contaminated by them (for example by being cooked in the same pan);\n\n- certain medicines: I do not have a list but your doctor should. Every time a doctor tells you to take a medicine, remind him that you are G6PD deficient and ask him to check if that medicine is safe for you;\n\n- a certain kind of ink used for tattoos called \u201chenna\u201d. This ink is not common and you can safely get a tattoo with normal ink, but be sure you do not use henna;\n\n- mothballs: they can trigger a crisis even if I never heard of an actual case triggered by mothballs, just try to not eat them or handle them too much.\n\nIf you are careful, you will never have any problem. G6PD deficiency will not give you any symptom if you avoid the triggers, so do not worry too much! When reading more recents and complexes article it says that very severe ones make us very sensitive to brain oxidative damage and other stuff that seem very correlated to my other problems. Strong urine, pain in muscles, digestives issues, and my lab test always show it is indeed playing with kind of low rbc high bilirubin, I have had very strong infectious things in the past. I have looking for any diet or thing promoting a better g6pd production cause I have insanely low production of it I have even been told by my neurologist that some weird damage exist in my legs There is not a diet that will cure you from the deficiency.\n\nThe symptoms only come if you take triggers so you have to avoid them. If you are not taking triggers and you still feel bad, so it is not due to G6PD. Also, it you have a reaction, there is high risk that you will need to be hospitalised, and not just to generally feel bad. That is really not what you read on deeper and recents scientific articles, having moderate g6pd is night and day with severes ones. Class 1 g6pd deficiency give chronic hemolysis that can go undiagnosed for a long time with no triggers. Of course having moderate class 3 g6pd makes it perfectly fine to live as long as you do not force the triggers but my situation is an inbetween I am class 2 severe with suspected Mediterranean gene and my levels are close to class 1, with 0,02 only. Folic acid is given daily to class 1 people that is where I am trying to figure out if I should try it. Butyrate seems like an interesting try as well Class-1 deficiency is extremely rare and you probably do not have it. If you get diagnosed with it, talk with an expert haematologist.\n\nAny other case works as I said, and if you have seen researches that say otherwise I would love you to share them. \u2022 Keep fevers down as soon as you get them. I have noticed my family members and I who have G6PD end up way more sick/unwell when we have a fever.\n\n\u2022 No high doses of vit C. \n\nI do not really do much to manage it, I find avoiding triggers is enough. For ref I have likely got the Mediterranean G6PD given my background. wow bro...2% ...  \n\n\nhey friend!\r  \n\r  \nI am hoping this reply finds you at your best, and that my advice will help you get to where you want to be.  \n\n\nI had given this advice to another redditor previously. and now I will copy and paste it to you, with some changes.   \n\n\nI sometimes use some supplements to help some of the symptoms I have like tiredness, headaches, and difficulty concentrating.   \n\n\nthe main ones I use:\r  \n\r  \nbefotiamine -&gt; increases g6pd action through akt and transketolase (\n\n\r  \n\r  \nInositol hexaphosphate + myo - inositol -&gt; increase g6pd action (\n\n\r  \n\r  \nvitamin D -&gt; Increases activity \r  \n\r  \nZinc -&gt;Increases expression of the mRNA &gt;probably due to insulin signaling and sensitivity increase.. also too much can be detrimental.. look for a sweet spot.(\n\n\r  \n\r  \nButyrate -&gt;Increases activity of the enzyme  \n\n\nrecently I added a chromium + vanadium supplement for occasional use since I seem to have had success with using just that.   \n\n\nVanadium -- Addition of vanadate has been shown to stimulate the activity of phosphoglucomutase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.\r  \n\r  \n(\n\n\r  \n\r  \n(  \n\n\nhope these help.. Thanks, that is Really insightful and I will deffo try those. Do you actually have advice about what supplement brand to buy for each of those things? It is hard to trust random brand and think it will be pure like what have been used in those studies.\n\nAnd I know, I reacted the same when I read the analysis...2% like WoW. Doctors seems to think that with medditarean variant like I have it is not that much of a difference to have 2 or 10% as long as I live a healthy lifestyle being careful with triggers. I try to stay positive and tbh, I had great upgrade in lifestyle when I decided to switch to better nutrition and sport routine. So I will blindly believe studies that say that g6pd does not change life length  expectancy and obviously try those supps.\n\nIt looks like g6pd deficiency makes it good against malaria and reduce the possibility to have some cancers so I guess there is some good news. When I tried keto I also noticed I have way higher base Ketones in my blood compared to my gf so I think the body has his own ways to compensate the atp process going on in our mitochondrias.

I recently found out I have G6PD and I know I should avoid anti malarial drugs, but when it comes to COVID 19 itself, am I at high risk from the virus? There is not really any data out there saying that there is a big risk for us Probably not because Covid 19 is a lung infection and we do not have any problems in our lungs because of G6PD (of course people can still have asthma and etc). The only problem might occur is if we have high temperature and we can not make it low, which gives hemolysis. Yet it can happen with flu as well so nothing specifically for covid 19. \n\nI have talked to my doctor about this and this is what she told me. I am not taking any responsibility or whatsoever since there is not enough research about this.

Good to know is fava bean severe or just something to avoid if i can Fava beans are severe. Possibly one of the worst things you can eat. I think typically as an adult - you will not die unless you take a lot of something that is bad for you.\n\nI think though, that it is still wise to avoid all the things on the lists.\n\nPeople with G6PD have weaker red blood cells than normal people. When we eat certain things, it can cause our red blood cells to die. If you do not have red blood cells, you will die because they carry oxygen from our lungs to the rest of our body. No. G6PD does not kill you slowly like that. \n\nYou will get attacks from ingesting things that are bad for you - mainly fava beans or some medicines. This will cause some of your red blood cells to die and will make you feel very fatigued and slow because you are getting less oxygen that normal to your body.\n\nYour red blood cells die and get replenished all the time. Attacks are normally temporary and will go away. \n\nI had a serious attack when I was 2 and had to get a blood transfusion. I am now almost 40 and have never had a serious issue since. I do have a lot of fatigue and tiredness and sometimes wonder if that is due to G6PD.\n\nThis is not to say that you should not be careful. The items on the avoid list are like poison to people with G6PD. G6PD Deficiency is a genetic blood disorder. It is x-linked and can be difficult to diagnose in women because of lyonization. There are hundreds of variants of G6PD Deficiency and 5 classes (Class I being the most severe form). When a person with G6PD Deficiency is exposed to a trigger, it causes the hemolysis, which is damage to the red blood cells. There are over 300 medication triggers including most antibiotics especially Nitrofurantoin (caused me severe hemolytic anemia and almost killed me), NSAIDS which are over the counter pain meds like Tylenol, antimalarial drugs, sulfa drugs. There are also a lot of food triggers like broad beans (fava beans being one of the worst for some people with G6PD Deficiency, especially people with the Mediterranean variant). Fava bean induced hemolytic anemia is called Favism. Alcohol, sulfites, teas, foods high in iron, vitamin k, and vitamin c, ascorbic acid, citric acid, food coloring (especially blue), artificial flavors, etc are all triggers. Chemicals like naphthalene found in moth balls, paints, carpeting are triggers. Menthol, fake mint used in most commercial toothpastes are triggers. Copper is a huge trigger for people with G6PD Deficiency (I instantly become hemolytic from accidentally ingesting copper). Chlorine is a trigger. Agave, alfalfa sprouts, tonic water, fake sugars, glycol, glycerin are triggers. Most cooking oils like vegetable, sunflower, canola oils are triggers. Soy lecithin is a trigger. \n\nPeople with G6PD Deficiency are prone to iron overload, diabetes, and folate deficiency. Supplementing with folate/folic acid, b-complex, zinc picolinate, and an antioxidant called NAC are beneficial. Avoid supplementing with iron unless your ferritin blood serum is low. Avoid henna, hair dyes, and nail polish remover. Some of the myths about G6PD Deficiency is that women can only be carriers and parents of children with G6PD Deficiency do not realize that their child had to inherit the gene mutation from one of them. Mothers of sons with G6PD Deficiency are usually the most likely to suffer from these myths and will continue exposing themselves to triggers. Over time, this can lead to low level hemolysis and trigger other medical issues. \n\nThe symptoms of hemolytic anemia are paleness, shortness of breath, enlarged spleen/spleen pain, enlarged liver, abnormal heart rate, extreme fatigue, cold intolerance, leg pain, chest pain, dark colored urine, exercise intolerance, jaundice/yellowing of eyes, mouth, and skin. There is a high false negative when testing for G6PD Deficiency especially after a crisis, it takes about 120 days to recover from a crisis and build new red blood cells. Lastly, the medical community including hematologists are not very educated about G6PD Deficiency and Big Pharma definitely does not want awareness about the prevalence of G6PD Deficiency (an estimated 300 million people worldwide and 1 in 10 African Americans in the U.S. have it, but a good portion are not aware that they do). They know that the primary treatment for G6PD Deficiency is to avoid medication triggers and with so many people with it, they would lose money. Oh, and people with G6PD Deficiency are resistant to malaria. Hope this is helpful. Boom! That was nearly everything. \nAlso..place emphasis on vitamin b2 as it binds strongly to Glutathione which you will not produce enough of since your body does not recycle this as fast. Limit carbohydrates and maximize proteins since many of your metabolisms will be depleted faster than others. Another plus is You do not produce as much fat from carbohydrates. OP mixed a lot of correct information with also a lot of disinfo. there is not any food or toothpaste that trigger hemolysis on G6PD people. Hi, I suggest you to check your source and try to get some better information. While some of the things that you wrote are correct, most are just wrong.\n\n&gt;Alcohol, sulfites, teas, foods high in iron, vitamin k, and vitamin c, ascorbic acid, citric acid, food coloring (especially blue), artificial flavors, etc are all triggers. Chemicals like naphthalene found in moth balls, paints, carpeting are triggers. Menthol, fake mint used in most commercial toothpastes are triggers. Copper is a huge trigger for people with G6PD Deficiency (I instantly become hemolytic from accidentally ingesting copper). Chlorine is a trigger. Agave, alfalfa sprouts, tonic water, fake sugars, glycol, glycerin are triggers. Most cooking oils like vegetable, sunflower, canola oils are triggers. Soy lecithin is a trigger.\n\nthis is all **wrong**. no food other than fava beans are going to cause any reaction to G6PD people.\n\n&gt;People with G6PD Deficiency are prone to iron overload, diabetes, and folate deficiency. \n\ndo you have any source for this? I never heard such a thing.\n\n&gt;Avoid supplementing with iron unless your ferritin blood serum is low. Avoid henna, hair dyes, and nail polish remover.\n\nit is true that henna ink can trigger hemolysis. but the other things, like hair dyes are totally safe, so I am curious to see your source on this too. &gt;I think typically as an adult - you will not die unless you take a lot of something that is bad for you.\n\nsorry but it does not work like this. even a little amount of fava beans **could** trigger hemolysis. if it triggers, you need to go to the hospital and get treated, or you will die.\n\n&gt;People with G6PD have weaker red blood cells than normal people. \n\nthis is wrong. blood of G6PD people is totally fine, we just suffer from hemolysis in certain condition. &gt;I do have a lot of fatigue and tiredness and sometimes wonder if that is due to G6PD.\n\nit is not ;) We have weaker blood than normal people. It\n\nOur red blood cells are not affected by just Fava beans. Fava beans just have a much stronger effect than most other foods.\n\nIf you have ever had Sichuan food, then you have probably had some Fava beans in your food. Dobanjiang has it but I think it is mostly deactivated as the beans are fermented.\n\n\n\nRead articles similar to this - you will see that our RBC are more susceptible to oxidative stress. &gt; We have weaker blood than normal people.\n\nwhat does it exactly mean? can you give me a pratical example?\n\nthanks for the source, did you read it carefully? it keep saying **theoretically**, and it adds:\n\n&gt; There is little evidence indicating that G6PD deficiency can cause perturbations in redox status, haemolysis, and clinical symptoms such as fatigability and myoglobinuria, especially after intense exercise, compared to individuals with normal enzyme levels.\n\n&gt; there is a lack of training studies, and assessment of the effects of regular and systematic exercise in G6PD-deficient individuals is warranted\n\nthis is an interesting study but itself says that it is finding are not conclusive and need to be studied better.\n\n&gt; Fava beans just have a much stronger effect than most other foods.\n\nno. this is just wrong, so be careful before spreading misinformation. my source:\n\n\n\n*very few articles have examined the safety of other food ingredients and food additives for people with G6PD deficiency. Some articles that associated specific foods with hemolysis appeared to be speculative and based on limited information  fava beans were found to be the only food for which there is conclusive clinical evidence linking the risk of hemolytic anemia to individuals with G6PD deficiency*\n\nalso you can read this comment that I made some time ago, where I explain that I contacted a hematologist known for his study on G6PD, and I report his answer, and I also translate a part of an interview with another hematologist that explain why only fava beans can trigger a reaction.\n\n&gt; If you have ever had Sichuan food, then you have probably had some Fava beans in your food\n\nwhen a food is stored or cooked along with fava beans, fava traces stay there. of course sichuan food can trigger an hemolysis, but it is due to the fava bean traces, not because of other foods. Hmmm.. to say that these are misinformation is a bit much since, while there is no definitive data, it can be said that cases have been observed where yhey exist. In as much as I was able to find references to what was stated above just by googelizing the words. The foods are a tricky subject since if you are already coming down from a previous hemolytic episode and you eat some of what was mentionned then you may get triggered, same as if you yave low conversion for vitamin K because of the Vkor polymorphism scientific evidence says that the only food that triggers hemolytic crisis are fava beans... a long list of food to avoid IS misinformation.\n\n&gt; if you are already coming down from a previous hemolytic episode and you eat some of what was mentionned then you may get triggered\n\nnope. I understand what you are saying. Could you reference that to me please?\n\nThe only one research that states what you are stating is the following:  ( \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nand I believe the line says that it was the only thing that affects every type of G6PD accross the board and does not take in to consideration the genetic polymorphisms as well as the tests performed were on a case per case basis thus excluding what I had stated.   \n\n\n\" \\ were consistently associated with haemolysis \" , this means even people who are asymptomatic were seen to have had issues.   \n\n\nWhile I cannot validate the information provided, Since it has been observed, we must be attentive to all avenues of information, ex this is from a hospital in Pakistan which pretty much repeats what the op was saying.   \n\n\n ( yes, I can reference. first I want to say that it would be better if you could provide some source that demonstrate that foods other than fava beans can trigger hemolysis. I read several articles on pubmed, and all the one that goes in deep about which food to avoid only list fava beans as food to avoid.\n\nSpeaking about that PDF from pakistan, I think that G6PD is not very well known outside of certain zones where it is more spread, and many doctors tend to play it safe, forbidding more foods that they can. That PDF does that, it is not a research or anything, just a little info from an hospital.\n\n&gt;I believe the line says that it was the only thing that affects every type of G6PD accross the board and does not take in to consideration the genetic polymorphisms as well as the tests performed were on a case per case basis thus excluding what I had stated\n\nI do not get what you are trying to say here, but I never heard that different variants of G6PD can be triggered by different foods.\n\nnow, for my source I am copying here a part of another comment that I made (that also link another comment):\n\n(\n\n*very few articles have examined the safety of other food ingredients and food additives for people with G6PD deficiency. Some articles that associated specific foods with hemolysis appeared to be speculative and based on limited information \\ fava beans were found to be the only food for which there is conclusive clinical evidence linking the risk of hemolytic anemia to individuals with G6PD deficiency*\n\nalso you can read ( comment that I made some time ago, where I explain that I contacted a hematologist known for his study on G6PD, and I report his answer, and I also translate a part of an interview with another hematologist that explains why only fava beans can trigger a reaction. \" I do not get what you are trying to say here, but I never heard that different variants of G6PDD can be triggered by different foods. \"\n\nNo, this means different genotypes of g6pdd will have different levels of reaction to certain foods. This will also mean, some people will react to certain foods while others will not.   \n\n\nFor Vitamins and minerals, I think that is something that needs to be looked in to more precisely since there is scarce research and all the data has not yet been taken and turned in to a mechanistic study.   \nI based most of my knowledge from research about the limits of studies.\n\n  (  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, G6PDD has a cumulative effect, in that all the metabolisms reliant upon NADPH which includes detoxification of negative and some hormetic elements as well as attenuation of Reactive oxygen species (ROS). This would logically mean that if there is some accumulation due to the fact that no metabolism has handled the excess of even simple nutrients.  \n\n\nin the link you provided you can see some of the nuances I have spoken about.   \n ( \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you very much for your link, it was a good and very interesting read. &gt;&gt;\nvery few articles have examined the safety of other food ingredients and food additives for people with G6PD deficiency. Some articles that associated specific foods with hemolysis appeared to be speculative and based on limited information  fava beans were found to be the only food for which there is conclusive clinical evidence linking the **risk** of hemolytic anemia to individuals with G6PD deficiency\n&gt;&gt;\n\nI have read many articles on the topic and studied G6Pd while doing my degree on cellular biology. \n\nI do not recommend eating Fava beans and avoid them myself. I was trying to make sure that it was not me recommending eating them. Dobanjiang is a paste made from Fava beans and is used in Mapo Tofu among other dishes.\n\nAlso, most Chinesr spicy hotpot have fava beans (broad beans) in them. It is not just trace. Definitely if a dish contains fava bean or Is made in some way with fava bean it is dangerous. For a G6PD person is always better to check out the composition of the food especially when eating outside or in foreign countries! As I have been saying, I eat Chinese food with fermented favas from time to time. I try to limit it but just using this as an anecdotal experience of mine. \n\nI am not sure if or how fermented beans are different from fresh. I have never and will not experiment with trying fresh fava beans. I also try not to eat the fermented ones. I suggest you to stop. Eating fava beans does not always trigger a reaction, but potentially it can. Fresh fava beans have an higher chance of triggering it than fermented one, but all can paranoia shit post Alcohol, foods high in iron, and blue food coloring (specifically blue 2) cause me to become jaundice and my blood levels deviate from my normal range for some time.\n\nI also take folic acid daily to maintain folate levels in my body. The things posted are various case by case scenarios that wont always apply to every G6PD deficient person. &gt; Alcohol, foods high in iron, and blue food coloring (specifically blue 2) cause me to become jaundice and my blood levels deviate from my normal range for some time\n\nyou have some other allergy other than G6PD then, because these things are not related to it. Hmmm...speaking of misinformation. Henna hair dye is a trigger for some variants of G6PD Deficiency. Would not classify them as generally safe. People who have certain variants/class 1 G6PD Deficiency are going to have more of a hemolytic reaction to triggers. That is just common sense. Not all people with G6PD Deficiency are susceptible to Favism. My genetic test results says that I am susceptible to Favism, but my son is not. And bs that fava beans are the only food triggers, I know that from personal experience that sulfites is a huge trigger for people with class 1 G6PD Deficiency. You are potentially setting people up for severe hemolytic anemia by claiming that the foods/chemicals on most avoid lists are safe for ALL people with G6PD Deficiency. The reason there is not much scientific literature about food triggers is because it would be cruel, unethical, and potentially dangerous to test triggers on G6PD Deficient people in clinical trials. So we have to rely on educated guesses (like making the link between oxidative stress and hemolysis, it is not a stretch to conclude that foods/chemicals that increase oxidative stress in the body are probably problematic for people with G6PD Deficiency) and case studies as a reference point. Js\n\n I know that henna ink is dangerous. I did not know it was contained certain in hair dyes, but I said that they are *generally* safe.\n\n&gt; People who have certain variants/class 1 G6PD Deficiency are going to have more of a hemolytic reaction to triggers\n\nCorrect, different variants have a different susceptibility.. but they do not have different triggers.\n\n&gt; Not all people with G6PD Deficiency are susceptible to Favism. My genetic test results says that I am susceptible to Favism, but my son is not.\n\nThis is also true, the level can vary in women and you can or cannot pass it to your son depending on which gene you pass him.\n\n&gt; And bs that fava beans are the only food triggers, I know that from personal experience that sulfites is a huge trigger for people with class 1 G6PD Deficiency\n\nIt is not bullshit, as far as I know it is true. Fava beans are the only food for which there is scientific evidence. I do not know about your personal experience but if you can provide some scientific source that explains which other foods can trigger hemolysis and why, I would consider it.\n\n&gt; The reason there is not much scientific literature about food triggers is because it would be cruel, unethical, and potentially dangerous to test triggers on G6PD Deficient people in clinical trials\n\nWe already know which substances trigger hemolysis on G6PD people, so we just need to test the foods. ( Are you able to eat other types of beans outside of favs beans?  I think so Have you had a blood test to confirm g6pd? Yessir as a baby tho Vitamin B2? Is it good or bad for H6PD", "White kidney beans Hello there, my 4 month old is going through hemolysis. Docs have currently diagnosed hemolytic anemia for her. We are still waiting on the final diagnosis on what actually happened. \n\nOn June 5, my daughter looked very pale and fatigue so we took her to the children's hospital. Her hemoglobin was dropped to 30. They had to start blood transfusion. She needed another around of transfusion after 2 weeks. Her hemoglobin is going down during this process. \n\nI was looking through pictures on May 18 I made white kidney bean(cannellini beans) stew. I have a toddler as well. My husband, myself and my toddler had that stew. We have never been diagnosed with g6pd. I am currently breastfeeding my 4 month old. \n\nHer g6pd test came normal at the time of hemolysis. I read that it can give false result during hemolysis. They will repeat the test in a couple of months.  So far docs have also identified she has an enlarged spleen.\n\nIt is extremely hard for us to see our baby girl go through these rough time while docs figure out what is wrong.\n\nMy question to your guys, has anyone with g6pd been affected by white kidney beans? Any enlarged spleen due to this? Is this deficiency inherited but none of us have it?  How long does this trigger last if it is g6pd?\n\nI am hoping that it is g6pd and nothing major health condition.\n\nSo confused and worried mama. Any feedback would be appreciated.\n\nThank you. The timelines do not match (there is a gap of almost 2+ week between consumption and hemolysis). There could be other trigger items around. If baby is only breastfeed, it could be food or some medicine you are taking or external environmental factors.\n\nIs you baby having any formula? Soymilk or soy products?\n\nIs there any chance of exposure to moth balls? \n\nAny artificial vitamins? Product containing Ascorbic acid?\n\nArtificial blue color? Blue dye exposure?\n\nAny chance you are in area where Fava beans is grown? Thank you for your reply. Yes, she is having formula as well as breast milk. All of the things you mentioned, we are not exposed to. Formula usually contains soy in some form Soy lecithin, Soy Oil. Both of these should be avoided.\n\nPlease look at the label on your formula. I just saw, it contains both soy oil and soy lecithin. I will stop it for now, I consume fair amount of soy products as well. Good stop formula now and watch for other trigger items. As the baby grows you can introduce real food like avocados, sweet potatoes, etc. We did not use any formula for our baby since it contains soy.\n\nAlso, avoiding soy in mom's diet was easy for us since traditionally we do not eat any soy. But, i understand it is not possible to avoid soy in several South East Asian and Chinese diets. You will have to watch out and determine what works and what could be a trigger. soy is not a dangerous food for g6pd people. What could be the trigger in this case? Do you think there is something in formula which is causing hemolysis? They did not give Fava beans to the baby.\n\nAs i said you have to watch out what works and what is causing a trigger. Soy is main ingredient in many Asian food products which are cooked traditional (home made). I think people can still eat these food products which are home cooked in a traditional fashion. \n\nBut, when consuming processed food, one needs to be careful, i will not recommend Soy present in processed food. An infection perhaps? I have G6PD and have not had issues with soy, but fava beans almost took me out! Did you take the formula to the doctor to look at the ingredients? Sometimes they use variations of the fava beans name (Faba, Vicia, Broad Beans,  field beans, horse beans, Windsor beans or ful). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had hemolysis from Favabeans but the reaction was very quick (12 hours). I am not a doctor but did the doctor check for infections? Is she on antibiotics or antimalarials?\n\nI hope your kid is feeling better! :) G6PDD is an X-Linked hereditary disorder. If baby girl has it then she could have gotten it from mom or dad. If a baby boy has is it then he gets it from mom.  I would also note that not all G6PDD is the same. There are different variants that differ in severity. I am mostly African American which our G6PDD is typically mild and carriers are asymptomatic. However, I got it from my mothers side of the family whom are 'caucasian'. So I have a Mediterranean variant of the disorder. Which unfortunately is one of the more severe. I have low level hemolysis from consuming any legumes of any sort and soy. Even quinoa. It is very strange and painful. I have even had a trip to the ER just from inhaling certain cigar smoke in a lounge. Once, I had a sandwich from a hotel in Thailand and was in my room vomiting and trying not to die for 3 days. Crazy stuff. Granted, I also have beta thalassemia which already makes me anemic so that certainly does not help. What I have learned living with this degree of sensitivity is that modern medicine has barely scratched the surface on how broad this disorder really is/can be depending on the degree of your deficiency. The most recent time I was tested my hematologist said there were barely any detectable levels of the deficient enzyme, which he said he does not see often. Mind you, this was at the Oncology center at Stanford University. So, he was not some small town hematologist. For me, this thing is a daily battle for a sense of normalcy. Especially because I am trying to learn if my body is reacting to the Beta thalassemia or the G6PDD. Soy is a trigger for me", "I am G6PD-deficient and one time I remember I ate hummus and nothing happened to me, is that normal?  Everyone is different, I avoid it because it ruins my day and makes me tired all day long, sometimes it comes with light headness.\n\nPeople on this subreddit usually say \"The only food you need to avoid are favabeans\", but that just does not work for me. There was a time when I was eating hummus (little bit) almost everyday, never felt nothing. Not everything triggers you all the time, but you should definetely stay away from stuff that we are not allowed to eat, just in case. A little is fine Are green lentils ok btw? Hummus nowadays is made with either garbanzo beans or chickpeas. Rarely is it made with fava beans. If you like mediterranean food, definitely watch out what the falafel is made out of though, as the traditional recipe uses fava beans. I have been eating everything on the 'not to eat' list for many many years.\n\nThere was even a period (2 months)  in 2014 where I would eat falafels made from fava beans about 3 days a week because they were so tasty. \n\nI have never felt  any different, I even went to take another blood test to check to see if I was g6pd.\n\nI eat hummus a lot and yeah, I do not know how I am alive . Hummus is a chickpea meal. As a G6PD Lebanese I have never head of it being made with Fava Beans.\n\nIf still paranoid, simply ask wherever you get your Hummus from whether or not it has fava beans in it.\n\nAvoid Falafel though. Some people make Chickpea Falafel, but most people either mix it with Fava Beans or go all out with the latter. There are a bunch of foods that may or may not cause symptoms for you. There are 400 variations in the condition called G6PD and they all mean that foods will or will not trigger you differently. You should test the foods and see. Hummus is made with chickpeas. I have lebanese roots and have had hummus since I was a kid and never had any issues at all! Fava beans however put me in hospital. So i think chickpeas are fine! :) You have to figure out what works for you. I went through a period of reintroducing foods into my life and thought all was well. But then I would notice my skin breaking out and more than usual hair in the brush and feeling sluggish after a few weeks. These are all signs and symptoms as well. I would caution the notion of \u2018I feel fine\u2019 immediately after eating and start tracking symptoms over a 30 day period if you do bring things into your diet that are on the no list. Egyptians usually make Hummus with Fava Beans, so fair warning. However most Hummus is made with chickpeas so it is not that much of a problem depending on which variant of G6PD you have. Other than Fava beans, I have basically eaten all beans and lentils my whole life.", "Dihydrocodeine Hi,\nJust wondering if this is okay to take?\nI normally avoid drugs but due to tooth infection and severe pain I am desperate for something that would work.", "G6PD deficiency and a hemolytic anemia It took me years to discover that I was G6PDD.\nI had countless hemolytic anemia crisis, and it used to take me days to recover from.\nNow knowing the list of triggers I avoid it as much as I can and have a very normal life.\n\nThe two Products that make me recover from a crisis (never going away even with avoiding triggers) are\n\n- Hydration (very important)\nI buy rehydration packs (obviously without vitamin C and K) and always keep it on me just in case.\n\n- N-ACETYL CYSTEINE (NAC) \nThis is a big one!a personal game changer \nWhen i do not feel good and I take this product, in a matter of hours I recover. \nYou can get this in most of the vitamin store and a lot of pharmacy and sometimes supermarkets.\n\nObviously everybody is different and I am not a doctor and you should consult with him.\nBut I have done a lot of research because my G6PDD is level is in the severe range Class 2 border Class 1.\n\nI hope we can help grow awareness of this deficiency sometimes difficult to live with specially with all speculations of chloroquine for the COVID-19 and the potential reaction with G6PDD.( everyone reaction and tolerance will be different.)

I avoid anything with copper added in it (some zinc supplements add copper). Just like people with Wilson's Disease, people with G6PD Deficiency seem to be hypersensitive to copper and are prone to copper toxicity.

It is nice and reassuring to know I am borderline and my brother is severe and we both got our Moderna first shots. He had no side effects other than a mild headache and I was a bit fatigued for a few days. Other than that no issues though.\n\nEdit: We also checked with our primary care physician prior and they assured us there would be no issue with either the pfizer or moderna shots. Glad to hear it! I just had the first dose of Moderna and no side effects aside from a mild rash and a headache which both disappeared after a few days. Had first dose of AstraZeneca here and all good. No problem!  I did not ask for Pfizer specifically (honestly was happy to get either!) They said next dose will be within 11 weeks at the latest after my first dose. Thank you and will do! Hi! I might have it soon. Do you have G6PD? I do indeed. Mum also has it and she is had AstraZeneca. We are both fine. Just got my first shot of pfizer this morning too. So far only a sore arm.", "More Than 3,000 Arrested In Russia In Protests Calling For Release Of Alexei Navalny ", "Amoxicillin/Clavulanic acid Anybody knows if it is safe to get Noprilam DT( Amoxicillin/Clavulanic) Antibiotics?", "Soy lecithin Is it safe to consume soy lecithin if i have g6pd deficiency?", "PSA - Do not trust random g6pd deficiency blogs and anecdotal one off patient cases As the title says, always do your research and look for peer reviewed articles published in reputable sites (NCBI, Pubmed, Nature, etc). Do not get your advice from random websites that just want to scare you into buying a list or subscription. Whenever in doubt, ask your doctor! :)\n\nPS: an example from personal experience; foodwise, all documented clinical evidence points to just Favabeans being enough of a trigger for hemolysis (which happened to me); not booze, soysauce, chickpeas and all legumes - that I have been consuming all my life! The is 100%. It has always amazed me how astoundingly bad the the current state of g6pd medicine is. Tons of conjecture and bad assumptions. I am not sure I have found a single web site that is providing information from cited studies and is not trying to sell me something. And vitamin c. All these people saying vitamin c. You cannot even be alive without vitamin c. \n\nI agree only thing that takes effect so far is favabeans Seriously agreed about vitamin C! It is not like your effervescent tablet is going to give you the clinical intravenous megadose (more than 60 grams!)  that might cause hemolysis! \ud83d\ude02\n\nSource:  I go into a bunch of detail about a particular site and the state of research in ( I think the caution here should be noting that even if specific triggers do not lead to enough response that causes obvious outward symptoms, you cannot discount that hemolysis is a continuous activity for people with G6PD deficiency.\n\nHemolysis simply means your red blood cells are dying more rapidly than they should. But how much red blood cells die is a factor of how much trigger compound they are exposed to. A good indicator of ongoing hemolysis is your RDW, which by the way is not something you check every day. I have been checking my bi-weekly for over 1 year now and can confirm that hemolysis is an ongoing activity, even when you remove most of the potential triggers.\n\nSo, my plea is for people with G6PD deficiency to avoid any known trigger, even if it has not yet made you sick. Response to G6PD is not universal, so do not jump into conclusion that certain vitamins are not dangerous just because you have not had a bad experience. Also remember that a multivitamin contains more than just the \"active\" ingredient. A little humility helps in these conversation.\n\nI will give you my own example. I cannot tolerate vitamin d supplements when taken as oral tablets (in any combination or formulation -- i have tried a number). But I do not have obvious adverse effect to vitamin D fortified food such as milk, orange juice or poultry. At least I have not noticed any. But the only known trigger foodwise, is Fava beans. There has been no credible, published research that I can find that for example shows hemolysis (clinically significant or not) caused by Soy or chickpeas, but still you find websites that ask people to completely stop eating major food groups such as legumes with no evidence at all. So a genius on this site stated that the COVID vaccine has nothing to do with blood.\n\nFollow this news:\n\n( and others like it before taking advice from \"quack experts\" I think you have to be very cautious by saying that only fava beans can trigger hemolysis. \n\nIn my personal experience there is some cross over with other beans and legumes. Independent of my G6PD diagnosis I took a food allergy prick test and food allergy blood test (separate doctor). The prick test did not detect very much. But the blood test noted intolerances for a list of about 60 foods - specific (but not all) beans and legumes comprised 85% of the list!  Two weeks later I got the G6PD official diagnosis. Could it be a coincidence, maybe, but I am not taking chances. \n\nThe point to OP is that YOUR experience does not equal everyone is experience. Well done on doing a proper allergy test btw! But one thing to keep in mind is that G6PD is not a food allergy (which is an immune disorder). It is an enzyme deficiency. And re my experience vs others, true but i am not basing this on my experience, i am basing this on the fact that there has been no credible, published research that I can find that for example shows G6PD related hemolysis (clinically significant or not) caused by Soy or chickpeas or legumes. Allergy tests pick up allergies and intolerances. \nAnd I understand what G6PD is. You are giving bad information based upon your own experience and what you deem as credible. I only go by what is published on pubmed, ncbi, nature, etc. Not blogs or anecdotes from my life or anyone else's, and I implore people to do the same. Trust the published and peer reviewed science and evidence, not anecdotes from random strangers on the internet, me included.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen in doubt: ask your **Doctor**, not a subreddit! This is a well researched condition and has no need to be mystified. Who is asking a subreddit? My experience was backed up by medical tests Great, but you % is based on all pop not those with G6PD def and so far there is no specific study. And Also G6PD def is not monolithic either. There are over 400 variants, and people usually have other genetic variations as well. So, thanks for the info. But my % is based on the numbers in your linked article though.\n\nAnd your point was around the vaccine and \"blood\", you realise a blood clot is entirely different than a hemolytic crisis.\n\nI can also comment on how different variants of G6PD deficiency do not necessarily mean different clinical presentations but honestly, everyone is free to manage their condition however they wish and I do not think myself or anyone on this sub will ever change your mind. I trust my hematologist at the Mayo Clinic, legumes cause hemolysis, I am a walking example of having levels of g6pd at 3.2 from soybeans G6PDD is auto immune, the process of the mutation is auto immune.  Which websites could we get correct information and research? I would say definitely ask your doctor when in doubt, and when googling, only trust research papers (e.g. NCBI, pubmed, nature). These are usually sites I trust. In addition, in the UK at least, anything coming from the NHS or the BMJ (British medical journal) is safe. These people are not trying to sell anything or fearmonger but publishing their findings and guidance. like.. why is there so little knowledge on something that affects so many people??? Honestly, because the people it affects are mostly minorities or people in poor or developing countries. In the US almost all G6PD attention is on infants because that is where the $$ is at. Most G6PD adult care is \"are you currently diying?, No. Then you are fine.\" \\*\\*No lie detected here\\*\\*\\*", "Why cannot I eat peanuts? "]
