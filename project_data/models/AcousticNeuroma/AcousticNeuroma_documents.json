["Is hearing loss after surgery guaranteed?  It depends on the size, location and type of surgery.\nTranslabyrinthine (Translab) will destroy parts of your inner ear and has 100% hearing loss.\nMiddle Fossa and Retrosigmoid have a chance of saving hearing. This chance can be quite low based on the size and location of the tumor. Thanks for the response. Admittedly, I am waiting for my MRI so I do not have any diagnosis yet. However, losing my hearing is a huge fear of mine. Thanks. I had 80% hearing and lost it from my retrosigmoid surgery. It sucks but there are some things that can be done like a Bone anchored hearing aid. If you are diagnosed with an AN your doctor should give you an estimate on your chances of keeping your hearing. If you get diagnosed I would suggest checking out  . I had what my doctor called posterior fossa surgery (I think it might be the same as retrosigmoid), as well as Gamna Knife. I still have some hearing. I am not sure of the percentage.  I have trouble hearing in crowded rooms and cannot use a phone on that side, but I can hear Not always a guarantee but it is likely in most cases. When my AN was found I basically had no hearing in the affected ear anyway. I now have no hearing in that ear and I have adjusted very well since my opposite ear is strong as has adjusted well. Losing hearing is not necessarily the worst thing that can happen. Best of luck to you It is worth noting..  I have lost 60Db hearing from 1kh-&gt;4kh in 18 months of a pea sized AN. \n\nYou will have one side of hearing still.. you will not go deaf unless you have bilateral AN's", "Does this sound like AN? So the first time this happened to me was in July 2019. For context, I had tubes put in my ears as a kid which have since fallen out (they are designed to fall out). I was unplugging my ears fairly aggressively (vasalva maneuver) on a flight, which I have done since I was a kid and my right ear felt like it was plugged 'deeper' than it had ever been. The right side of my tongue also became numb, and I was worried for a few hours until my ear unplugged and I regained sensation on that side of my tongue.\n\n Fast forward to March 2020, I do the same thing, and this time the whole right side of my face goes numb along with the tongue, and I also get momentary vertigo. I go to the ER and the symptoms wear off while I am waiting for a doctor. Same thing happens in November 2020, and I am fine as soon as the ear is unplugged. \n\nSame thing just happened to me right now, and again the symptoms wear off as soon as my ear is unplugged. I still have tinnitus but it wears off within a few days. I also get swollen lymph nodes on the right side of my neck (same as plugged ear) which clear up within a day or two. I experience no symptoms at all in between these periods, they only occur when the right ear is plugged. What I am wondering is is have any of you experienced similar symptoms, or does having symptoms in spurts like this sound unfamiliar to AN? I would make an appointment with an Ear Nose and Throat dr to be safe. Nobody ever really knows until their dr finds out for them Yeah I just made an appointment to be safe. Just wanted to see if these symptoms sound familiar to anyone because they seem very unique to me as others said, see your doctor. But no, this is nothing like my experience. If you had AN related hearing loss, it would not be intermittent, it would just be gone. This does not sound like an AN, but I am not a doctor. Please do go to doc as discussed!", "AN after suegery Hello all\u2014I had surgery (medial fossa approach) to remove an AN in June.  I just had my postoperative MRI follow up at 3 months, and it showed a small mass, presumably a remainder or additional AN (~30% of original size).\n\nHave any of you had ANs post surgery, especially so soon?  If so, did you monitor or need additional surgery?  The latest mass is sub 0.5 cm^3.\n\nThanks for any insight you can provide. I had my surgery July 2021 and I had an mri a few days after just to make sure it was OK. But the surgeon did tell me he had to leave some of the tumor just to preserve my facial nerve (I am assuming that is that is yours did too) I am scheduled to get gamma ray radiation sometime early next year (I am pregnant so it makes this a lot more complicated) Thanks for the reply.  In my case, they told us the entire tumor was removed.  I have a follow up doc appointment next week, so I will learn more about their thoughts then.  Thanks again! Oh ya then definitely worth asking ! Had surgery in 2018, and in 2020 i had to take radiation treatment because it had grown back a little bit. Radiation is easy compared to surgery, went back to work immediately after. I had my surgery 11 days ago to remove a 3.6cm tumor  and they also told me they got it all. I will keep this in mind to make sure I follow up with mri's. I do no think I could ever go through this type of surgery ever again. Very traumatic  for me. Me either. So traumatic, had my surgery in July. What is it like to have that thing on your head? That is the part I am the most concerned about What thing? The frame when you are being radiated? Yea Well, it was not comfortable to wear, but just weird. And since it is screwed into your skull it takes a couple of weeks to heal. \nBut i have gone through both the operation and the radiation. It took me half a year to recover from the surgery, I had a big tumor, and some complications with my facial nerve. Mine was to big to use gamma knife on.\nThen after a couple of years it had grown back, but not as big as it was, this time I could do the gamma knife. One weird day where they put on the frame and then an mri, and off to radiation you go. After a small hour you are finished, they take off the frame and you wait for the local sedatives to go out and then you go home the next day. You are fulle functioning from day one after the procedure. I would say if you can choose between the two, choose gamma knife. Well, it was not comfortable to wear, but just weird.

Good luck to you, an acoustic neuroma is not the end of your life, but it, or it is effects will be with you the rest of your life. I had surgery done already too but doctor is expecting to have to do gamma in the future in order to get rid of it completely. He could not get rid of it all since he did not want to damage my facial nerve.", "Tingling/pins in needles in ear? Is tingling or a pins and needles like feeling a symptom for acoustic neuromas? Ive been experiencing an on and off deep pins and needles feeling in my right ear, ENT checked for hearing loss but said everything seems normal. \n\nI notice it seems to get a bit worse when I lie down, and only feels better or like something is being \u201cunpinched\u201d when i leave my jaw slack or sit up. So far TMJ or an acoustic neuroma seem to be the only things i can find online that sound anywhere close to what im experiencing. It seems like everything ive read about acoustic neuromas, the tingling is facial and not in the actual ear. \n\ndoes anyone know if this is a symptom? To my knowledge, the nerve bundle that runs in the auditory canal has hearing, vestibular (balance), and facial nerve function (sensorimotor function of that side of face).  I have not seen any \u2018pins and needles\u2019 in my reading of symptoms.  Also, personally, I think it would be strange to have this type of symptom, unless you were feeling this sensation on the side of your face.  To my knowledge, these nerves do not carry information that would cause this sensation.  This being said, I am not a doctor and could definitely be wrong!  Hope this helps. I had this problem too. It was really bad at night when I slept. Turns out after an mri, my tmj was so bad, the jaw joint was not in place at all. So when I slept it would naturally shift due to gravity and it would end up pinching the nerve. So when I rolled over, the pressure came off but it felt very painful. I went to quite a few doctors trying to explain it but they all wrote me off as making it up,probably since I was also in the military at the time. I finally saw a tmj specialist and he knew right away what I was taking about and got me the scans to prove it so I could get physical therapy for my tmj. Hopefully you can find the right doctor who will get it and get you help. It was unrelated to the AN but still a problem.", "Anyone have Gamma knife done after surgery?  Yes. Tumor was \"debulked\" with surgery and then GK 6 weeks later. Tumor was about 3cm. Retained my hearing (mild-moderate loss and no hearing aid for many years). Very slight facial nerve damage from swelling after GK. 14 years ago and I would do the same again if my doctors recommended it. Let me know if you have questions. That is kind of how my situation is. They got it mostly out with surgery but could not get it all out due to facial nerve involvement. I am having an mri done next month probably to monitor if any growth. Mine was planned to be both from before the surgery. Do you have confidence with the doctors involved? I know my neurosurgeon was very involved in the GK , but there was a neuro-radiologist or maybe a radio-oncologist (?) I met with beforehand and they did the GK together. GK was pretty simple and straightforward. Yeah I have confidence in the doctor. I am not looking forward to getting it done but from what others have told me it seems way easier than surgery. I will not have gk done until I have my baby and I am due in February so it also makes it a little more complicated Oh I am sorry you are dealing with this all at once. I was diagnosed when my son was 4 weeks and had surgery when he was 6 weeks. I was so stressed but my baby was and still is the biggest joy, 15 years later. GK was a breeze. DM me if you ever need to talk or have questions. Confidence in your doctor is huge, IMO. Take care. Likely waiting until February will be better than making any decisions about gammaknife a few months after surgery.  It can take a while for the tumor blood supply to change/consolidate and often the tumors will look different on post operative scans but will not be \u201cgrowing\u201d.  Depending on how much tumor was left on the nerve initially I would favor waiting until February to even make a decision regarding GK.", "Dr. thinks I might have AN (awaiting MRI results), what were your first symptoms? After being in and out of doctors over the past few months trying to find the cause of my dizziness and never-ending tinnitus, I am finally awaiting the results of two MRI's I had last week. They think it might be AN, but at this point, it feels like anyone's guess. I figured I would come here and ask what kind of symptoms others had and if mine sound familiar :|\n\nI have had this fullness feeling in my right ear/side of my head, almost a heavy pressure that I might mistake as a headache if it actually hurt at all. When this all started I thought it might be an ear infection, or Meniere's or something along those lines, but those have all been ruled out at this point (and the videonystagmography results said the problem was not in my ears). My hearing test a month ago said I had perfect hearing, but now I am having trouble understanding phone calls on that side. \n\nThe tinnitus just never stops, and I cannot really tell which ear it is coming from, it is just this loud high pitch ringing that never goes away and drives me crazy if I do not play music or something to distract me from it. It is honestly worse than the dizziness because at least that is not nonstop. I would give *anything* to know silence again.\n\nThe dizziness comes and goes, it is way worse in the morning. When it comes, it either lasts for a few moments or what feels like hours and then the brain fog comes along with it. I almost collapsed in a Barnes and Noble about a month back because it was so hard to focus and stand when the dizziness came on hard. It is been making my ability to focus at work extremely difficult, and I have had to call out more than once because of it.\n\nThen this past Friday night the face numbness started, and it is really hard to describe quite what it feels like. It is like a numbness that starts in and around the bottom of my ear where my jaw is, and at times it radiates out towards the front of my face. Almost like I had a lidocaine shot for a cavity in the back of my mouth.  I was actually pretty concerned about that and went to the ER over it (random face numbness is not something that is ever happened to me before), but they told me it was not TMJ and since there was not any pain I was feeling it probably was not life-threatening and they sent me home. It is not total face numbness, just this radiating numbness that comes and goes.\n\nI have been following the \"Vestibular Migraine\" diet for a month now, hoping that was the cause. I quit vaping, got on the patch to quit nicotine entirely. Stopped drinking caffeine, you name it. I even tried Vitamin B and Magnesium supplements as suggested for migraines, hoping that might stop it to no avail.\n\nAt this point, I am at my wit's end trying to make this feeling stop. It does not hurt at all, it is just extremely annoying to get so dizzy I feel like throwing up randomly. The pressure is more of a weird dull feeling, almost like my ear is trying to pop from changing altitude quickly, but it is more spread over what feels like the whole side of my head and nothing seems to make it stop. The numbness was scary at first, but now it is just another weird thing to add to the list. \n\nDoes any of this sound familiar? \ud83d\ude1e", "Post AN surgery for my ma Hi All!\n\nMy mother (55) had her translab surgery on Thursday to remove her 2.2x2.2cm AN. \n\nEverything went well according to the doctors and neurosurgeons and she is recovering now in a ward. She got really bad nausea after the surgery and was kept in ICU for an extra night to try control her nausea and stop her from vomiting all the time. \n\nShe is doing well now, but she is still having tinnitus in her ear and her tongue still has a weird sensation (same sensation as pre surgery). According to her, it is like her tongue feels swollen and she is lost her tastebuds and instead everything tastes a bit like metal. Nothing tastes the same anymore. \n\nHas anyone else who have had an AN removed, had a similar experience? This is one thing that is puzzling the doctors as they do not know why it is like that. They are hoping it will go away and it is some residual nerve damage, but no luck yet. \n\nWould love to hear from you all! I had an AN and hardly consider myself an expert, but it was my impression that the nerve damage done by the tumor does not necessarily go away once the tumor is gone. After my surgery, I did have some new numbness at the tip of my tongue that did go away after a number of weeks. The tinnitus I had before the surgery did not get any better, though I had the mid fossa approach, so the hearing nerve, cochlea, etc, were left intact.\n\nI feel for her about the nausea. I threw up and dry heaved several times after my surgery. My BP would rocket up to 190 over something (I already had untreated high BP at that point) and the pain in my head really made me feel like I was going to die. The ringing will still be there after translab surgery.  The ringing is not really in your ear but your brain interpreting what it thinks it is hearing in the ear. With the inner ear gone and not sounds coming through the ringer got louder for me.\n\nMy numbness mostly went away after surgery, but there is some still there. That might be different for everyone. In my case the doctors dud something with the damaged feeling nerve that made all the feeling come back before I had some numbness again.", "AN and ADHD? Are you diagnosed with ADHD?  If so, do you take meds to manage it?  \n\nI am wondering how many of us were diagnosed with ADHD when they were younger or as adults.  A book I am currently reading (ADHD 2.0) made me curious based on some of the neurology discussed.\n\nI am ADHD and also wonder about the wisdom of taking the meds I have been prescribed.  My neurologist did not have a definitive answer, but thought it would not be a problem. Yes. Ritalin, adderall, you name it since 1996 Yep. Was identified as ADHD in elementary but did not get officially diagnosed/on meds until my mid thirties. Shortly before my AN was diagnosed.  Not going to lie though, the vyvanse then adderall was a lifesaver post op. I had an AN and have ADHD but was not medicated for them ADHD. AN and daily Adderall.

While they successfully removed the tumor and avoided any damage to the facial nerve, I unfortunately did lose my hearing in that ear.\n\nFor the most part, my recovery went well but I experienced significant headaches that did not really respond to the opioid painkiller but did to the steroid packs so eventually my neurosurgeon switched me to naproxen with improved results. He said this likely meant my pain was a result of inflammation from the tissue used to close the skull incision but would go away once it becomes scar tissue. All my post-op MRIs and CTs have come back normal.\n\nENT recommended a pain mgmt specialist who prescribed a lidocaine cream that did nothing. Neurologists, which my PCP suggested, in the area are booked 6+ months out.\n\nDuring my most recent follow up with neurosurgeon, he did express sympathy and said that this is not typical but he has had a patient or two that has had similar experiences and that it did go away eventually.\n\nSorry for the long intro but any feedback, suggestions, etc. for dealing with these headaches? When on meds, I am now usually ok during the day but whether I take my PM dose or not, my mornings are pretty bad until that AM dose kicks in. Does sleeping/laying down have something to do with it? For example, last night at \\~10pm I took my dose which should last 12 hrs. I woke up at 5am with a brutal headache and could not go back to sleep until I took another dose.\n\nLike I said, any feedback, etc. would be appreciated. Could laying down or pillows or something be a contributing factor? I am kind of at a loss at this point....", "Cross face nerve graft Hey AN team. I am 8 weeks post op  surgery.  My facial nerve was completely  damaged on the right side during the removal. The  plastic surgeon  who assisted in rebuilding the nerve during my surgery  is recommending  a cross face nerve graft to assist with symmetry. As of right now I  still have no movement. The post op stuff looks tough and im not sure I want  to go through another surgery. They basically  take a nerve from my ankle and implant it into my face. Another 12 weeks  healing process with facial swelling ankle swelling  etc. Has anyone gone through the nerve graft? I need insights.", "TIL that tinnitus is in my brain, not my ear... I have not had time to process this bit of info yet. This is not good news. I also learned that, for many people, the tinnitus does not go away, even after treatment. I was just watching a ANA video on YouTube about this, and they said the tinnitus is independent of the actual tumor, and that the origin of the problem is in the brain. \n\nWith all of the research I have done, I am blown away that I missed this factoid...\n\nI have been listening to this white noise YT channel for the past hour and it is actually helping a lot.\n\nI honestly cannot imagine having this for the rest of my life. I just wanted to say that. I had been pondering coming out of W&amp;W and getting this treated, even though it is small, just to get rid of the tinnitus. But I guess no.\n\nIf anyone cares to share about their tinnitus experience pre- or post-treatment, i would be very interested. Although I also acknowledge that sometimes talking about it males it more stressful. :-/ Op I am going to bed , but I would be happy to talk about my AN surgery tomorrow . Send me a DM. Well for now, while I still have some hearing on the right, a hearing aid helps with the tinnitus a lot. It does not bother me when I am wearing the hearing aid, and knowing I can fall back on the HA if I need to helps me not to focus on and freak out about the T. Honestly you get kind of used to it and do not even notice it that much except during really really quiet times. Are use a ton of white noise to cut it out but it will never go away. Oh well at least we did not have a cancerous brain tumor. I do not ever really notice mine most of the time.\nI can hear it as I type this though, only because I am aware of it now. \nIt is just something that gets filtered out most of the time. Yeah mine is just a constant high pitched whine. It is not too loud so I do not even notice it most of the time. I also have kids so there is not much time when there is not other noise covering it up lol.\n\nFor about a month a couple of months after surgery, I was getting pulsatile tinnitus and that was ten times worse: Thud...thud...thud....stop for a while (oh good it is gone)...*five minutes later*.....thud...thud...thud....(dammit it is back. how long is it lasting this time?) I try not to make unhelpful comparisons like that when dealing with my AN challenges. I am sorry I did not mean to offend you\u2026 It is just that when I was told I had a brain tumor my mind immediately jumped to cancer. When I found out it was not cancer my relief was immense. I wish you luck in your journey. Again no offense meant. The thudding was so bad for me and I was unprepared for it and unaware it could be an issue. I was convinced my neighbor was booming techno music \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I understand. :-)\n\nI am sorry for being so terse. My tinnitus is starting to get bad and I am a bit crushed to learn that treatment will not fix it.\n\nThank, and take care of yourself. :-) Hi. How long have you had it? Would you be able to guess how loud it is on a scale of 1-10? Are you pre surgery or do you even need surgery right now? Also how much hearing do you have in the AN ear? This will help me relate my experience to you. I promise you that you pretty much get used to it and do not hear it anymore. I am sorry it is getting worse, I remember when that happened to me. But most of the time I do not even notice it anymore. Easily 99% of the time I am not even paying attention to it. So there is hope out there for you! Good luck to you too. That is heartening. Thank you. :-) Hi :-)\n\nI do not know about loudness, I would be guessing. I can say that it is gotten much louder in the past two weeks, accompanied by a noticeable decrease in my hearing. I am in W&amp;W with a small tumor. I think I have maybe 50% hearing in my AN ear, but I am due for a test, so totally guessing here.\n\nI am considering middle fossa surgery, per my doctor's suggestion, but I have not met with a gamma knife doc yet, so have no real opinion on that yet.", "I think I have this condition based off of symptoms I have been having I(22M) developed double vision around a year ago but I kept trying to get answers from an eye doctor.

You need to get an mri. It is rare, but possible.  The only way to rule it out is an MRI with contrast. Do you have hearing loss in both ears or just one? Both ears Hearing loss from AN tends to be in just one ear, since the tumor is usually only found on one side.\n\nIf by \"eye doctor\" you mean an optometrist, I would recommend trying to get in with a ophthalmologist instead for your vision issues.

My doctors recommended either middle fossa surgery or radiosurgery, although the current plan is to wait six months for another MRI and make the decision then.\n\nBoth options terrify me, but not doing either is also terrifying.  I do not know that I expect the second opinion to tell me anything new, but I figured it cannot hurt, and I am trying to gather as much information as possible.  I know it could be so much worse - my tumor is small, and I have okay hearing so far, and hey, it is not cancer.  I am still terrified.  \n\nAre there any recommended places to research either the surgery or the gamma knife?  How did you choose what treatment to go with?  I am scatterbrained and scared, so apologies if this does not read very well. If gamma knife is an option, I always tell people to go with gamma knife.   The success rate is great 98%, it is the best option to preserve your hearing balance and facial nerves. \n\nEven if it fails (which it did for me) you can always have the surgery later.  \n\nWatch and wait is very common with ANs, since they are so slow growing, and some people wait for years before seeking treatment. \n\nIf you have not already, look at the ANA website, there is a great message forum there and you can search directly for doctors and hospital systems.

If you have questions please feel free to message me, as I have been through both gamma knife and surgery. Thank you for your insight, and the ANA recommendation.  I will spend time there this weekend. Join the acoustic neuroma association ANAUSA, watch their videos and read the boards, join the AN Facebook group, and do not rush into anything. When you are ready, get in contact with a major university or other hospital that has a dedicated AN team. You can find them at ANAUSA (they support the yearly conference and such). I started with Kaiser insurance, hated the neurologist I was sent to, and then changed my insurance to Blue Shield so I could go to Keck USC. A year after diagnosis I am planning surgery with a team I trust. That is so important. Good luck. I am newly diagnosed with a 3mm in my left eat canal. You might join the ANAUSA? (anausa.org) they have s ton of MD led videos describing options in detail. And peer mentors\u2026 I am really sorry to hear about your diagnosis. I was there myself last October when I found out about my 7mm AN. That was a really tough few months and I think I can imagine what you are going through. I could not think about much else and I always returned to thinking about it. Now it is the other way around and I rarely think about it. I think the key is having a plan to deal with it. I am in Ireland so it is a public health system. I have been treated professionally throughout, being referred to the centre in Dublin that deals with all of these in the country, but they are in no rush to do anything about it. I had a 6 month scan which showed it to be stable with no growth and I have my next scan scheduled in a year. I am trying to prepare myself mentally for the possibility of growth and having to face a treatment option. I suppose what I am saying is to remember that you have watch and wait in the bank as an option and you have time to consider your options if it is small and not causing to much symptoms. There is a definite American bias in Reddit and surgeons seem all too ready to cut into you. As far I see it there is no perfect treatment for these, even with surgery they can recur. Remember that we are the lucky ones who have the small ANs, we have time and options. I am sure I have seen something about not recommending gamma knife to younger people.  Was this ever discussed as an issue with you? How did recovery/side effects differ for you with the different procedures? I believe that the idea if radiation in general is frowned upon by some people, bc, well..radiation.  but my original surgeon that did the GK felt that was not relevant for young vs old and not relevant for GK specifically bc the radiation is so localized and directed at exactly the right spot. \n\nI originally did consult with 2 surgeons one favored surgery (and I have friends who have used him and had great success) and one preferred GK. I choose GK bc it was much less invasive, less recovery time, less side effects, very high success rate, and at my age, and life situation was the best choice for me. \n\nIf I had to go back and do it all again, I would again choose GK even tho mine was not successful. And even talking with my surgeon who did surgery 2 years later agreed that GK was the right choice to start. \n\nSide effects for GK - little to none. GK for me was outpatient, so I went home that same day. I have a small scar on my forehead and a small on under my hair (I am female), I was sleepy for about 2 days and took maybe 4-5 days off work, that is it. \nGK did not effect my hearing, I had not lost much to begin with, and GK did not change that ( maybe slightly but not noticable in day to day life)  \n\nSurgery- and I do not write this to scare anyone, I was a unique case and my doctor said I fell into lots of the \"rare\" circumstances.   \n\nBc of my previously radiated tumor my surgery was extra long and difficult, typically the doc will peel layers away from the tumor until it is removed, but mine was the consistency if scar tissue, making it more gummy to remove. He explained dit as pulling melted cheese off a grilled cheese sandwich. My surgery lasted 15 1/2 hours. \n Bc of the time I was under and being on the operating table I woke to have some minor reactions (minor in the medical world, big to me) to the anesthesia. (Body convulsions right after waking up and a feeling of buzzing for 24-48 hours, I also had some hallucinations for 12-24 hours after. I have been told for another surgery that I am hard to wake up after anesthesia) \nI was unable to move my body for about 3 days post op, this was from being in 1 position for so long. Bc of this I developed a blood clot in my lolungs, a pulmonary embolism which was discovered about 6/7 days post op and landed me back in the hospital \u2639\ufe0f\n\nDuring surgery the docs pack the nerve endings with a substance like foam, it swells up a little and eventually absorbs into your body in a few days, this prevents bleeding.  Well, mine swelled up a little too much, and began to push on my nerve that controlled my neck muscles and my ability to swallow. So before realizing this, I tried eating and coughed up all my food and drinks, leading to aspiration into my lungs which turned into aspiration pneumonia. Bc of this I had to have a feeding tube inserted so I could get my nutrients.  \n\nI was discharged from the hospital 5 days post op with the feeding tube.  Within 24 hours I had some ked a fever and was rushed by ambulance back. This is when they found the PE and the pneumonia in my lungs. This put me back in the hospital for 6 more days. \n\nOnce I came home from that stay things went well! I took the total 12 weeks off work I was allowed for FMLA, but I could have returned earlier. \n\nThat is my story.  It sucked I will be honest and I continue to support GK over surgery.  I had an AMAZING surgeon and none of the complications were due to him, they were just weird things, so not very typical, but they happens to me. \n\nI am 10 years post surgery thisonth and I feel great.  So there is so much light on the other side of this tunnel, I promise that! I did not have an AN, but my mom had a 3.1 cm AN and I was very involved in her care and actually found her the doctors she ended up going to .. \n\nRadiation is definitely an appealing option because who wants to endure full on brain surgery, right? However, what we learned from my mom\u2019s ENT, if radiation does not work/the tumor continues to grow after to the point where you do need surgery .. surgery becomes a lot more difficult. The radiation will cause swelling and take up more room, which will decrease your surgeon\u2019s room for \u201cerror,\u201d if you will. It definitely increases risks for post-surgical complications/decreased quality of life in the long run. \n\nThat is not to say radiation cannot be successful! It is just definitely something to think about and something to discuss with your doctor. \n\n\nAlso, I want to note... this is no small deal, obviously. Yes, there are many \u201cqualified\u201d surgeons out there, but it is in your BEST interest to research, research, RESEARCH. I am part of an AN support page on Facebook and from everything I see on there optimal outcomes/greater quality of life post-op is *HEAVILY* correlated with going to a team of surgeons who deal with a HIGH VOLUME of acoustic neuromas. \n\nHouse Clinic in LA was definitely a pioneer for AN surgeries and the surgical technology for the surgery specifically. At one time they did more AN surgeries than any other clinic in the world. They are still an incredibly great option to look into. \n\nI believe now UCSD has surpassed them in AN volume and they have the same cutting edge technology for these surgeries. The team at UCSD trained at House and then branched off. \n\nAnecdotally, my mom had surgery at House. Her tumor was 98% removed. The remaining 2%\u2019s blood supply was severed and is expected to \u201cshrivel up,\u201d if you will. She is a little over a month post-op now and she is doing great. From day 1 she had no noticeable facial paralysis. She did not have to do any physical or vestibular therapy after her 5-day stay at the hospital. After a week she never used her walker again. 3 weeks post-op she was driving on the interstate in our million-person-populated city. Not bad for a middle aged woman with a classified-as-large tumor. \n\nEDIT: when I say these places are high-volume, I mean it an incredible rate.. Our local surgeons only do 5 a year.. that freaked my mom out! The surgeons at House do about 150 a year! One of my mom\u2019s ICU nurses said she sees 3-4 AN surgical patients a week. \n\nEDIT2: Also to note in the list of post-op successes with my mom ... no CSF leak either. Her surgeon reported that he had only about a 3% CSF leak rate. \n\nFeel free to message me if you want to talk more! Thanks for this information, it is incredibly helpful.  I have a second opinion appt on Tuesday and feel much better prepared with what questions I have.  Also, I am glad your mom is doing so well!", "Just learning about this now For a while I have had issues hearing my Husband/Daughter's voices if there is any other noise around me. Car noise, tv/music, even the dog drinking from his water dish will drown out people talking to me. I had also been having a lot of pressure in my right ear but figured it had to do with allergies. I went for a Hearing Test thinking all the concerts in my Teens/20s did some damage or maybe just more post-pregnancy changes, but no, I have \"Good\" hearing, my left ear is great and my right ear is still pretty good but there is a noticeable difference and paired with the dizziness/blacked vision I get when I stand up or move too quickly the Audioligist? sent a referel for an Auditory Brainstem Response Test because \"there could be a growth on the nerve to your brain, but it is usually fine, it will probably be within a year or so\". So now I am just waiting for someone to contact me to setup an an appointment for this thing that has an unbelievably long waitlist and of course I am googling because I have no other info and anxiety. I am in Rural Atlantic Canada, no Doctor, and I am not sure of any other resources so any and all info is welcomed. Even just positive stories that can help lighten my mood.", "Facial paralysis recovery Hi all. I have been on Reddit ages and never thought that this sub existed. I should have looked ages ago. \n\nAnyway. Hello. I am over my surgery a few years and even had cyberknife this year for recurrence. \n\nMy question is around facial paralysis. After surgery I had a bad case of palsy but over time and therapy I regained a lot of symmetry and very minor movements. \n\nI am always massaging my face for tightness but over the last few weeks I have been wondering if things are changing. For the better. I can flare the nostril on the affected side. Not by much but visible to me when I look at it. Some slight movement around the orbit of my eye. Though I will continue to monitor and exercise it I am wondering can this all fix over more time itself. My therapist at the time said that after a year of \u2018no significant change\u2019 then it does not really get any better. Have any of you made as to imaging recovery for your face?  I would love to see my original smile back", "Cholesterol Granuloma After Surgery Hey everyone, I had an acoustic neuroma around 4cm, but had it removed about 4 years ago. I recently had a MRI and was told I have a Cholesterol Granuloma. Has anyone here had one of these develop after surgery, or does anyone else have experience in dealing with one? The doctor told me it was probably no big deal, but knowing I have something else in there now kind of freaks me out. \n\nTHANKS!", "AN and work Hi all, first time posting, happy I found this sub. I have a grain of rice sized AN (Named it Schwannona Ryder) on my left side, diagnosed about a year and a half ago after a free hearing test and resulting visit to an ENT (Canada, Yay!). I cannot off the top of my head remember it is size aside from the grain of rice comparison. I am in the wait and see rounds as it has not grown since diagnosis. Hearing is heavily impacted, tinnitus is constant, minor dizzy spells and facial twitches, but I know they are becoming more frequent. \n\nI am trying to be proactive. The depression and anxiety are real and I fight them as hard as I can. I figure having some kind of plan and security might help. I have always worked in physical, movement based roles through a variety of employer's. University degree is about as useless as when I graduated a decade ago. Presently my job involves a lot of running, lifting heavy loads, and just general sweaty, loud work. I want to pivot to something more sedentary in case Schwannona decides to fuck with my balance even more, cannot be stumbling about with forklifts speeding around. \n\nHas anyone else pivoted their career around their AN? I do not even know where to start. I have tried a few coding tutorials and now know with certainty that it is not going to be a component in my future. I have dyscalculia/dysgraphia so there goes just about anything involving a spreadsheet. Beginning to suspect ADHD as well, that is on the list for the next doctor's visit. \n\nAs I said first post here so be gentle. So just talking out loud and not a medical professional either so take it with a grain of salt (no pun intended).\n\nDid your doc ever mention about possibility of stereotactical radio surgery? It might be also called \"gamma knife.\"\n\nI had it when insurance considered it \"experimental\" &amp; that was 30 yrs. ago. Now it is not experimental, at least that I know of in US so wondering up north in your neck of the woods?\n\nI had normal resection of AN first time around. Size was golfball to baseball and wrapped around the celabellum; size alone would have killed me. Anyways,  surgeons left millimeter of AN on celabellum so as not to risk turning me into a carrot.\n\nWell 2 yrs. later it started growing back. This time the docs recommended stereotactical radio surgery to \"zap\" the AN cells dead as it was not big like before. From what I remember (just google I guess too LOL) For geeks: farm of Sun minicomputers doing target calculations overlapping MRI image to precisely knock the AN cells out.\n\nAfter going through this &amp; after MRI images (first frequently but now every 5 to 7 yrs), the size has not changed so the prognosis is that they have been dead cells taking up space for close to 30 yrs \ud83e\udd1e\n\nSorry for the long reply. From your post it seemed like the rice grain sized AN is wrecking havoc in different ways and was wondering if there are options ... also sharing personal experience. Thanks for sharing! Did you have any lasting side effects? I already have a benign cyst kicking around in my skull so yay for dead cells in there!\n\nAs far as I remember the doctor gave me three options and his opinion. \n\n1. Wait and see (it is small, may have had it for years. His opinion)\n 2. Surgery (risky, hearing gone in that ear, facial paralysis, long recovery) \n3. Gamma knife (less risky than surgery. Shorter recovery. Hearing likely to go. Facial paralysis a maybe?)\n\nI went with his opinion, generally trust the experts and at that point I was newly unemployed and in debt so delaying the job hunt was not an option. Since then I feel like I have been kicking the can a bit, I had my annual MRI in Dec, and uneventful 10min follow up call from the doc. \n\nI know I am going to have to deal with it sooner rather than later. Thankfully in Canada I will not be out of pocket for any of the direct costs, but I also care for and financially support an elderly parent with her own health issues so I have that to consider.\n\nI know I am in for a hurdle one way or another, I would like to be as prepared as possible. Be prepared is a good moto. I was a Boy Scout; I even attend the World Jamboree in Calgary!\n\nTo answer your question, I forgot to mention that when I first had the resection, it ablated my 7th &amp; 8th cranial nerves. 7th is hearing &amp; 8th is facial, or was it the other way around?, thus half my face was paralyzed: one ear &amp; one eye left. Why the eye was damaged is related to the facial nerve that was ablated which ceased the eyelids from blinking which led to cornea damage. \n\nHaving done both, I agree with you risk assessments for your various options with the most risk being resection. I do not know about gamma knife &amp; facial paralysis but good thing to research IMHO. If I were to guess, to zap the AN, I believe the good cells in front of the AN cells will be damaged too thus if the 8th cranial nerve \"happens\" to be in the line-of-sight, I suppose that will damage(?) that nerve ... I am way over my head and I am sure your doc will be able to explain this better. AN patient here and I will just say that if you enjoy your job that you will recover and return to work in no time. I am one year post translab (5.5cm, tangerine size) and can say that no challenge is too great to overcome. Well said fartknocker8: \"... no challenge is too great to overcome.\"", "Acoustic Neuroma symptoms? Hi there,\n\nI am a 24F and in the last 6 months I have been experiencing on and off pulsatile tinnitus in my right ear, especially at night and when I am sitting in or lying in bed, it seems to get worse when I am anxious as well. \n\nIn the past week I have had this odd sensation in my head, it is not sore but feels full or like I have a band around my head, I have been feeling nauseas but have not been sick. I have had a hard time with my mental health the past few weeks and have been panicking quite a lot. \n\nI got an eye test yesterday and I am already short sighted but my right eye has changed prescription slightly. They checked the back of my eye and said everything looks healthy. \n\nI have spoken to my doctor about all these symptoms, they want to send me to ENT for a hearing test first but I have not been feeling like I am losing my hearing but it definitely feels more sensitive to certain frequencies. My mum is profoundly deaf and lost her hearing later on in life so I think that is a factor in them wanting to check this. \n\nMy doctor did mention an acoustic neuroma because of my pulsatile tinnitus but said it was very rare. I just wanted to ask if this sounds like it could be? \n\nThanks for any help at all. Hi! Firstly it could be an AN, but could also be other things. Different people have different symptoms. Do you know what your mom has? That could help your ENT if it is a hereditary disorder. Ultimately you will not know if you have an AN unless your ENT sends you for an MRI. My ENT also said it is not as rare as you think, especially now that the technology to find them is more widely available. Good luck! Thanks so much for your reply! \n\nMy mum is deaf as it is just in her genes, her Dad was deaf too so I think it is just hereditary.\n\nMy doctor is sending me for a hearing test and is letting ENT decide whether they think it is worth exploring further but I am getting bloods done to see if it could be anything else at all so hopefully it goes okay. The ENT can do several tests to narrow it down. My hearing loss was very minimal at first on the side of my AN.  However,  the equilibrium test also showed a slight irregularity which made them order an MRI. Thanks for your reply!\n\nHopefully I will have clearer answers with more tests. I have just been told about a hearing test so far but if there are more tests available, that is good to hear. \n\nI have not noticed any differences in my balance but just the occasional pulsatile tinnitus and more sensitive in my ear to nosies like phones/video calls etc. I had symptoms of an AN going back as far as 2004, but did not lose any hearing until 2013. I was not diagnosed with an AN until 2016. It is possible. It is also rare. Do not worry. Just do the testing. It is better to get tested like you are than not getting tested like I did because I had doctors who did not recognize the symptoms. The last time I had a hearing test was around 2 years ago and everything was fine then. I am a bit of a hypochondriac to be honest so I have been panicking about possibilities but you are right, getting a test is the best thing.\n\nI hope you are getting on okay with your AN and your hearing! Half my face went numb.  I had asymmetrical hearing loss and tinnitus before that but I work on a flight line. My wife and BOTH of her parents had the test. I am pretty sure my Dad has been tested for it. I am the only one that had it. My wife\u2019s test was ordered by the same doctor that initially ordered my test. She learned from what happened to me to order the test with contrast. The only reason they caught this is because I went to see a second ENT for a second opinion on hearing aides before sinking $8000 into hearing aides. The first ENT missed it completely. Facial nerve impingement could be caused by AN.   The hearing,balance,and facial may be squished by AN.  After my surgery my facial nerves were wonky. I am 5 weeks post op and they are not yet normal, but getting better. Hey OP you and I bought have very similar symptoms. Did you get an MRI done? How did it go? Hey! I have not had any tests yet as my doctor does not think it is urgent enough for an emergency referral to ENT so I am still waiting for my routine appointment referral for ENT. \n\nI still have the pulsing and the pressure in my head and neck but no other symptoms at all. Otherwise I feel fine apart from being very anxious but hopefully the tests will happen soon because the anxiety is the worst part of it.\n\nWhat about you? Have you managed to get any appointments?", "Questions about hearing aids Anyone have any success with Cros or BaHA Style aids to compensate? \n\nThe single sided disparity really wears on me sometimes, I am looking into some options after speaking with my doctor \n\n\nLet me know yalls stories about aids I have Oticon Cros! And I am in love with them. They may not perfectly solve SSD, but it is a ton better than being being my hearing at all! I have the Phonak Cros and never got to feel comfortable with them. The equalisation may be tricky. It helps in certain social situations, but overall I prefer to not wear them. I have the phonak cros as well, i use then all the time at work. I work as a teacher, so hearing aids are a must.\nI tries different brands, but phonak worked best for me. I have a crossover with my Starkey aids. Not perfect but way better than having  the dead zone on one side. The app that lets you control them has lots of settings to fine tune what works best for the situation you are in. My experience with the Widex Moment has been so-so. I think I have some sort of hearing nerve damage which means the hearing aid is only amplifying distorted signals to my brain. With the hearing aid on my left ear, most sounds sounded like they came from a broken radio.", "Joining the group... Hi all - just wanted to post here, hoping to hear some stories from folks with similar experiences.\n\nAbout two months ago, I woke up with notable tinnitus, and saw my ENT as a result.  I had a notable reduction in hearing in my right ear; follow-up showed that the hearing improved somewhat over the course of a few weeks.  \n\nOver those two months, I experienced minor headaches/ear pressure, but no balance or dizziness.  I thought I getting better the last few days, but I just saw my ENT to review MRI results, which surprised her, in the fact that I have a 4.5mm acoustic neuroma.\n\nThe head issues I had been experiencing were never especially debilitating; but their presence was constant, and made me quite nervous of acoustic neuroma, or more notably, a worse condition.  \n\nThe diagnosis of the AN took me aback a bit, but I am a bit relieved to hear that I do not have glioblastoma or some truly terrible thing like that.  \n\nAnyways, hi! My story started in 2010; my wife and I were down at Disney World, walking through the Magic Kingdom when she suddenly smacked my arm. When I asked why, she looked at me. \"Did not you hear me?\" Well, no, to be honest.\n\nHad other real-life things going on through 2011, so finally went to an ENT. Testing indicated loss in one ear, so they strongly suggested I get an MRI and sure enough, I had an AN. It kept growing, so we went with GammaKnife (quicker recovery time) in 2014. Over the next few years my right side hearing deteriorated further, and sure enough the AN was still growing.\n\nSo in 2017 I had the surgery. They would warned me that I would lose all the hearing on the right side, but I shrugged and said I would not really miss what I did not have any more. I wear CROS hearing aids that help a great deal and so far everything looks good.\n\nThe funny thing was when I told my brother (who is a terrible hypochondriac) about the initial diagnosis, he got very nervous. \n\n\"So what caused it?\"\n\n\"THEY DO NOT KNOW.\"\n\n\"Is it hereditary?\"\n\n\"THEY DO NOT KNOW.\"\n\nWe are a very vicious family. No mercy. :) \ud83d\udc4b Welcome. I had a very similar experience to you. Mine is 3 mm x 4 mm. For the first week I was put on a high steroid dose to see if that would help the hearing loss. It did a tiny bit. \nOn the bright side, after my AN was discovered on MRI it has only grown 1 mm in 1 direction over a 5 year period. My hope is it will not ever grow again. The tinnitus has gotten easier to live with albeit annoying during really quiet times. But my brain has adjusted enough to not affect quality of life too much. I also got a hearing aid which helps a bit in certain situations (although my husband notices it more than I do). Best of luck to you, hopefully it does not grow!! Thanks!  I also got the steroids for a week following the initial test; there was a certain frequency range in the middle of the chart, where I was in the 40-50 decibel range in that ear (normal in the other).\n\nIn the two subsequent visits, I was more in the 25-30 decibel range, making me think the steroids did help in some capacity.\n\nAnd yet, here I am.  Crossing my fingers I follow your path! According to my ENT, around 60% do not grow after discovery.", "Waiting to see an ENT. Feeling really scared about the possibility of AN About two weeks ago, I woke up with pressure in my right ear along with ringing/tinnitus. I did not think too much about because it was just annoying. I figured it was allergies or something since everything is blooming right now. However, I tried taking all sorts of decongestants and allergy meds but nothing worked. I woke up yesterday with pretty bad pressure in my ear and the ringing has become more intense. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday, I went to the doctor regarding this and he had no idea what was going on, so he referred me to an ENT. There was no blockage, no noticeable fluid buildup, and no sign of an ear infection. They also did a hearing test which showed moderate hearing loss in my right ear. However, I am not sure how accurate that is because there was a fan in the room and the nurse was walking around, so it was super hard to concentrate. I also have not noticed any hearing difficulties with like conversations or listening to music. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo anyhow, now I am sitting here waiting hoping to see an ENT in the next couple of weeks and I am absolutely terrified that I have an acoustic neuroma. I know ANs are benign and relatively rare, but I am just filled with so much dread and hopelessness right now that I do not know how I am going to mentally get through these next couple of weeks. I am also a hypochondriac, which makes this whole journey even more hellish. I talked to a family friend who is a doctor about this and he mentioned that there really are not any malignant tumors that would cause my symptoms, just benign ones (I hope that is true!). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions for how I can try to cope while I wait to get seen by the ENT? What were your symptoms of AN? I realize that I might not have an AN, but the Internet has definitely made it seem like that is the most plausible scenario based on my symptoms. Also, what is the prognosis look like? I had an AN. This kind of sounds like my symptoms but I also had vertigo / confusion and very severe intermittent hearing loss. Like I would be completely deaf suddenly and my hearing would return gradually a week later.\n\nI also had pressure and tinnitus. The final time I lost my hearing it never really came back and that is when they scanned me.\n\nBrain surgery sucks but generally brain surgeons are really good at getting this one out. Especially if you go to someone who is dealt with multiple AN before. Did you gradually develop all of those different symptoms or did you kind of have them all at once? That must have been terrifying when you lost your hearing. The tumors that cause hearing issues like this are pretty much always benign, right? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt sounds like you have made a full recovery from AN. That is great to hear! I really wish I could just get scanned and see if that is what is going on. This wait is killing me.  I lost my hearing on and off for years but never really thought much of it.\n\nOn the final time it took ages to come back, and when it did it came back very muffled and with tinnitus. Around the same time I started to feel confused and dizzy , and this created severe anxiety that started to effect my life. That is when I went to the doctor.\n\nWhile waiting for my scan I noticed I lost the feeling in the right side of my face and that is when I just kind of conceded that I had something wrong with me.\n\nEventually I got scanned and confirmed. AN are pretty much always benign. Worst case you need brain surgery to get it out and although it does suck big time, the prognosis is generally good.\n\nMy life is significantly changed as a result of the two craniotomies I got. You come out a fairly different person. But I am alive and that is what matters. I had an AN removed this past summer. My symptoms started probably like a year or so earlier when I had a faint tinnitus in that ear. It was annoying but it was faint enough that I just chalked it up to being old or whatever. Then there were a couple times it got worse but it usually coincided with colds and I assumed it was fluid in my ears. Then over the Christmas 2018 holiday it got really bad and I noticed some hearing loss. I had a couple tries at fixing an ear infection but nothing was helping. Went to see an ENT who immediately sent me for an MRI and a 8 mm tumor was discovered.\n\nI had my surgery last July. Recovery was pretty rough with a lot of dizziness and loss of balance. Took me about 5 weeks to get back to work fully and that was working from home. It was like 6 or 7 until I felt comfortable driving. \n\nNow things feel pretty much back to normal. There are still some movements that feel a little off. My tinnitus is still there but not as bad as pre-surgery. My hearing has stayed at the same reduced level so far.\n\nOverall it was not AS bad as I thought it could be, but definitely not easy either. Prognosis is very case by case. Some people keep their hearing and have a relatively easy time regaining their balance and stuff. Others will lose their hearing in that ear and may have a harder time with the balance. Unfortunately it seems like they can only give very ballpark probabilities of how each patient will do based on tests before surgery, assuming you do surgery. Other options have other sets of outcomes. Mine is super small 3-4 mm. I have had it for almost 3 years and it has not grown. My treatment is \u201cwait and see\u201d. So if you have a small one it may never materialize. My ENT said that about 60% that are found never grow. That said, I still have tinnitus and moderate hearing loss that I have to live with. I will say, 2 years in that the brain adjusts remarkably to the tinnitus. It is much less noticeable now. Hearing is worse on the low frequencies and fine on the high ones. I have the option to get a hearing aid but it is not really bad enough for that. Maybe when I get older. I hope your wait is short! Did you have the radioscopic surgery? No, I had it surgically removed via the middle fossa approach.\n\nWhile radioscopic surgery did have its appeal due being \"easy\" compared to traditional surgery, the poorly defined risk of getting cancer near my brain stem from it or direct damage to my brain stem outweighed those benefits to me. I am only 44 though. If I was more advanced in age I might feel different.\n\nIf you have an AN and go with surgical removal, it is important to find a surgeon that does this surgery regularly to have to best outcome. Did you also have like ear pressure/fullness with yours? It sounds like you are handling it well and it is not too bad.\n\nThank you! I am going in on Monday... ENT wants me to see the audiologist first though so they can redo the audiogram and do a pressure test. Is that fairly normal? Are there a lot of surgeons who regularly remove ANs? I ask because it seems like an exceedingly rare condition. Well, regularly is relative in this case. The surgical team (otolaryngologist and neurosurgeon) that operated on me are pretty well regarded and said they do generally 2-3 per month. A surgeon serving a smaller population that does not get referrals from out of town might only be doing a few a year. I did have fullness at first but it went away for me. I hope it does for you.  Yes normal to redo pressure test...my ENT also put me on steroids for a week before my second hearing test to reduce any potential inflammation. It seemed to help a bit but it is hard to say for sure as the audiograms are not perfect. Good luck. Interesting. My doc immediately recommended radioscopic over invasive surgery if my AN grows. I am 43. I will have to ask him about the risks. Do you have any articles I could cite? Thank you. I really appreciate it. This weekend will be rough with my anxiety but I hope Monday brings somewhat good news Well finally getting to see the ENT now! Wish me luck", "What led to your AN diagnosis? I am 9 days into sudden onset tinnitus. It has a \"low hum\" to it. Voices also have a robotic quality to them in that ear. I do not want to jump the gun, but I am curious what your tinnitus sounded like or what caused you to get checked out. Thanks. I lost my hearing steadily for like 6 years. I would always bring it up that I could not hear. They flushed my ears multiple times and said I was fine. 8 years ago I was in a dirt bike accident. Wrecked my face and knocked myself silly. I went to the ENT doc about my nose, and told him about my hearing loss. He set me up with a hearing test and by this time I had lost 90% of my hearing. Ordered an MRI and found my AN. It was big. I Thought for sure since I was young they would watch and wait. As soon as I saw the specialist they wanted to do surgery immediately. I waited 6 months, and then was AN free. Just got my first follow up MRI (6 months ago)and it was clear. I lost my hearing at 24, and had surgery when I was 30. I had tinnitus for years before, sometimes it sounded like crickets, and the hum a lot like when you stand next to the big power lines. When anyone would talk it was like they were a robot or sounded like they were underwater. Definitely get it checked out by a doc. Probably an Ear nose and throat doc. I saw an ENT two days ago. Doing a round of prednisone first to see if there is any improvement which I doubt there will be. Did your tinnitus continue after surgery?   Yes. Sometimes it gets really annoying, other times it is not too bad. Benzodiazepines can help, but I chose not to go that route. Well, we will see what happens over the next few weeks. My best guess is simple NIHL, Meniere's, or AN. Intermittent hearing loss for years. I would wake up one day and I would be deaf, then it would come back a week later. One time when it came back it was weaker than before and I had tinnitus, so I went to the doctor.\n\nShe looked at me like I was crazy for not asking about this before, asked if I also had dizziness problems. I did. She immediately scheduled the mri. \n\nI also lost the feeling on the right side of my face while waiting for the mri appointment. That is when I knew something was truly fucked up. Thanks for responding. All my issues came on pretty suddenly and I have not had vertigo......yet. I do not know if symptoms from AN can happen suddenly or if they are gradual like yours. Was your tinnitus high-pitched? My symptoms happened very suddenly, all in one second, hearing cut out, ear felt plugged up, tinnitus started. I thought it was an earwax blockage. When the doctor looked in to see no wax at all, I was scheduled for an MRI. If this prednisone does not help, I hope an MRI is the next step. Does not hurt to have an MRI regardless. I had a second episode of sudden hearing loss after diagnosis, took prednisone, and got back much from that loss.  So, prednisone success does not rule out AN. But keep in mind ANs are not in of themselves emergencies. I was diagnosed 13 months ago and had no growth this past year. Okay. I see that they are not malignant, so that is good. At this point I am not really sure what I hope it is. All possible causes have downsides. Tinnitus was first. Right after I went to the hair salon. I thought it may have been the hair dryer being loud, but the tinnitus never went away. 3 weeks later I picked up the phone at work and put it on my left ear for some reason (I rarely do this). I could not understand what the person was saying. It was really muffled! I thought the line was bad. So I put it on my right ear and the person sounded fine. That is when I called the doctor. Had to get a referral to an ENT and an MRI to figure out that it was AN. It started in high school for me. I would always get this weird feeling on the side of my head, accompanied by this weird popping that I cannot really describe. I went to a doc and got a CAT scan and it did not show anything weird, so I always thought that was just something that I had to deal with. Years later, I went to another doctor after I started getting what I could only describe as head rushes, followed occasionally by convulsions. Then the tinnitus started and I went to another doctor who eventually ordered a MRI with contrast that discovered my 4cm AN. Did you have it treated? Wow. What was done? Surgery? I ended up having 4 different surgeries. Two scheduled, and two emergency from csf leaks. Shit sucked real bad, but I am 95% back to normal now, except for the deafness which I am used to now. Slight facial paralysis and complete deafness on my left side. Doctor says my face probably will not be back to 100%,  but I disagree because I still feel muscles that feel like they are waking up on my face. This was about 4 years ago or so. My story is an extreme one, I am not trying to freak you out. Go to the doctor and ask for an MRI with contrast to rule it out. Will do! Thank you. I also took prednisone for a week and it did nothing. I am now in the watch and wait phase (has not grown for 5 years and is small). Still have tinnitus and hearing loss. Why will not they treat it? Too risky? Expensive?  Mine is 3-4 mm wide and has not grown much in 5 years. If I tried surgery my hearing could get worse. I am better off leaving it! According to my ENT, 60% of ANs do not grow after being found. Hoping that is my situation. Leaving it is an option? Did you lose any hair during the surgery? I am a bald guy so no Oh yes. Lots of people do this and just get an MRI yearly to ensure there is no growth. If there is growth you cannot leave it. Always having hearing issues in left ear and then visual changes along with headaches Have you ever been checked for Chiari Malformation? I found out last week that this is what has been causing my headaches and tinnitus. I had surgery done on July 29th to remove my acoustic neuroma. I have not heard of Chiari malformation though. So what are they doing to treat you is it surgery ? Just meds and monitoringfor now. Not currently a candidate for surgery. If the condition progresses surgery will be an option.", "Has Anybody received Disability/social security in US after a AN surgery? The title says it all. Taking everything into consideration. Thank you! I was wondering this too. I cannot do my job with one good ear, but from what I have read as long as you have one functional ear social security will not pay.", "1.5 years later, painful ear I had translab on left and a repaired CSF leak that closed the ear canal.  That side is now swollen and super painful.  Anyone else with this?", "Might have this I went for a hearing check today. I have had tinnitus for years and was getting tired of it. I have been exposed to gunfire for years.  My left ear was significantly worse than my right. Although I told the doctor I have had gunfire more on my left than right side, she thinks it is a tumor. Waiting on a MRI next week. Surgery out of pocket if so is going to be 17k at least. Scary days ahead. Sorry for all who have been through this! Doctor said google it when I wanted to know more. Now I see I will be deaf in one ear and good chance of face droop. Not necessarily, everything depends on size and where exactly it is. Hello\u2014sorry to hear of your troubles.  You can find out about my experience thorough my comments.  I am now three weeks post surgery (medial fossa).  If your results end up positive (hopefully they do not), we could set up a time to chat, or DM me.  Overall, my surgery went very well. Is gamma knife a option for you? Feel free to share the results when you get them.  Not much can be determined until then.  Kind of odd your doc would immediately assume a tumor without other tests being done. I agree I am considering getting a second opinion as I have no symptoms but Hearing loss and I know where that came from.  And I have had it for 20 years My mom had a 3.1 Cm AN. She does have deafness in one ear, but thanks to her incredibly talented surgeons she does not have any facial paralysis. Supposedly she had some temporary paralysis for like 72 hours after surgery, but it was nothing that me, my sister or my dad could notice. It was incredible, actually. I would not jump to AN with that history. Did you get a MRI?", "18 yr old with acoustic neuroma Hi I found out about my AN a few months ago and will be getting surgery soon as advised by my doctor. I was wondering if someone could give a detailed explanation of what recovery is like? How painful was the first day and how bad is it overall? First off, I am sorry you are going through this. I had my surgery done this past July. I had a different approach (retrosigmoid). But my recovery was brutal. The first night after surgery my pain was very intense. I do not want to scare you and everyone is surgery goes differently. I was very dizzy after surgery. I could not even open my eyes for a few days because of it. You will be put on IV painkillers and likely oral too. The first night was the worse pain wise, after that it did get better. Do you have someone that can take care of you at home while you rest? You will not be able to do much for yourself the first few weeks so having that person there is crucial. Im a few months post op and I will say that the physical part of recovery comes with time. The emotional recovery is a different story. I have found myself in therapy now learning to cope with it all. You are going to feel so much better once that thing is out of your head. You will not even believe how much it was affecting you and you probably did not know. \n\nYour doctors will likely recommend vestibular therapy to help with your balance which I highly recommend too. Not sure how your hearing is now in that ear. But I am sure they talked to you about that too and the potential for hearing loss. PM any questions seriously. \n\nThere is an organization called acoustic neuroma association that has a lot of information. \n\nHere is a link:\n\n\nHeres a link to their zoom format support groups you can join for free: \n I had the mid fossa approach and my recovery was not as traumatic as that other response (not saying they were exaggerating or anything, just to be clear). My worse pain was when I first woke up. I started vomiting and dry heaving and my already high BP spiked to like 190/120. I thought my head was going to explode. After that the pain was kept pretty tolerable.\n\nI did not have any major problems with dizziness, although I did have to close my eyes \na few times on the drive home. Balance was a different story. It took me a couple weeks until I felt comfortable walking without something to hold onto. The PT at the hospital recommended vestibular therapy but I just did the exercises they gave me at the hospital and feel like I progresses pretty well.\n\nIt took me close to 4 weeks until I was ready to work, even from home. There was a certain fogginess to my thinking and mild headaches that came from concentrating too hard. It was probably about 6 weeks until I felt totally comfortable driving. By about 6 months post surgery I felt like 99% normal. \n\nNow about 2 years post surgery I feel completely normal. I was fortunate that my hearing remained after surgery, though at the same diminished capacity as before. I did not have any facial nerve issues. I did have a weird feeling at the tip of my tongue for a while but that went away. Overall, it was not something I would not choose to do, but compared to my mom going through chemo, it was a walk in the park. I think I was fairly lucky on how things turned out and obviously some people have a much harder time. Thank you so much for responding I really appreciate it! This was really helpful and makes me feel much better about getting the surgery. This was exactly what I wanted to hear thank you so much. I already feel much better having a general idea of what to expect. PLEASE do your research and do NOT be afraid to travel for the best care that you can find. Many insurances will actually help to cover travel and lodging costs too - ours covered like $6000-some of it.\n\nThere are many instances in which you do not need the \u201cFerrari\u201d of doctors, if you will. For example, many surgeons can successfully remove your appendix, your gallbladder or even do a knee reconstruction... This, however, is your brain and you want to ensure you give it your best fighting chance as it is no joke. \n\nMy mom just went through this a few months back and I was *heavily* involved in her care/treatment plans, along with my dad. \n\nFeel free to message me if you like, I can give you more personalized information and even recommendations on who and what to look into based upon my mom\u2019s extremely successful treatment.", "Is AN possible without hearing loss? Hello! I have been dealing with tinnitus since November 2019. I thought in both ears, but now I cannot tell because my right ear is so loud I do not know if the left is ringing or not.\n\nI just had a hearing test this morning, I was told my hearing is \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cnormal\u201d,  I could not pull much more information/detail from them. So, anyway, my hearing seems to be okay.\n\nI requested an MRI when they started to tell me about CBT for tinnitus... I am not saying I am against it, but I am just looking to find out what is causing this. He agreed to order an MRI but mentioned that I do not have hearing loss a variety of times so insurance my deny it (the outer office, without my asking said my particular insurance should approve the MRI easily)...\n\nMy question is, has anyone ever had AN without hearing loss?\n\nOther symptoms I experience: migraines (right side), \u201cblacking out\u201d when standing from sitting, facial twitching, I had a period in 2017 of about 8 months where my right ear would seem to \u201cclose up\u201d and I could not hear out of it for hours daily, which at the time I attributed to Lyme disease, brief moments of vertigo, chronically fatigued...\n\nI would just love to hear any experiences you can share. Thank you! I mean it is possible that you have a AN. You could have one and not have hearing loss if it is not pushing on the nerve much. But I do not know how likely it is. Especially since your symptoms can be attributed to other things. I do not want to invalidate your symptoms/concerns/worry but I think it would be a good idea to try and be open minded to other causes and try to cancel other things out. However, if it would make you feel better/reassured or you are pretty positive you have a AN then a MRI would not hurt. I cannot think of any downsides. You are doctor might be able to help you with insurance if you talk to them about it. \n\nJust a warning: tinnitus is really hard to determine the why/cause. I really, really hope you can figure it out but it is something to be aware of. \n\nAre you seeing a ENT or general care? Have you seen a cardiologist (for blacking out), reproductive health (for period), general or migraine specialist, or vestibular therapist? You might want to get your blood tested because blacking out can mean a iron deficiency or high blood pressure I think? I cannot quite remember if it is high or low blood pressure but I am pretty sure about iron deficiency. Your symptoms are not necessarily all caused by one thing so it would be a good idea to look into your biggest symptoms individually too. Or at least that is my experience. \n\nThe other thing that might help is to create a symptom journal where when a symptom happens you write down the date but also what is going on. Like what you are doing, if you are moving or not, ate recently, pain, time of day, slept recently/amount of sleep, stress level, or whatever else you think could be a contributing factor. It can help doctors but also help you see any patterns. It can be especially helpful for migraine since they often have a trigger(s). And it can tell you other things like do you get the twitching when stressed (I have something similar that is all stress), does vertigo happen when you are moving or still, what are you doing when blackouts occur, etc. It is also helpful because you can give numbers to your doctor instead of guessing which can make them take you more seriously. \n\nI know that it is very concerning and even scary when your body is not working right. And just *hard* in general. Especially when you do not know why or how to make it better. I am really sorry that you are going through that :(. Hopefully you get answers quickly and it is easily treatable!! Sorry to hear of your issues. I would certainly push for the MRI having been in a similar situation myself. Of course I am not saying that you have an AN and I hope you do not but it is worth ruling it out. I do have a small acoustic neuroma. I had a feeling that I could not hear as well out of that ear but a hearing test, and subsequent ones, have shown near perfect hearing in both ears. I have only had pure tone hearing tests and have a feeling that word recognition type tests would show my hearing to be worse in that ear. \n\nTo re-iterate, chances are it is something else as AN is rare but I think your symptoms are good ground to have the MRI I am so sorry you have an AN, but happy you found it while it is small!\n\nI am definitely going for the MRI just to rule it out. I did not even know about AN until recently, my mom saw a distant relative post on Facebook about her constant tinnitus being caused by AN and mentioned it to me. My tinnitus came on very suddenly, out of nowhere on November 20, 2019 and it has not stopped since... (I have accepted it never will), but I feel I may as well investigate in any way that I can!\n\nI pray everything goes well for you, I know this diagnosis must be really hard to take in! Thank you! \n\nI have been to a bunch of specialists, actually!  I have accepted that I will probably never know why I have tinnitus and also that I will be living with it for the rest of my life... sometimes that pisses me off, but most of the time I just accept it as a what it is...\n\nI am not particularly nervous or worried that it is AN, but I requested the MRI to rule it out.\n\nI do know the blacking out can be from low blood pressure, which I have had in the past... my facial twitching is unrelated to stress. Although I had eye twitching which was stress induced years ago so I understand it can be a factor.\n\nI was bit by a tick with Lyme in 2016 and did not realize I had to worry until my body started freaking out. So I do think this is more than likely related to that, every test I have for the most part says I am fine, which I know is great, but it is also maddening! The whole lyme thing is controversial for many and I understand why, it seems crazy, and I am sure there are some people out there who are actually crazy and claiming Lyme, but there is also normal, fairly sane (ha) people like me going insane from strange ailments with no known cause... \n\nThanks again for responding! :) I am sorry you are having to deal with loud tinnitus. In my case, I still had 100% hearing in both ears with a small AN that we had been monitoring and had just started to grow again. So, yes it is possible. I am a fan of getting the MRI, especially if your insurance will approve it. Could be many different things but better to know if you can. Good luck. I hope you get your MRI soon and that nothing is found and you can put your mind at ease. For my part it has taken a long time to sink in but I am coming to terms with it. I would definitely rather know and I am lucky that it is small. My tinnitus did also come on suddenly, fortunately it is very mild and a lot of the time I do not even notice. Again though I think there is a lot of reasons for tinnitus, a lot of which are not even understood, so I would work from the premise that you do not have an AN until shown otherwise. I never had tinnitis, but I always felt like I had vertigo and my hearing loss was very gradual where my PCP never picked up on it, like over several years. I was not sent to get an MRI until my headaches got so bad that a neurologist had requested I have one to \"rule things out\". Turns out it was the AN that was behind all of my issues and within two weeks I am on the operating table.", "Some reassurance maybe? I feel like I am jumping the gun, but today has just been hard. Just hoping for a little reassurance, maybe one of you has had a similar experience and can commiserate with me?\n\nI (38f) found out about my vestibular schwannoma (VS) about a month and a half ago. I would been having increasing difficulty hearing and with my balance for about 4 years I think? The last 9 months getting especially bad. I had mentioned my symptoms to different medical and dental professionals throughout the years...but I guess I never talked to one who put two and two together. I finally saw an ENT who knew exactly what it was and sent me in the right direction. \n\nMy VS had started of course on the vestibular nerve, had invaded my facial nerve severely, modeled my ear canal, and grown up into my brainstem and right hemisphere. It was cystic so had grown relatively quickly. (\n\nI met with the Otolaryngologist and Neurosurgeon within the month and just had my surgery Monday. \n\nThey removed my vestibular nerve entirely (I was like 95% deaf by the time we realized what it was) and had to leave a rind of tumor on my facial nerve to avoid any real damage. They were able to remove the large tumor from my brainstem/hemisphere entirely. Luckily it had not adhered at all and \"onion peeled\" away from my dura and brainstem. They did an abdominal fat graft to fill the void. \n\nI had a lot of pain from the surgical halo the first few days (it was honestly worse than the surgical site itself). But now my balance is just...fucked. I know I need to find vestibular therapy. But wow...I have never had vertigo or carsickness before. And damn...\n\nI am on prophylactic antibiotics and steroids. I have been able to manage without taking any opiates since before I left the hospital (Tylenol and ice FTW). But wow do the medications mess with the way my stomach feels. \n\nI guess I am just venting at this point. I am exhausted. I feel sick. I cannot walk around my own house without a walker to catch my balance. Looking at my phone and TV becomes torture after a while (gives me vertigo and makes me feel sick). I cannot play video games (vertigo). I cannot read (vertigo and headaches). So I am just feeling kind of done with it right now lol. I know it is only been a week since I was knocked out...but damn...at least I can watch my fish tanks?", "Title Hello, my mom was diagnosed with bilateral AN and they have just recently grown to 1.1 and 1.3. We have a friend that had Acoustic Neuroma removal when hers was 1.3. My family is very close, and it pains me that my mother may be deaf at the end of the year. Is there any hope that she may have hearing after the surgery? Sucks to say this but I think deafness is probably more likely than not.  I just had one removed in July and from what I was told/researched, there is only one surgical option that gives a chance of retaining hearing.  Unfortunately that is even iffy.  I had the particular procedure, retrosigmoid craniotomy, and ENT told me he thought I had a 80% chance of keeping my hearing (neurosurgeon told me 50%) and I ended up losing my hearing.  Gamma knife was not an option for me so, I could be wrong about this because I stopped looking into it awhile back, but I think even that route guarantees loss also. That is what I was hearing as well, there is one procedure that I have heard my mom talk about, a \u201cbrain stem implant\u201d or something like that, but I researched it and it can pick out sounds, not words. Thank you I am sure there are more considerations in play with a bilateral that I have no knowledge but I would think that if they are able to keep the nerves intact, then she would be a candidate for cochlear implants perhaps?  If I remember correctly, they are only recommended for loss on both sides but in my case for instance, my docs said that since the nerve was left intact (it still frustrates them that I lost mine because all their machines showed no change) I would be a candidate for them if I ever went deaf in my \u201cgood\u201d ear. I was just diagnosed.  Mine is 1.7mm by 3mm and I am getting radiation not surgery.  My team said for a tumor this small they do not recommend surgery because of hearing damage (I still have relatively good hearing).  Radiation has only a 25% chance of damaging your existing hearing.  I am getting ( \n\nMaybe get a second opinion? Do you mean cm? I am surprised they are doing anything at 1.7mm! Evidently it is already affected my brain lol!  1.7CM ... the remaining measurements are mm! Bilateral? Is that NF2? Or just incredibly unlucky? Hi, When was your mom diagnosed? \n\n1) Has she had a second opinion yet?\n\nYou can get a FREE consultation from House Clinic in Los Angeles. They are among the top three places in the US for treatment of acoustic neuromas. Just Google them and call them up. They are really nice and will tell you exactly what to send them from the doc.\n\n2) Join the discussion forum on the Acoustic Neuroma Association website. It is free to join and you can post questions and get support and feedback, and their website has tons of very helpful info--anything you need to know about ANs\n\nI was diagnosed this past May with a small AN (7mmx4mm) and am in \"watch and wait\" for the time being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBest of luck to your mom. I know it is a scary thing. So it is like a long thin kind of shape. Have not seen one like that before! Sorry for all the questions but her 1.1 mm  is the one that causes her pain and hearing loss as the 1.3 mm has not affected her yet. If she would have surgery to remove them, would it be an option to only have the 1.1 removed? She was diagnosed in Athens summer of last year, she has not even seen her specialist yet. I do not have his name but it is out of Cleveland Clinic. Only person she has seen for hers is an ENT. Thank you! It is hereditary, i have had my hearing checked because of them being hereditary but no signs in me yet. I wish her and you the best. :-)", "Upcoming Translabyrinthine Surgery Hello all,\n\nI am scheduled for a translabyrinthine approach to remove a 1.8cm x 1.8cm tumor next month. Any tips to hit me with?\n\nSo far I have purchased a wedge pillow for recovery, a shower stool, an audible subscription, and I removed the arm from one of my spare glasses frames. \n\nI have some residual hearing in my affected ear, so I am guessing that I will have issues with balance and walking when that bit of hearing is gone. My face is pretty numb on the same side as well, which gives me concern for facial paralysis after surgery. \n\nIf anyone wants to share their story, I would love to hear it. I am worried about recovering, especially with two young kids. It is been hard to even talk about - people hear the term \u201cbrain tumor\u201d and it is usually a conversation killer. \n\nI think my kids will be ok with the scar, and I am prepping them for how I will need them to be gentle and quiet when I come home, but I do not know what to expect for myself. Will I be able to shower myself? Use the bathroom? Navigate steps? Is it hard to keep the surgery site clean? I have a lot of hair, I am debating chopping it short ahead of surgery. This is all so surreal, and I have no similar experiences to draw from in trying to deal with everything. How old are you?   Why did you decide on surgery over radiation?  I am 36. The risk of radiation turning the tumor from benign to malignant is the main reason I opted for surgery. I have two neurosurgeons, one was stronger in his opinion but both recommended surgery. \n\nThere is also a risk of scarring from radiation that could make future surgeries more difficult, although that risk seems pretty minimal. Thought you might be that young with the little ones.  I had radiation 8 years ago, but I am older.  \n\nWish you all the best with your surgery!  The Acoustic Neuroma Association has a helpful online forum, if you have not found that already. Thank you for your reply and the info about the ANA. I have not looked at that forum yet, but I will go check it out soon. Great!  You should get several responses to your questions there. I had it done in 2017. Every experience is different, but I had a top ENT and neurologist and they did a fantastic job. My first morning in the ICU, the nurse asked if I wanted to get out of bed and sit in the chair. When I told her yes, she replied, \u201cOh, good. Doctor R hates seeing his patients just lying in bed.\u201d :)\n\nI did a lot of running prior to the procedure, and I was determined to get back on my feet as soon as I could. Once I got out of the ICU, I started walking around the floor a few times a day, holding my IV stand with one hand and my wife or a nurse on the other. I did not have any real balance issues. I did make the mistake of demanding my wife take a picture of me so I could see what I looked like. It was not pretty. Thank god hair grows back!\n\nI think the important thing is to be patient with yourself. This is a scary deal, and it will take time to come to terms with it emotionally, both yourself and your family. It took me about six-eight months, and my wife will tell you I was very touchy.  If your surgery goes as well as mine, you should be able to do everything, just more carefully at first. \n\nYeah, I still have some balance issues, but nothing I cannot handle. FWIW, I was resuming 5K runs after seven months. \n\nThe one thing I would strongly recommend is that you look into CROS hearing aids. I have got a pair by Phonak and while it is not a perfect solution, they are a big help. Basically, the aid in my right ear transmits sounds over to the one in my left ear. Mind you, I go through a lot of batteries!\n\nOne other word of advice-I tend to sleep on my side \u201cbad ear up\u201d, so my wife knows I might miss stuff like text messages, phone calls, and...ahem...smoke detectors chirping \u201clow battery\u201d alerts. She makes sure I become aware of them. It is good that you are preparing. In my case I was overprepared, and had an easy recovery. My ear surgeon calls the AN more of an ear tumor than a brain tumor, so put people (and yourself) at ease by calling it an ear tumor. Take this journey one step as a time and do not run ahead. For example, do not even consider hearing aids for a year. After a year of unassisted monohearing, I decided hearing aids were not for me and monohearing was not a big deal.   \n\n\nP.S. Watch actor Mark Ruffalo's AN video interview.   \nP.P.S. 10% of patients need a repeat surgery because the tumor unexpectedly grows back quickly. Get your follow up MRI in 6-9 months, while the possibly rebounding tumor is still small enough for radiation. Thank you for your response. That is a good point about ear tumor vs brain tumor. In my particular case, the tumor is deeper into my brain stem than normal. My ENT initially told me that I would not be a candidate for translabyrinthine surgery, but my surgeons disagreed. \n\nIt is also a different shape. They are usually ice cream cone shaped, with the cone growing into the ear canal and the scoop part growing out. Mine looks like a curvy backwards S. It is also pressing on my brain so much! I was shocked to see that, considering it has not caused any irritation or headaches at all. \n\nI am planning to take it slow with recovery, although I know I will want to be able to run around with my kids again ASAP. \n\nDid you have radiation or surgery? Thank you for giving me such a clear picture of your recovery. I hope I am able to be active quickly as well. I had an emergency c-section a few years ago, and I was walking around that same day. My recovery from that was super fast and painless, but I do not want to be too hopeful for repeat good luck. \n\nI am fortunate to be able to have a lot of down time to rest at home - I am off work for a full eight weeks and my kids are in daycare. I do not love daycare (or surgery/hospitalization) in the midst of this pandemic, but it is what it is. \n\nI love scars on people, but this is a really big scar in a hard-to-hide place. I do not really enjoy discussing my tumor, surgery, potential outcomes, etc with people, and I know that such a big scar is going to get a lot of attention. I have some thick headbands and beanies, so I guess that will be part of my spring and summer wardrobe. \n\nMy ENT told me about those hearing aids, although he also seemed pretty dismissive of them. I have heard nothing but good things though. Have there been any drawbacks for you?\n\nI also sleep bad-ear-up! I have read the same thing for a few people, oddly enough. The one upside has been that the pets and kids cannot wake me up during the night now! Although if I am ever home without my husband, not being able to hear the kids will be a concern. The hearing aids are not perfect\u2014if there is a lot of background noise, things kind of get lost initially. But when I first heard about them\u2014and this was before my surgery, when the neuroma had taken out most of the hearing in my right ear\u2014the hearing specialist I was seeing offered me a trial pair for a week to see if they would work. When I brought them back, I told him it was under protest!\n\nI had a coworker at the time who was very nice but spoke very softly, and I could never make out what she was saying. With the CROS aids things were much better. \n\nAgain, they are not perfect. I was having dinner with a group of friends and most of the conversation was taking place at the other end of the table. Afterwards, my wife asked what I would been so angry about\u2014I said \u201chuh?\u201d And she said everyone had wondered why I would been so quiet! \u201cIt is because I could not hear a damn thing you were saying!\u201d\n\nA good sense of humor is a big help...and hardest of all for me at least, a bit of humility. I have had to suck up my pride and tell people I am hard of hearing when I miss stuff.\n\nI think you will be fine. Be sure to let us know how it goes. And if you want, feel free to message me. You do not necessarily have to have a big scar. I do not know if I just got lucky, but the neurosurgeon that did the actual tumor removal also closed me up. He used internal stitches and then glue on the outside.\n\nHere is me a couple days after the surgery:\n\n \n\nHere is me like a year later:\n\n \n\n(the first one was in selfie mode or whatever. Both pictures are the same side - pinky promise) &gt;I had surgery for a jumbo AN in 2019. A year later the MRI revealed the AN grew back beyond the size where radiation was an option, so I needed a repeat surgery, which was followed up with radiation two months later. Radiation  (*LINAC*) was easy and well tolerated.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Naturally I was more freaked out for the first surgery than the repeat. The second time around I knew what I was getting myself into. Hi there, I understand all of your concerns but can honestly say you can relax and you will be fine. I had a 5.5cm AN removed a little over 5 months ago (translab, August 2020) and I initially feared this was a death sentence. It is not. It seems you are well prepared and you have probably read all there is to read. The ANA group is a fantastic resource.\n\nFor the surgery you are asleep ( mine was 11.5 hours); ICU sucks (especially during COVID); but by the time you are discharged you will be a functioning parent to your kids. I remember that I was worried that I would lose cognitive function from surgery and my doctor confidently said, \"oh, I will not be on that part of the brain\". From then on, I knew I would be ok. I did lose hearing in my left ear (it was already bad), but I will gladly take that any day of the week. Not hearing out of one ear actually makes for a peaceful sleep.\n\nMy scar is now indistinguishable and the whole experience seems surreal. I am 90% back to normal, back to work, exercise, and parenting. I do have some balance issues but PT helped with that.\n\nBottom line: be positive, you got this! You are an AN Warrior.\n\nPT I hope you did not chop your hair off. I have a lot and just braided it up the morning of the surgery. They only shaved a little and you cannot see my scars now. Even if I try to show you.   Just braid it so it does not hurt to sleep on it for a week.

What would you guess my chances of having an AN are? - Sudden hearing loss in January of this year\n\n- Regained it, not really sure if it was sudden or gradual but it came back\n\n- Also gained consistent tinnitus in this same ear\n\n- Tested at ENT, cannot hear high pitched sounds\n\nNo dizziness, no vertigo, no other symptoms to speak of really. Just this odd bout of hearing loss, consistent tinnitus, and deaf to high pitched noises. \n\nHad an MRI but since its New Years I have to wait until Monday probably. I also have an auditory brainstem response, or ABR, next week.\n\nAnyone have any suggestions on what to expect? Hard to say, could be all kinds of stuff. This basically happened to me last year and I do have an AN. I would not stress yourself too much about it. Just listen to what the drs tell you and deal with it then. It is very scary getting an mri and waiting for results. But you have to live your life. Medical advice from strangers on the internet may not be the most calming for you. Just find things to occupy time between now and then I had something very similar to this a few years ago.  Sudden hearing loss in one ear.  Went to ENT and also had hearing tested- could not hear high noises.  ENT said likely inflammation of nerve in inner ear.  It was miserable.  I had to take a high dose to steroids, which were terrible but once I finished the course I was fine.", "Anybody treated with laser ablation surgery? I just found out about this- it sounds like it is not a widespread treatment option currently, but it is FDA approved. very curious to know more about this one What is this? Where can I find out more details? Will it work for large tumors? I just found out about it yesterday... I am looking into it as well as I can now. I talked to my current prospective surgeon at mayo today. She said it is not an option for acoustic neuroma. I am getting opinions from two other places that I know do laser ablation surgery on brain tumors, so we will see what they say. I talked to head of neurosurgery at the University of Minnesota. He said he could do something like this if my tumor was much smaller.", "Is a head CT without contrast sufficient to exclude or diagnose acoustic neuroma?  I would not think so, otherwise that would be the standard protocol. Mri w and w/o is what i was prescribed.  Ct cannot see through the bone. Calcium lights up. You can totally do a CT scan of someone is brain, but CT scans are not quite as clear for looking at soft tissues. When time is of the essence for like a possible stroke or head injury, they are good enough but if have the time an MRI is better. A CT scan also exposed one to a lot of radiation that the MRI avoids all together.\n\nAll that said, I have not heard of anybody having a CT scan to diagnose an AN but I suppose it is not impossible. What about if it is also a CT (without contrast) of the IAC? My doctor said it is because CTs without contrast vs with are less expensive and more likely to be approved by the insurance, but I do not want to do it or have to do another type of imaging unless it is actually going to be useful. Since the MRI gives the best result, that is what I would want to have. I would ask your doctor to order the MRI and then get pre-approval from your insurance before actually getting it. Chances are they will require it be pre-approved anyway. If they do not cover it, then maybe consider the CT.", "My surgery on July 29. And all the details Wow where do I even start. First off lef me start off by saying I always had ear issues. My left ear was always clogged I always had to go get it looked at. It was something I dealt with. I found out I was pregnant may 2021. And started getting pregnancy symptoms (or so I thought) I got really bad headaches. Weird visual changes. And honestly terrible neck pain. Again thought it was pregnancy. Finally saw an optometrist who referred me to a specialist then referred me to get an mri which forever changed my life. Even when I was doing the mri I was like I am sure this is nothing terrible probably pregnancy. Well the next day I got that horrible phone call that it is a AN and surgery is likely going to be done. Of course I am terrified for myself but also my future child. I always wanted to be a mom. I end up in the ER bc the symptoms got worse and eventually had surgery done on July 29th. Everything happened so fast that I did not even have time to comprehend everything. I am healing now and I am thankful everyday that I am here and caught this thing fast. Listen to your body. You know when something does not feel right. So glad to hear you got through it safe and sound. I was diagnosed in February with an AN. Hearing loss, tinnitus and dizziness are my main symptoms. They are recommending gamma knife for treatment but they wanted to wait a bit and get a second MRI in September before making a call. I am still not sure if I should go with Gamma or surgery to be honest. I feel like gamma is less invasive but I worry about side effects.\n\nHow was the surgery experience if you do not mind me asking? Did you lose all of your hearing in the affected ear? How is your recovery going? And thanks for sharing your experience. The recovery is shockingly fast. It is amazing how quickly your brain and body are able to reconconstruct. The day after surgery I was in pain and could not open my eyes, had double vision lots of dizziness. Keep in mind I am pregnant so that cannot give me the extra strong pain meds they typically give. I still have to have radiation done after I give birth since they left a bit of the tumor on my nerve. My hearing is not anymore affected on that side even though the doctors told me I would likely have no hearing so that was a huge surprise for me. How big is your tumor that they are watching it? Any symptoms at all? May I ask what side effects your concerned about with GK?  Even after my GK failed, I would still do it as a first option  again, given the chance. \n\nIF your GK were to fail, which statistically is unlikely, you can opt for surgery, but if you do surgery first you cannot turn back. \n\nMy post op side effects of surgery are much worse than GK.  Gk did not effect my life at. All.  Surgery has left me with life long changes that sometimes effect my day to day. \n\nI know all decisions are personal, and I have been in this community for almost 13 years and I still cannot understand why someone would choose surgery over GK, given the choice. I am in Canada, our healthcare is not the fastest haha. \"10 x 6 mm\" is what they wrote in the first MRI report. They basically said no to the gamma based on its size and to wait until September for another MRI. I feel annoyed since if I keep waiting for treatment, I could be losing more hearing over time. I am at about 70-75% (25% hearing loss) in my affected ear, so it is not too bad yet, but I do not want it to get worse. Also, I am nervous about it affecting my balance more. I get consistent dizzy spells after I stand up too quickly. my vision goes dark and I feel faint. It lasts for only a moment, but it is not fun.   \n\n\nI have had no facial tingling or numbness, so I am hopeful that I will not lose any facial movement, but I know the surgery could cause that as well. Do you have any lingering side effects post-surgery? I know it is probably not valid at all, but I have read about some people worrying about possible radiation or even scar tissue complications caused by the gamma treatment in the long term? I really should not be google searching this stuff haha. Honestly, its my number one choice for treatment given how serious the surgery is and the side effects from that. I think that is the direction we are going to go, but I am not sure why they are making me wait longer before moving forward? I live in Canada and our healthcare is notoriously slow. I just want this thing out of my head ASAP. Wow I am actually surprised they have not scheduled surgery yet..  especially since you are having some severe symptoms. I did not loose any facial movements and you would not know by looking at me that I had it done. From the doctors I have talked to, they do not mess with the facial nerve much. My GK surgeon told me that because my body created the tumor on my own, the likelihood of my body producing another tumor is higher. It had nothing to do with the radiation. \n\nThere are a lot of AN patients in the watch and wait category.  Waiting to see if it is growing before processing with treatment.  I am in the US so no experience with your healthcare system, as mine moved rather quickly, but I had a little help.on my side (my BFs brother at the time of my GK was working with the surgeon that performed it, so we got in quickly) \n\nI understand your want to get it out asap, bit do not rush a decisions if you do not have too", "Radiation vs surgery I have an acoustic neuroma/vestibular schawnoma, am 42 and have lost a fair amount of hearing in that ear. My ENT recommended AN specialists in San Diego (they do seem to be some of the best)so I had a consult today. They said it is my choice but they are leaning towards surgery. My tumor is 6-7mm. Reasoning is, I have already lost some hearing and I am young-ish. Radiation has \"unknown circumstances\".\n\nAm I crazy thinking they are leaning towards surgery because they are surgeons? They claim in the thousands of surgeries they have done they have never had facial paralysis, or long term effects like epilepsy. They are saying 4-6 week recovery after a short hospital stay.\n\nAny thoughts or experiences from those who went with radiation over surgery? Or surgery over radiation?\n\nWould love some opinions.\n\nThanks! I went surgery over radiation, was given the same reasons you are.\n\nHowever I am much younger, I was 24 at diagnosis and the surgeons said if there were unknown side effects of radiation (ie. brain cancer down the road), it is likely to happen to someone who got radiated this young and lived for many years after. They also said because I am young, a radiated tumour is more likely to return later in my life than one that was physically removed. \n\nI listened to them as I could not see a reason they wouldnt tell the truth. My ENT would of been involved in either procedure so I do not think he had any reason to prefer one over the other aside from his honest opinion as to what was best for me. How was your recovery? How are you now? I had the surgery. Heard pretty much the same reasons to go surgery over radiation. I did some reading on the subject and it did appear that radiation, while attractive in some ways, had some risks of its own. Getting brain cancer down the line did not sound good.\n\nIt was probably about 5-6 weeks for me to feel close to 100 percent energy wise. It still took another couple weeks before I felt confident driving. The big sticking point was getting a little dizzy when whipping my head back and forth to check for traffic when going straight or making a left from a stop sign.\n\nI know it sounds shallow but one thing I dreaded before the surgery was the idea of having a huge scar on the side of my head. I do not know if this is common or not, but my surgeon did internal stitches with glue on the outside and year later you cannot really see a scar at all through my rather short hair. Does not sound shallow at all. I am a chubby old man with magnificent hair... I lose that and I am lost! :P\n\nThanks for sharing it really helps. Right now they are saying wait 6 months to see if it grows and decide then... Personally if I am going to do surgery I feel like fuck it lets roll. Why wait? I am actually consulting with a neurosurgeon tomorrow. Mine is 11 mm and I am 54. I consulted with a radiation oncologist last week and she told me herself that because I am \u201cyoung\u201d (I do love hearing that) she thought surgery was better for me. She told me that radiation was a good 10-20 year solution but my life expectancy (knock on wood) is beyond that, and 20 years from now would be a poor time to find out I need more aggressive treatment. LOL I was just telling a friend that if I have surgery I will be rocking the most badass scar.  All the images I saw online look like they are closed with big staples. I kind of feel that way too about waiting. I want it to be over with. Wow yeah I mean that was basically the message I got too... And yes it was nice to hear that I was \"young\" though their 40 to 50 year additional life expectancy seemed very generous!! By the way what is up with San Diego? I am in LA and my ENT also told me she could help me consult with her mentor in San Diego. 36 years old now, was 33 when mine was found.  It was 3 cm x 3 cm so I did not have a choice.  I still had hearing in the ear prior to surgery (much to the doc's surprise).  I did not like the first doc and went with an ENT who did this surgery twice a week (I found out the national average is roughly 1.5 times every two weeks).  Plus the first guy wanted to schedule me within a few weeks.  My ENT was booked until like 2 months later so that is a good sign to look for.     \n\n\nI spent 3 days in hospital and then started feeling close to 100% in a little over a month.  I have lost all hearing in that ear and have permanent tinnitus.  This was expected as the surgical approach alone has round a 50/50 shot of causing it and that number goes up exponentially based on the tumor size.  Balance is a bit fucked (cannot stand on one leg or pass a field sobriety walk without wobbling like crazy) but that is from the size and placement of the tumor.  The scar is not too bad.  It looks hideous at first but over time I need a fresh haircut and you to be looking for it to find it.  \n\n\nIf you decide on surgery  \n\\-The drive home from the hospital is going to be brutal, you will feel every bump so pop a couple of the pain pills before leaving  \n\\-You will need someone to live with you for a few weeks.  You can NOT lift anything over 10 pounds so essentially you can do nothing.    \n\\-Have and take stool softeners regularly while on the pain meds at home.  That is one of the meds they are giving you in the hospital because narcotics have a constipating effect.  You do NOT want to be pushing hard while taking a dump.  \n\\-If you feel or find any clearish, vaguely sticky fluid coming from the wound or feel an IMMENSE migraine if you raise your head while laying down, GO TO THE HOSPITAL IMMEDIATELY.  This is a CSF leak and needs to be treated immediately.  I got read the riot act, had surgical glue put on the wound (felt like acid) and spent another 5 days in the ICU with a drain in my back.\n\n\\-Invest in a shower chair\n\n\\-Start walking as soon as you feel able and as far as you can each time.  Like down the driveway and back at first.  It will help.  \n\\-It is been mentioned before but once you feel good to drive, whipping your head to check for traffic will make you dizzy. Not sure but I guess st john's has gone down hill? These guys seemed legit and with the drive Recovery was pretty uneventful. Slept for a couple weeks and then went into physiotherapy. A year later I had to have a second craniotomy because the skull got infected and the muscles around it healed improperly.\n\nI am okay now, definitely a \u201cnew normal\u201d . Some lasting after effects are tinnitus, deafness on right side, anxiety, and vertigo.\n\nBut I am back working in my very demanding profession, just with some adjustments. That was my thought. It seemed inevitable it would have to come out some time and that the recovery was not going to get any easier the longer I waited. Yeah, that is what I saw too. I do not if maybe since it was the micro-neurosurgeon that closed me up that maybe he did things with greater finesse. Hi! I JUST had surgery with Dr. Schwartz and Dr. Friedman - they were amazing!! I highly recommend them! \n\nI am 28, and my tumor was 3.2 x 3.6 x 3.8 cm. I am 3 weeks out from surgery and I feel pretty much like myself already - just need a bit more rest than usual. I am every working part time (from home) now. \n\nI have no crazy complications! I had the translab surgery, so of course I have no hearing in my surgery ear, mild tinnitus, and I had/have vertigo (doing vestibular nerve therapy, but it is really not a big deal at this point). \n\nI was in the hospital for 4 days - what a journey that was. The first 8 days of recovery was rough for me. The second week I improved a ton - up walking around more and more every day helped a lot (I progressed from walking around a cul-de-sac to walking a mile 2x in a day). The third week has been more of the same, but with less dramatic improvements since I already feel pretty fine. I walk 1- 2 times a day with my fiance and rest when I feel like resting, listening to a lot of audiobooks right now :) .\n\nIn total I spent 4 weeks in the San Diego area. It helped a lot that I have family down there that we stayed with. \n\nGood luck! wow this is super helpful grapes grapes grapes! (I love grapes as long as they are juiced and fermented) :P\n\nso my tumor is TINY, .6cm by .7 cm  so its such a tough call. I do believe that Schwartz and Friedman are the best surgeons in the country for this ailment. But at the same time, I still have a fair ammount of hearing that I hate to lose, not to mention being out of work for 4 weeks will suck.\n\nHow was your hearing before, and how is having complete single sided deafness? When you were referred to Dr. Friedman - what was the wait time to get in for an apt? Also, how far was the surgery booked out? It was so fast! tldr; requested free consultation on 6/2, surgery was on 6/15.\n\n* **6/1 (Monday)**: had my MRI.\n* **6/2 (Tuesday)**: got my MRI results, put in my name and number via the \"request a free phone consultation\" button on the UCSD website late that night.\n* **6/3** Kris called me - I was so worried and she was so great. I was  able to send my MRI images the same day &amp; ask my PCP to refer me to UCSD. Dr. Friedman also called me later that day and told me I was going to me ok :') \n* **6/5 Friday:** Dr. Friedman called me to schedule my surgery asap because the tumor was pressing on my brain stem (1 cm midline shift) and was at risk of closing my 4th ventricle &amp; causing hydrocephalus. I told him my first free day was the next Friday (the 12th). Over the weekend they tried to schedule surgery for the 12th  but could not get an OR room, so my surgery was scheduled for Monday the 15th.\n* We flew to SD on the 7th, I had pre-op appointments on 6/10 and 6/12. Surgery was on the 15th &amp; I was in the hospital for 4 days. I had appointments 10 days after I was discharged (talked to Schwarz and Friedman, got my stitches out, &amp; had physical therapy). We flew back home on the 30th.\n\n\nSide note - I also had a consultation with a local (in-network for me) acoustic neuroma clinic on 6/4. They also wanted to schedule me asap (risk of hydrocephalus) and told me they would move someone else's surgery to get me in(!). I was meeting with Dr. Friedman the next day, so I told them that and that I would get back to them after that. They told me hydrocephalus symptoms to look out for, and told me to go to the ER at their hospital and ask for them if I started to get symptoms. So even though I did not end up scheduling surgery with them, it was  really nice to have that safety net... local doctors who were aware of my condition, had my MRI images already, and were ready to operate on me if needed. That is great news! I suspect that I have acoustic neuroma, but I have not been diagnosed. I have all of the symptoms to a T. But the doctors have been trying to figure it out for a year. One neurologist told me I was probably just \u201cstressed\u201d and asked about my childhood emotional trauma. I have had an MRI but it was without contrast and I have braces - so they affected the image. I have another one schedule for September. Here is to hoping I finally get answers I am going to offer my personal story. I got diagnosed with AN back in 2012, ended up with a basic hearing aid but \u201cSkippy\u201d kept growing, so something had to be done.\n\nWe weighed the two options\u2014GammaKnife and surgery\u2014and with the former because it was less invasive, had a quicker recovery and was 95% effective.\n\nGuess who fell into the 5%.\n\nSkippy continued growing, my hearing got worse, and so I ended up having the surgery done in 2017. They got 95% of Skippy and I have been good ever since. Mind you, in order to get rid of him they took out the bones, etc on the right side, rendering me completely deaf on that side, but as I told them at the time it was pretty much gone anyway.\n\nOn a side note, I use the Phonak CROS hearing aid system. The one on the right acts as a microphone and broadcasts over to the left, and they have been a godsend. Still have some problems but it is better than being utterly unable to hear on that side. I had my first appointment with a doctor from University of Miami. He is part of a team that handles ANs. \n\nMine is pressing on the brain and initially he said surgery is the best option. He says that 90% of patients have no problems with face paralysis. I have no hearing in my left ear and my balance is a bit off sometimes. So Transdermal would be best. Since I have been living with this for some time my DR thinks that I have been compensating for hearing and balance on my right. So I should recover pretty fast an not miss the hearing and balance on my left (they would have to cut the hearing and balanance nerves). I am a big guy 6'2\", 270 and body build (or try to) so I am hoping that my build will help in recovery.\n\nNow I just have to wait for his team's official word. And try and schedule someone to be with me for a month. Your situation sounds almost exactly like mine and I had the translab surgery a year ago. The surgeons have your best interest in mind and want to help you avoid facial paralysis if you avoid getting the surgery for too long. Your situation does not sound like a good candidate for radiation based on the size similarity to mine and the research I did with advice from my surgeon at Michigan Ear Institute. I would recommend the surgery, the loss of hearing is difficult and the recovery was challenging. However now I am feeling great and back to running consistently. If you have any questions feel free to dm. I regret waiting the 6 months because I had significant tumor growth and the surgery was a lot longer. It ended up being 9 hours because I waited and the tumor was pretty wrapped around the facial nerve. My face has a mildly pronounced difference between the two sides and I cannot help thinking the facial recovery would have been a lot better if I had not waited. You could end up being one of the \u201clucky\u201d percentage that does not have significant growth and can make it to the 5 year mark of longer term relief that it is not growing but the odds are not great. THIS. It is also not a bad idea to invest in a     small battery-powered radio for after the surgery because you may not want the TV on. I went with a cheap $10 one at Target that did not have digital tuning. The battery last the entire time I was in the hospital.", "Radiation or surgery? My dad is 51 years old with a small acoustic neuroma. This is causing him balance issues and sometimes tinnitus. He lost his hearing on the side of the neuroma but the doctor said that will never come back.\nDo you think radiation or surgery would be best or what was your experiences?\nThank you It is all a matter of personal choice, there are risks with each.\n\nWith surgery there are all the usual risks, anesthesia, complications, bleeding, infections, etc.\n\nWith radiation there are some doctors that say there is a slight risk of the radiation causing more growth, or mutating the tumor.  Of course there are also doctors saying that is not the case. I had GK around that age.  Very bad side effects (knife-pick headaches, bad dizziness and balance issues) for about 6 months, then the side effects stopped completely and MRIs showed necrosis and shrinking.  Now, I hardly ever even think about it.  That is just my 2 cents. I would go with radiation. My mother had a stroke after \u201cminor\u201d brain surgery and I learned that burrowing inside the human skull is never minor", "Discharge time after surgery My wife had a translab procedure to remove AN on Monday. Surgery fished around 630 pm. I just got word they are wanting to discharge her today at noon. This sounds insane to me. Can anyone shed some light or discuss their hospital times after their surgery? Thanks for the help! I was in the hospital for 4 days after my translab surgery (surgery day 1, released day 4), so it seems fine to me. I think UCSD stated that they keep patients in the hospital 3 - 5 days &amp; release is based on your ability to walk on your own again.", "Dr. Philip Stieg - Weill Cornell Brain and Spine Center Zoom call - Tonight 8PM On behalf of: \nPaul Bernabe at the Weill Cornell Brain and Spine Center in New York \n\nTheir chief, Dr. Philip Stieg, who specializes in acoustic neuromas, is holding a \"Virtual Brain Seminar\" where he will be talking about acoustic neuromas over Zoom this coming Monday.

He has had horrible headaches ever since and has to be on meds constantly.  It ruined his career, retirment plans and everything.  \n\nSo we have been dealing with this ever since.  At this point hes been on the meds way too long but he cannot be taken off them according to pain specialists until the headaches are dealt with. \n\nDoes anyone know anyone or anything we can do to address the headaches?  At this point we are willing to do anything even exploratory surgery if we can.  I hope in the last several years since there is more ways to battle this.   \n\nAny advice?? Hi there,\n\nI am so sorry to hear about your dad's pain. I wanted to respond and tell you that I was recently diagnosed with an AN--a small one. I am on watch and wait til November.\n\nAre you familiar with the Acoustic Neuroma Association? Is your dad familiar with it? They have an EXCELLENT discussion forum and you or he could post this question there. It is an amazing resource and among all of the people there who have now or did have ANs, there is a wealth of experience.\n\nAll the best to you and your family. THANK YOU!  I will look into it as soon as I can.  I wish you all the best and I know the methods and techniques are far better now.  All our lives were changed by this surgery. You are really welcome. xo There are some very active AN Facebook groups.  You should check in with them as well.", "Acoustic Neuroma Questions Hello, I was recently diagnosed with a 25 mm acoustic neuroma. I am 33 years old and I live in Canada. The AN is pressing on my brainstem. I saw the surgeon who said it was a 10 month waiting list for surgery. In this time I will continue losing more hearing and balance. This seems ridiculous to me. Is this the norm? I just want the tumour out of my head. I have moderate/severe hearing loss, facial numbness, lost tastebuds and facial twitching. Is this no big deal? I feel like everyone is treating me like it is not a big deal. I would have thought a brain tumor was! My doctors in the US recommended surgery as soon as possible because my 3.3 cm AN was pushing on my brain stem. It is possible that it can cause CSF back-up and eventually effect brain stem functions. Can you get a second opinion? Hello... I am recently recovering from treatment and did LOTS of research so perhaps I can shed some light.  \n\nFirst off, these tumors are incredibly slow growing. Very very slow. So 10 months from now, while it might be slightly bigger, it will still be small. \n\nWhich brings me to my second point; yours is less than 3 cm, and generally speaking stereotactic radio therapy (radiation) is the preferred method for smaller acoustic neuroma treatment.\n\nThere are multiple reasons why. First off, with surgery you will lose your hearing permanently in the affected ear. That is a given and there is nothing they can do about it. Do you still have some hearing in that ear? With it being so small I would imagine you do.  I would think it is important to keep that for as long as possible.\n\nSecondly, with brain surgery it has a 5 to 6 month return to work recovery time. And of course it is freaking brain surgery! With radiation therapy, (and the type I had is three blasts three days in a row, which appears to be the preferred method now versus gamma knife which is just one shot), is highly effective.. It is done using a linear Accelerator or LINAC. \n\nThe advantage of this, (besides not having brain surgery!), is that there is a 78 - 95% chance that you will retain the hearing that you have for quite some time to come. Will it eventually deteriorate? Yes. But that would happen with surgery too\u2026 But it would be immediate!  \n\nWith radiation the tumor is not removed, nor does it really shrink, but it does die. I had my radiation completed a week before Thanksgiving (end of November in the US), and six months from that date I will get another MRI to see if it is grown, which of course would be surprising.  Every year after that I will have an MRI to monitor it.  Statistically at my age the chance of it growing or getting another one in the other ear is zero.\n\nThe downtime and side effects from this are virtually none. I had some minor facial nerve tenderness, some mild headaches, slight vertigo, and fatigue. However I am mostly over all of those now and feel fine. If you have tinnitus, which I do, that will never go away either. \n\nI am not a doctor, and I do not know your individual case. You might be having different side effects than I did, which for me was just unilateral hearing loss and tinnitus.  Are you having vertigo? Facial paralysis?  Because my tumor was pressing up against my brain stem too, technically it still is, but I did not have those particular side effects.\n\nAs you can see, after I did all my research I opted for the radiation. And it is a decision I stand by *for me*\u2026 You obviously must make your own decision on what is best for you, but I would not jump on the surgery bandwagon right away (unless of course your doctor has said that is the case)... BUT... I would go see a Radiation Oncologist for a second opinion **no matter what!**. \n\nDo more research, take a big deep breath, and do not panic. You have got time.   And this could have been so much worse\u2026 I am very very grateful, as we lost a colleague seven years ago to a brain tumor, hers was cancer, ours are benign. And like me, yours is small. Another thing to be grateful for. What I have told everybody is if you *have* to have a brain tumor, you want one like this!\n\nI hope that helps, and ask me if you have any other questions. Hey, sorry to hear but good you are dealing with it and having all the right tests done. Is private healthcare not an option? 10months seems like forever. How long have you experienced symptoms for? Your doctor will no doubt be able to assess whether it is growing at a fast or slow rate. They tend to grow very slowly.\n\nI personally would hate to be treated differently, which is why I have not told anyone about it around me. If rather get on with life and try and push past the mental boundary. Private healthcare is not an option. I live in Canada and we do not have private health care. In December 2018 I noticed sharp pains in my ear. I went to the doctor and he recommended I get my hearing tested. I did this. I had mild hearing loss in my left ear. I was told it was minor and was probably just due to aging (I was 32 at the time). In September 2019 I noticed I could not hear in noisy backgrounds. I got my hearing tested again and I was told I had moderate severe hearing loss in the left ear. It was only 10 months after my first hearing test. \n\nI went to an ent who gave me steroids and told me it was sudden hearing loss. I felt like it was more gradual but everyone said it was a lot of hearing lost in just 10 months. A mri was booked for January. While I waited for an mri my face became numb, facial twitching occurred and I lost taste in half my tongue. I begged for my mri to be moved up but everyone told me this was the way it was. I lost more hearing and my doctor was able to get my mri moved up by a month. \n\nA 25mm tumor was found. It only took 10 days to see the neurosurgeon so I thought it was a sign I would get treated quickly. He told me it was 10 months. He said it is slow growing and all larger acoustic neuromas press on the brainstem. He said I would inevitably lose all my hearing and my balance might get worse as I wait for surgery. \n\nI hate that I cannot get the surgery done now. That my symptoms might get worse. I am a teacher and I do not have the option to sit down and relax if I feel dizzy. I just want this nightmare to be over. A 2.5 cm tumor is considered medium to large. Mine is pressing on my brainstem and im only 33.  Usually a younger person gets surgery which a larger tumor. I went from mild to moderate severe hearing loss in 10 months. I know if it grew fast last year that it does not mean it will grow fast again but I feel like I have a fast growing tumor. Well as I stated, everybody\u2019s situation is different, but I was told that up to 3 cm radiation is better. Of course that is completely dependent on your side effects, of which it sounds like you have numerous. Did they say if removal of the tumor will reduce or eliminate your side effects?   Was radiation even discussed as a possibility? Your doctors will know best, I am just asking.\n\nI am so sorry this happened to you at such a young age\u2026 It must be very scary.  Waiting 10 months does seem a long time. I do not know much about the Canadian healthcare system but is there anyway to put a \u201crush\u201c on it so to speak? Can a doctor push that through or sign something to make that happen? In Canada we do not get many options. I am getting headaches now. I feel like I am going crazy. How long did you wait for surgery? Nope, I asked if there was another doctor who did not have a long wait list. There is one other doctor in my area but he did not know how long that guys wait is. I would only get rushed if it was a life or death situation. I was told if I lose more hearing then I will just get another mri. It sucks! I am a teacher and since my hearing keeps getting worse I struggle to hear the kids some days. I work in an open concept school with no doors!!! Torture Wow\u2026 What a horrible situation to be in. Because I agree with you, a brain tumor is a big deal, especially with the side effects that you are experiencing. But I guess technically since it is not considered life or death you will just have to wait it out.   Again, my heartfelt sympathies for you. I do not know enough about how fast they grow, but maybe they grow fast at the beginning and then begin to slow down some\u2026? Certainly worth investigating with research. At the very least it might make you feel better. Now I totally relate\u2026 I am a high school teacher! And I work in a project-based learning environment which means there is noise all the time. I struggle to hear my kids now too. Perhaps look into those hearing aids that fit deep inside your ear\u2026 At least it would be a temporary solution and it does amplify the sound quite a bit. Seems like both of us will end up with one anyway at some point.  :/ I already bought one! It helps a bit but not much. I will lose all of my hearing in the left ear. There are hearing aids now that I wear on both ears but the sound goes to the good ear. The doctor said they can grow at different speeds in different years. Most people had symptoms for years. I only had symptoms for one year and still had a 2.5 cm tumour! Well shit.  It sounds like you are doing everything you possibly can. How frustrating! I guess the best thing you can do now is work on accepting your predicament and trying to keep a positive attitude as much as possible.  Easier said than done.  \n\nLucky us- 1:100,000 Thanks! It just seems so ridiculous. I was told my balance might go as I wait for surgery. Just do the surgery!!!! Interesting. Yes, I have had symptoms for years and been pushing to figure out what was wrong. I would not have found out if I had not turned into a raging bitch about it! No one believed me\u2026 They thought it was all in my \u201chead\u201d (LOL!). So in one way getting the diagnosis was vindication! Exactly! Is there a waiting list? I do not really know how the Canadian system works. I am just wondering if there is a way to get posted higher on the waiting list because of those issues\u2026 I mean you will have to get payouts from the government if you lose your method of earning income right? I would think that would matter. Yeah, a 10 month wait is unacceptable. I guess I am silly for thinking this was serious. Well I wish you luck... feel free to PM if you need support.  Big hug for you.  \ud83d\udc9b There is no waiting list. I was supposed to wait 4 months for an mri after I lost my hearing. I called to be put on a waitlist and the receptionist laughed. Everyone calls to be put on a waitlist. My mri was only moved up because I lost more hearing and showed my videos of my face twitching. It took so long to get ppl to listen and now I am waiting 10 months because I already lost so much hearing so I do not have much chance of saving it anyway. I went from mild to moderate severe hearing loss in 10 months! That is crazy!!! I felt the same way! The doctors were shocked when they found out I had this tumour. I was telling them for months something was wrong. One doctor told me facial twitching was normal. \u201crolls eyes\u201d\n\nIt is amazing how they do not want to actually listen to us. Like, dude, I know my body. I know if somethings messed up, or different, or painful, etc etc etc ad nauseum! I am sorry to hear about your AN! You are going to be okay and it is completely valid to hate waiting 10 months. There is an AN specialist in California who, for free, will look at your scans and give you his prognosis as a second opinion. You may need to do some Googling as I have forgotten his name. A second opinion could potentially help motivate your neurosurgeon. I am not familiar with the details of Canadian health care. Can you get a second opinion or use your referral for another doc? \n\nAs far as your symptoms progressing it is likely that you will lose both your hearing and vestibular balance on the affected side from surgery. It is the facial symptoms and pressure on your brain stem that you do not want to progress for 10 more months as it could make recovery much harder. \n\nIf I were in your shoes, I would track my symptoms carefully and request additional MRIs throughout the waiting period. If growth is detected, then it is not as slow growing as most other ANs and you may get your spot bumped up. You have facial twitching?  you should immediately have the MRI re-reviewed and get a second opinion to rule out a facial nerve schwannoma.  \n\nWaiting 10 months is not unreasonable. Schwannomas are benign slow growing tumors.  Yours is already approaching a large size given you have facial numbness (implying it has grown superiorly to involve the 5th cranial nerve as well), plus the signs of brainstem compression on the scan.  So you will definitely want this treated.  Given your young age and brainstem compression, I think surgery is what most people would recommend.  However confirm that this is indeed a vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma) as opposed to a facial schwannoma, which has a slightly different treatment paradigm.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that doing surgery never makes anything better.  So doing surgery now versus in 10 months will not change the fact that you will lose hearing and balance function from that ear.  You will lose any residual hearing you have after surgery, pretty much guaranteed.  The biggest issue is facial nerve function.  Smaller tumors are easier to take out while achieving great facial nerve outcomes.  So the only problem with waiting is potentially having a bigger tumor to take out.   But yours is already on the bigger side so it might not make a bigger difference.  The biggest thing you can do is to go to a highly experienced surgical team.  \n\nGood luck! Regardless of when the surgery is, you will lose all remaining balance function immediately after the surgery.  Treating the tumor now does NOT preserve your remaining balance function.  The tumor is on the balance nerve, which gets cut and removed at surgery.  But balance should not be your concern.  You are young and your other side will compensate well.  It may take 6 months to 1 year to recover but you will get back to your daily activities, including riding bikes and even rock climbing! Thanks! The radiologist determined it was an acoustic neuroma. I lost my hearing first. I already do not have much hearing left. I feel like my AN grew fast. I went from mild to moderate/severe hearing loss in 10 months. I am also experiencing other symptoms (facial twitching) that others do not seem to experience for years. My symptoms are increasing so quickly. Thanks! I just want this nightmare to be over with! Facial twitching occurs in &lt;5% of acoustic neuromas so you should get that double checked.  Radiologists do not always pick up on these subtle differences, but (hopefully) your surgeon will look out for it.  Sometimes they cannot tell until surgery, so your surgeon should tell you what their plan is in the event they diagnose a facial schwannoma intraoperatively.  \n\nAlso, you cannot predict growth rate from symptoms.  That is well established.  So do not let the new onset of symptoms (such as worsening hearing loss) worry you or make you think it is growing fast.  \n\nI would recommend getting into see your neurotologist for another consultation about your symptoms. Why do symptoms get worse then? Because the tumor slowly damages the nerve itself, irrespective of whether it has grown.  It is not uncommon for a tumor to grow, yet hearing remains stable.  And then at the next MRI, the tumor remains stable in size, yet the patient has lost hearing.  In other words, size/growth of the tumor does not always correlate with symptom progression. This is why your doctors monitor the growth with an MRI, instead of a hearing test. Oh thanks! That makes sense. I was told if I lose more hearing then they will do another mri. The mri wait time is awful in Canada! How are you? I just had a 3.5 mm acoustic neuroma removed last Monday.   Mine was not on brain stem, but close.  I am in US. I was told I needed it out within 3 months.  I did wait the full 3 months to save money and prep myself.   I do not understand socialized medicine,  but let me reccomend using the time to do hypnosis and meditation.   I did it weekly.  My surgery took 6 hours as opposed to 8-12.  I was out of the hospital in a day and a half.  I am now a week out, walking well, face is normal.  Eye ball bouncing is almost all gone.  My biggest issues are headaches.   My left ear hearing is slowly coming back and now is a dull wooshing.  This may not be helpful to this question,  but my progress is amazing and everyone around me is blown away.  My family was pissed I waited but I know for me, all the prep made a huge huge difference. I just got sent home from the hospital today for my Acoustic Neuroma surgery. I went in on Wednesday morning, and it was a 14 hour trans slab surgery. I started losing my hearing about 5 years ago and was just about completely deaf in my right ear by surgery. Along with severe tinnitus and headaches. I work construction so just tossed it up as hearing loss from the job. \n\nMy tumor was 2.8cm\u2019s and was told surgery was pretty much my option because  it was too big for radiation. Mine was also pushing against my brain stem. To answer your question I got diagnosed the beginning of November and just had the surgery Jan 22. They even tried to get me in on Dec 4, but I opted to wait until after the holidays. 10 months does sound like a really long time and I hope you find a better solution by then. I have slight paralysis on my right side of face. My eyelid has a delayed reaction closing compared to my left side, and it does not quite close all the way. Hard to sip a straw on right side of my mouth. Hoping it gets better in the future. \n\nThe first 2 days after surgery were pretty rough to be honest, but by day 3 it turned a corner and I was able to keep my eyes open and have some balance back. My first day of PT in the icu, I sat up in the bed and threw up everywhere. Also had really bad reaction to pain meds (first oxy and then fentanyl). Blood pressure dropped to 90/30 and almost passed out. So have been dealing with pain through Tylenol 3. Once the nausea was under control I was able to function more again. \n\nI wish you the best of luck and feel free to pm me with any questions I can help with. Hey, just wanted to thank you for posting this, I hope things are going well. This was the first reddit post to pop up after a search. I am still coming to terms with everything and I am glad you and others shared your experiences to put everything into perspective and share some info. I am in Canada too, early thirties and have a 9mm AN on my left side diagnosed in August 2019. I feel like my hearing has always been a little impared, not helped by steadily increasing volume of music over the years, working near heavy machinery on and off for ~10 years with limited ear protection (oh so fucking manly), occasional tinnitus in both ears, repeated ear infections when and an eustachian tube surgery, both when I was little. \n\nSo I had a hearing exam in August 2018 to finally get them checked and at that point I had mild hearing loss on the left side with pretty constant tinnitus, check on it in a year and get a fan.  Had an ear infection over that Christmas, along with a good amount of financial strain, went to my GP, moved up my next hearing exam when I followed up. Referred to an ENT in February 2019, booked an MRI for December 2019! \n\n\nThere was a lot of cursing after getting that slot. But I called and had myself put on the cancellation list, if your schedule is flexible it works pretty well, sometimes you will have less than 24hr notice, but you are not losing anything by trying. Our MRI is mobile and my community is  definitely of the older set so in the end I figured I was lucky to get the slot I did.\n\n\n I was bumped up in August 2019 with a few days notice, managed to squeeze into my ENT for the results and boom. 9mm acoustic neuroma, plus a brain cyst. He laid out the tentative options for treatment of both, radiation, surgery, wait and see. I went for the latter until I looked into it as he did not seem too worried and wanted to book me for a contrast MRI to check on the cyst. Was booked for February 2020. Hit another employment roadbump in November but managed to get a cancellation and was free to take it. Nothing grew in 3 months (not the largest sample size) and the cyst looks benign. I am a walking anxiety bomb anywhere near doctors but I am working on asking more questions...like where the cyst is? If it is related to the AN? What should I name it? Any chance of developing superpowers?\n\nI am choosing to wait a year until my next (pre booked) MRI in Dec 2020, 9mm is tiny and my only symptoms are the left side mild hearing loss + constant insanely loud tinnitus/clicking/roaring, occasional right side total hearing loss + occasional tinnitus which I need to bring up with the doc next time. I will keep an eye (ear) out for additional symptoms. \n\nOn a slightly more humorous note, might have noticed I have had some employment/financial ups and downs and downs and downs, I recently started a pretty nice steady job with some security going forward, hard work but worth it. Unfortunately I work near and with large quantities of metal shavings/slivers and in reading all these posts I remembered I will be receiving annual MRI's likely for the rest of my life.... it also requires constant hearing protection, and lots of verbal communication. Irony? I am shopping around for a magnet to clear out my hands before the next MRI. \n\nWorking on keeping positive and this has helped me take a step forward and potentially plan ahead a little bit. I am eternally grateful for our healthcare system, had I been somewhere else I would have been out at least 7-8 grand by now and still be waiting. Typically you can get a second opinion but the process likely varies by province. In my province there is a process for this. I think it is worth doing in your case.", "Is this an AN? I am 24F. About 2 weeks ago I started getting pretty bad headaches. I would had them occasionally in the past 6 months or so, but they ramped up in intensity and were on and off for about 9 days. I attributed this to medication withdrawal, as I had been trying to ween off of my antidepressant during this time (guided by my psychiatrist). I eventually decided to just stay on a low dose of the meds to stop the headaches- this seemed to work and the headaches stopped, but now the tinnitus has started. It is been about 5 days now of high-pitched whistling in my left ear. It is not there when I first wake up in the morning, but it comes on after getting out of bed. I do not think I have any hearing loss (not noticing any) and my balance is fine. I went to my PCP who looked in my ears and said she did not see any earwax or indications of an infection. She told me to call her after the weekend if the tinnitus is still there and she will refer me to an ENT.\n\nWhat do you guys think? It is possible but taking and/or withdrawing from certain antidepressants can cause tinnitus as well, so I would be inclined to consider that first. My AN-caused tinnitus did (and still does) occur pretty much constantly and is probably most noticable while I am in bed and everything is quiet. I would not worry too much about having an AN yet. I agree, this does seem possible. I have an appointment with my psychiatrist next week, I will bring this up with her. The only thing that makes me think it is not caused by the medication is that I was taking the same med for over a year with no problems, starting going off and had bad physical symptoms (but no tinnitus), and then the tinnitus only started when I went back on a steady dose. The only way to know for sure is an MRI which I am assuming your doctor will order after they have ruled out the more common conditions. You would need an MRI to know for sure. The ENT should send you for one. Only an MRI with contrast will tell you for sure. I was told that only a very small percentage of patients with AN synonyms actually have an AN. You can also have an AN and have other things going on at the same time. I had borderline diabetes and a cyst causing issues at the exact same time. You are right- hopefully when my PCP refers me to an ENT I can get in quick. You are right- hopefully when my PCP refers me to an ENT I can get in quick. That is interesting!! And comforting to know that only a small percentage with symptoms actually have them. Maybe I am just freaking myself out reading everything online. I will request an MRI just to give me peace of mind at least. That tumor is mainly something that has to be eliminated when symptoms occur so that they can figure out if it is something else.  Even if they did find it many people do not need surgery.  My diagnosis came after YEARS of doctors missing it.  My first symptoms occurred in 2004.  My tumor was not diagnosed until 2016. Have you just been doing the \u201cwatch and wait\u201d course? Or did you have surgery or radiation?  Update: I do have an appointment in a couple weeks with an ENT, but I also spoke to my psychiatrist who said the tinnitus could definitely be from restarting the antidepressant. We are going to switch me over to a different one and see if it goes away. I will update once I am totally switched over (I have to taper off the current one so it might take a week or so). I was so advanced by the time they found it that I had no choice but surgery. I had translab surgery. I should have had surgery no later that 2013 or 2014. Instead my surgery was in 2017. Before my surgery I was buying antivert aka bonine aka less drowsy Dramamine in bulk because I was taking 12 a day. (The max you are supposed to take is 2.)", "6 years post op, Tinnitus worsening, clean MRI scans. Has anyone post-op experienced worsening tinnitus in both their deaf and good ears, but no explanation?", "Scheduling surgery I was recently diagnosed with an acoustic neuroma that is roughly 3mm. I still have complete hearing in my right ear, but have tinnitus and ear pressure. I am currently waiting to speak with specialists regarding my options, but after doing a ton of research, I am leaning towards surgery (middle fossa approach) if the surgeon agrees that I am a candidate for that. \n\nI am also currently going into my third year of law school. COVID-19 has obviously changed everything, but I am starting to think about when I should have this surgery done. I was told that the specialty center will get back to me in the next couple of weeks regarding my initial consultation. To me, it seems like I have two options: try to get this taken care of this summer before school starts again in August, or have surgery next summer after the bar exam (July 2021) but before I start work at my firm (October 2021). \n\nI am going to do whatever my doctor ultimately recommends, but the wait is killing me and I would like to know what people think about my timing options. How long should I realistically expect recovery to take? 3 weeks? One of the centers I am looking at says the hospital stay is 2-3 days and 9-10 days total in the area. \n\n* Reposting from AskDocs. My husband had his AN tumor removed last March. We stayed in the hospital a solid 3 nights and most of the 4th day. This is mostly dependent on how the surgery goes, for example: is the tumor encasing nerves, are the surgeons able to \"save\" nerves or are they cut (which do not repair). Thus, how well are you walking with an aid (walker/cane) in that time period. My husband was 29 at the time, pretty able bodied and motivated to get back home.\n\nEdit: His hearing nerve was cut, so he is 100% deaf on that side. There are apparently 2 nerve \"strands\" on one side of your head, 1 of these was cut. (We were told a lot of varying information about the number of strands, but this is our current understanding.)\n\nHe was out of work (carpentry/construction management) for 3 full months, and barred from use of ladders for a total of 6 months.\n\nHe was walking without and aid to use the toilet independently at ~1.5 months. Although I gave him grief, he WAS \"able\"- \"should\" he have done so, well that is a different question. \n\nWe had in-home nursing for a few weeks to check the healing of the wound; physical therapy weekly for about 2 months; and occupational therapy a couple times. Physical therapy itself was invaluable, and the confidence boost he got from a positive relationship with our PT was huge also.\n\nHe was feeling capable of doing 95% of his normal routine by the 3 month mark, but still kept a shower stool available to him, \"just in case\". I am curious as to why you are opting for surgery for such a small tumor?  3mm is very small!  Why not do gamma knife stereo static radiation?  That is what I did, my tumor is bigger than yours (although 1.7cm is not super tiny), plus it was just three shots of radiation and no recovery time... and I retained my hearing. I guess because it seems like there is potentially a small risk of developing a malignancy (not sure if that is true - I will discuss it with my doctor) and it seems like there is a possibility of having to get surgery anyways and/or losing my hearing. That is great to hear though that it worked so well for you! Do you have to go in for periodic check ups? Thank you for sharing your husband\u2019s experience! That really sucks that his hearing nerve was cut (I am super nervous about that happening). It sounds like his recovery is going well though! How has he adjusted to being deaf in one ear? 3rd year of law school, ugh, that is rough timing.  Not sure what I would pick but if you do not have it soon, I would say this summer might be rough because they may say \"9-10 days total in the area\" but that is only until you are able to travel home safely. You will still be laid up to a degree for at least a little bit once you get home.  \n\nI am in my 30's and had a small but fast growing AN removed 11 months ago via retrosigmoid.  I was told there was little to no chance of permanent facial issues and a decent to high probability of preserving hearing (ENT said 80%, Neurosurgeon said \"above 50%\").  Their main concern seemed to be my balance because it tested pretty high and tests also showed that there had been no degradation to the nerve so the opposite inner ear had not started compensating.  They said that was going to add days, if not a week to my hospital stay.\n\nThat being said, my hospital stay ended up only being 4 days (should have been 3 but my neurosurgeon could not make it by to sign off on me leaving so I left the next morning).  I was walking (slowly) around the hospital and doing stairs by the end of the 2nd day.  I did have some minor facial paralysis that is expected immediately after surgery but it went away within 2-3 weeks.  The one surprise was that I did lose my hearing which shocked the ENT because the nerve was left intact and signal steady throughout the surgery.  In a recent follow up, ENT says that they are thinking it may be related to a blood vessel issue so I am going in for a CT to have a look.\n\nI was out of work (desk job) for 4 weeks but probably went back a week or 2 too soon primarily from a stamina standpoint but after a few weeks I was doing well and after a month or two I was pretty much back to normal, all except for the headaches.  I am still dealing with chronic headaches, believed to be due to inflammation at the skull incision, that are managed by naproxen and steroid packs.  Now, my neurosurgeon (who had done tons of AN) says that headaches lasting this long is not unheard of but is rare and that they have always gone away in time but it is one of the few things I was not really aware of ahead of time that I wished I had known. Yeah, the timing really sucks. That is a good point about how long I will probably be on bed rest even after I get to leave the area. I am glad that you are doing relatively well though. Do they think you might regain your hearing if it is a blood vessel issue (hopefully that is the case)? If you could do it over, would you have done gamma knife instead of surgery?\n\nHow was physical therapy? Did you have any balance issues? I love running and cycling, so I am worried that I may lose the ability to do those activities. My doctors (three) all said the possibility of a NA becoming malignant are statistically so small that it is insignificant.  \nPlus with *surgery* they said there is a 95% chance ALL hearing on that side will be permanently lost... with radiation I keep it.  Tinnitus never leaves but it is what it is.  \nI just had my 6 month scan and it is not grown.  In 6 months I get another to confirm and from then on it is once per year.  \nIf you have not gotten a second opinion I *highly* suggest you do.  \nI had fractionated therapy (3 sessions).  \n( \nObviously I am NAD but it is your hearing and your health... before you commit to something as drastic as brain surgery you might want to consider other options. Very very well! He is an incredible musician, and audiophile,so we were all very anxious for him. In fact, while he was heavily medicated after the surgery I pulled the doctors aside and asked for them to postpone sharing the news with him until he was in his right mind. \n\nOf course the surgeon came by hours later and casually dropped it into conversation. He took it in stride, but ya know, drugs. You will be pretty heavily medicated during the days in the hospital. \n\nHe grieved a little during recovery, during the uncertain phase of: will I enjoy music the same again in the future? Will my musical skills regress? Will I be able to produce music again?\n\nIn the end, none of that has changed, his mind has changed over the loss and he has adapted to the situation. \n\nIn terms of social interactions, it can be hit or miss, he directs his body to catch sounds and listen when in conversation. However if he is not anticipating someone talking to him from that side, it can go 100% past him. If I see it occur, I usually jump in to say, oh sorry he is deaf on his left. Then get his attention and either repeat the question or fill him in that he is being talked to. \n\nBasically he struggles to admit he is deaf up front, and it can be mildly awkward at worst. \n\nAlso he protects both ears from heavy machinery and loud sounds as usual, with the hope of getting a bone anchored hearing device in the future. Look into them (also known as BAHA). Most hearing aids utilize the nerve to increase hearing, even cochlear implants, these  circumvent the need for an intact nerve. We have gotten some mixed messages about whether he will be allowed to get one, since they call for annual MRIs and the BAHA would impede that.\n\nGood luck with your surgery! I will not lie: he had a panic attack the night before and his anxiety the morning of was sky high. Once the prep began he requested some medication to manage that, which was great for him! Do that! Not the time to be apprehensive about anti anxiety meds. \n\nBut in the end, he was sedated and did not experience much until I was by his side again with his parents and my sister. \n\n(The 8ish hour day of waiting for someone to come out brain surgery is a whole other can of worms...)\n\nIf you do it \"now\" and get it over with, your life can move on. That is exactly the mindset we had when planning to go ahead with surgery. A year later and I am 5 months pregnant with our first baby (girl), his career has progressed, and we have a beautiful dog. (He basically insisted we get a puppy during his last month at home, was not a bad idea in hindsight.) \n\nYou will not regret \"getting it over with\", I promise. Please feel free to reach out to me (and him, via me) as much as you want! If your family or partner have questions about the support needed, I am here for that too! While the headaches suck, they are getting better gradually so I do not know that I would have done anything differently.  I was offered the GK but everyone I met with recommended against it due to the AN size and my age. The size made the surgery risk low and they were up front that they were more comfortable using GK on older patients because  the long term effects of the radiation are not exactly known so it was potentially a greater risk for young patients. \n\nAs for my hearing, nah, it is gone. It is really not that bad and I use bi-cros aids that are great and hardly noticeable.  The CTs for the blood vessel issue are in case it could have something to do with the headaches but I think primarily because the ENT is still pissed about my hearing outcome and wants to get to the bottom of it. Only reason it is coming up now is he was reviewing notes from my MRI around 7 months post op and saw a note from the radiologist about an infection in/at that blood vessel but since I woke up without hearing the EMT does not buy it so he is curious.

It all depends on the type of surgery, size of tumor, and multiple other factors.  But I do agree with getting a 2nd opinion. Well, I had gamma knife six years ago. Turns out there is a possible side effect\u2014I have a cataract in my right eye, and the doctor said it was due to the radiation. Nothing insurmountable, but add that to the fact I ended up needing surgical removal three years later...but what can you do? Oh man that sucks.  May I ask how big it was to begin with?  Mine was small-ish so 3 blasts of radiation were deemed acceptable.  I guess I have always assumed that it always works so it is kind of been out of my thoughts but now your story is making me nervous.  \n\nIs all heating in that ear gone now?  Do you have a hearing aid? I am embarrassed to admit I had to go back to my doctor's pathology reports to get the size--it was, as he says \"1.9 x 1.4 x 1.4 cm, previously\nmeasuring 1.0 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm when remeasured in similar fashion\". Big enough, in other words. They said \"almost touching your brain\" and that was it, so far as I was concerned.\n\nIn order to get to it, they had to remove the bones, etc. from the right ear, so I am completely deaf on that side. Then again, I was all but deaf by that point, so it was not a deal-breaker. I have been using Phonak CROS hearing aids since 2015, where the right aid is a microphone of sorts that feeds sound into the left one. It is not perfect but I generally can hear fairly well. It did reach the point, though, where I had to swallow my pride on occasion and tell someone \"I am sorry, I am hard of hearing on my right side, could you repeat that?\"\n\nMy wife calls herself my \"backup hearing aid\". :)\n\nIf they have been taking MRI's of your spot since your procedure and they are not concerned, I would say you are fine. I get them every 2 years because the last few were clear. Well I had to look mine up too! Mine was 1.7 cm x .7 x .5 so mine was smaller. I try not to think about it too much because there is nothing I can do, and it was discovered when I was 62 so as the doctor said the chances of it growing before I die of something else are pretty slim. So hopefully it will be no brain surgery for me. I am sorry that you had to go through that and I hope you have recovered completely. I am 60 myself so I am with ya on that. I recovered pretty well, and I have always thought that due to the fact I was in decent shape (running for the last 8 years), to say nothing of my excellent doctors. \n\nI still laugh about my 6-week return visit. I am frustrated and in tears because \"I want my life back\", and the doctor &amp; staff were beyond thrilled at how much I would recovered and progressed. I was ORDERED to cut back on the walking I was doing! \n\nAt the time I was doing a work commute regularly between St. Louis and Omaha (my neurologist put a stop to that, and my employer graciously agreed to it). Well, the surgery was in August, and by late September it was getting pretty chilly. Unfortunately, my coat and cold weather clothes were up in Omaha. Now...technically...I was not supposed to be driving long distances, but...ahem...we figured this would be a good test to see how I was doing...because if it went well, we had plans to drive down to Florida to see our daughter. So under the guise of \"beg forgiveness not permission\", we made a quick weekend run so I could stay warm!\n\nAnd yeah, we ended up going to Florida too. :)", "Some exciting news on HIV drugs as a treatment ", "(20F) 5 years post operation facial paralysis.  for anyone who is going through the same thing and wants to see how other people have healed. Burry picture w/ the white top is how my face looked before facial paralysis at age 15 ", "Is it possible i have AN? ive suffered from dizziness episodes before and  recently i got tinnitus in one ear that went away but its started again now.. im also 15 so is it likely that this is AN? Have you went to a doctor? Of course it is possible, but it could be a lot of different things. You will not know until you go to the doctor and get an MRI.\n\n\nI just had a huge AN removed, and based on the size I had it for 5 - 10 years. It would have been way nicer to catch it when I was 18 and could have had more surgery options. Agreed. Go to an ENT and get checked out. Get an audiogram. Based on that, your doc will order an MRI if you have a difference in hearing between your two ears. That will settle the question It is possible. My daughter\u2019s roommate had an AN in her early 20s. Because her surgery was right before mine I was able to expect that I would not be watching TV  or reading in the hospital after surgery.", "Diagnosed with Acoustic Neuroma this morning after MRI This morning I found out I have a 4 x 5 mm AN on my right side. 3 weeks ago, I came down with a bad headache that lasted two weeks, followed by ongoing vertigo. I have a constant sense of unbalance. Fortunately, it has not affected my driving or walking around. I am very, very scared, the depression and anxiety I have had over the last few weeks have been totally debilitating I have lost 10 pounds and have gotten very few hours of sleep. I am most worried about steps going forward. Should I expect hearing loss? I have an ENT appointment on Friday to further discuss results and treatment. It is okay to be scared. I was really stunned when I was diagnosed, and it took me awhile to process. As much as I hate to say it, go to your ENT appointment and see what they have to say. You do have options, and you will get through this. 36 yo male, diagnosed with one in the same ballpark, size wise just yesterday.  I was actually relieved it was not something worse, in a way. To echo what has already been said, it is ok to be scared and completely natural. I am 38 diagnosed with a 7mm AN about a year ago, with symptoms going back at least a year before that. It was really hard to see past it after diagnosis and I was a bit of a state for quite a while but you will learn to make your peace with it. Do yourself a favour and let your body and mind relax a bit. Depression and anxiety will only make it all worse. You kind of said it yourself that your driving and walking around are fine i.e. when your brain is otherwise occupied. I am exactly the same whether it be driving, walking, running, cycling. The point is it does not stop you doing anything although I sometimes feel a bit wobbly afterwards! It is a bitch of a thing to be stuck with but there is a lot worse out there. Your follow up appointments and scans will determine how things will proceed. For me the 6 month follow up showed no growth so I have another scheduled for a year. It is new at the moment but once you have a plan of action it gets easier, believe me. Your words mean so much to me. When I left the  MRI imagining/hospital, I got on my car and wept. I cried and cried and cried. Half of me was relieved it was not a brain tumor, while the other half was scared and confused by what I am diagnosed with. I already deal with severe severe depression, on top of crippling anxiety. And this took me out completely. By the time I got home I just sat there and stared blankly at the wall for over an hour. Trying to process. Trying to accept. It sounds dramatic, but it feels like my life in crumbling. After reading what you wrote, I feel somewhat more at peace. I have read what you wrote over and over. I am in a state of just shock I guess. When I got my results and spoke with the radiologist, I thanked him, walked out to my car and just completely broke down. My body has been floored with stress and anxiety for weeks waiting for this MRI and results. I got home and just completely zoned out. Not a thought crossed my mind, but the feeling of hopelessness flooded my body. I wish I was relieved. I wish i was immediately optimistic. It is just not who I am. I am already a hypochondriac. I hope my appointment on Friday will give me some peace. It is been hard to remind myself that this is not the end of the world, eventually, everything will be okay. I wish I believed that. Thank you, your words mean a lot. I am going through a really hard time. I am glad what I said was a help of some sort. We are all different and will process these kinds of things differently, and it is all good. I am also not a naturally optimistic person so the temptation is to think 'well this is just typical that I would get something like this'. I have also suffered from depression and anxiety to varying degrees throughout my adult life, perhaps not to the same extent. You do not have to suddenly become an optimist about everything to deal with this but you will realise positive things about yourself. I also cried and cried like never before. To be honest I cannot remember the last time I had cried before, and it felt good actually. My experience of depression is one of numbness so the raw emotion was a relief of sorts. Strayed a bit off topic there but I guess it is all part of it. I suppose every moment we live there is something that could go wrong but they tend not to. You are still in charge of this situation. It can be hard and it is damn frightening. I would be more worried if you were not scared. Thank you for saying this. Made me feel a little less alone. Normal to be scared.  When I was diagnosed my ENT sent me for an MRI and on the follow up with the results they told me there was an \"irregularity\" and were sending me to a specialist.  That was it.  I had to wait a week wondering what was inside my head.\n\nTalking with your ENT and other doctors will help you understand the next steps. They may just tell you to \"wait and see\" if it impacts you.  There are many other options for treatment as well.  \n\nHearing loss may occur with some treatments (it did with me) and while it does seem crappy at first, you adjust. Yeah I am preparing myself for the \u201cwait and see\u201d option\u2026.. which I am worried my anxiety will absolutely destroy me through that. its a tough road but you are not alone i found out about mine 3 years ago on my 30th bday it was super hard but i got threw it and you will too you are not alone your going to be just fine xoxox Thank you so much for saying this, I really needed to hear it. 29 year old male here. Was diagnosed at 24. Have had two cranial surgeries since. Work in a highly demanding professional field. Feel free to message me if you have any questions. just make sure you take care of yourself for sure you will pull threw its been about 3 years for me and i find what helps is not to think our talk about it you know its there but you still have life to live ya know Can I PM you? 4 or 5 mm is small IMHO, which is great news. You may qualify for painless radiation-only treatment, such as with a LINAC machine (aka Linear Accelerator machine, which uses high-energy x-rays). sure Does that involve radiation? I have heard that radiation treatment is discouraged on young adults like myself\u2026. But it is honestly the option I am most interested in. I was diagnosed almost two weeks ago, my dm's are always open to talk.\n\nYou are not alone. I just commented on your post, I will be reaching out soon! I went through surgery recently to remove mine. PM me any questions you have ! I know the anxiety can be hard", "Bell's palsy after surgery? Anybody wind up with Bell's palsy after surgery?  A relative was diagnosed with a fairly large acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma) and was told there is about 70% of bell's palsy after an extremely invasive surgery.  Googling does not make it seem like it is that common. I just had surgery (translab) for a 25mm AN at UC San Diego in the US. I do not have an answer for you however, I would suggest your relative talk to a few other doctors to get additional opinions. Several AN programs will schedule a free consultation without having to get insurance approval. \n\nYou can also find a ton of great resources on  She is been several places so far and the place she is at now is about as good as you can get near us (ranked #3 in the nation according to google).  It sounds like they are doing a translab even though i have asked that a few times and nobody that is talked to the doctors have heard that term.  Apparently, there will be an ENT there during the surgery to fix her hearing as well. I had AN surgery five weeks ago via the medial fossa approach.  My AN was medium sized, ~2 cm x 1.5 cm.  I can tell you my experience thus far, and I have about 75-85% of my facial function back at this point.  At first, I had basically zero mobility of the right side of my face.  It rapidly improved over about two weeks.  Now it is maybe improving slowly.  Maybe not.  I actually would describe mine as a low-grade Bell\u2019s Palsy, essentially only viewable when I smile big.  When I activate the muscles hard it starts to get noticeably asymmetric.  \n\nI would have still had the surgery even knowing this would be the outcome.  Most of my hearing is preserved and I bounced back from the surgery pretty quick. I asked for a conservative (translab) surgery for my jumbo AN, meaning please surgeons try your best not to disturb the facial nerve. It was not disturbed, and I had no palsy effects. However, as a layman I was surprised by how much of the tumor remained after surgery. In fact, it grew back in a year, and I needed a repeat surgery, followed by LINAC radiation to \"kill the remaining tumor.\" Luckily the facial nerve can withstand a great deal of radiation. Still no palsy.   \n\n\nIf a surgeon is telling you that palsy is likely, he/she may be more interested with removing tumor than preserving your facial health IMHO. Some facial nerve paralysis is not uncommon. There are plenty of people in the acoustic neuroma Facebook group who have some degree of facial nerve paralysis after surgery.  However, I have never seen it referred to as Bell\u2019s palsy when related to AN surgery, which may be why you are not finding these together. It does not happened to everyone, but a large tumor is certainly a risk factor.", "Best hearing aid for AN? I have an acoustic neuroma on my left side, 3mmx4mm. Too small for surgery at this time. Side effects are moderate hearing loss and tinnitus. Can anyone recommend a good hearing aid brand and type for my situation? Thanks! I have almost the exact same situation. I have tried 3 so far. All 3 were completely in canal. The first was eargo which is a low cost solution that you can buy direct rather than from an audiologist. It is good... Good features like a recharging dock and app. Fit was ok. But then I tried a Starkey from an audiologist that was dialed in specifically to my prescription and it was light-years better.\n\nThe first Starkey cic I got was fine.. requires a battery swap every few days. No app or controls to speak of. But it does make a world of difference. I recently upgraded to a Starkey with a remote control for easy volume up and down, program changes etc. I am happy with it, but it is slightly bigger and I can \"feel\" it in my ear more.\n\nI am tempted to try the Starkey premium version where the hardware is behind the ear. They have the most features, recharging etc. It is just slightly more visible.\n\nBest bet I can say is go to your audiologist and test drive a few to see what you like best. Honestly, you get used to it over time.  \n\nMy AN side hearing is down to 25-30%, but I hardly ever think about it or even notice.  Life goes on. I have gotten used to it (being partially deaf) after 5 years. I am still noticing it and people are noticing it. So time to do something new! My ENT claims I will not regret it ;) Thank you for this valuable feedback! I did not know I could \u201ctest drive\u201d so I will definitely ask about that. I like the idea of behind the ear since having something in my ear seems like it would feel weird, but I am guessing you get used to the feeling pretty quick. I will definitely try the Starkey if I can get my hands on it. Okay, good luck.  I tried a bi-cross 4-5 years ago, but it just did not work for me.  Maybe you will have better luck. No prob. I had no idea you could test drive either!!\n\nStarkey is probably the biggest brand so your audiologist should have it. It is kind of a racket though as prices are not published...\n\nIt feels weird but after a few weeks you do not notice. I would be interested to know your experience. Did you find it did not help you hear better at all? My biggest pains are low talkers who are male (lower frequencies are hard), people speaking in a room with background noise, like a restaurant, and dialogue in movies when watching at home. Sure, it helped a little in restaurants and movies, but I guess it just did not help enough for me to keep using it after just a few weeks.  I find positioning (seating, etc) myself with my good ear is critical.  \n\nBTW, I had Gamma Knife radiation for my AN in 2014.  It seems to have worked to halt any further growth.  I even stopped getting annual MRIs after a few years because it seems to have stabilized. \n\nAlso, I started my own business a few years ago, so now my days are mostly spent alone.  I used to work in an office where my diminished hearing and tinnitus were a nuisance.  Now, I have peace and quiet all day.  Obviously, not everyone can start their own business, but my point is that there are other ways to adapt to the situation. \n\nI wish you all the best! When I reached a point where my hearing loss was so bad the hearing aid I was using could not compensate, my ENT showed me a set of Phonak CROS aids and suggested I test-drive them for a week.\n\nWhen I returned I told him I was giving them back under protest. These things were incredible and I got a set for myself as soon as I could.", "Anybody have Hydrocephalus before microsurgery? What does hydrocephalus feel like? I have a 4cm AN and the surgeons tell me that hydrocephalus is the main risk in waiting around and gathering more information, because tumors have an irregular growth rate. I had a 5.5cm AN with a midline shift and swollen optic nerves that was causing me a world of other issues before I was diagnosed. My symptoms got progressively worse over a period of six years while my AN was probably 15+ years old. My symptoms were hearing loss, vertigo, blurred vision, eyesight going black when getting up real quick, general clumsiness, feeling drunk and stupid, foggy headed, and crazy eyeball piercing headaches. Symptoms would often  come and go and I usually would have only one or two symptoms at the same time. Many of the symptoms I just learned to live with and thought it was just part of getting old.\n\nFrom my own situation, nothing happened overnight so I feel that you have some time but, certainly take action if you notice anything getting worse. I appreciate the response and also from another post glad that you are doing well Did you have any weird throat sensations? Have all of your symptoms improved, other than your hearing of course? Left side hearing loss is permanent and the left side of my face is partially paralyzed, like a Bell's Palsy thing. Chewing and smiling is a little lop-sided and I have a platinum weight inside my left eyelid to help me blink. My balance gets off a little sometimes, but I have never taken a fall. Lastly, eating is a little messy and my left eye waters and left nostril drips when I chew crunchy foods.\n\nI think everything on the left side was a little numb for the first month or two, but the numbness has since gone away.", "What Are the Symptoms of AN? Can somebody please direct me to a list of possible symptoms for AN? I have searched, but cannot find such. Thanks. I am not a doctor and I cannot really supply you with a list, but I can tell you the symptoms that I had and the symptoms that I have heard from others. I had a noted hearing loss in my left ear, I had tinnitus it would not go away (even after treatment it does not go away). Other people have had balance issues, tingling in the face, and perhaps a few other things. What makes you think you have one? I found a list at Johns Hopkins Medicine. I do not know what I have. It is pretty painful, but does not fit the classic AN symptoms. I had progressive deafness in my ear and eventually had facial numbness. By the time the numbness became relevant enough my tumor was getting awfully close to my brain stem. I unknowingly had every major symptom of an acoustic neuroma...and did not have one. You need a specific MRI  to look for one. One of the symptoms is marked  hearing loss in a specific tone, which is where the tumor would be. With mine, small 7mm AN, I was repeatedly told I had no hearing loss. I actually know one of the guys who did a hearing test on me. When I told him it turned out to be AN he was surprised to say the least. On a follow up hearing test the lady performing it said she would never seen such good hearing in someone with an acoustic neuroma. The reason I was looking for the hearing tests was that I had a sense of my ear being blocked but obviously no objective hearing loss. My other symptoms are mild balance issues. I suppose my point is that they are tricky little buggers. There is no point second guessing your symptoms. There is a sure fire way to find out which is an MRI, so get one if you can. It will either put your mind at ease or you can start dealing with it if you are one of the unlucky ones I was told having made 2 visits to ENT in 6 months made it a possibility and the mri confirmed it. My symptoms were hearing loss and balance issues. I am sorry to hear this. How big and what is your advised course of action? Thanks for the feedback everyone. Yeah I had absolutely no pain. I would suggest you get yourself into a neurologist as soon as possible and request an MRI. You do not want to mess with the possible brain tumor.\nGood luck! go to anausa.org\n\nacoustic neuroma association So, after getting yours removed, have you noticed any improvement with the sensation of your ear being blocked or the balance issues? I have not had it removed, and do not have any intention to unless it shows growth. It was stable on my 6 month follow up scan and I am happy enough with that. Any reason why you had not had it removed yet? I think there are plenty of reasons. At the end of the day I am guided by medical professionals I have seen here in Ireland. The process is to follow up the initial scan that identified the AN with another one after 6 months to try to ascertain if it is growing. They have decided that it is not and will scan again in a year. This seems a sensible approach as there is no guarantee of outcome with surgery.", "AN removed a week ago I had an AN 2.5x1.6x1.5 removed last Wednesday using RETROSIGMOID surgery. \n\nEverything went well, had ton leave a bit of tumor as it was inside the ear canal. Surgery was about 3.5 hours (from opening i think)\n\nFeeling some discomfort, mostly around the incision and scalp but minimum pain after first night.\n\nWorking on recovering balance That is great that your pain is not too bad. I was taking something for pain (headaches) constantly for like two weeks and then just at night for another week or so. \n\nMake sure to keep doing your exercises for regaining balance even after you feel ok walking. For me the hardest thing ended up being driving. That back and forth head movement to check for traffic when making a left from a side road was tough.\n\nYou have to be mindful when doing other unusual movements as well. I almost fell over when standing and watching a fly ball go over me at a baseball game. Then there was the time I ran off the trail while riding my bike and looking over my shoulder for approaching traffic.\n\nTake it a day at a time and try not to get discouraged if things do not progress as quickly as you want. You will get there eventually! Thank you! Sounds like you are doing great!!  I still need Tylenol or ibuprofen daily for pressure headaches. My surgery was a bit more invasive and I had to go back in the following for spinal fluid leakage. They took all of my inner ear out to repair. I am almost 3 months post surgery and am getting back to normal. Minus the stereo hearing and good balance. I am hoping balance continues to improve. Have not tried biking yet. I tried a spin bike first, probably one month after surgery. I would practice looking over my shoulder and looking down. After 2 weeks, I tried a bmx bike because it was low to the ground and rode around a nearby park. I finally got back to road cycling by month 2 and rode in a place closed to cars. Eventually, I felt comfortable returning to roads with traffic and I use a garmin radar and helmet mirror so I can be alerted to oncoming traffic. Both devices help. 5 months post surgery now, I am still not great looking over my shoulder as it makes me swerve, but it gets better every week. Bottom line is to start slow and stay within your comfort zone. My balance is improving, i am not sure I would pass a sobriety test tho :-)\n\nI am having some double vision when I wake up and it lasts about one hour, maybe a bit less.\n\nI have check-up wednesday with a neurology nurse, i am planning to ask about driving Sorry i missed this question. Both neurosurgeon and neurologist were there. How is hearing? It is been 6 months now, the right ear is totally deal, the other one is fine\n\nThanks for asking", "Hi, I am new here. I just came from the ENT and they suspect AN.  I will be going for the MRI in August.  Any ideas what I might expect?  How soon did you get the results? I had been suffering from symptoms for around two years before I finally went to the emergency room with the hope of getting a referral to a neurologist. I had a MRI and was admitted overnight to discuss surgery options with the team in the morning.  This was a Wednesday and I had my surgery on Monday. Thank you for replying!  Can I ask how the surgery went?  How long was your recovery and did you have any lasting side effects? Surgery was without incident and I was able to regain control of my facial muscles. I did lose most of my hearing in my left ear.  Waking up in the PACU was loud and awful!  I never had headaches or loss of hearing but I did have a whole other slew of weird symotoms.\n\nBe prepared to be utterly exhausted.   I am extremely independent and it was hard being that wiped out just making a trip to the store for a gallon of milk.  I was also taking some heavy steroids which made sleep impossible and put me through an emotional roller coaster. Dont be discouraged to use your walker and you will need some sort of shower chair for when you are able to shower again.\n\nMy bad ear would \"twang\" for months. It was annoying but I became used to it and it really doesnt do it at all anymore.\n\nI was off of work for 8 weeks and not allowed to lift anything over 10 lbs for fear of tearing open the incision. \n\nI was worried they might shave off a lot of my hair but I only lost a little and it grew back in no time.\n\nThe only long term affects I have dealt with is the single sided deafness and i still feel very uneasy on my feet around stairs. (I think this is more from being so clumsy and unbalanced for so long though due to the AN and just adjusting to it)  Being in a room with a lot of low level noise is hard since it makes it harder to hear and carry on a conversation but it is not impossible.  \n\nPlease let me know if there is anything else you would like to know!  I hope this helps you somewhat. Thank you.  Unfortunately losing my hearing could strongly impact my job (I am a speech therapist.).  So I am quite concerned.  My right ear is already showing a sensorineural mild loss.  \n\nDid you do radiation prior to surgery? I did not.\n\nI was about 9 months pregnant in 2014 and I noticed I had started to develop some numbness around my tongue and upper lip.  It reminded me of when you eat too many sour candies and your mouth is tingly from them.  Spoke with my doc about it and they suspected it was Bell's Palsy brought on by my pregnancy.  I was told to call them if it became worse.\n\nI never got around to discussing it with them and ended up moving to Arkansas to start a new job.  Over time, I developed many symptoms that I really dismissed to working out too much or to thyroid issues.  I had a thyroidectomy in 2012 and have issues staying regulated ever since. \n\nMy eyes would water non-stop at times.  My balance just became worse and worse. (in the end I would take baby steps everywhere to avoid falling and would have to have a hand on the wall as a guide). I started to drool out of one side of my mouth when I was talking.  My right hand would cramp terribly when I would write and my handwriting went from neat to barely legible. I fell all the time. I had a slight facial droop but I didnt really notice it at the time.  The numbness spread from my tongue and upper lip all the up to the top of my head. (I could still feel but it was  like when you come off of novocaine after dental work...not quite numb, not quite fully aware).  People told me after words my thoughts were all over the place and they had difficulty having a full conversation with me.  I remember feeling like sometimes words would get stuck in my mouth and my tongue didnt want to cooperate when trying to speak.  The night before I decided to go to the ER, the road was spinning and I had difficulty driving to work that night.\n\nI had tried to get in to see a neurologist but you had to have a referral and they werent taking outside cases at that time. I had worked all night and had three different patients ask me if I was okay because of my stumbling and clumsiness and I was worried they might say I was intoxicated at work. I went down to the ER when I got off that morning and the rest is history.\n\nSorry this is so long.\n\nI never had hearing loss or headaches.  My tumor was pressing on my brainstem which was causing all of the other issues. Hi bookmom25,\n\n\nI found out I had an AN in September 2015 because of tinnitus in my left ear.  I had it removed in December 2015.\n\nMy surgery went great and I had no complications.  I am not sure where you are based, but NYU Langone is great for AN surgeries and their team is FANTASTIC.  I was out of the hospital in 3 days, walking normally in 2 weeks, fully functioning / exercising in 6 weeks - 2 months.  Walk as much as you can when you regain your strength, it will help you get stronger faster.\n\nMy face was perfectly fine, although some numbness / redness at times on my left side.  I ended up losing hearing in my left ear completely, but I had the BAHA surgery in August 2016 to help restore some function in that ear, and it is really been helpful.  I still have that same tinnitus from pre-surgery, so that has stayed.\n\n3/4 years on, long term effects have been the tinnitus, mild headaches, numbness in the face at times, and the hearing of course.  Let me know if you have any other questions! Good morning,\n\nIf you do not mind me asking questions, I would appreciate it.  The MRI just confirmed the diagnosis for me this week, so I am new to all of this.\n\nHow large was the AN when you were diagnosed?    \nWhat approach did they take for the surgery?  \n\nI have an appointment scheduled with a local neurologist and have the paperwork for getting seen at Johns Hopkins.  My AN is still small (2-3mm) so I am hoping that there are options. \n\nThanks for any information. Of course!\n\nMine was quite big already (5-6mm I believe), so I had no choice but to operate through my ear or I was guaranteed to have had facial paralysis.\n\nIf yours is quite small, I would suggest taking the other route (I believe it is behind the ear) where you will not lose your hearing but risk facial paralysis.  With smaller tumors, though, it is the preferred options and you most likely will only suffer small issues with your facial nerves.  I have also heard the gamma knife surgery is quite good, but I was not given that option.  It is very precise with little to no issues post ops, but only works with smaller tumors.\n\nI know the diagnosis seems daunting at first, but really it is quite common and everything will go back to normal afterwards! Thank you for your reply!\nRight now it only is barely a problem most days, but this morning I am feeling \u201coff\u201d.  \n\nDid you find that things like sleeping on your back or looking up would impact it at all? Definitely not, I am fine with both of them!", "My ENT recommended a CT with contrast to exclude acoustic neuroma/other brain tumor for insurance and cost-related reasons. Is an MRI necessary or is CT fine? I am in my mid twenties, have had continuous vertigo for 2 months, some facial paralysis/tingling on the right side and some hearing loss in my right ear according to a recent hearing test. He told me it is still unlikely that it would be a tumor though, because it is incredibly rare. I have heard that MRIs are less hazardous than CTs but was told they can be many times more expensive. I am also attending vestibular rehabilitation therapy and am hoping they can solve my issues without the expensive imaging. Do you think it is worth getting the CT? I cannot afford to get a second opinion.", "New Subreddit Hey, created this as i was trying to do some research on AN's after my diagnosis, i do not have much at the moment as i was diagnosed only a few months ago.. will share information when i have it and will try and answer any questions etc. Thanks for creating this. I hope it gains some traction in the coming months. My mom is having surgery to remove an advanced acoustic neuroma in 1 month and I will be sure to share experiences here! Yeah. I am sure it will.\n\nOne of the first things I did when I got diagnosed was to look on Reddit. Was surprised that nothing existed already!", "Doctor, I hear MUSIC ! | Musical ear syndrome | Musical Hallucinations | Medical videos ", "gofundme for reuniting with my fianc\u00e9 who just underwent an acoustic neuroma surgery ", "Anyone been prescribed prednisone for sudden tinnitus? First of all hello! This is my first time in this sub, I did not realize a whole community of people with AN was just one Reddit search away! I discovered my AN about 4 years ago and have not really had any issues from it, in fact most of the time these days I forget it is even there. But 2 days ago now I went to bed hearing some ringing and it has not stopped since. I went to the ER worried something might be wrong and they prescribed me prednisone to help any inner-ear swelling, hoping that was the reason for the sudden tinnitus/hearing loss. Has this happened to anyone else? Could this help or am I stuck hearing this ringing now? I was prescribed prednisone, yes.  I ultimately was diagnosed with a small AN near my cochlea.  I think I was really unlucky to get this outcome from what they told me (though lucky that it is small and not near my brain stem) Yeah I think I am in the same boat, mines only 9.5mm x 5.8mm on the scan and not too close to the brain. Did the medication help the tinnitus at all? Or did your ringing continue? Are you still taking it?\n\nEdit: sorry not trying to spam you or get you to say anything you are not comfortable with sharing! No pressure to respond, all my questions come from a place of trying to understand only My tinnitus has diminished a bit.  Sometimes it creeps back up a smidge, but I think my brain is acclimating. I have a 3x3 mm AN in a not great spot. My first symptom was tinnitus. I did nothing. A couple of weeks later I realized my hearing on that side had diminished when I put the phone to my left ear and could barely hear the person. I called my doc who immediately called a specialist who immediately sent me for a hearing test and put me on a high dose of prednisone. Afterwards my second hearing test was slightly better but I still have moderate hearing loss and tinnitus is still there. I would get your hearing test if you have not had one recently and maybe an MRI to check if the AN has grown. I am guessing you are doing those annually but my ENT would bump it up if there is any change in symptoms. Not the greatest news but I will say that after 4 years of tinnitus my brain has acclimated very well and I only notice it when in a quiet place.", "good resource for information I used this website \n\nTo watch previous videos posted on the ANA website.

For personal reasons. It is 3 years already. That is advice you should only take from a doctor.\nI personally felt the same way.\nI thought seeing as an acoustic neuroma is usually slow growing I will be fine.\nBut it was not worth risking it. \nIf it impacts the brain stem you could have other complications. \nWhatever happens please just take notice of any advice from healthcare professionals not faceless people hiding behind a keyboard.\nGood luck fellow AN warrior. Thank you so much, I am doing my best to start dealing with it. I am currently saving for the Mri cost and i do not know where to go from that. I hope things go well. It is hard to say.  Even doctors cannot predict the outcome 100%.  I was told that I was good for a year.  I did exactly that.  They discovered that my tumor had accelerated growth during that year.  They did not tell me to come in if I had a change in symptoms.  When they did my surgery that thing had grown a lot in that last year.\n\nDid you have an MRI 3 years ago where they found it? Tough to say.  I would definitely talk with your doctor about this.  As the tumor grows, your symptoms will also likely increase, as will the potential to have complications such as hearing loss.  Unfortunately by the time mine was discovered, it was too late.  I lost my hearing and am having some other problems that, fingers crossed, will go away as my body heals.  The only issue I had before surgery was some hearing loss and tinnitus.  I woke up and was SSD with tinnitus still, problems with my throat/voice box that prevented me from talking and eating easily, facial weakness, inability to close my eye, no tears in AN side eye, and tons of dizziness.  If mine was discovered a few years earlier, I would like to think I would be in a better place today.", "Musical ear syndrome / AN - do any of you have this too? I am a 37 yo male with a 1.6 cm AN on my right ear.  Medial fossa surgery scheduled for June. I have a weird symptom that I was thinking was associated with my AN, but my doc does not think so.  Do any of you have similar experiences?\n\nOver the past 4-5 months I have begun to hear music-like sounds that I know are not really there. Whenever I notice it is happening, it quiet (at night or during the work day in my office). It is been getting more noticeable over the past 2 months. The pitch / frequency spectrum of the sounds are all similar. Sometimes it sounds like a baby crying, sometimes it sounds like an 80\u2019s guitar solo, and sometimes it sounds like music. It sounds like its coming off to the right, always the same direction on the right. It has a low, but noticeable volume. I am always able to tell it is not real, except a few times when it sounds like my son crying and I do not know.\n\nAnother strange detail is that occasionally, I am able to control the sounds. By this I mean I am able to voluntarily vary the tonal progression of the music. In these cases, I am hearing a song that I have never heard before, and I am able to make that song sound like whatever I want.\n\nWeird stuff, and I am a little freaked out.  I was surprised and disappointed that my doc thought it was not associated with the AN.\n\nThanks a ton for any insight you can share! Have you researched auditory hallucinations? I cannot prove any actual connection, but anecdotally I can say I have an 11 mm AN and I occasionally have them\u2014only on my AN side\u2014as I am falling asleep. A few weeks ago it happened twice. First was like a weird airhorn-like noise. The second was like radio static and voices, like 1 second of walkie talkie noise in my ear. Each time, only the AN side, and loud like it was right there in my bedroom.  I am consulting with a new ENT-neuro team on Monday and am planning to mention it.  Oh and I also have regular old tonal tinnitus all the time, occasional Morse code tinnitus, and occasional pulsatile tinnitus. Thank you for your response!  This sounds very similar to what I am experiencing--at night mostly, when things are quiet.  What I hear could easily sound like static / voices, but I mostly interpret it as music.    \n\nI also mentioned it to my neurosurg/ENT team, and the ENT told me he thought it was unrelated and neurosurg never replied. \n\nSorry to hear about all your tinnitis! I just figured out this is what I have, for me it is fan noise.  It does not always happen, I always just assumed I had especially keen hearing and I could hear things too faint for others and I do have noisy neighbors so I just brushed it off.\n\nBut last night I could have sworn there was faint Italian opera coming from my range hood while I cooked dinner.  I almost took the grates off to look for a bluetooth speaker someone hid as a prank.  However when the fan stopped so did the music.  I have had it happen with other fan noises and I even get different music.  Sometimes it is Mariachi, or Sinatra all sorts of genres.  Always very faint, indistinct but musically recognizable.\n\nI will eventually talk to a doctor but it seems I am not going insane as apparently this is actually not that uncommon. Thanks for following up--I too suspected it has something to do with background noise.  I have not made sense of what this means, so please let me know if you learn anything! I hear music as soon as I lay down for the night. I oftentimes use a fan... But it is not always on when I hear the music. Have u been exposed to mold recently? I get the same thing and just found my washing machine had been leaking for a year in brand new apt.   There was so much water damage and Mold. A month before I found it I have been hearing music non stop. Ugh the worst! No, not that I am aware of.  My guess is that this is related to spurious or reduction in auditory nerve activity.  In my case, a tumor on these nerves may be to blame.", "My neurologist said that there are probably only 10 people in the world with a tumor like mine. First, I do not think he was quoting actual statistics, but stressing how rare my variation is.  It is very small  \\ and still completely in the fundus.  It has not grown in 2 years since diagnosis and I have had symptoms that go back as far as 30 or more years.  It is possible I have had it that long and it was not until I had the one sided mild hearing loss + bouts of vertigo that I was diagnosed.  \n\nDoes anyone else have similar experiences? Hmmmm mine is 3 mm. It has not grown in  5 years since symptoms started (hearing loss and tinnitus) and it is discovery. However I am unsure of it is specific location. Can I tell by looking at my MRI? Sounds like the positioning of yours is part of the \u201crareness\u201d. I am not sure it is nearly as rare as he thinks.  But if you want to compare MRIs I would be willing! Mine is on the inferior branch.  So it makes sense since that branch attaches to the saccule that the head movements that are problematic for me are tilting my head back.  It also makes sense that it is only when there is inflammation or stress that movements when I swing dance are fine until I dance with a partner that goes back and forth. I have no issues with vertigo but it makes sense that you do based on your explanation. Hopefully you continue to have no growth.", "Is this a symptom?

It is my right ear, and for the past 3 days my neck has been visibly swollen, I guess you would say lymph nodes? Although there are no lumps or hard bumps. Googling these symptoms together has given me less than 5 years to live..  however I feel Google says the same if you have a hangnail. ;)\n\nDoes an AN come with swollen neck or lymph nodes on the one side where the tumor is suspected? My sinus are clear, I do not have a fever. \n\nAny insight is appreciated!\n\nGL Nothing points to it definitely being or not being an AN. Neck swelling could still be something unrelated to your hearing issues. Best to wait for the MRI results, which really should not take more than a day. I expected a call a week ago with the results. I am hoping no news is good news. Just wondering if I should have this neck/ lymph looked at. It is really only one symptom outside of the ear issues. You should give the ENT's office a call about the MRI. I got my results the same afternoon that I got the scan, so there is no reason to still be wondering more than a week later. While doing that you can ask them if you should come in for the other issue. The doctor who laughed is not going to be affected by it. There is only a small chance that you have it, but any ENT that knows what they are doing will recommend an MRI. Exactly. He retired. I am just here inquiring about swelling on the affected side to see if anyone else has also had this happen... while I wait for the results.

Does it get worse?  What was your experience? Hi :-)\n\nI was diagnosed in May 2019 with a 4mm x 7mm AN on right side. Symptoms are slight balance issues ( wobbly, like I have been on a boat all day), hearing loss and low-pitch tinnitus that is occasionally high-pitch for several seconds, especially when I stress out. The AN has grown since first Dxd but only a little, with a little additional hearing loss and increased tinnitus.\n\nThe #1 best place to find info and a great discussion forum is the Acoustic Neuroma Association website. :-) Hi, I had surgeryin2011...the tinnitus stays.  It is weird, but I get used to it.  Mine gets worse in noisy areas and my other ear, no AN, gets bad in quiet.... My tinnitus got worse. Way worse.\n\nBut I am used to it now 4 years out. Worse. But improves with time as you get adjusted to it. Mine got somewhat worse and is permanent but deep breathing and acceptance help somewhat. Sometimes I will realize that I have not noticed it for while if I am engrossed in a book or on Reddit; my reaction to it is worse at night when getting to sleep but cbd oil helps.\n\nI would suggest having the surgery as fast as possible, I waited 6 months and the tumor became significantly worse and had to be removed from facial nerves.

It basically got stuck in my throat.  My mouth was also numb and metallic tasting.  My neurosurgeon stated that the problem was likely due to the intubation since the facial nerve does not affect the throat.  After about a month, I was able to eat solid food again and about 3 months later my eating returned to nearly normal.  I am 10 months post op now.  I was under the impression that the intubation was the culprit for my ongoing issues with a dry throat and issues speaking.  Cough drops help me get through most days, but the issue persists.  I finally went to my ENT yesterday and he scoped my throat to look for any issues.  He did not find anything wrong whatsoever.  After I described my initial symptoms, he determined that the problem is related to my vagus nerve.  Just wondering if anyone else had similar issues after their surgery and whether they eventually cleared up.  I read of one other person who had the same issues with their throat and voice box.  It cleared up for them after about 1 1/2 years.  Would love to hear from others who have/had similar issues.", "MRI update, any radiologists amongst you?

I got diagnosed with an AN 7 months ago and decided to get treated with Gamma knife radiosurgery. I performed gamma knife 6 months ago and yesterday I had the MRI follow up. Well the MRI showed shrinkage of the tumor and significant necrosis within the tumor, so everything points out to a good prognosis and I hope it continues like this. I got so relieved because the diagnosis and the treatment affected my mental state so much and wanted to share with you all the good news.\nLove and support to you all! Congratulations, that is a great result. Were there any side effects to your gamma knife treatment? Can I ask why you went the radiation route with you being so young? I am weighing up my options for a 7mm AN and I am noticing that they lean towards surgery for younger patients. I felt fatigued for 3 days after gamma knife but other than that nothing. I chose radiation because the tumor  was near the facial nerve and with surgery I would get paralyzed on the right side of my face, and I was terrified at that time doctors drilling a hole in my head so we went with radiation. They say gamma knife has 85-90% success rate, I always doubt if we did the right choice or will I have side effects from gamma knife in the long term or will I get cancer or whatever but me, my family and doctors did what we thought was right and I hope I will be okay in the future I am sure it will be fine as it is such an accurately delivered dose of radiation. I am not keen on the idea of having my head cut open either but I guess I will go with the advice of the consultants when I see them. Obviously it would be better not to have one in the first place but it is great that there are options for treatment and good to see positive stories like yours. Keep us posted on your progress. That is great news! How was getting radiation? I had surgery done and my doctor is planning on doing gamma knife to clean it up basically", "Reassurance that I am not crazy for thinking this is an AN. I woke up on December 16th with a killer headache that has not gone away since. It is a constant dull ache &amp; I feel a lot of pressure in there. A week into the headache I developed a constant ringing in both ears that also has not gone away since. Then last week I noticed I was experiencing some slight hearing loss. I had found myself needing to turn the car stereo volume louder than usual &amp; that I was having to have my partner repeat himself often while we were sitting on the couch watching TV.\n\nI finally saw a doctor yesterday. All she was able to do was a very simple audio test that did show hearing loss in my right ear. She prescribed me Naproxen 500mg for the headache &amp; referred me to ENT.

Over the years I have experienced unexplained nausea &amp; vomiting. I have had dizzy spells with no explanation, including a rough spot where I had to sit in my car for four hours until extreme dizziness passed enough for me to drive safely. I have felt a lot of numbness in my hands, feet, &amp; mouth that comes &amp; goes. I suffer from extreme fatigue that does not go away no matter what changes are made.\n\nAll of this has happened within the last 10 years. Because the symptoms would come &amp; go and that I have been on a million psych meds, we always assumed it was side effects.

I read and researched everything about ANs, but I really wanted to know if I would ever be able to return to the hobbies I enjoy the most.\n\n The answer, for me, is yes and I am very fortunate to have had a great team of doctors, a supportive group around me, and a little determination. \n\nFor those of you diagnosed with an AN, or if you have a loved one with an AN, I really hope my positive outcome will give you a little comfort knowing that you will be OK.

At the moment, I am a bit worried about the random onset of symptoms so I generally refrain from high-intensity workouts or running anywhere but on a treadmill.\n\nThe path ahead of me is long, as I am currently scheduled for a second MRI and going from there. In the meantime, your words are encouraging and reassuring that I might get back out there again. My Strava is silent for now, but I enjoyed seeing yours and knowing that feeling again of seeing a long run completed.  Keep the faith and motivation. I run also and trail running is still a little tricky for me. When trail running, I get the feeling like my balance is off. I never really trail ran much though, and I prefer hard surfaces due to a history of knee surgeries. I found that any obstacle on my deaf left side seems to throw me off and I feel much more comfortable keeping that side open.

I was out of work 4 weeks (desk job) and after the first few days had wished I had taken another week or two. By 6-8 weeks, I was pretty much back to normal with the exception of headaches. While they gradually lessened, they were bad enough that I was taking pain meds for about 18 months after.  According to my surgeon, having these incision site inflammation related headaches that long is rare but I did not feel \u201crecovered\u201d until that was over.

I had surgery to remove a cyst and the larger part of the tumor,  and then GK about 6 weeks after that to kill off remaining tumor. I did not go back to work FT for 5 months but I was also recovering from another surgery at the time  This was 15 years ago. Retained much of my hearing. I wish you the best in your recovery. 5.5cm translab one year and 10 days ago. It was about 11.5 hours long and during peak COVID lockdown. Balance was wonky for a few weeks post op but was on a bicycle in about a month. I still have some facial paralysis, a weight in my eyelid to help me blink, and loss of hearing on my left side.

I am on the far end of the bell curve. 9-1/2 months post middle fossa surgery and still cannot drive, have trouble changing positions (like from sitting to standing, cooking, etc) and I cannot drive. Horrible headaches. Mild tinnitus, mild hearing loss. No facial paralysis. I consider myself disabled. Oh wow. Do you see any physical therapists to help? Yes I have been in intense vestibular physical therapy for nine months. I am on a month break, but continue to take daily mile and a half walks. There has been no discernible improvement except for me adapting to my condition and not being as afraid of it. But the perception is the same. I feel like someone is in my head pushing me forward. I feel like a drunken sailor on a stormy sea. I have to concentrate on my movements when I walk. It is as if you were trying to pretend you are not drunk when you are walking, as if you do not want anyone to know you are drunk. It is so exhausting! I had my surgery at University of California, San Diego, but I live in Central/Northern California now. I recently found a top-notch neurologist here. He is the one who told me I may be on the far side of the bell curve. I am sorry you are having such a difficult recovery. But i can relate to the feeling a bit. I had surgery July 2021 and just now finally feeling somewhat \"normal\" and able to drive locally definitely not long drives or highway. I am still in physical  therapy it helps me I think. How large was your tumor? What approach did they use for surgery? Mine was 1 cm and I had middle fossa. 1 cm is 0.39 inches Mine was 3.5 cm. And they did the retro Sigmoid approach for surgery My mom had surgery for a 3.1 CM tumor in June and was driving me (by herself) to and from my nose job 3 weeks later. Feel free to message me as I was heavily involved in her care &amp; can offer a lot of information!", "Newly diagnosed, not sure what to expect Hi I am 30 from the UK and I have just been diagnosed with An in my left ear.\n\nDue to covid restrictions in the hospital I was informed over the phone and sort of switched of once I heard tumor. The consultant did not tell me the size and I did not think to ask so In going to call back soon and wondered if you could suggest any other questions to ask.\n\nAlso what am I supposed to feel right now? I wasnt that worried about the diasnosis until I looked online and saw 'brain tumor' then started reading all sorts of things some that made me anxious and others that reassured me it was not serious. I genuinely have no idea what to think.\n\nJ Hello\u2026 I am sorry for your diagnosis, but let me just tell you things could be a lot worse. \n\nAcoustic neuromas generally speaking, by a very large majority, are benign and extremely slow growing. Depending on the size, which you do need to know, you have three options; wait and watch, radiation (of which there are different kinds I got three zaps of radiation), or if it is too large for radiation then surgery. \n\nSince they are so slow growing often wait and see is an option for a few years. You will have an MRI every year or so and they document its growth (not all of them grow at the same rate) but at some point, especially since youre young, you will need to deal with it (medical science improves every year so you might have better options later!).  If it is radiation like I had, it was easy peezy. I have since had three follow up MRI\u2018s and the tumor appears to be dead, however with radiation it stays in your head but your symptoms do not get any worse as long as it stays dead.  \n\nIf you need surgery the odds are you will lose complete hearing in your left ear. Not great, but not horrible because it is still not cancer! \n\nWhat are your symptoms? None of your symptoms for the most part will go away but they could quite possibly improve if the tumor shrinks a little from radiation which it usually does. If you have tinnitus that will not go away, but sometimes the facial paralysis and vertigo might go away (I did not have either of those).\n\nTruly, when I got my diagnosis and immediately read up on it I was relieved in that, if you are going to have a brain tumor this is probably the kind to have. Because again, it is not cancer! So my advice is to relax a little, get the size information and treatment options from your doctor and team, and roll with it. I know it sucks, but it is not cancer!\n\nGood luck! I would ask about size first. I am willing to wager that they will recommend a \"wait and see\" approach as mentioned in the comments. My two major problems were hearing loss and balance issues, and if I am recalling correctly it was about two years from diagnosis to gamma knife radiation surgery. \n\nHonestly, it is okay to be rattled. Even with one of these, it is still initially disquieting knowing that it is in there, and it takes time to come to grips with it. \n\nThe one thing I would be careful about is discussing it with friends and family. Emphasize that it is a growth, not a tumor. Big difference. Then again, I did have some fun with my brother over it. He is one of those people that if made up a disease and told him about it, by the end of the conversation he would be showing symptoms. When I told him about mine, it went like this:\n\nHim: \"So what causes it?\"\n\nMe: \"They do not know.\"\n\nHim: \"Is it a hereditary thing?\"\n\nMe: \"THEY DO NOT KNOW...\" Thanks! Really helpful.\n\nI have tinnitus which is what prompted me to do to the doctors in the first place, I also had dizzyness but that went away pretty quickly and seemed to as a result of the Bbq maneuvers I was told to do so not sure if that is related (something I need to ask the doctor about).\n\nI am going to contact the doctor tomorrow so I will ask about treatment and size too.\n\nThanks again! Thanks yeah it look likes wait and see, they have booked me in for another mri scan in 3-6 months (waiting for confirmation letter), it is just a bit overwhelming, I have told my wife and her parents and they general reply was at least its not cancer and it could be worse, I know they are right but still scary. \n\nThanks for the reassurance, I knew reddit would sort me out! \n\nJ You are welcome, keep me posted, and if you would like to DM me you may do that as well!  Best of luck! Hell yes it is scary. And that is okay. But you are doing the right things and you will be okay. You might not need any sort of treatment/surgery for years if at all--these things tend to grow very, very slowly. Just be prepared to spend a few hours every 6-12 months inside one of those MRI machines. Hey. \n\nEntirely normal. I did the exact same thing. Spent 2 weeks on Google going through a lot of reading. \n\nYou are likely going to be referred to a base skull specialist who will probably do a contrast MRI. And you will be monitored unless they think they need to operate. \n\nMine is 11mm if I remember correctly. Watch and wait and nothing has happened in 2 year apart from my hearing has degraded. \n\nWhat to feel... I felt pretty scared and out of control, having a thing in your head felt like a weakness and a failing and I was miserable. \n\nThe acoustic neuroma FB groups are usually filled with old people or people with chronic issues, be aware that the people who are getting\n\n on with life or have minor symptoms are not usually on those types of groups about how it is a minor inconvenience. \n\nIt is not going to change your life expectancy, may require scary surgery or radiation  (unlikely at our age) but aside from that.. I mostly forget about it on day to day - however I know that is not the case for everyone. \n\nDo not read into the vegan diets/sugar free/detox stuff. It is utter rubbish and will not \"shrink the tumour because you are starving it of sugar\"\n\nAnd remember. It is a benign tumour and not cancerous. It is not going to spread or anything else scary. \n\nFeel free to DM if you want to chat to another British person your age in a similar situation. Yeah. I rang my girlfriend and told her \"I told you something was up, I have got a brain tumour\" before she burst into tears.. \n\nApparently leading with benign brain tumour is better and she told me off \ud83e\udd23 I did not get that option. My wife\u2019s a nurse and her job gives her a wealth of information. I called her and said, \u201cHey, they told me I have got an acoustic something or other, what is that?\u201d and with ten minutes I had a ton of reading assignments! She is pretty awesome, to say the least. Had surgery 2 weeks ago (63F). I am almost back to normal. My hearing had deteriorated significantly, pretty much useless but during the surgery they were able to save the hearing nerve although we do not expect improvement.\nIt was major surgery but I was one night in ICU and one night in a normal room only. No damage to facial nerve.\nOne good source is the acoustic neuroma association, forums with both patient and doctors.\nAs others have said, it is most likely benign and very slow growing. Talk to your doctor and reach out n if you need Kudos to all of you on this thread. All of your diagnostics and prognosis are spot on. Bottom line is that modern medicine is amazing and doctors have been performing successful treatments on ANs for decades. DECADES! I had my tangerine sized AN removed 5 months ago and am mostly back to normal (except partial facial paralysis and loss of hearing). We are AN warriors and trust me when I say my life is better without my tumor. You will feel the same. Best wishes to you.\n\nPT Thanks for the message, everyones being super nice and it is making me feel better about it all. \n\nReally helpful and nice to know what other people are going through with it.\n\nThanks Thanks\n\nI will check the association out! Snap :p mine is too!", "weighted eyelid I am 12 days post op of a 3.6cm tumor removal. The surgery  was 11 hours and waking up was very traumatic  for me. They want to do another procedure  this week to weigh my eyelid. I feel this  is too soon after surgery to do this and im very scared to get  another procedure done. Who has the weighted  eyelid and what does it feel like? Did it hurt? I got a weighted eyelid about a month after an 11.5 hour (5.5cm) translab AN surgery. The procedure is very weird and I compare it to opening your eyelid like a pita pocket, slipping in a platinum weight, then sewing you shut. I got this because the left side of my face was/is paralyzed and I could not blink. With the weight, i can blink to keep my eye moist, but it is not a water-tight seal. After a year with this thing, it works but does not solve all my problems. \n\nIt is a minor procedure and you are awake and walk out of the clinic. It took about 40 minutes. Wow that is a lot. I did not have the weighted eyelid surgery but did have surgery to remove my tumor back in July. I hope you are doing okay physically and emotionally. Reporting a bit late, but maybe this comment helps someone. I preferred to not install the weight. \n\nMany insisted to proceed with a tharsorraphy or gold weight but I want to avoid any invasive procedure.\n\nCheck for scleral lens or bandage contact lens. It (with some additional eye care) will protect your eye.\n\nAll the eye related thing could be very frustrating. Good luck with that! I did not have the weighted eyelids done, the doctors felt it unnecessary, but i had to get scleral lenses, they are a godsend!", "Balance issues? Hi, after losing my inner ear and balance organ on one side, I am still experiencing balance issues.  Sometimes I feel completely normal, sometimes it is subtle, and sometimes I feel drunk.  Does anyone have balance issues and do they get better with time? Did you have surgery? How long ago? Yes, I had surgery Nov 4, 2020 to remove tumor, and a second surgery Nov 11 to repair CSF leak.  They took out the entire inner ear on that one.  I did lose hearing early in the first surgery, so they when straight in on the second.  My pre-surgery complaint that lead to diagnosis was vertigo with a little hearing loss.  My hearing was ok when I went into surgery, but tumor was traditional ice cream cone, so knew odds of losing nerves were high. I had translab surgery July 2020 and I feel similar to you. My balance is mostly normal, but sometimes I get a bit of vertigo and feel dizzy or just jut off to the side when I am walking. It seems to be the worst in new places or busy places (grocery store = feel like I have had a few drinks vertigo-wise).\n\n\nI think it is improving overall though- I think exercise is helping me. I test myself by walking along a specific length of curb on my usual walk, and I can walk the whole thing now (still a challenge though). And I do different variations of lunges that used to be impossible, but now I can do without falling out of them 90% of the time. Still cannot do tree pose in yoga though! I had my surgery, or surgeries actually, in 2017. It has gotten a lot better over time, and now almost never bothers me. It does seem to be the worst at night. Dark spaces are the hardest for me. Hang in there, exercise when you can and try to get enough sleep, all of these things have helped me. \n\nI had a 4 cm AN, with two surgeries scheduled, and having two others that were emergency surgeries because of csf leaks. Four years later I feel almost back to my normal self, with the exception of mild facial paralysis and complete hearing loss on the left side. 4 cm is 1.57 inches I had my translab in August 2017 and I still have the occasional issue. It is gotten a bit better over time, but I know it is never going to go away. It is just something you learn to live with. Darkness is definitely a problem area. I have also noticed that if I have a peripheral distraction it can make me lurch a bit. I think line of vision plays into it. I am 14 years post surgery and GK. Balance is still a problem, although usually just a minor problem.. Stress, fatigue and darkness all make it much worse. I still occasionally do some if the exercises I learned in vestibular therapy after surgery, but the biggest help to me has been yoga, standing poses. I had 2 translab surgeries in July 2017. My second one was too fix a brain bleed that happened 5 days after the first surgery. My inner ear was removed in the 1st surgery. My balance is through my eyes now. My issues are mostly better, but it took a while bevause I did not realize I had 2 major issues with my eyes that needed to be addressed. I have dry eyes so I require over the counter eye drops (Refresh Optive - the regular kind not the advanced kind).  It also requires me to be on a low carb diet because I have Prediabetes with symptoms including eye problems. My initial recovery took 9 months because of the dry eyes. I still had to use a cane when going up or down stairs until a little less than a year ago when I stuck heavily to my low carb diet during the early days of the quarantine. At this point when I have balance issues it is usually a sign that I need to put eye drops in or my glucose is high. I am 46. I had translab 6 months ago (5.5cm AN) and had those ear parts removed also. I road cycle and run often and have no issues doing those things. However, sometimes going for a simple walk with my dog will make me feel a little wonky. It gets better the more I walk but has not disappeared yet. I am still relearning how to do things and my balance is not awesome.

Just trying to exhaust all my options. I am not too keen on opening my skull and losing all hearing on my left side and god willing, nothing else- 30 male. Doing as much research as I can before making final decisions. GK can have the same possible outcomes.  It is a tough choice to make. I ended up going the conventional surgery route. I had a 3cmx3cm.  33 male (37 now) and my surgery was in 2017.  When I called around for other options (GK or proton beam therapy) every single treatment center said it was a no go because of the size.  \n\n\n  \nI just found this study regarding GK on larger tumors.  It seems that it might work but a not insignificant % needed later surgical resection.    \n\n I had a large-ish tumor (a little over 3cm but a large arachnoid cyst too) and was able to retain some hearing.

I wish you the best in whatever you decide. Nope. 46 male. 5.5cm, translab was my only option. Deaf on left side. 10 months post op and I returned to surfing yesterday. This was the last of my pre-surgery lifestyle activities to attempt. Lingering balance wonky-ness and partial facial paralysis, but life is good. Surfing went well? Yes, I have been going at least once a week. Front-side on a wave is no problem, probably better balance than pre-surgery. Back-side is a little more tricky as I lose my balance looking over my shoulder at the wave. I trip up on a takeoff or fall on a turn maybe half the time.\n\nThe bigger problem has been my left eye, which does not close all the way. My brow is also droopy as that side is still partially paralyzed. So I get saltwater in my eye and have only partial vision when I am lying down paddling.

Anyone have one that progressed to facial numbness? \n\n\nWhat method did they take to remove?\n\n\nDid you get feeling back? \n\n\nAny issues with actual paralysis? \n\n\nI found out yesterday and I would love to hear some first hand accounts. Thank you! Mine was hearing loss on the right side and some balance issues. They did Gamma Knife the first time, but the little sucker kept growing (which is rare but not unheard of), so three years later they went in and removed it surgically. I never had a problem with numbness or paralysis, but as they say every case is different. I had mild hearing loss, balance issues and facial numbness.  \n\n\n3cmx3cm meant I had to have it surgically removed.  My balance is still off but the numbness went away.  Lost the hearing from the surgery Oh gosh this is good to read. I am so hopeful that the numbness goes away. \n\nHow has life been adapting to no hearing in that ear? Not going to lie, 4 years later it still sucks.  I have adjusted as far as being used to it and being aware of my positioning. No facial numbness here. Balance was my biggest issue.  I went with surgery but had a complication that is making it as slow recovery. But I am hoping things will improve. My face does feel a little weird in my bad side when I am over tired. Oh wow! It is funny you say that about being tired because when I consulted with my neuro that is what I said about my numbness. If I am tired it is much more pronounced. So odd!\n\nI hope it starts improving faster! I was diagnosed with an 11 mm AN by MRI after sudden hearing loss. Curiously enough I have had vague intermittent tingling-numbness on that side of my face for almost a decade. The ENT does not think it is related (okay ...). I also have a lot of balance issues. I had a VNG test yesterday that showed my right vestibular nerve is 43% off from the left. We are looking at surgery later this summer most likely. Interesting! I am curious if that tingling numbness will go away when it is removed! I do not know. It is so mild that it cannot be much more than a little nerve irritation, and I imagine surgery will be more irritating. I am mostly hoping it will not get worse. The hearing and balance problems are much more significant in my case. Did you have tumor on one side only? So, you still have hearing on left which is good. How did you find out the issue? Just on the right side, yes. \n\nAnd I have pair of CROS hearing aids that help compensate for my hearing loss. That is good! Half my face went numb.  Being the genius that I am, I waited 4 months for it to \"get better on it is own\".  Narrator:  but it did not get better. Facial numbness was one of my first symptoms, thought it was from dental work. Then mild hearing loss, visual problems and eventually sudden hearing loss in one ear led me to an urgent care and diagnosis in ER. PCP  had chalked up my double vision and nausea to pregnancy. Treated with surgery and later Gamma Knife. Still have some facial numbness 14 years later but retained some hearing. Only recently got a hearing aid for my mild- moderate hearing loss (masks made things hard for me). Wow! Thank you for sharing your experience! \n\nI cannot imagine how hard masks made things for you. I struggled with not being able to read lips too. Tumor regrowth, so I needed a repeat surgery, then LINAC radiation. I think my mistake was waiting a year for a follow-up MRI after my \"conservative\" surgery. Apparently conservative surgeries leave a good deal of tumor, eager to regrow.\n\nOf course I have single sided hearing too, but great balance and facial movement. If you do not mind my asking, why did they choose to leave some behind? Was it for fear of damaging the facial nerve?\n\nHow long ago was this? \n\nThank you do much for your response! Are X-rays can detect a AN? Mri are so expensive here. No they cannot Thanks The surgeons did not want to disturb or damage the facial nerve, which they achieved.

Thanks this helps! You are welcome! :-) Update to this\u2014I had vestibular testing last week and was asked specifically if reading bothered me. Yes! But in this particular case it seems to be the inclined back and forth head motion of making flash cards that was doing it. I have always been very sensitive to motion sickness and my AN side vestibular nerve tested 43% off from my good side, so the testing audi felt this nausea was entirely consistent.", "Diagnosed Today Hi there. I went to the Dr. for ringing in my right ear. I was told to get a hearing test and an MRI. The MRI showed clear on the right side where the ringing is, but I have an AN on the left side. It is very small 3mm in size. The Dr. just told me to get MRIs yearly to watch for growth or to notify him if I start to get other symptoms. I am sorry you have received news you have an AN, but I am happy your finding a support group.  I am fairly new to this reddit group, but I know other support groups I have been in in the past have been SO helpful! \n\nI was diagnosed with a 2.3cm AN in 2008 (December)  had Gamma Knife in January 2009.  Regrowth in 2011 and Translab surgery in July 2011.  \n\nSo, I have been through 2 different approaches and I would be happy to answer any questions youay have.  But there are a lot of people in the watch and wait like you are!  The good news is ANs are typically very slow growing and some people can be in the watch and wait for many many years! Welcome to the club! I have also had both Gamma Knife and translab. This is a great community and everyone will be happy to answer any questions or concerns you might have. The ringing is tinnitus. Sorry about the diagnosis. The good news is that it is super tiny and may never get big enough to be a problem!  Mine was 2.5cm when I noticed symptoms.  I know the ringing is really annoying. I wish there was a treatment for it. You do kind of get used to it so your brain filters it out ... kind of. hello forsaken ? only ringing or any other mild / slight symptoms ?   \nalso can you give pattern of ur tinnitus ? low / high pitch ?  continuous or sometimes ? like attacks or stable and smooth ? melodic or pure tone ?  \n\n\nand my last question ur mri with contrast or non-contrast ?", "People who have had acoustic neuroma, did your tinnitus 'roar' whenever you nodded or shook your head? The tinnitus fades if ive been lying down flat for an extended period of time without moving their head, ie sleeping, and my hearing is normal but my balance is compromised. There is often fluid in my bad ear or the pressure in the ear is too low or too high 90% of the time they are evaluated. The symptoms started off with vertigo episodes 10 years ago and the symptoms have gradually been getting worse. i also get very occasional ice pick headaches on the side of the tinnitus about 2 inches above or behind the ear and twitching on my right side.\n\nI have had an MRI done without contrast, was 5 minutes long, and they told me to wait 8 weeks. I am 22 by the way.\n\nI recently noticed the tinnitus gets about 3-4x louder when I nod my head, specifically, when my head is accelerating. the same kind of noise that is there always, but slightly higher pitched. When I shake my head sideways it sounds lower pitched but still louder than if I am not moving my head. Again, only in the right ear, my left ear is silent always. I also tend to get sudden deafness in my right ear that lasts for a few seconds and comes back, but a high pitched ringing follows. \n\nEven if I plug my ears and walk down stars I can hear it get louder whenever I went down a step and it sounded like ''wub wub wub wub''. I had an MRI on the 23rd, of ''inner ear meatus'' and not sure if this will pick up a tumor, got no call so far. I would not say mine roars , mine spikes. It gets louder and more high pitched with sudden movements . Running is a nightmare because as you say , with each thudding step I get a massive spike and ring. Yes that is exactly what happens to me! What kind of MRI did you have to pick up the AN? I had an MRI scan of ''inner ear meatus'' w/o contrast and the scan took only 5 minutes, they told me to wait 8 weeks. \n\nDo you just have one tone playing or is it multiple tones at once? I am not sure at this point it was about 4 years ago. I remember a general brain mri picked something up and then I had one with contrast shortly after to confirm it.\n\nI have multiple tones at once and although it started in one year it has now travelled to both. \n\nI had two surgeries to have it removed , my most recent being about a year and a half ago Yes. It is sounds like you might be talking about gaze-evoked tinnitus. In my case it just changes the sound when I move my eyes or head. Why did you have to wait 8 weeks for a 5min MRI? Or do you need to wait 8 weeks for the result? Either way they should do one with contrast and do the full cycles. I had an MRI on Friday. Was an hour. Got it on CD within 5mins of finishing. Checked it on the weekend and saw the results myself. \n\nWhere are you based? \n\nTo answer your initial question: I did not have any roars or spikes when nodding or shaking my head. Something you said actually sounds familiar. I went on a track day at Silverstone in a single seater which is open cockpit. Engine behind me and air intake above my head. Had a helmet and all the get on. When I finished the 45min session where I was not going flat out tbh, I was temporarily deaf in my ear. Did not know about my AN at that point.. just knew I had bad hearing. But it was significantly worse. I do not know if it was the noise, but it did not seem that loud (although measured in dB, I am sure it would have been fairly loud). It is likely the air pressure from the intake that caused the deafness. Even my good ear was raining like crazy. It was a scary moment for about an hour where I struggled to hear anything. I was pretty much 100% deaf in my AN ear and maybe 50% in my good ear.\n\nAnyway. Point is... Air pressure and /or maybe the acceleration... Which I didnt think of at all until you mentioned it above hey, how are you getting on?", "Can facial tingling be intermittent? I am waiting for an MRI as I have developed some unilateral hearing loss and tinnitus. Sometimes (now) I have a tingling sensation on the same side but not numbness I do not think. Could an AN cause intermittent tingling and of so is it likely to get worse? For those that experienced facial numbness did treatment help? Did you get your MRI? Waiting  on mine next week. They fitted me in today, it was quite quick and they did not use a contrast dye.  Just have to wait for the consultant to see the scans now. Keep us posted!   I get an odd, not quire tingling feeling on my AN side occasionally My MRI results were normal so I presume no AN. It might be an autoimmune reaction but I had thought that would affect both ears. Neurology can be weird.  Are you feeling relieved or more confused? Mostly frustrated. I think unfortunately it is the case that since theres no sign the hearing loss and tinnitus is being caused by anything that might cause other problems then there is nothing more to be done.

The AN was in contact with the V cranial nerve ( nervus trigeminalis ) and so if I did surgery there was a great chance I would be paralyzed on the right side of my face so me, my family and the neurosurgeon decided to go with Gamma knife. I did the Gamma knife yesterday, it was a bit scary and traumatic for me and a bit painful but nothing that serious. The doctor warned that I may have headaches, vertigo, facial numbness, loss of energy but till now I got nothing, I am feeling good thank God, the only thing that scares me is what if Gamma knife does not work and the tumor becomes larger and the gamma knife\u2019s ability to cause brain cancer. \nPlease if you have any suggestions or questions for me tell me !

I am also young (24F) and getting Gamma Knife in December because of the high risk of paralysis on my left side of my face. What was the worst part about the process? That is what scares me, they say gamma knife has a 90% successful rate but I hear too much complicated and sad stories from gamma knife and not one positive, it freaks me out and now I am wondering what if I would go with the surgery, would it be better The worst part about me was not keeping calm, I have the nature that I panic too much and overthink, I stressed myself too much, the first important thing is staying calm and keeping your loved ones close, as for the procedure the worst part for me was getting an MRI with the head frame on, It caused me severe vertigo and the MRI noises made worse my tinnitus, another thing that was painful was getting your head frame off, the pain is real afterwards but they gave me some IV and painkillers so I became better. You will be okay do not worry, very good luck and keep us updated \u2764\ufe0f I know what you are going through, believe me. Been there. But the surgery has its own risks and it sounds like gamma knife was the best choice for you.

At the time I was told GK had. 98% success rate ..I was taking those odds! \n\nFast forward to 2010 (about a year and a half post GK) and I started having bouts of facial paralysis (not a symptom I had pre GK). An MRI indicated that I was having regrowth, now up to 2.5cm .  At that time with the blessing of my doctor , Dr. K. And my family I went ahead with surgery in July 2011.\n\nI was told at that time UPMC had performed over 6,000 GK fo AN (Dr.K pioneered it) and only 9 patients had regrowth. I was #9 and I was the youngest ever. \n\nHonestly, I had an AMAZING team of doctors at UPMC and my recovery was about 1 1/2-2 months but I took the full 3 months off work.   Today I am doing great, I am deaf in my right side, but I have learned to manage that and I am now getting scans every 5 years!! \n\nThey did leave residual tumor on my facial nerve, so I have no facial paralysis.  \n\n\nSo I know it is very scary to deal with, both young and old,  but I am a success story and I feel that is really important to share! \n\nFeel free to ask questions.

They have not suggested any treatment because of my age. If I were older they would perhaps consider stuff. \n\nMy hearings shot, that is the worst of it, it is gotten noticeably worse over the last 1-2yrs. I have given up on a lot of good habits in the 12m as a result of a tainted mindset. \n\nGot the MRIs on CD this evening, so will take a look at them when I am home and fingers crossed it is relatively unchanged.

I got my dinner ready and everything as if it was my Friday night movie session \ud83d\ude06\n\nw&amp;w was probably suggested as it was an incidental finding whilst checking something else by MRI, and besides the hearing aids I did not show signs of imbalance, facial paralysis, or miscoordination.\n\nThe consultant said that considering age, radiation is not recommend because of the risks at my age of things developing later. In my case it would likely be surgery, but all being well it would not happen till quite some time from now.\n\nHearing aids will probably help. I work in an office environment so luckily it is never too noisy; I am sure I will end up with them in the not too distant future. Oh NO!!  That is happened to me.  They need to provide them on thumb drives at the least.  Better yet, a website with a security key.  \n\nMay I ask your age?  I am 61 and mine was discovered because I got really pushy about a suspected Eustachian tube issue.  Good thing I kept pushing for the MRI!  I still have 70% hearing on the tumor side so opting for radiation was a no brainer (vs surgery) but I am still not sure about the watch and wait approach.  \n\nAt least you can still have movie night and tomorrow go buy a dvd reader (they are cheap on amazon and at Frys if you have got one around you).  Best Buy is outrageous for stuff like that. \n\nSorry for the frustration but please still let us know! Worked it out. Slight (like, 1mm) growth, but nothing major from my YoY comparison. At least my mind's at peace now. Oh I am so happy you shared that!!  \n\nSo it is been 1mm in a year or 6 months?  At what point is it no longer watching?\n\nCongratulations- I am sure you are feeling much better! That was a year on year comparison as it gave me a better idea of growth.\n\nI have to talk the consultant to see what they say about the watch and wait. My acoustic neuroma is the exact same size! It sound like you are experiencing some effects from the AN already though, whilst my symptoms are quite minimal. When did you first identify it, and we are you unaware of a load of symptoms before you had it? \n\nI had symptoms of the AN about 7 years ago, but it was only diagnosed last year in October. I was aware of a slight loss of hearing but never actually did anything about it. Yeah, I noticed mild symptoms like sharp pain in my ear. My symptoms happened fast which makes me think it is growing fast. Another reason why I want this out of my head!", "Question- bit worried Quick question if anyone knows.\n\nI have had tinnitus in one ear for about 7 months now. Had a hearing aid for it for 2 months. \n\nA hospital scan has come through today to check for a tumor. It was explained to me that tinnitus is uncommon in one ear and it could be a growth.\n\nI am not one to google but I am a bit worried. Does anyone know the chance of it being a tumor or just tinnitus? Or where I should read or should not? It is worrying me a little \u2026 It can be just a middle ear inflammation. \n\nIf it is the case that you have an AN, the sooner or gets detected, the better.\n\nDo not panic. Acoustic neuromas are benign, though that does not mean they are a day at the park. But take it one step at a time, because each one is different and there are lots of variables. Your age, the size of it, the location of it, the aggressiveness of it, your physical fitness, etc etc. Do not panic, do your research if it is an AN and do not be in a rush to get treatment. Most are slow growing and you have time to make the best decisions for YOUR factors. Best wishes! (I hate it when Reddit does not sign me in right. That is not my account name. I am going to sign in and make a quick comment to follow) Following This post gave me goosebumps. I was also diagnosed one side tinnitus WITH one side hearing loss, and my doctor ordered a brain MRI to check for acoustic neuroma. I had the MRI back in May, and turns out everything was normal and good. I actually just got hearing aids a week ago too. I remember freaking out so much and crying every night being anxious if I have the tumor. You are in the same situation as me, so do not worry. I 100% certainly believed that I have a brain tumor, and ended up not. Please do not trust google, as it literally said that tinnitus with one side hearing loss is the \u201challmark\u201d of acoustic neuroma. I would say chances are low. But should probably have an MRI as the chances are much higher than chance of AN in general population. Thanks Great thank you. Just hate the thought of it being something like that. I am 35 and generally a fit and healthy guy- zero health conditions other than this. It does does not it.\n\nI was discussing this with my wife last night. \n\nI would found an article that showed the type of scan I am going for there is a 1/20 chance of it being a tumor. Irregardless of the tinnitus - that is what set me off.\n\nThanks for the reassurance\u2026 Thanks Meniere's disorder has similar symptoms as AN.  I was 1st diagnosed with this before another doctor made the right decision to get a scan. My mom was also diagnosed with M\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s disease initially. Her doctor told her that he did not think an MRI was necessary BUT if it would give her peace of mind he was happy to order one. \n\nMy mom thought \u201cwhat the hell.\u201d Yeah, you go looking for horses and not zebras, but zebras are not unheard of... admittedly though an acoustic neuroma was not even on her radar..\n\nLow &amp; behold.. a 3.1 CM acoustic neuroma that needed to be dealt with in a 2-3 month time span due to the positioning of it. \n\nWhat i am saying is, if an MRI is an option for you insurance wise and/or financially and it would give you some peace of mind ... do it. When it comes to your health care and your care plan, the patient is their own best advocate. I may look like a random dude on reddit, but please trust me. Do not worry. I am 33m, mostly active/healthy. \nGot diagnosed with a small AN earlier this month. \nFeel free to DM if you want to discuss anything. Thanks - had my MRI on Wednesday.

Hi, i have not done any AN test yet but i think i will because i match the symptoms.\nSo, when i ride my bicycle i feel pain in both my ears, it feels like an inch or so behind ny ears or below. This happens alot in cold winds. Is this common with patients with AN? Thanks! Ear pain due to cold/wind is not that unusual for folks without AN. That you have it in both ears makes it even less likely to be related to an AN unless you were EXTREMELY unlucky and had them in both ears.", "Is is possible to never need treatment on a small AN? I found out incidentally about my AN last month. I went to a neurologist for headaches due to screens and she ordered an MRI just to be safe. It came back with a tiny 2mm AN. It is so small that she did not even see it at first and called me later about it. I currently have no symptoms at all. Mg doctor thinks I probably would not have known about it for awhile if it were not for the MRI. I am wondering if it there is anyone out there that maybe has never had to actually take action on their tumor? I mean, is it possible it could never grow and show symptoms ? yes, I think that is very possible.  most of them grow slowly anyway, even when they do grow.  mine was found in 2014.  I am still on wait and watch.  I am hoping to never need treatment.  cannot say I do not live with symptoms, but from what I have read and heard about both surgery and radiation, oftentimes people are worse off from the treatment.  I do understand however, that sometimes treatment cannot be avoided.  like if it were pressing on  your brainstem and such.   I also have the thought that if one is able to wait, perhaps at some point in the future a more effective and less potentially damaging treatment may be found.  yours is very small, you have time to wait and see.  maybe it will not grow. Yes. Mine was just too big not to get treatment.  I experienced symptoms for over a decade before they even found out about mine. Yes. I have had my small AN for 5+ years and I just get an MRI and hearing test annually. Unfortunately I have hearing loss and tinnitus but so far it has never grown so I do not need to be treated. that is good to hear. how big is yours &amp; when did your hearing loss and tinnitus begin? 3 by 4 mm.

It is gone.. and that is a drag I feel your pain.  I was diagnosed 2.5 years ago and following that I had a really bad run of things at work and at home much like yourself and it triggered some really bad health anxiety and I spiralled into depression whilst in the wait and monitor stage, luckily the 19mm neuroma is showing no signs of growth so no intervention required just now.  I got help from my wife and doctor after my depression was formally diagnosed, I was off work for a couple of months and ended up doing a role switch which helped massivley.

I am just wondering if the following symptoms can be signs of an acoustic neuroma:\n\n- Dizziness/Lightheadedness on and off throughout the day. Weird sensations in head but no vertigo (room spinning)\n- Ringing in right ear almost all the time (No hearing loss)\n\nI have an MRI soon to confirm if it is an acoustic neuroma but I wanted to ask here to see what other people\u2019s symptoms were like.\n\nThanks! My main symptoms were dizziness , tinnitus and hearing loss. Towards the end ( before excision ) I lost the feeling in my face.\n\nSymptoms could be indicative of an AN, but could be a number of other things too. How would you describe your dizziness and how often did you feel this dizziness? \n\nHow are you doing now? I got full vertigo when I was tired or stressed,  but otherwise it was just that if I moved quickly or were in a very busy place I would get nauseous and dizzy and have trouble waking.\n\nI am doing good now, lost most of my hearing on right side and vertigo is worse, but tumour is out safely after two surgeries. Oh ok I do not have vertigo. It is more like a \u201cdrunk feeling\u201d dizziness. \n\nThat is good to hear that the tumour is out. How are you dealing with the vertigo and do doctors say it will be less as time passes? It could be. The room does not have to be spinning for it to be vertigo. Those symptoms you described before you said no spinning are also vertigo. If my surgery had not been delayed I would never have experienced room-spinning. The MRI with contrast will tell you if it is an A.N. or not. Only a small percentage of the people tested for the tumor have it. I had other symptoms of AN for years before I lost hearing. Even that lost hearing came back and was missed by an ENT when I described it. Sounds more like Labyrinthitis to me than an AN Hello! May I ask why your surgery was delayed? I have to wait 10 months for my surgery. I do not have vertigo now but I am afraid I might develop it in the next few months. My tumor is 25 mm and pressing on my brainstem. They forgot to tell me I had a copay that was due on the day of preop. They knew my brother who I worked for had just died so I did not have a job. I asked them to let me know in advance about copay so that I could borrow the money if need be. I did not have the money in the bank so they canceled my surgery. After that I was mad so I waited until after my brother\u2019s house has sold. Then they were booked 3 months in advance.", "Has anyone had vestibular therapy during watch-and-wait to help cope with vertigo symptoms? I think it was my ENT last year who told me there was no point because the nerve is going to keep declining and things will change again. But I am thinking I need skills to speed up these adjustments. Vertigo has bothered me on and off for 10 years. And it is bothering me now, this is an \u201con\u201d time\u2014any activity that requires bending (gardening, laundry, scooping the litter box), pivoting (cleaning the kitchen), anything visually scrolling (like my computer work), and especially grocery shopping all make me immediately seasick. I suppose the system needs to recalibrate\u2014how do I help?  I am under the impression that I am not supposed to avoid things that make me sick.  I have already walked 2 miles today and intentionally grocery shopped.  Can vestibular therapy offer more? I only had therapy after surgery (and it was helpful). Commenting to share my experience with yoga - I took up yoga about 8 years post-treatment and even at that point, it was really, really helpful. Just basic standing poses have a huge benefit, in my opinion. I only take \"gentle yoga\" once a week but try to do a few minutes a couple of other times per week. Yoga with Adrienne on YouTube is great. She might even have some specifically for balance. I am on W &amp; W and did vestibular therapy about 2 years ago. It really helped a lot and gave me some tools to ground myself when I feel off balance. I feel pretty good most days now and do not do the exercises unless I start feeling dizzy again and I think it really helps. Thank you for this, it really helps. I just joined this group as I think I have surgery in my future, but I saw this and wanted to jump in.  I am currently in vestibular therapy- on week 3.  I have a small AN on my right side.  While small in size, it is packed a punch in terms of symptoms.  I did not have any symptoms for a long time, but the last two months I have dealt with continuous vertigo.  I feel dizzy and seasick most of the time, with pressure and heaviness in my head- particularly right side.  My doctor has this as a last check off list before surgery.  I believe vestibular therapy can be helpful, but my PT thinks of us more as working the muscles pre-op so that after surgery when I am back in her care, we can jump right back in to working the left side to compensate for the right side.  It is not perfect, it is not a quick fix, but it is a process to try to help myself.  Currently I am unable to drive due to the vertigo and even taking my 3 yr old to the park on my own is not ideal because she often needs a spotter and I am not sturdy at this point. I think that vestibular therapy can be very good, with time, but I am not sure how much help it will be if the tumor continues to impede on the nerve.... that is where I am at.", "Anybody have strange throat feeling from bigger AN before treatment? ", "2 x.8 x.8cm acoustic neuroma or vestibular schwannoma Just found the reason for my terrible dizziness and loss of hearing. Wondering if any of you had a tumor this size and the treatment you chose. I had one quite a bit larger (5.5cm) and the only option for me was translab. Sorry to hear of your diagnosis\u2014I was diagnosed in January and posted something similar.  I am 37 yo and have a  ~1.6 x 1.2 cm AN on my right side.  I have balance issues and very minimal hearing loss.   My diagnosis was an incidental finding from an MRI for a different reason. This is my experience since then:\n\nI got a referral to see a neurosurgeon in January, and wanted to get two opinions.  One was at a local, large hospital and the other was an academic medical center. The local hospital told me they could not help because it was too specialized, and to go see the academic medical center, which I was already doing. \n\n The way the neurosurgical practice at this medical center operates is that they do this type of procedure joint with ENT. The first person I saw was the ENT. Since my hearing in my right side has only minimal loss, they recommended the medial fossa approach. This approach allows them to preserve the hearing have in my right ear and if the tumor gets any larger, they will not be able to use the medial fossa approach. They said since I am relatively young, they thought I would have to eventually have surgery anyway, It makes sense to try to save my hearing.  They said positive outcomes are all correlated with being \u2018young and healthy.\u2019 Similarly, they did not think radiation was a good idea due to my age, plus, it could always start growing again. When I saw the neurosurgeon, he reiterated these points. So as a result, I was scheduled for surgery for June 28\u2013they did not want to wait any longer. They told me that I have a 60% chance of keeping my hearing and a 90% chance of keeping my right sided facial function.  They also said they did not think it would affect my balance long term (at least they said I would still be able to snowboard no problem).  Now, I am waiting and getting things for work in order.  \n\nAs it turns out, the academic medical center in my city is one of the best places in the country for this surgery.  This has given me and my family a lot of peace.\n\nI hope this helps, and  I hope everything goes well for you\u2014feel free to DM me if you have any questions!\n\nEdit: added more. I had a 5.5cm. Had no choice in the matter. Had to do translab. Could not remove the whole tumor. Had radiation after. Still dealing with some trigeminal damage as a result of where my residual tumor is sitting. hello , how was ur balance issiue started ? was it first symptom ? and how serious was it ?   \nthank you It first started out as just accidentally walking to doorways and such\u2014general reduced coordination and spatial awareness.   But I am pretty clumsy as it is, so it took a while.  Then I started noticing I was off balance sometimes\u2014and it is crazy exaggerated when inebriated.  What I notice most is low level nausea, which causes me to lose weight.", "Fatigue with AN? In addition to my dizziness, tinnitus, and hearing loss, I am experiencing an unusual amount of fatigue.

It may be due to damage to the vestibular nerve, where the brain has to compensate/get used to only using one side for balance.  It also could be due to compression of the brainstem, if the AN is large enough. Makes sense. Thank you!", "Does this sound like AN? Please help. Thank you Struggling with dizziness since 2016. Help please.\n\nMale. 33 years old. 200 pounds. Non smoker and drinker. 6 ft tall. \n\nHey\n\nI have been suffering from dizziness since about August 2016. \n\nI would say I have anxiety to a degree and have for most of my adult life. I normally have a feeling of dread a lot in my stomach so not sure if it is connected. \n\nAnyway. My dizzy symptoms: i would say 3 or 4 times since 2016 I have had what i would describe as really bad dizziness. It typically starts when all of a sudden I feel a weird swirling sensation and things are spinning a bit around me. Then that is followed my vomiting for maybe 8-12 hours. Then the symptoms slowly start to get better over the next 3-5 days. My girlfriend has noted my eyes are a little twitchy moving side to side during this also and I have a hard tome focusing on anything without the feeling of it moving in front of me. However I can use my phone and read anything close to my face just fine. \n\nI have been to the hospital the first time this happened, doctors twice. Had an eye test and been to an ear specialist twice. Nobody can really pinpoint what it is. I asked them of course if it was something serious like a brain tumour or something but they all dismissed it as something that serious.\n\nOutside of those times where it is really bad for those 3-5 days I still have dizzy bursts and spells weekly and it is something I struggle with on an almost daily basis. \n\nI would just like answers and someone to point me in the right direction. This is hell to live with. \n\nThank you for your time.\n\nJust to add. Girlfriend and doctors also noted horizontal nystagmus with my eyes during each severe attack.\n\nWent to the doctors again today 23/03/2020 \n\nHe said I should have an MRI done and potentially it could be a vestibular neuroma that is causing my symptoms but he is not sure. I am not a doctor so take anything I say with a grain of salt.\n\nIt does not sound like you have any hearing related symptoms. Normally, you would have significant hearing loss / tinnitus either permanently or intermittently before the tumour started to effect balance or dizziness. This is especially true as you are young, so your balance would be pretty good until this thing was fairly big because your vestibular system would be quick to compensate any issues  ( as mine was.) at that point, hearing issues should definitely have kicked in.\n\nFor me, I had hearing issues for years before my balance was effected. \n\nYou can never really know for sure though, AN effect people in different ways. It is good they have offered an mri so they can rule it out. Thank you for taking the time to reply. I appreciate it a lot so thank!!\n\nIf it is not AN what do you think it could be? I know you are not a doctor but just figured it ask. Maybe you know more than me. I have no idea haha. My expertise is limited to AN as that is what I dealt with. My doctor seemed to think it was an inner ear issue. He said a brain tumour or something else i would be shown more symptoms and more extreme symptoms likely by now. This sounds more like labyrinthitis rather than an acoustic neuroma. I am sure it could also be several other things.. but I have had both the above, and it sounds more like the former than the latter.\n\nI think if it were an AN, you would likely have a level of hearing loss that was noticeable.\n\nIf you feel unbalanced, or walk a bit like you are drunk, it could be a recurring care of labyrinthitis, which is inflammation of the inner ear. A penicillin course is normally the answer over a week to reduce the inflammation. \n\nHave an MRI done just in case - it will give you all the answers you need. Thank you very much for the reply. \n\nIf you do not mind, do you have iMessage or messenger or something where we could maybe chat a little? I would appreciate it a lot. Do not use iMessage. You can DM me on here if you like though, I am good to chat if it helps. Hi.\n\nI need to chime in and refute what the poster above you said. There really is not any \"Normally you would have this, and then this\" with an AN. That is what can be so tough about connecting with others about it. There is a world of great support with fellow ANers to be had, and sharing of plenty of solid info--but everyone has their own journey with having an AN, and symptoms are unique with each AN patient.\n\nFor example, I was diagnosed in May 2019 with a small AN. My FIRST and most noticeable symptom was vertigo. Still, a year later, dizziness is my primary symptom. I have had only very slight hearing loss. And very slight tinnitus that most days I do not even notice. But the unsteadiness and the dizziness when I turn my head suddenly or at certain angles is the worst of my symptoms. I also have other subtle things that I deal with, like brain fog and fatigue--both of which are affected by stress and sleep and quality of my diet it seems. Mostly by stress.\n\nMy AN is small-the size of a pea-but it is in a very small and tricky place. \n\nI cannot recommend the Acoustic Neuroma Association website enough. AND it has a discussion forum that is pretty active where you can ask lots of questions. Thank you for the comment. Really insightful and as with anyone I appreciate it a lot you writing. \n\nDo my symptoms sound like something that could be an AN? I have an MRI next Tuesday morning. Getting nervous about it. Are you getting treatment or surgery eventually to remove yours? How are you coping with your symptoms? Hi. :-) Glad to help. I understand your feelings. It is scary to wonder if you have it, and scary if you find out you do. \n\nIt sounds like it could be an AN, so I am glad you are having an MRI done. Smart move. Then you will know one way or another and you need to know. It also sounds like it could maybe be something like what I had 15 years ago--BPV or Benign Positional Vertigo. It comes on suddenly and can be recurrent. The vertigo is hellish and of course the nausea is no fun. The first bout of it for me was rolling over in bed to turn off the alarm and the room spun like a pinwheel. I had NO idea what was going on. It resolved after about a week and a half. I saw an ear specialist and he offered to to the maneuvers to help heal it, but I was in school and never went back for that. I know you said you saw a specialist, but if you do the MRI and there is nothing there (hoping) then you could try another ear specialist. \n\nHow am  I coping? Well...it was a shock to get the diagnosis. It has taken quite a while to get accustomed to the idea that I have it. It is been stressful to be honest, but I have tried to remember the things to be grateful for. It is small, and I can so far live with my symptoms. They are mild. I would say that the mental and emotional strain of knowing it is there is the hardest part. I have kind of lost some of my spirit, if you know what I mean. But I try every day to be strong and to look for all of the positives. I get sad and depressed at times. Angry at other times. Some days I can forget about it. I think about my future alot and the tumor brings an uncertainty. No way around it. I am in \"watch and wait\" for now, and my decision, after much much MUCH reading and researching, and hanging out on the ANA discussion forum, is to wait until such a time as my tumor grows to size large, OR my symptoms really lower the quality of my life--before I will treat it. My choice will be surgery if need be. Having a follow-up MRI whenever this pandemic thing is over. Yay more uncertainty, lol.\n\nThis was probably way longer than you needed! Remember-an AN is not a death sentence. There is a lot of help and support out there. By the same token, benign is not \"fine!\" Any tumor in your head is a big deal. Hang in there and come back and update when you get your results, ok?", "FYI studies have shown AN detection without contrast is 84 to 100 percent effective.  What? Forego getting an IV stuck in my arm prior to enjoying a relaxing session in the MRI tube? Perish the thought! My doctor has ordered a contrast MRI that I cannot afford. My symptoms are consistent with AN. Should I suggest going with a cheaper MRI just to verify that I have AN and then go from there. I am preparing myself for some bad news and trying to figure out how to get through this with no insurance. I would suggest researching the dangers of the contrast dye / heavy metal dye injections.   There is a good group on FB and info online.   Some countries are moving towards sugar based injections that work just as well.   Do not use the injections they can find it without, it will be slightly cheaper and 100 percent safer.  Also in Japan they are solving AN with:\n\n**Propolis**, a waxy substance produced by the honeybee, ... also induced nearly complete regression of human NF2/1 tumor (schwannoma).    I discussed with a doctor in Japan he uses 3 grams of this substance a day until the tumor is gone with patients.  He has had much success.   They also suggested with this product to consume brocolli and brocolli sprout extract.     Another optional added treatement is Rick Simpson oil 90 day program, but the Propolis alone has worked for many people in Japan and they did not need surgery. Wow that is some hopeful info THANKS! No problem , also two cloves of garlic a day , let sit 15 min after pealing then eat has cured other brain tumors so would not hurt to try for AN.  Good luck \ud83c\udf40", "Mum (60) has ~2cm AN and is having translab surgery What can I expect for her recovery based on its size and her age and the type of surgery? We are totally expecting full hearing loss, but what about her balance/vertigo? She is experiencing very mild, barely noticeable balance symptoms right now. What is the chance of her facial nerve being paralysed?\n\nI know these questions are very specific and I cannot get definitive answers but if anyone has similar AN experiences with surgery/size/age I would be really grateful to hear it. \n\nThanks I feel that post surgery balance issues are compensated some by pre-surgery symptoms. If your mum already has some vertigo symptoms, her brain is already learning to compensate. For me, I had severe symptoms for 6 years before discovering I had a 5.5cm AN. Although balance was affected post translab, it was not as bad as stories I have read. The first month or so is rough, but she will learn to compensate. The important thing is to get up and walk. A lot!!! Best wishes to your mum. Hi, thanks so much for taking the time to reply. It is reassuring to hear that the vertigo is recoverable. I have experienced bouts of vertigo myself (vestibular neuritis) and I worried so much about her experiencing that, because it suuuuucks. I had mine at 57. Most of my balance issues resolved fairly quick, but as said elsewhere, you tend to compensate quickly. As for paralysis, that is a possibility but it is pretty low. Good luck with her surgery and let us know how it goes. Hi, thanks so much for your comment. It is very reassuring! She is got a good surgeon so we are all keeping our fingers crossed! hello ,i hope she will recover fine .... what are the main symptopms she had ? My mum is also 60 with a 22mm AN and is having the same surgery next week! From what I know the neuroma is not touching her brain stem and her only symptom until then was significant hear loss, so I am really hoping that she will recover fast and well. I must admit I was terrified when I learned about the AN and when I read about the surgery (sometimes I wish I had not looked for it). I read a lot of stories and it really seems like the recovery and post-surgery symptoms depend a lot on the AN grade and where exactly it is located.\n\nIf you want I can give you a heads up when the surgery is done to let you know how she is recovering. I know how stressful it is not really knowing what to expect but I am sure our mums will be alright! I had one the side of an egg next to my brain,lost hearing on one side,wasnt cancerous,took me 3 years to get the diagnose,because first my leg hurt(leg doctor),stomach(stomache doctor),etc .Different part would hurt and after tests they said I am fine,but I read in a newspaper and it said to do an MRI,I did and they found out that because it grew,everytime it grew bigger it pressed on different nerves that affect different parts of body,thus the different pains all over,WISH YOU FAST AND PAINLESS RECOVERY Update for anyone interested - mum is home after 8 days in hospital. She was very, very sick for the first 3 days from the combined effects of CSF loss from the surgery and general anaesthesia. After that she improved quickly day by day. Amazingly, she can still hear a little out of the affected ear. She has some slight worsening of her balance but no vertigo at all. Her facial nerve was stimulated throughout the surgery (which was 12.5 hours) and was giving the best response, so the surgeons are confident it is not damaged. It is bruised and weakened temporarily so she has some paralysis on that side. 96% of the tumour was removed. It was just beginning to press on her brain stem. Histology came back good as grade 1, benign. She lost a lot of sodium and potassium in her blood from the vomiting which caused her heart to have as slight arrhythmia but this was fixed very quickly. She can walk up stairs and shower herself and do some small/simple chores around the house. She is very weak but attributes this to being bed bound and not eating for the best part of 4 days. She will be having vestibular physio to help with her balance. All in all, the surgeons said her operation was \u2018textbook\u2019. So we are pretty relieved.", "Help?  3 x 2 seems nice and small. How can we support you? It is a rough and rugged road for sure...\n\nI have a 6x7 that is just hanging out and had been for two years now Ask for the radiologist report, to me that coronal marker (7mm) does not seem to be measuring anything and is out near the ear canal. Just do not let yours get to 36.1mm x 31.7mm like mine did.\n\nI am hoping that yours still being that size gives you better treatment options. do you have any symptoms? Hearing loss mostly, and tinnitus. Most days it is fine, sometimes it really gets me down that my hearing will only get worse from here. What are your symptoms? I just discovered by accident actually that I have one, roughly the same size. But since I found out, my poor balance has miraculously disappeared. Doctors said it was due to stress. However, I still have a 2mm (originally specified as 5mm) AN, I will live with it until the doctors decide to send me to the gamma machine. Hey!  Here is a little about my story / path, in case this is helpful.  I was diagnosed in January and posted something similar.  I am 37 yo and had a  ~1.6 x 1.2 cm AN on my right side.  I had balance issues and very minimal hearing loss.   My diagnosis was an incidental finding from an MRI for a different reason. This is my experience since then:\n\nI got a referral to see a neurosurgeon in January, and wanted to get two opinions.  One was at a local, large hospital and the other was an academic medical center. The local hospital told me they could not help because it was too specialized, and to go see the academic medical center, which I was already doing. \n\n The way the neurosurgical practice at this medical center operates is that they do this type of procedure joint with ENT. The first person I saw was the ENT. Since my hearing in my right side has only minimal loss, they recommended the medial fossa approach. This approach allows them to preserve the hearing have in my right ear and if the tumor gets any larger, they will not be able to use the medial fossa approach. They said since I am relatively young, they thought I would have to eventually have surgery anyway, It makes sense to try to save my hearing.  They said positive outcomes are all correlated with being \u2018young and healthy.\u2019 Similarly, they did not think radiation was a good idea due to my age, plus, it could always start growing again. When I saw the neurosurgeon, he reiterated these points. So as a result, I was scheduled for surgery for June 28\u2013they did not want to wait any longer. They told me that I have a 60% chance of keeping my hearing and a 90% chance of keeping my right sided facial function.  They also said they did not think it would affect my balance long term (at least they said I would still be able to snowboard no problem).  Now, I am waiting and getting things for work in order.  \n\nPost medial-fossa surgery in June, I have basically symmetric facial function and lost hearing below 1000 Hz on may right side.  It does not interfere with life too much, since the speech range is &gt; 1 kHz.  Balance function is also pretty good, and also a continual work in progress\n\nAs it turns out, the academic medical center in my city is one of the best places in the country for this surgery.  This gave me and my family a lot of peace.\n\nI hope this helps, and  I hope everything goes well for you\u2014feel free to DM me if you have any questions or want to connect Assuming that it is a left sided tumor, the measuring stick that is 7 mm is on the other side from your tumor.  Would pay attention to what they counseled you about on the phone.  Cannot really see the tumor clearly on the pics.", "Diagnosed today - incidental AN, no symptoms Hello all\u2014 I had a seizure recently and they did an MRI and found an AN (which they think is unrelated to the seizure).  It is approx 1.5 cm x 1.1 cm.  I do not have any symptoms (hearing loss or balance issues).  I am wondering if any of you were diagnosed this way, and if so, how long might it take to develop symptoms?  It also strikes me as reasonably large for not having symptoms. Anyways, I am just trying to process this information and would be grateful for any insight you could provide.  Thank you in advance. I will not ask your age, but treatment tends to fall into 2 options.  Very generally, younger people tend to opt for surgery, while older people (50+) tend to opt for radiation.  You could probably just Watch &amp; Wait a little while (subject, of course to your doctor\u2019s advice), but I waited for a few years after dx with a 1.4 cm AN until it grew to 1.8 and I decided on radiation, which may not have been an option if my AN grew much larger.  \n\nAnyway, most importantly, 8 years after successful radiation (Gamma knife), I hardly ever even think about it anymore.\n\nEdit:  I experienced single side hearing loss and dizziness, which led to a diagnosis 10 years ago.  Thanks for the reply\u2014I am a 37 yo male.  It helps to know there is a size cutoff for radiation.  Next, I guess I wait to see what the doc has to say. I wish you all the best. I had a 2cm x 1.6 cm AN, I had tinnitus, hearing loss, balance issues, then it started even headaches and then even my right side of the face going numb. The tumor was in contact with both n. trigeminalis and n. facialis so If I did surgery I would become paralyzed in my right side of the face so I decided on Gamma Knife radioation. I am young for radiaton, I am 19 years old but the chances for the tumor to become malignant are not that huge and I was not having my face paralyzed at 19 so I went for it. So far so good, I will get my results in May after I do a MRI to see if the tumor shrank or not Thanks for the reply\u2014I definitely hope it shrinks! Thank you! Hello,\n\nWe are pretty similar, 37yo with a 1.8 x 1.8 tumor. I was diagnosed by MRI, but I did have symptoms. I lost my hearing in one ear, and have since developed numbness on the same side of my face. \n\nMy tumor is unusually shaped and closer to my brain stem than ANs normally are. I had a long consultation with the two neurosurgeons/neurotologists handling my care. One strongly leaned toward surgery, the other presented the pros and cons for surgery vs radiation. Every tumor is different and every person is different, and for me, surgery was the better option. It was a tough call though. \n\nMy surgery is in a few weeks, so I do not yet have that experience to share. I know in making the decision that the risk of facial paralysis and vertigo and going through the recovery, which sounds like a beast to get through, sucks but the better long-time prognosis is worth it. \n\nBest of luck to you. Please feel free to ask away, I am in the thick of it right now and I am happy to share any information that might be helpful. Thanks for your reply and I hope everything goes well for you!  I do have some questions if you do not mind.  Do you have an idea of your tumor growth rate?  How fast did symptoms come on?  How did they describe the potential outcomes for radiation treatment?  Like, did they think it would help your paralysis or bring your hearing back (is that even possible with this type of tumor?)?  Thanks again for your input. I was 26 when I was diagnosed with mine and had surgery, pretty limited with symptoms aside from hearing loss, which was chalked up as just bad genetics for 10 years until we actually found the AN when other symptoms reared their head. Turns out it was a massive AN, more than 4cm and was blocking CSF from my spinal cord. The final straw of symptoms was intense numbness on the left side of my face, mainly my cheek and mouth. But my point is that it seems from my experience, and a ton of other peoples experience from the groups I have joined, that everybody is different snd there is a wide variety of circumstances and symptoms out there. Definitely check out the Acoustic Neuroma Association, they are an awesome group of people and have support groups that meet virtually. You will get a lot of information there, and please feel free to DM if you need any other information. Always happy to help 10 years ago I first started having vague occasional numbness on the right side of my face and vague occasional vertigo.  1 year ago I had sudden single side hearing loss; in June I was diagnosed with an 11 mm AN by MRI.  I will have another MRI in 6 months and we will see if it is grown. The most important thing I have done so far is get a hearing aid; my hearing loss was accompanied by raging tinnitus and the hearing aid offers enough stimulation to settle it down. \n\nI am 54 btw; I am still in the surgery zone, because if radiation were to fail and it came back in 15-20 years I would be in trouble. I had my tumor for about 7 years before I had anything done about it.  The doctors told me that some people live their whole lives not even knowing they have one.   My initial symptoms were dizziness, but that seemed to subside, thus the reason I waited.  I did have slight hearing loss that was only detected with a hearing test.  It is possible you have such slight symptoms you do not even realize.  Eventually I started having issues with the nerves on one side of my face, so decided to have surgery.\n\nI would see what your doctors advise is.  If you have no symptoms they may say to \"watch and wait\". Thank you for your response\u2014I hope yours does not grow!  I do think I have mild ringing in my right ear, but I only notice it when it is quieter.  I am guessing what you are describing is something you hear all the time?  I am guessing they will ask me to follow up in 6 months or so as well. One thing that is weird is I have had pretty extreme and unexplained weight loss, which I am wondering if that is part of the story.  Anyways, it is weird now trying to go back to my regular life and live like normal, but I guess that is how it goes.  Thanks again. Thanks for posting\u2014I think you are probably right.  Did you have dizziness 7 years ago, that seemed to get better, and you waited at that point?  Was that weird just waiting for symptoms to occur?  I feel like that is the position I will be in as well.  Did you already have your surgery?  If so, I hope it went well!  Thanks again. I was in full freak out for several weeks after my diagnosis. Like, \u201chi guess what I have a brain tumor ...\u201d but finally I realized that I was living every day at anxiety level of \u2018brain surgery tomorrow\u2019, which is just not sustainable for the long haul. I made an agreement with myself that I could freak out all I want to after I schedule surgery at some point in the next few years; until then, chill!  Somehow that worked and now six months later I hardly think about it. Thanks for the well wishes! \n\nWe do not know how fast my tumor grew, since I only had two MRIs one month apart. My tumor did not noticeably grow in that time period though. \n\nOne day in July, I answered my phone and could not hear anything when I held it up to my right ear. I moved the phone to my left ear and could hear fine... uh-oh. I thought it was swimmers ear, allergies, an ear infection, something that commonly happens. I had no heating issues at all before - my ENT said that it is common for symptoms to appear suddenly although they build slow. He said my tumor has probably been growing for a decade, increasingly pressing on my nerve until it hit a tipping point. He likened the tumor pressing on my nerve to something pressing on a cable, where it is not a noticeable impact until it is. \n\nAs far as radiation goes, there are the obvious benefits of avoiding surgery and successfully removing the tumor. However, being somewhat young (like you), radiation does carry the slight risk of eventually turning the tumor malignant. It is worth the risk when you are 60 or 70 and do not have to worry much about what will happen a free decades down the road. Hopefully, I will still be kicking around in a few decades though. \n\nAnother concern for radiation is that it can cause scar tissue that would make future surgeries more difficult. \n\nNeither radiation nor surgery would restore hearing in my right ear. I have some residual hearing which comes and goes, but for the most part my ear is dead. The results from my audiologist were that my cochlear hairs and ear drums are both unresponsive, and since they were so damaged for so long, there is no coming back. \n\nOn the upside, *majorly* on the upside, is that my facial control should be helped by surgery. Removing the tumor means my facial nerve will be free from pressure, and unlike my auditory nerve, damage once done is not permanent. So far, I only have a weird tingly numbness, nothing that anyone could see. I am worried that surgery will make it worse, but I can live with it if I must. \n\nNobody recommended the \u201cwait and watch\u201d approach to me, but that is because of my unique tumor. One of my neurosurgeons described it as a terminal time bomb, which was a pretty awful thing to hear. Both of my neurosurgeons said that surgery is not an emergency, but it is urgent. In the time that has passed since my consultation in December, the facial numbness started and I started to feel the tumor pressure inside my skull. Weird! But not painful. I am glad it is coming out. \n\nI know this is long, but hopefully it helps! I had mine removed about 3 months ago.  I was diagnosed the traditional way-hearing loss then bad vertigo with intermittent hearing loss.  I was pretty devastated because all I heard was \u201cbrain tumor \u201c.    But it is treatable.  Mine was causing ongoing balance issues so we opted for surgery since it was pressing on things and grew relatively fast. I had a clean mri in 2007.   You do not need to chop off your hair. Just braid it up right before your surgery. You want it so it does not cause a pressure point,so kind of on top of your head on the opposite side. Once you are cleared to wash your hair, undo the braid and you are all set.   I had to have a second surgery because I had a bad csf leak and it made me collapse a few days after I left the hospital.  That was scary but they came up with a plan to repair it and I was out after another 4-5 days.   I was amazed at how weak I was, but it all came back pretty fast. I got a cane so I could signal that I was going to walk slow and not get run over by impatient people. And to move my cats out of the way.  I made lasagna and chili to freeze so it would be easier for my husband to feed us during the first 2-3 weeks.  Try not to be too scared. It is scary but the outcomes are very good.  You will be surprised at how quickly you will bounce back. Just do not push yourself too hard too fast.", "Is MRI without contrast usual? Hi, I have had an MRI due to unilateral tinnitus and hearing loss.   I have seen mention of using contrast dye to detect small ANs but I did not have this.  My Scan was of both internal auditory meatus and only took about 9 minutes and was just wondering if this was usual. My MRI was both with and without contrast, so take that as you will. My initial scan to determine if there was a problem (2008) was with and without contrast and lasted well over an hour so they could image all parts of the brain. \n\nMy follow up scans are also with contrast but do not take nearly as long, maybe 30 minutes since they know exactly what they are looking at/for. I had with and without (yup, I have got one!). I always go in without, then they put it in me towards the end with contrast dye to take the last few pictures. Some metal used (Gado\u2026um something) in \u201cWith Constrast\u201d is mentioned harmful on long term. I avoided it in last one but my second opinion doctor could not gauge the tumor correctly. Thanks everyone, I wonder if they will be able see enough detail from my scan. If it was done with IAC protocol this usually includes a FIESTA or CISS sequence. This is usually sufficient to screen for even small AN hour even without contrast. It is cheaper, faster, and you can avoid using Gad. However, if it is positive you would have to repeat with contrast to confirm diagnosis. Thanks, I had not heard of this technique. I presume this must have been what they used, they do not give out details but I received a letter from the ENT consultant today saying my scan was normal. I presume this means they looked for AN and did not find any. I would still like to know what has caused my hearing loss and if there is anything that can be done to prevent it getting worse but I do not think they will be doing any more investigations. Unfortunately or fortunately usually imaging is negative. The thought is usually sudden hearing loss is due to viral inflammation, as can be seen with shingles and other herpes viruses. The other potential cause is due blood vessel damage to the small arteries that supply the inner ear. Sadly there is no way to determine this in a live human, but both have been confirmed in studies of cadavers as possible mechanisms Ok that is interesting, I have had some issues after viruses in the past with autoimmune conditions. I do not recall illness around the time my tinnitus started but I suppose it could have been mild. It is a relief not to have a tumour but also frustrating not to know the cause or if I will maintain some hearing.", "Anyone done an MRI without contrast for suspected AN? Last time I did an MRI with contrast I had severe allergic reaction.  My initial MRI that spotted and diagnosed my AN was without contrast, as was my second one so it certainly wouldnt necissarily stop a scan picking one up.  However, all my scans since then have been with contrast, but from what I understand the contrast just helps define the margins and exact dimensions of the AN and help spot any small growth. Thanks still waiting on my scan . Two weeks so far.   The FB groups of people who have had this are pretty scary , lots of terrible results after surgery! One thing I would say is (if it is an AN) dont rush into surgical intervention.  I was diagnosed 2.5 years ago with a 19mm AN which has shown no growth since initial diagnosis and 6 monthly scans (although im down to yearly scans now).  Aside from tinnitus and slight issues with balance I have had no other issues, my consultant reccomended that if it is not growing then doing surgical intervention can cause more problems than it solves.  I may need to re evaluate if it starts growing but much like you the potential complications from surgery make me very wary too. Thank you Yeah some of the stories make me want to skip my mri and just see how life goes.  Some folks are basically crippled after the surgery!  Right now I just have tinnitus. Yes. I was pregnant so they could not do it See what your doctor recommends.  Many people are just one a \"wait and see\" status.  Mine was so big that it was a serious problem.", "Waiting for an MRI scan Hello. I have recently been experiencing unilateral tinnitus. Low drone in one ear, some fulness sensations and only a few brief, mild, very transient episodes of dizziness. NO hearing loss in either ear. Im fatigued a lot of the time and have always experienced headaches. A specialist has referred me for an MRI scan. I am trying not to overthink this, as I know AN is supposedly rare, although I know two people who have experienced AN and needed surgery. Is it possible to have AN without hearing loss? From reading about it I do not think so? I am surprised that I have been referred for scan that is all .....and would prefer not to have one if it is not necessary. Thanks Did the specialist give you a hearing test?  Initially I did not think I had hearing loss until they tested it. Hello. Thanks for your reply. Yes I had a hearing test with an audiometrist. My hearing is fine in both ears. Same with me. In hindsight, my hearing had become more and more muffled, but I thought I was just getting old. My AN was probably 15+ years old before doctor's discovered it. Thanks very much for sharing your experiences. I really appreciate it. I have received an appointment for my scan so hopefully do not have too much longer to wait till I know for sure. Thank you very much for sharing your experiences. I really appreciate it. i dont think u have AN ... please reply your topic after u get mri scan Thank you. I do not think so either. It is hard not to worry sometimes though. I will update once I have had scan and results. Thanks for taking the time to reply. np brother :. any good updates ? I have had an MRI scan. Follow up appointment with the consultant is on 14th June. Im hoping due to appointment time that all is clear as it does not seem an urgent appointment. I will update once I know for sure. yea ur fine but u have to look to your results at online.. Had my MRI results today and thankfully all clear. Thank you to everyone that posted here. It was very comforting to read and get support during the uncertainty of the wait. Did you ever find out what caused your tinnitus? I too have a \"low hum\" tinnitus. Hello. Apologies. Only just seen your message. My MRI showed no abnormalities. My tinnitus comes and goes and I am still none the wiser. Initially I did not think it was a pulsatile tinnitus but often it has a rhythm, or throbbing type sensation. It does not seem to match my heart rate so my consultant was not overly concerned. I would have needed a slightly different type of MRI to investigate this. I am relieved it is not an AN. I have low iron levels and low B12 so wonder if it might be connected to that? I hope you find an answer. It can drive me mad when it gets full on. Good luck on your search.", "Advice for person who is spouse has AN My wife has an AN and is scheduled for a translab surgery in a few months. For those of you who have been through this, do you have any advise or info to pass along that would be useful to her or I for her recovery. Luckly, I am able to take FMLA leave for a few weeks to help assist in her recovery and any useful info you are able to pass along to help me aid her is greatly appreciated. Thanks! Watch Mark Ruffalo's video interview. Have confidence in your surgeons. Ask for a conservative surgery to avoid irritating the facial nerve and avoid facial palsy side-effects. This approach will likely leave a chuck of tumor hugging the facial nerve. Insist on a MRI follow up 6-9 months later to see if the tumor is growing back. I waited too long (12 months) and had to have a full repeat of the surgery because the tumor grew back 100% in a year. Small thing: if your wife wears glasses, take off the temple on the affected ear side and have her try them out before the surgery. I did not realize I would not be able to wear my glasses like normal and it was not until my wife came back the next day that I could see. I had the mid fossa approach. Presumably the trans lab will also require you are not running against that area too, but I guess it could not hurt to ask.\n\nA shower stool will probably come in handy too. And a handheld shower head. She does. Thank you so much for your help! I agree with everything the other person said here. I still have a small amount of tumor left on my facial nerve, and even with that still have a bit of paralysis, but a lot of my facial movement has come back with time and exercise. \nAlso, pay attention for csf leaks... I am not sure how common they are, but it happened to me twice after both of my two surgeries that I had scheduled, resulting in two unscheduled surgeries. It took me about 3 months to get back to work, and now it is 3 years later and I feel pretty great!\nFor after surgery, of course ask your doctor, but have some lubricating eye drops, they helped me a lot for the first few days.Tell your wife to stay strong! Please come join the acoustic neuroma support groups on fb. They have been what got me through mine. And are super active. \n\nBe patient with her. Recovery is going to be real rough and a lot slower than any other surgery. She going to have days with headaches,  days with dizziness and days she is going to be super fatigued. It gets better though. \n\nI am 5 months out from retrosigmoid this coming week. The morning after my surgery, the ICU nurse asked if I wanted to sit in a chair and said good. \"Oh, that is great--your doctor hates to see his patients still in bed!\" I was very fortunate in that I had two of the best doctors in STL for this procedure. Now, that being said, I ended up returning to the hospital a week later because I developed hydrocephalus (unrelated to the surgery itself, but the procedure seemed to open the floodgates, so to speak). Fortunately my neurologist got me in, plunked a shunt in, and I was back in business.\n\nRealize that your wife is most likely going to be deaf on one side (if she is not already)--you are going to be hearing \"huh?\", \"what was that?\", etc. Patience is a virtue and a necessity. I got lucky because I wear CROS hearing aids which help me immeasurably, but they are not perfect. At one point my daughter lost her temper with me and said, \"Do you know how irritating it is to have to repeat everything to you?\" To which I responded, \"Do you know how irritating it is to have to ask?\"\n\nGetting up and walking was excellent therapy (for me at least)...though when I told my neurologist that I was doing two miles on the treadmill a day he gave me a look and suggested I slow it down a bit. You have to understand that I am a runner and by god I was going to get back to where I was come hell or high water. And I did eventually, but it took time and patience.\n\nHer doctors should insist on periodic MRI's to monitor the situation. I was able to move to every two years after this year's checkup. Also--just out of curiosity, I noticed your handle. Where is your wife having her procedure done? I had mine at BJC in St. Louis. Same place for us, I believe. We just got the details the other day and things have been hectic, but I am pretty sure it is at the one on Kingshighway. I am willing to bet it is the same doctor. I will consider that. Can you share the group link with me? Thank you very much for your input and support. Ha, yes hearing loss has been a bit of an issue (which is how we figured out the tumor existed). Thank you for the advice, it is truly appreciated!   They have both been very helpful,  the groups are very supportive and you get a lot of questions answered just by reading others posts at times. \n\nI went into my surgery with the best team I could get in my state. And feeling like I was prepared. \n\nI felt way less alone knowing there was a whole community of us going through the same thing together. It real calmed my nerves and settled at least some of my worries. No one has exactly the same outcome and recovery,  but we are all going through this. Mine was McJunkin, with Rich assisting. Feels like the CAM is my home away from home these days! Same here. We were at Disney World, and we were walking down Main Street when my wife smacked me on the shoulder and pointed out she would asked me a question. I never heard her...which led to an audiologist, which led to an MRI...you know the rest. :)", "How long was your recovery from surgery, and how was it in general? OK? Awful? I was diagnosed in mid-2019, and my AN is still small. I am still in active surveillance and my doc is thinking middle fossa surgery when the time comes.\n\nFor those who have had surgery, how did it go,  and how are you doing? If it is still quite small why are not you opting for radiation? Surgery was okay. Was in icu for one night, hospital for 4 days total.\n\nDid physiotherapy sessions once a week for a month after. Returned to law school about six weeks after surgery for part time studies.\n\nTinnitus and my change in anxiety levels were the worst after effect. For multiple reasons. Why do you ask? Thanks for your reply. Yes, that really sounds like a lot to handle.\n\nI hope you are feeling better. :-) Well because mine was/is small and since surgery is pretty drastic and results in total hearing loss on that side, my doctors recommended a course of three stereotactic radiation sessions. So far it seems to have worked and I still have hearing on that side.  It is reduced but it already was.  \nBut, I am NAD and not *your* doctor so I am guessing they have reasons but have you gotten a second opinion?

If I laid with my right ear exposed in bed for instance, I could not hear my wife very well (sometimes at all). Ringing got worse and worse. When 2021 came I went to get my annual physical and my primary doctor inspected my ear and could not see anything. He suggested going to an ENT. ENT inspected, could not see anything, and ordered and MRI. The MRI came back with evidence of an acoustic neuroma (1.9cm).\n\nI went to see a specialist at Rush hospital and spent this past summer doing more tests, exploring options, and meeting with a neurosurgeon. Because my tumor was small, the neurosurgeon actually suggested radiation only. He was supportive of whatever decision I made, but felt like the best course of action was to radiate and monitor with annual MRIs.\n\nAfter some hand-wringing and discussions with my ENT surgeon, I ended up wanting to do surgery (things growing in your head, ya know?) My hearing was about 80% gone in my right ear, and I wanted to eliminate the ringing if possible. \n\nOne of the things that became a possibility was a cochlear implant. My doctor brought it up to me because he felt like I was a good candidate to have one installed during my surgery. I went in for all the pre-op cochlear tests, etc. in preparation to wake up with an implant.\n\nSurgery was 12/13 and I went in anxious (as to be expected), but VERY confident based on the experience of my doctors, and the loads of success stories they had been part of. If you are reading this and your fear is that you will not wake up from surgery - that is technically a possibility, but EXTREMELY unlikely. My neurosurgeon made me laugh because he said he thought the biggest risk of \"disaster\" was that maybe HE would have a freak heart attack while he was giving me surgery. I felt VERY safe with my doctors and you should too.\n\nSurgery was translab and I was on the table for about 9.5 hours. After seeing my hearing nerve, my doctor determined that the implant would NOT be a good idea, so they did NOT install it. I am now fully deaf in my right ear.\n\nBeing awake post-surgery the first 30-60 minutes was the worst part. I was disoriented and felt \"upside down\" from my vestibular system being out of whack from the surgery. Within a couple hours I was uncomfortable, but in my hospital bed, with minimal pain, and able to sleep in short stints. Over the next 48 hours I was able to regulate my sleep and be fairly comfortable. I was in the hospital for the day of surgery, and 4 days following. I was eating small meals and drinking water 2 days after surgery without much issue.\n\nThe right side of my face is frozen, but my doctor said my facial nerve was in really good shape, so it should just be a matter of time (6-12 weeks) before things recover. Just 10 days out, it is already a LITTLE better, but I have difficultly talking and eating. And I have to drink everything through a straw (I hate straws) and I have to \"pinch\" my mouth closed to drink. My pain is almost non-existent (10 days out). I took painkillers for only 5 days and the last day was really just to help me sleep. If I get some low-level pain now, I take a couple Advil and it does the trick.\n\nAll things considered, I am confident that life should get back to normal in a few months and I am thrilled to have found this group to hear the stories of others who have recently (and not-so-recently) had their surgeries.\n\nHere is my advice/thoughts as a newb post-op:\n\n\\- drink your water and TAKE YOUR LAXATIVES WHEN THEY GIVE THEM TO YOU. I did start taking them, but not until about 4 days after surgery and that was the biggest mistake. Painkillers will give you constipation, or in my case - impacted feces (I guess I was the last person on earth to know this). You do not want this. I have gotten past it now, but you DO NOT want to know that pain. You need to take stool softeners/laxatives as soon as you start taking painkillers. Maybe before. Honestly - surgery was a walk in the park by comparison to the digestive issues I had.\n\n\\- before you go into surgery, get artificial tears, straws, and eye patches for home. You will need them. My right eye does not close yet and I have to wear a clear patch to keep my eye protected. They gave me eye patches and tears when I was discharged, but in case they do not for you - buy them in advance.\n\n\\-  eating is a little challenging. Soup, coffee, etc. are out of the question because they are difficult and messy. I am focused on eating protein and fiber and doing so slowly. My facial paralysis causes me to be a bit tired and sore after eating too.\n\n\\- I walk with a cane, but mostly for safety. I started PT today and (after testing) am considered BARELY \"medium risk\" for a fall. I CAN walk without a cane, but it feels like I have over-active shock absorbers and everything is wobbly. I am using my cane when I am out of the house (not very often) and you should too until your vestibular system re-learns.\n\n\\- being deaf in one ear... just last night I noticed a difference for the first time. I was watching that LCD Soundsystem holiday show and realized how \"flat\" the music sounded with just one ear. Obviously I could hear it, sing along, etc., but I did get a little emotional realizing hearing is different now. Would love to hear from others if that changed for the better as time has gone on or stayed the same?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope this post helps someone who is scared. If you have questions, do not hesitate to DM me or respond in the thread.", "cochlear implant anyone? I had a great consult last week where the surgeon threw in a surprise. I had mentioned how my tinnitus (now calmed by a hearing aid) was a concern if I lost the rest of my hearing in surgery (I have an 11mm AN). I would not have any way to stop the ringing without my HA. So he said, what if we do a cochlear implant during the surgery? Wait what??? I knew CROS and BAHA were options for routing sound to the other side, but I had no idea I could be a candidate for CI in my bad ear. I thought it was going to be over on my bad side. But no, maybe not.  CI is not perfect, but at least I may still be able to have directionality and tinnitus relief, which are the two things that bother me the most about the hearing loss I have now.  I have an appointment for CI evaluation in a few weeks. This is the most optimistic I have felt in the year since diagnosis.", "Gunfire exposure chart next to a AN hearing test chart. ", "Surgery Hello! I am getting my tumor removed this Tuesday. Any tips for calming down? Or just general tips? I am getting the Translabyrinthine approach since I already lost my hearing. I have had surgeries before but the only ones I am old enough to remember were outpatient surgery so this is new. I do not know, it is just nerve-racking. I understand. The only thing that kept me sane was that I had to drive seven hours the day before to get home for it!\n\nTreat yourself tomorrow. Do the things you enjoy doing, eat some of your favorite foods, that sort of thing. You are going to be okay. It is definitely a bit scary to think about, but you will be ok.\n\nHere are a couple little tips I gave to the husband of somebody (maybe you? They were also having trans lab) having the surgery last week. If you wear glasses, test out removing the arm on the affected side and wearing them that way. I had the mid fossa, but I assume they will not want you having anything against your ear either. I had to go a day without seeing while my wife and father got this figured out. You will likely need some type of shower stool when you get home and a handheld shower head. \n\nThere is likely a sensor in your bed to make sure you did not fall out. After I had my lumbar drain removed my wife helped to move to the chair and the nurse came running, so let them know if you want to move or go the bathroom , etc, even if you have somebody to help.\n\nGetting your balance back will not happen overnight, so be patient. Some aspects will take longer than others. It took me close to two months to feel totally comfortable driving of all things because whipping my head back and forth to check for traffic causes dizziness. It gets better though and in a year you will forget it ever happened, although I occasionally you will try some \"new\" head movement that might throw you of for a second. The best investment I made was to get a small radio. I was told that reading and watching TV were not really good options after trans lab surgery. That was the best $10 I ever spent. Hey! I had the translab surgery ~4 months ago. I was actually not nervous about the surgery itself, but I was nervous about how crappy I would feel post-surgery. \n\nSurgery is a piece of cake. You go in &amp; close your eyes, and bam!, you are waking up and it is all done. The thought made me feel much more calm about the surgery part. \n\nI think it is good to know that you will wake up and feel bad - and but it gets better every day. I woke up and my eyes could not focus on anything because of my newly severed left vestibular nerve. And the drugs made me throw up and my head hurt like crazy. But they give you more pain drugs that help, and all of the nurses were taking really good care of me, so I knew I was ok. \n\nI would highly recommend getting Audible on your phone and getting some audiobooks. I got some old favorites that were super long (~30-40 hours per book) and I listened almost continuously during my 4 days in the hospital. It was such a great distraction from the pain at night. \n\nAnd for the love of god, take the laxatives they provide for you. You are not allowed to bare down after the surgery, plus the anesthesia messes with your body. They offered me some weak-strength ones or some stronger ones and I though I would be fine with just the weak ones. In hindsight I should have taken all of them that were offered. Do not make my mistake!\n\nYou are going to be ok! It will suck, but it will get better. After about day 3 for me, every day was better than the last. Where is your surgery being done? Thank you :,) Nah I am not married. Not even old enough to be married lol. But I really appreciate the tips thank you! A Swedish hospital in WA Good luck. You will do great! Thanks I really appreciate it! Glad to see you came through with flying colors! Yay!  I had my surgery Wednesday. We can be recovery buddies", "Waiting for answers I posted a few Months ago but got cold feet and deleted, not 100% sure why really. I do not have any answers yet so I am posting to get some of the worry off my chest.\n\nI went for a Free Hearing Test thinking that I had just damaged my hearing from all the concerts in my 20s but left with \"You may have a growth\" and a referral for a Auditory Brainstem Response Test. My right ear was significantly worse than my left side, that paired with frequent dizzy spells and my vision going black when I move to quick/stand up they wanted me to see an ENT for the test. Sadly, I am in Rural Canada and healthcare is lacking so I am on an 8 Month wait list to even make an appointment for the Brainstem test, so I am just stuck wondering and waiting. I honestly had not given much thought to the dizziness because it seems to have started after I had my Daughter a few years ago, I figured it was just normal getting old/post pregnancy changes.\n\nI was pretty shocked at first, now I have just settled into a calm frustration because I will not know anything for so long. Have you seen anyone else regarding your dizzy spells and vision going black? The vision going black thing when you stand up (and potentially the dizziness if it also happens when you stand up) sounds more like a low blood pressure issue to me. If I could I would. I do not have a Doctor to see unfortunately, but my MIL has had me test my blood pressure a few times with her machine at home, even during dizzy spells, and it was good.\n\nOur healthcare really is in shambles. \u201cYou may have a growth\u201d is a pretty big leap to make from results of a free hearing test. For the vast majority of people the reason for hearing loss is never determined. I am not sure what an auditory brainstem test is, but my acoustic neuroma was diagnosed a year ago by MRI, which was given specifically to rule out any possible growth. I had surgery 2 weeks ago and am doing great. Well I am glad you are doing great! From what I understood they hook up monitor's to your head to find out how your brain responds to sounds to make sure it is getting through from the ear. I spoke with the ENT office over the phone who explained a bit. I am not sure why they are choosing this route over MRI, probably because the wait times on everything here are incredibly long, this may have been the quickest/easiest/cheapest. I would think if this came back showing issues they would then try MRI. As for the Free Hearing Test, it is just a regular hearing test, we just get a free one for first time. The Audio Tech? Audiologist? I am not sure what to call him, could not give me much more than \"possible growth\" since he was not a Doctor. Honestly, I would not even stress about this. An audiologist is totally out of line bringing up the possibility of a brain tumor to someone with hearing loss. Yes, you should look into why you have asymmetrical hearing loss in case there is a reason. Get your appointment for more testing. But you should look at this as \u201con rare occasions it can be due to a growth\u201d rather than \u201cYOU may have a growth.\u201d Until you have a MRI with contrast confirming the Acoustic Neuroma, do not jump to conclusions. After all, men get ANs more often than women.", "I have an MRI scheduled and was told it might be AN but that it is rare. Thoughts? Hi everyone. For reference, I am a 43 year old male, with no other health issues.\n\nMy symptoms began with ear fullness, slight dizziness, and slight nausea. This lasted for a couple of days, and now, the ear fullness, dizziness, and nausea are all gone. But I now hear a low hum that starts at random times (mostly but not limited at night). The duration and frequency are random: sometimes it can last for 10-15 minutes, at other times it can last up to two hours. It is not an overbearing sound that interferes with my daily activities.\n\nI made an appointment with the ENT and had an audiogram done. Results? Very good hearing but my left ear performed a lot worse than my right; there is around a 15 point dB difference, compared to my right. And BTW this was not my first audiogram: 5 years ago, I had an audiogram as a health screening, and the results, five years ago, where exactly the same (the doctor pulled up those old results to compare). So whatever's going on with my ears, not much has changed in 5 years.\n\nThe doctor stated it a little too bluntly -- after showing me the chart and explaining the hearing loss, he said 'It could be a tumor', I froze and widened my eyes when I heard this, and he followed with 'but it is rare, 99% of patients are OK' and recommended I get an MRI. I learned about acoustic neuroma aka vestibular schwannoma from the paper work and have been looking this up ever since. How soon until your MRI? Nothing you have described points to it definitely NOT being an AN, so it could be. They usually grow pretty slow so it could have caused your initial hearing loss and then either stopped growing or grown in a way that did not impact the auditory nerve. Without the MRI that is all conjecture though and you will have an answer pretty shortly after that.\n\nIf it is anm AN, that is not the end of the world. I had one that was caught small, had the surgery to remove it last summer, and other than still having some tinnitus and needing to be careful looking over my shoulder while riding my bike, have gone back to life as normal. Some people do lose their hearing and have a tougher recovery though, so I do not want to make it sound like it is all rainbows and puppies. My MRI is at the end of this month.\n\nIf it is AN, and if I get surgery, the recovery time is what worries me (though I know it varies by individual). I have also read about many patients getting facial paralysis. I had a 3cmx3cm (Medically classified as \"large\").  The only treatment was surgery and though the docs said they would be as careful as possible, hearing loss was all but guaranteed.    \n\n\nI ended up with complete hearing loss on that side, permanent tinnitus, and wacky balance (cannot stand on one foot or pass a field sobriety test without wobbling constantly).  I remember watching an interview with Mark Ruffalo where he talked about trying to overcome his facial paralysis post surgery.  \n\n\nSurgery is not always necessary.  It could be small enough for other treatments (radiation knife, chemo, polareon beam therapy).  But let us take worst case scenario here and say you have a large AN and you need surgery.  First off ANs are benign and treatable.  They do not metastasize and surgery has a 99.5% survival rate.  Whatever side effects you may or may not have pale in comparison to coma/death (My ENT guessed with how big mine was and the way it was pushing against my brain stem that within a year I would have fallen into a permanent coma and/or died).  As mentioned earlier it is not the end of the world nor is it all sunshine and rainbows.  You will struggle, you will have good days and bad.  Ultimately, you will adapt. That sucks you have to wait that long. I was fortunate that my ENT was able to get an appointment like to days after seeing him.\n\nYeah, the recovery from surgery takes some time. I feel like my case was on the somewhat easy side and it was still 4 weeks until I was able to do a full day of working from home. I just got tired really easy. It was six weeks until I was comfortable driving due to getting dizzy looking back and forth when trying to enter traffic. Thanks for the information, everyone! I guess I will wait until the end of the month to see and then take it from there. Hey hope your MRI goes well.  There are great groups on Facebook for Acoustic Neuroma people and even people who are in your stage.  I had surgery in January for a 3.5cm tumor.   I am happy to answer any questions or give support.  I was diagnosed Sept 29 2019.", "Acoustic Neuroma surgery coming up soon. Any advice? Hey guys I have my surgery coming up next week and have been pretty anxious about it. My tumor is 12mm by 6mm so it is in the medium size range, and I am getting the middle fossa approach done to hopefully preserve the rest of my hearing. \n\nI just have so many questions. Did you have facial paralysis and how long did it last? How much hair do they shave off? I am going back to college after this and aside from a stressful semester, I am also worried I will be a half bald person with a crooked smile that is just limping around campus. \n\nI also have a history of smoking and reduced a lot over the past couple months but fully quit about a week ago, which is also stressing me out a bit. I got all of my preliminary blood tests done though, and the hospital cleared me for surgery. I do of course intend to tell the surgeon about this once I get there\u2014 they are scheduled to do my physical and get my personal history next week. Any advice would genuinely be very helpful right now.", "Seeking support while I wait results I woke up about 5 weeks ago with sudden reduced hearing in my left ear and tinnitus that was not present before. Ruled out infection and any trauma to eardrum. Audiology test shows hearing loss within the 3-4k range on the left side - minor, but noticeable to me and is at odds with the perfect hearing on my right side. I potentially have some minor vertigo too.\n\nFinally got into an ENT last week who has sent me off for an MRI which is tonight. All my symptoms appear to fit an AN, but I obviously will not know until I get the radiology report (hopefully I can collect it tomorrow).\n\nAs someone who finds it extremely difficult to wait (ADHD), just looking for some support or advice while I wait out the time til I get the scan and collect the results. Well my Ozzy internet stranger... It might be an AN, but know that life goes on. It is not a death sentence, it is not cancer it is not life threatening or completely debilitating if taken care of.\n\nIt sucks. It is random. It is unjust , unfair, but most importantly it is not your fault. This did not happen due to poor life choices, or anything in your control.\n\nSo, while the road is rough and rugged you can at least rest easy knowing not only is this out of your controll, but you will also live a rich and hopefully long life.\n\nI hope that helps...\n\n1.5 years into a 6 mm AN. Thanks for the response :) \n\nI am not too concerned if I have to have surgery - I have had 12 other surgeries and grew up with Mum/Dad/Sister being nurses.\n\nI am however concerned about losing my hearing. I have social anxiety anyway and this would make it worse for sure. It sucks. I have 30 percent word recognition in my right ear. Restaurants are a challenge. But, I am not deaf... I can still listen to and play music and hear my kid. I am not saying it is easy but man it is way better than being completely deaf 2 years post surgery here. SSD on the left. As other post mentions, crowded areas with lots if background noise can be a challenge.  You will still be able to hear though and there are options for implants if you so choose. Well, it turned out not to be an AN (yay), but instead is likely Superior canal dehiscence syndrome. More tests incoming!! Interesting, I had not heard of this before. I am in a similar position awaiting an MRI but have also recently noticed some facial tingling. I wondered if my ADHD meds might be affecting pressure in my brain but it is unlikely.\nEdit. 5 weeks from symptoms to diagnosis! I wish I was in Oz! (Apart from all the deathy critters) SCD does not typically cause a SNHL hearing loss and is usually accompanied by other strange symptoms. You likely had a sudden hearing loss which is fairly common. A CT is much better than MR at diagnosing SCD. Symptomatic SCD is rare but it is often an incidental radiologic finding. I had a CT scan too. Due to current restrictions I have not been able to see my specialist, but will be next week to discuss further next steps.", "Post translab crusty ear gunk I am 6 months post translab which removed a 5.5cm AN on my left side. I spent an extra 5 days in the hospital to fix a csf leak in that ear post surgery. The csf leak was supposedly fixed but I often wake up with a stinky ear crust on the AN side. I have never had any drips or anything out of that ear, just stinky crust. Is this another CSF leak? I have my 6-month post-op MRI in two weeks followed by a visit with my surgeons who will check it out then. Any thoughts or similar experiences? Fearing another \"procedure\".", "Survivors taken COVID-19 vaccine? Hello\nI am wondering if any survivors of acoustic neuroma have gotten the COVID-19 vaccine and has it caused any complications? Could there be concerns with the vaccine if you had AN surgery and recovered? I go the first round of the Pfizer vaccine, my second one is later this month. No complications, just the expected slight side effects/feeling a little crappy 2-3 days after the vaccine. \n\nMedically speaking, I do not see how a vaccine would somehow affect  recovered AN patients differently than it would affect anyone else. I do not think there is any cause for concern. But I am a medical physicist, not a medical doctor. Thank you!!! I had it yesterday. Nothing but a little sore arm. Thank you!!", "diagnosed with acoustic neuroma Been seeing my ENT for a few months for unforeseen hearing loss and tinnitus.  He recommended that I go get an MRI done.  ENT called me yesterday and told me that I have a rather large growth and said I will likely have to lose my hearing in my right ear in order to get rid of the growth.  Onto the specialists.  Having a hard time sleeping or relaxing due to the upcoming unknowns. Thank you.  I am sure that is what it will boil down to in the end is just the fear of what to expect post surgery.  The cochlear implant which ports the sound from your bad ear over to your good ear...not so sure that would work well.  I think it will still be difficult to determine where sound is coming from For me right now, I can not locate sound at all. Unless I am looking at that person or thing when it is makes noise. I opted out of cochlear because I never want another skull based surgery. But there is always options. \n\nIt can get really frustrating at times. Drive thrus are a beast. The box distorts their voice, and I am deaf in my left ear. So I snap my neck around the exorcist to hear. And I try and be honest when I feel people get frustrated when I cannot hear them. \n\nI have to have subtitles on everything now. And loud rooms (bars, arcades, casinos (despite covid) and really hard for me. It just kind of feels like I have a bucket on my head and sound just kind of pings around. \n\nIt is not so bad, honestly. Just inconvenient.\n\nIf you ever get overwhelmed and need a sounding board. Feel free to send a chat. Itll work out!! Thank you.  I am thinking of avoiding the cochlear implants as well.  Plus the magnets in the implants have their own magnetic field and block out an area around them in MRIs.  I would imagine annual MRIs are in order to ensure nothing is growing back. Yep! I am almost a year post op and have an MRI coming up. They get less and less if there is no change after a certain amount of years, per my surgeon. Wow, what an excellent outcome!  I did have a CSF leak, so needed abulance ride and a second surgery.    My pressure headaches are brutal, especially after I sneeze or cough.  I am hoping it is due to the CSF leak repair and that the stuff blocking my eustachian tubes will eventually be absorbed.  I also felt drunk - which is why I wanted the surgery -  and kind of still do.  I hope that goes away.

", "Suddenly low pitch tinnitus on one side. No balance problems. Getting an MRI next week. What are my odds? Age: 42\n\nWeight: 193 lb\n\nDuration: 11 days\n\nNo relevant medical history.\n\nI suddenly developed tinnitus in my right ear on Jan 30 this year. It is a low pitched drone. Sort of sounds like there is a big cargo airplane circling my house at all times. It is there most of the day but sometimes goes away.\n\nThere is also a distortion that I can hear in that ear for sufficiently loud noises of sufficient duration. For example, when I am listening to a podcast with earbuds, I can hear a crackling distorted sound in my right ear. Initially I thought there was something wrong with my earbuds, but after a day or so I found that I could hear the distorted sound as a result of my own voice or when other people are speaking to me.\n\nSo this is pretty upsetting obviously.\n\nI got it checked out. No infection. My ability to hear out of both ears is normal.\n\nGP thought it might be a dehiscence but gave me antibiotic drops to try.\n\nENT thought it might be an acoustic neuroma, and scheduled me for an MRI with contrast next week.\n\nNow I understand that contrast makes a dramatic difference in the quality of the MRI, but given the uncertainty about long term effects of gadolinium, I looked around and found some articles saying it might be fine to do an MRI without contrast.\n\nSo my question is, given that acoustic neuroma is a slow growing tumor that I am unlikely to have, does it make sense to request the MRI be done without contrast?\n\nIs there anyone on the sub who had their acoustic neuroma story begin this way? Gadolinium is only a risk if you already have kidney issues and your doctor would be best to advise you. Ultimately you have to decide if you are okay with not knowing if you have a brain tumor. You can just wait and see if you get more serious symptoms.  I personally could not do that, so I did the contrast.  Was v. surprised when I came back with AN. That said, the odds are low of it being an AN.  Meniers is more likely but sucks just as much because you have the same symptoms.  I do not think the tinnitus ever goes away, but you kind of get used to it so it is not as annoying as it is in the beginning. \n\nI started with sudden single sided deafness and really really annoying tinnitus. I would not have gone to the ENT because I never go to the doctors. But I could not stand it, so I made an appointment on day 3.  It cleared up with the steroids. 4 months later I had a 3 day vertigo session (really bad). I roughed it out, but after a month of feeling drunk and really bad hearing I went back to the ENT. I was diagnosed with Meniers and got the MRI to rule out AN. It was AN. I was stunned, then scared, then okay. It is treatable and the people here are so helpful in talking you through it.   I read a lot and just focused on it not being malignant. The surgery was not fun and I had a complication that made it worse. But I am okay and an getting a little better every day. I got the impression that it is difficult to diagnose without the contrast. I have an AN that started with tinnitus (ringing and computer beeps) and then moderate hearing loss...everyone is different. Personally I think it is worth getting the dye at least once to verify unless they can diagnose without it. Worth asking. I have had the dye like 10 times now. It will probably get me long before the AN. Haha. Mine is quite small and not growing so that is good at least. Hi - I am a diagnostic imaging medical physicist &amp; I am 7 months out from my AN surgery (4 cm AN removed via translab approach).\n\n\nIn your case, it makes sense to get an MRI with contrast. The risks of Gd contrast are slim to none, and there is a clear benefit to getting an accurate diagnosis - whether it is an AN or not. Even getting results that are negative are important! Please please do not risk missing a brain tumor diagnosis by turning down Gd contrast.\n\n\nIf it helps, I am committed to getting MRIs with contrast every 6 months for the next 5 years because I need to watch the residual tumor that was left behind to avoid nerve damage. I am worried about the tumor a bit (really hope it does not grow!!), but I am not at all worried about the Gd contrast. hello , i had same problem with you and i did my re-search about non-contrast mri and it is accurys about detect AN... If you search on pubmed - googlescho - ncbi then u can read that \"last publish about this is non-contrast t2-weighted fast spin mri is \"OK\" for detection ANs\n\nbecause that nerve already glowing in mri sequence.. u just need to tell your mri  technician and doc about \" i dont have contrast mri and want to rule out AN and other stuff so please just becarefully and know what you primely looking for\".... i had top-quality doc friends and also they said that \" its ok u can do without contrast , you already told doc and technician who doing mri about it.. if they find any suspicious thing then they can want contrasted mri\"... and this is what i did.. it came clear without any suspicious thing.. so my advice is ,talk with mri tech and doc about it . if they find suspicious thing then they can suggest contrasted mri...  \n\n\nread some publishments not old one , new ones... dont forget that gadolinium is heavy metal and stays in ur body forever.. even decades can be deteced with mri.. just speak about what i wrote to you with ur doctors .. they will tell you same..   \n\n\nplease inform us My tinnitus started very high pitched suddenly and then hearing loss gradually, my first MRI was done without contrast and it showed a 1.6 cm x 2.2 cm tumor then with contrast it showed the exact dimensions which were 1.6 cm x 2 cm. It is best if you do it with contrast cause some AN are more likely to be missed in MRIs when they are smaller, for example if they are less than 1 cm. Wish you the best :) hello , its very uncommon that missing AN if its exist.. even they cant tell size of it but they can say that \" mri sequence were suspicios and we want contrast mri\".. because that nerves glowling in mri naturally according to least publishments on pubmed - ncbi ...even they can detect tumors smaller then 5mm without contrast but they cant say that \"its menengioma or an or other stuffs\" or \"an with cystics or not\"  \nnew medical approch to this is non contrast MRI if there was something suspicious they want contrast mri , also in follow-up (watch and observe approch for small ANs) mri can be done with non-contrast at these days according to last publisments Hey, contrast is riskier than people are mentioning.

I went with contrast. I asked my doctor about doing it without contrast and he gave me a lot of pushback about that. In the end I decided that if I went with no contrast and got a negative result I would wonder whether it missed something.\n\nI verified with the MRI staff that they were using the new generation of contrast drugs. She told me they were using a macrocyclic formulation and that this scan would also require less contrast than they were using 20 years ago.\n\nNo symptoms of contrast toxicity so far. Here is to hoping I never see any.", "as for dizziness, anyone who has or had an acoustic neuroma, what kind of dizziness was it? was it persistent or was it only dizzy spells? and did you get it before the hearing loss or after?  I often feel a gentle rocking, or get the feeling I am walking down hill (indoors).  However what I learned in vestibular testing is that there are multiple structures in there, each handling a different kind of motion. Depending on which part is affected you may feel differently. Over all, my right side is 43% off from the left. This seems to bother me more sometimes than others, and weeks at a time when present. is it all the time?? I usually only notice it when I am also in motion, particularly if i move my head or pivot (like when working in the kitchen). Sometimes it does not bother me for months at a time, then starts up again. It is been much worse for the last 2 months, which is why I just had vestibular testing and will probably start vestibular therapy so that I can cope with it better. I was diagnosed last year after sudden hearing loss, but I first had vague vestibular symptoms maybe 10 years ago (which I am guessing is when this guy first started growing). Mine was / is not all the time. It came in waves. was that your first symptom? and what other symptoms did you have? im really nervous because i have been dizzy/lightheaded for almost 2 weeks but have no hearing loss or ringing in the ear or fullness in my ear No, my first symptom was hearing loss on one side. \n\nThen I got minor tinnitus, then I lost some feeling in the right side of my face, then dizziness/ just a weird confusion state sometimes. Mine was when I got up from sitting or lying down. I called them dizzy spells as they would go away after I moved around a bit. Not knowing what was wrong with me, I started using a standing desk for work as the spells would be less frequent when I would stand. My first balance symptoms started about 3 months after the hearing loss(came back after a few days so we did not think much of it). The vertigo was severe for 3 days. One of the few times I could not work. It got to where I just felt drunk all the time. I actually waited a month to go back to see the ENT because I thought it was normal to just get vertigo. I was soon diagnosed AN with a MRI.  I mostly feel like I have had a few glasses of wine and it is not as fun as it sounds. I have never fallen over just walking, but I feel disoriented. If I wiggle my head around a lot , I feel better for a while. I had surgery and it is been the same. I just do aggressive head shaking before I walk and it helps. I am hoping it just gets better.  Some days I do not notice it. Must vary greatly for each person. Mine was discovered about a month ago because of hearing loss on my left side, and it is about the size of a golf ball but I have never experienced any type of dizziness. Not looking forward to the surgery or the complications that can happen from it, but I cannot wait to get it out of my head. Did you ever figure this out? My ENT found both my ears had no hearing loss but i do have fullness in one ear, headaches, and continuous feeling of being on a moving boat. Getting an MRI in a couple of weeks. Lmk what they say!", "Just diagnosed with a AN. Not sure if I should do surgery or radiation for treatment? Hi everyone (37 m). I was diagnosed last week, after multiple MRIs found the 6 cm AN. I have been losing my hearing for the past 2 years and I have been having frequent moments of dizziness and my vision turning black for a moment when I stand up. \n\nI am in touch with a great neurosurgeon but she is leaning towards radiation as a treatment, not surgery. Is it safer and easier than surgery? Also, I am extremely nervous about the face paralysis risks she mentioned. How common is this and is it permanent or easy to recover from post radiation/surgery? \n\nLooking for any advice/info you can offer. Thanks! Radiation is less invasive, which means a quicker recovery time. It is got a high success rate, and even if you end up on the wrong side of that statement (as I did), the surgery is still an option.\n\nFacial paralysis is a possibility, yes, but the procedures have gotten very precise to reduce the odds of it happening. I had mine removed a couple years ago and was 37 as well.  I had it surgically removed after both my ENT and neurosurgeon recommended against radiation, primarily due to my age.  They said they were not crazy about using radiation on people our age because there is more time for any negative side effects to develop later in life. hello i hope everything will be ok and good for you mate.. but i would like to ask why u dont go doctor for about lost ur hearing 2 year and other huge sypmtoms bro TLDR-  go with radiation, less invasive, easier recovery and highly effective! \n\nIf radiation is an option, I would highly suggest it.  Way less invasive, less side effects and way quicker recovery.   The success rate is so high! It was 98% when I had mine in 2009.  I would assume it is around the same or better now. \n\nI also fell on the wrong side of the odds and had surgery 2 1/2 years later.  That is one of the positives if radiation. If you fall into the very low percentage you still have the option for surgery. \n\nFor me, radiation was a chance to preserve my hearing , which I had not really lost much if at the time. Surgery was instantly 100 % hearing loss and I did not like that idea at first (I was 24) \n\nThe risks/benefits outweighed surgery by 150% for me.\n\nIf I had to do it all over again, I would pick radiation first again..knowing surgery came later for me. \n\nMy radiation recovery was about 3-5 days (I was just sleepy, and went out to eat after the procedure) no side effects except a TINY scar where they placed the head thing they used to keep my head still. It is not even noticeable. \n\nAs for surgery, Translab approach I had a 2+ month recovery, lost my hearing and balance on that side.  My docs were able to preserve my facial nerve which was a positive for me.   Since my tumor had already been radiated, the tumor was like scar tissue, so the surgery took longer than normal. My surgery was 15 1/2 hours.   I had an adverse reaction to being under so long, and had terrible body pain after from being on the table so long.  So I developed a blood clot in my lungs \u2639\ufe0f.  I also had a problem with the packing gel they use upon closure, and it made my throat muscles paralyzed l, so I gave myself aspiration pnemonia, bc I coughed up my food and drinks before realizing the problem.  I had to have a feeding tube for 8 days. \n\nOnce released from the hospital 5 days post op, I was home 24 hours and rushed back to the hospital with the blood clot and pnemonia, where I spent another 6 days getting my blood to the right levels for thinning. \n\nMy case was rare..post op complications like I had are rare. But this is why is do radiation again in a heartbeat. \n\nI am now 10 years post op and everything is going so great for me.  Sure I am deaf in one side...not that big of a deal, honestly.  No balance, but my body has compensated and I do not have many issues with that.  \n\nGood luck and please reach out with any questions!  Also, check the ANA website, lots of great info there and a great, very active forum Do you mean 6 mm? 6 cm is really really big and I would be surprised they would suggest radiation for that. I am definitely no expert, but as it was explained to me, radiation may cause the tumor to swell a bit afterward and so if the tumor is already large, they want to avoid that. 6 cm is 2.36 inches Thanks for the reply! I am leaning towards radiation since it is less invasive. Hopefully, that will be all I need to kill this thing. Good to know I have surgery to fall back on I guess. Did you lose your hearing after surgery? That is concerning, I will definitely ask about the long-term risks of the gamma knife treatment when I have my meeting with them in the next few weeks. I am leaning towards that over surgery since it is less invasive, but definitely something to consider. Thanks for the reply! Thanks for the reply. I still have most of my hearing in the affected ear. It feels like more of a clogged ear than complete silence. A minor problem I thought. I am also taking medication for another brain tumor (lucky me) that can cause dizziness. Both issues have aligned and I thought the medication was causing the dizziness and I thought the other brain tumor (which is now almost gone) was causing the hearing issues. Luckily I have been getting constant treatment and MRIs for the past few months so I am just glad we caught it now and not 10 years from now. Not initially--about two months after the Gammaknife I experienced a severe drop in hearing on the neuroma side (and you might want to ask about that). My memory thinks that it was a sort of reaction by the neuroma, but it was almost ten years ago so I am not sure.\n\nEventually, though, the neuroma resumed growing (very slowly), and so I went with surgery in 2017 based on the neurologist and ENT specialists' recommendations. That pretty much killed my hearing on the right side. I wear a pair of CROS hearing aids that are a big help. Thanks so much for your reply and medical history. I am glad to hear you have recovered from all of those complications and are feeling better, this honestly put me at ease to read and gives me hope for the coming months.   \n\n\nI am leaning towards radiation for the same reasons you mentioned. It seems like the logical first form of treatment rather than the grueling surgery option. I will most likely go with the gamma knife first and hope for the best with the outcome. It is good to know that surgery is always there as a backup option.   \n\n\nI am honestly more worried about face paralysis than losing my hearing in that ear. As scary as it is to lose any hearing, I am beginning to accept that outcome and just thankful that we are born with 2 ears haha. I have googled a lot of cases of this since finding out (never recommended haha but hard to avoid the impulse) and most people have recovered from facial paralysis within a year or so. Actually, the actor Mark Ruffalo (the Hulk!) had a AN, did the surgery and did have facial paralysis, and recovered from it. It gives me hope to hear yours and all of these people's stories. Thanks again for your perspective! Are you having any facial paralysis now? Has your doctor talked about how the tumor is in relation to your facial nerve?  \n\nWhen I found out my tumor was growing again after gamma knife, it was because I started to have bouts of facial paralysis when that was not a symptom prior to GK.  \n\nIt started to happen just when I stretched those muscles, during big laughing or crying, it eventually happened when I would just smile l, that is what prompted me to get an earlier mri and ultimately learned my tumor was regrowing. \n\nIf swelling if the tumor or nerves after GK.does happen, it does usually go away, especially if the nerve is not damaged. And things like physical therapy help that alot, should it happen. \n\nIt sounds like your AN is pretty large at 6cm, and if it is not causing facial paralysis now, I would think the likelihood would be low. My tumor was 2.3cm and grew to 2.5 before surgery. Yours just may not be close enough to the facial nerve to be a concern. \n\nBe open and honest with your doctor about your concern for that. I thought that I was being petty talking about not wanting my face paralyzed, since there are obviously much worse outcomes, but my doctor reassured me that this was a very big and very valid concern and that they would do everything they could to preserve my face.  They did...by leave a TINY piece of tumor connected to my face nerve, they saved it from any dropping during surgery. \n\nIf you go to the ANA website you may he able to find others that have had your samemdoctor or hospital and get their perspective.  That community is much more active than this sub I had surgery for mine.  I was a hearing preservation candidate, but my AN was fast growing and I was suffering from bad vertigo/dizziness, which are both indicators that surgery is preferable.  The vertigo and dizziness was gone after surgery and they got the whole tumor so I had a really good outcome and my hearing was saved. 6cm?!  Did you mean 6mm?  6cm is a very, very large size.  If it is 6cm, you will likely need surgery. Sorry, the results were confusing, I thought that seemed too big haha. The report I got said \"10 x 6 mm\"? I am probably reading that wrong. I think 6mm is correct. I read the results wrong. Sorry, I read the results wrong, they wrote \"10 x 6 mm\" so I thought they meant 60 mm which is 6cm. I am not a smart man haha. So I am guessing they mean 6 mm total.   \n\n\nAnyways, I have no facial paralysis at the moment, just the muffled hearing in my left ear and the slight balance issues and feeling faint when I stand. I also have occasional ringing in the ear which I believe is early signs of Tinnitus.  \n\n\nIf it is small I guess it is good that they caught it now, and radiation definitely seems like the best option if it is on the small side.   \n\n\nI will check out the ANA website for sure, thanks again! with that size tumor, 10 x 6mm, I would think wait and watch to determine the rate of growth would be the first thing to do.  while monitoring the growth rate may seem like doing nothing, it is doing something.  I was diagnosed with similar sized AN in 2014, and while it has grown some, and formed an extension into the cochlear aqueduct, it has not grown towards the brain stem.  So at this point, I am still getting regular MRI's and monitoring.  \n\nits true that my word recognition score on hearing tests has taken a dive (60%), and my balance is not so great, and I have constant tinnitus.   I am older; I understand that younger people are taking a bit different risks with their future.  but I think determining rate of growth is very important for any age group.\n\nafter having bad reactions twice to the gadolinium contrast, I opted out for future MRI's, and now get them without contrast.  they know its there and where its at from the previous times they used it, so they can now tell what they need to know without the dye. Good luck with whatever you choose. I had a 3.5cm AN diagnosed when I was 37. Surgery was my only option. Less invasive is the way to go, trust me. My neurosurgeon (Tufts medical boston) also did not recommend gamma knife as a solution due to My age with possible radiation side effects long term. Also, I did not have any ear function worth saving by the time I was officially diagnosed. I was 31 at the time of surgery and my AN was 3.2 cm.  If you DO have some hearing that can be preserved and since yours is a bit smaller maybe that is why radiation is a stronger solution. \n\nI had the trans lab surgery to remove the tumor in 2016 and did not end up with any facial paralysis and have not so far had regrowth but have my 5 year scan coming up. It was a very hard recovery for me! I ended up with a CSF leak that requires a second surgery and 3 weeks in the hospital. I am sharing that not to sound scary; but I did not know that was a serious possibility going into it and it really sucked! So if there are legitimate reasons why your doctor thinks gamma knife is the right call I would be open minded to that option! The other thing I will add, particularly because I read somewhere in the thread that your tumor is small, is just to be aware what personal stories you read online.  People are 100x more likely to share their negative stories than the positive ones.  For instance, I joined the ANA org message boards only to be told in response to one of my questions that \"most with positive outcomes do not seem to come back and post\".  Just my perspective on the insight you may get.  \n\nAs for surgery, mine was fairly straightforward.  One of the top ENT/Neurosurgeon teams in the state.  ENT gave me an 80% chance of keeping my hearing.  Unfortunately, that did not work out and, to this day, it still frustrates him because they monitored the nerve signal throughout with no change but it just went away.  But the nerve is still intact so you never know.  My balance came back pretty quick, esp. considering my preop testing showed no impact to my tumor side nerve so I should have been worse off when they cut it.  All in all, I was out of work about 4 weeks (probably could have used another 1) and by week 6ish, only my neurosurgeon could notice any facial paralysis and it was all gone by my 6 month f/u.  The only issue I had were prolonged surgical site inflammation related headaches but issues like that are rare long term.  Once I figured out that I could resolve that with a minor change in diet (just avoided high sugar foods, and I mean HIGH sugar) they went away.\n\nUltimately, my advice would be do not be GoogleMD.  Find an ENT and Neurosurgeon that have a LOT of experience handling these (because that makes a huge difference imo) that you trust and listen to their recommendations. Ahh, that size makes me feel better!  Good luck on your journey!  It is scary, for sure, but know that you are not alone and there are lots of people to support you! wow man what a luck i am sorry.... other brain tumor ? i guess menengioma ? non-cancerous i hope brother Same with the CSF leak. I think the repair is what is causing my ongoing headaches (6 months). I am dependent on pain meds. Please tell me that it gets better. And by meds I mean aleve and Tylenol. Which kind of surgery did you have? I had middle fossa at UCSD.", "Headache around incision 3 months after surgery I had my Schwannoma retrosigmoid on April 15 and came down with meningitis that went undetected, was released and then committed to the infection ward two days later. \n\nSince returning home two weeks later my recovery has been ok. Face still completely paralyzed, but that is about it. \n\nUntil four days ago. I have been waking up with headaches that are very localized to the area where my incision was. They generally last 30-60 minutes. It is now evening and the headache is back. \n\nThe pain is not bad, I would say 2-3 out of 10, but I am scared this might be reoccurring meningitis or something else wrong with my crater. Has anyone else experienced anything similar? It is been almost 3 months since surgery. No headaches. I had a csf leak post translab which put me back in the hospital for 5 days. I am now 11 months out with some facial paralysis, a weight in my eyelid, and left side hearing loss. No other issues to speak of. I am still having daily headaches 9 months out. I had csf leak. Still hoping it will get better. Incision site well healed, but some pain randomly around edges of area. Waiting for referral to new neurologist. I recently moved and have to find new providers.", "Anyone\u2019s AN missed on MRI? Hi all, almost exactly a year ago I had an MRI done because of one sided hearing loss, tinnitus and a bit of ptosis (droopy eyelid) on one side. MRI came back normal then (phew!). \n\nIn the past two months or so my tinnitus has gotten worse in the bad ear. I have new recurring headaches on that side, and a pretty constant ear ache. The eyelid is super droopy now, some weird vision stuff is happening, and I have got some numbness on that side of my face, too.\n\nHas anyone had a normal MRI and later was found to have an AN? I feel like something is wrong but also feel like an idiot going back when it is already been ruled out.\n\nAny perspective would be appreciated! Thanks all. You do not really say what else has been looked at to explain these symptoms. I would definitely be seeking second and third opinions at this point if you have not gotten any satisfactory answers . Mistakes CAN happen where results from different patients are mixed up, the scan is misread, etc. You are obviously having some sort of neurological issue and you would only be an idiot if you did not actively advocate for yourself. That is a good point... but the truth is nothing else has been looked at. My ENT basically said \u2018good news! Scan is clear. I was sure you had an AN but you are fine. Come back if your hearing goes in the good ear. No one wants to be deaf.\u2019\n\nTime for a new doc, I guess. If your ENT was aware of these other symptoms and that was his response, then yes you definitely need a new doctor. \nThe eyelid , numbness,vision , and headache sound very serious. I vote to get a second opinion. That is not something you should just put up with.   \nDid they use contrast on the mri?  Because if they did not then they could have missed a growth.  I would see a neurosurgeon or neurologist.   It really sounds like something is impinging on the nerves that go to your face and ear. Same exact thing happened to me two years ago. Change in my vision, nonstop ringing in my ear, dropping eyelid and eyebrow, and headaches. I am still going to doctors and I am constantly being gaslighted by them. The ringing in my right ear has gotten much worse so I am hoping someone will see. Also I studied my mri and see some weird stuff that is in the same spot as my weird symptoms and pains. And the right side of my skull grew a smidge including my face", "7mm acoustic neuroma diagnosed in October 2020, looking for help coping with it really Hey all. I had my diagnosis quite a while ago now, had my follow up scan last week and will be having consultation with ENT surgeon, neurosurgeon etc in about a months time. I am in Ireland and 38 by the way. It is all fairly devastating really and hard not to get really depressed about it. I know that I am at the good end of things in terms of the size and location (only in the ear canal). I do have symptoms though which are tinnitus, dry eye, slight balance issues and weird dizziness which is like little shifts in my vision, and little bits of numbness and strange feelings on that side of my face. I was hoping for some help from those that have been through similar experiences. I often do not have time to think about it as I have a very busy job but when I do I get overwhelmed and basically feel like my life is going to be all downhill from here then I feel sorry for myself and ask why do I have to be the 1 in 100,000. I know these negative thoughts are not helpful and I have to keep reminding myself of the positives, that it is not cancer, it is slow growing and it is treatable, so I have to keep it in perspective. Thanks in advance for any advice anyone can offer. Hello OP,\n\nNot sure exactly what you are looking for here , but I can provide an ear if you want to talk or answer any questions.\n\nFor context , I was diagnosed 5 years ago, and had two surgeries to have mine removed. I was in law school at the time, and am now a practicing lawyer. I had / still have all the same symptoms you have. Hi, thanks for responding. I am not sure what I am looking for either. I guess I am just reaching out as I find that it is very isolating having a rare condition like this. I find it really helpful to talk to people who have already been through it or are going through it. I get the impression that surgery perhaps is not always that effective. What was your journey with it? Do you feel better post surgery? You say you still have the same symptoms... It is most certainly isolating - and it always will be. I regularly have to remind people I cannot hear them in a crowded room, or that I suffer from tinnitus and cannot sleep well. But you get used to it.\n\nI still have all the same symptoms, in fact many of them worsened from the surgery. But I was diagnosed very young, and it was already 2 cm. My neurosurgeon highly recommended I get it removed. \n\nAs he said \u201c this thing will only get bigger - you will have to deal with it at some point. If we deal with it earlier we can get it before it causes more damage.\u201d That makes sense to have removed it. How old were you and why were there 2 surgeries? I am really hoping that mine has not shown any growth on this 2nd scan. Did you have any period of watching and waiting or just straight in with the surgery? Hi OP. I definitely empathize. I am in a similar spot - 9mm AC, I am only 32. I am in a waiting period to be seen by an ENT and start developing a plan and getting advice. I do not know much else. But the periods of waiting are where I start of overthink it all and wonder how my life is going to be affected, and how crazy it is that it is this rare and I got it.\n\nI am in Canada. Hi there. I am sorry to hear that you have one too. Sounds like we are in pretty similar situations alright. Can I ask what led to yours being discovered? Did you have symptoms leading you to get a scan? I suppose I try to think of it like there is a whole bunch of rare stuff out there that you could get so your chances of getting something is actually pretty high, it just happens to be this one. Do not know if that makes sense, I am no statistician! I was dx in December 2020 and heard from surgeon in January this year.  15mm affecting my face with what started with hearing issues then got better then spasms in face, now numbness. Tinnitus goes way back as some of the symptoms I was having before make sense now.  Will be having retrosigmoid sx. Doc wanted to do in March but I asked to wait until after May as symptoms not bad and personal things going on and probably could not have gotten in that quick anyway BUT now covid is worse and not as many sx so regretting waiting. I was 23 when I was diagnosed , 24 first surgery, 25 second.\n\nI watched and waited for about 8 months , just until my semester of school was done. My symptoms worsened in that 8 months so I am glad we did it. \n\nIt took 2 because my skull got infected during the first surgery. Second surgery was actually not tumour removal, but instead a skull rebuild. Hi.  I was diagnosed quite a while ago.  Was in \"watch and wait\" phase for 7 years as it was very small at diagnosis.  My symptom for discovering it was dizziness, even though that went away.  That is why I waited so long as I did not have any other symptoms and things seemed normal.  Eventually, it got to about the size of yours when I had surgery because it was causing spasms in my face.  I lost hearing on that side but my body had adjusted to compensate for balance since it was there for so long impacting balance on one side without me knowing it.\n\nAfter surgery I did not really have anything \"different\" besides the hearing loss and tinnitus, which I just got used to. I am so so sorry you are feeling so overwhelmed with your AN diagnosis. \n\nFirst, I want to say, it is more common than 1 in 100,000. I do not know that for certain but I DO know that I bump into people who have it or their brother has one, or something like that.  It is more common than you think. But, that does not downplay how scary it can be.  \n\nI also had some facial numbness when I was diagnosed, and that can really be bothersome, but mine has either gone away or I have gotten so used to it by now. \n\nI was diagnosed in December 2008, I was 23 years old. I had a 2.3cm AN.  \n\nHave you discussed \"watch and wait\" options or radiation? Gamma knife or Cyber knife vs surgery? \n\nIf you are a candidate for radiation I HOGHLY reccomend it. It has a great success rate of around 98%, of stopping the tumor from growing. \n\nNot to scare you, but I actually had Gamma Knife and had regrowth and had surgery afterward (translab approach in 2011) so I have been through 2 options, and I would still choose Gamma Knife again first. \n\nGamma knife (and cyber knife, from what I understand) is less invasive and keeps your hearing and facial nerves and balance more intact than surgery options. So for me, at 23, that was much more favorable. \n\n  This sub is not super active, but the Acoustic Neuroma Association website is very active, especially for support.  I do not know if it is international or just US based, but either way, the people will be very supportive for you if you are looking for that. \n\nGood luck to you, you will get through this and come out on the other end stringer than you knew you could be. \n\nWhen I was diagnosed I was freshly out of college, ready to start my life...fast forward to today and I am post gamma knife, post surgery, deaf in my right ear, but I am happily married, have 1 beautiful daughter, I am a stay at home mom and my life is perfect.   So I know it feels overwhelming now but I promise you, no matter what choice you make in your treatment, you will do great and you will be so happy no matter what! OP,\n\nI just listened to a message on my phone from the ENT regarding the results of my MRI. She said in the message that \"it is a mass\" that has caused my sudden hearing loss. I have an appointment tomorrow to talk more about it. It probably is an acoustic neuroma based on what I have read-hopefully not cancerous. I had sudden hearing loss about a month ago. Kind of in a state of shock. Always been healthy and never had major medical problems. I am 30 years old. No advice really here, just letting you know that I am here and am also about to go through with figuring this out. We will get through it and move on with life. Let us stay as positive as we can! Yes, stay positive. My AN (5.5cm) diagnosis and surgery were only two weeks apart (due to size), so I did not have a ton of time to contemplate the outcomes of translab surgery (8/2020). I was an active person before and I think that really helped me recover as quickly as I did. I also think it is incredibly important to stay positive and know that doctors have been performing these surgeries for decades. Yes, rehab was challenging, but I feel so much better without that thing in my head. If I had to do it all over again, I would. I have a 3mm AN... diagnosed in 2016. I have been on Watch and wait the whole time with yearly a MRI. No growth ( very lucky) I do not have to go back for 3 years now. YAy.  I have tinnitus, hearing loss and dizzy spells on occasion. I did go to vestibule therapy which helped a lot and got a hearing aid a few months ago. When I was first diagnosed I stressed out a lot about it but after about the 3rd MRI I mellowed and I do not worry about it too much anymore. The worst part for me is the single sided going deaf and not hearing like I used too and not knowing where sound comes from even with a hearing aide. I did get four different opinions from doctors and all of them said to just watch it because  if I had surgery I would most likely lose all of my hearing in that ear anyway so I am glad that I have waited and I am grateful for the hearing I have. I have had migraines for years, and in the summer I had this intense double vision for the first time for many hours. I happen to live by a hospital so I went to the ER, and they ordered me some tests and referred me to a neurosurgeon, who then sent me for an MRI. That came back as 9mm in the summer. Now I can tell I have some other little symptoms - my ear feels full, my left side of my face sometimes feels numb, and a bit of tinnitus. But I do not notice any hearing loss yet. Our waitlists for specialists right now are a bit long/backed up due to covid, so I am waiting to be seen and get a second MRI. I am curious whether it has grown and just am anxious to get to talk to an expert in this. \n\nI echo what someone else said - joining Acoustic Neuroma associations can be very useful and supportive. I am part of the ANA of Canada, but I did look at the USA website too. If there is one you can join, I encourage it. I could not believe how much info they have/speakers to listen to/forums, etc. I felt like there was a community. Those sound like scary symptoms alright and make mine seem like a walk in the park.  I hope you get your 2nd MRI and consultation soon. I guess it is a bad time to get such a thing with the hospitals being so focused on Covid. I will be glad to actually talk to the specialists soon and see what they make of it, just a bit scary when you know you are going to be meeting neurosurgeons... That is great that it is shown no further growth since discovery. It is mad that you would have symptoms with something so small, it seems to have little relation to tumor size what symptoms you get! Pesky little things... Yes. I believe it is the location. Mine is right next to my cochlea. Dear OP, sorry you had to join this very exclusive club. I am 32yr from California. Diagnosed in September 2020. The first two months since Dx were identical to what you are describing. Feeling depressed and uncertain. Felt upset that I had it, and others did not etc. I read up on tons of information online. I joined the Facebook groups which are very active but unlike Reddit, lots of older folks use it so their coping methods and beliefs are a little bit different than our generation. Many told me time will heal, and I knew it, but at the time, it was so hard for me to just turn on a switch just because someone told me it would be fine. So I will not attempt to say this is fine. It is ok to digest in your own way, but if my experience was any indication, you will start coping with it mentally, and start accepting it for what it is. I know you know, but this is benign. There are people with less fortunate medical issues and you just have to appreciate it for what it is. Just had my 3rd MRI with contrast for the first time and taking a look at the pictures, the radiologists cannot decide if mine grew or stable. Do not get discouraged, as either way, we will find a way out of this. And life is just beginning. It is actually taught me a great deal about what is important and I no longer feel any anxiety about anything once you get use to living with an AN. Hang in there. Feel free to ask me anything as well. I am also learning to live with it. Thanks so much for sharing your experience. It sounds like you have been having similar thoughts to me post diagnosis. One of the worst things had been the feeling of why me and not you when I look at other people, which is a terrible way to be thinking. As you say there are many with worse conditions and we have to deal with what we have been dealt anyway. I know what your mean about other anxieties fading away, so that is a good side to it..\n\nHope all goes well with you and your AN Did you get any more clarity on your MRI? Hope all is going well for you. I find I am getting better at dealing with it as time goes on but there is the odd day where I feel that I am back to square one. I got the results of my 6 month follow up MRI yesterday and am very relieved to say that my AN is stable with no growth. They are saying now that it is 6mm but were at pains to point out that they are not saying it has decreased in size, just that their measurement was slightly different to that of the original radiologist report. I have my next MRI scheduled for 1 years time. While I know that there is a long way to go with it yet and that it could have grown again on the next scan I do feel like a weight has been lifted at least temporarily. Thanks to everyone who took the time to comment on my post, it is so helpful to hear from people facing similar situations. That Is great congratulations. Happy for you. Hey can i ask did your symptoms before being diagnosed ever got better ? Thanks. Symptoms are much the same and am probably just stuck with them now. I was prescribed betahistine, otherwise known as Serc, which seems to help. So you are left with facial tingling and shifts in vision untill you chose a treatment then ? Did the doctor say anything if your symptoms would change ? To my mind watch and wait is a treatment option. I am in Ireland so it is a public health system and I am guided by what the experts say at the centre where they deal with all these in the country. They are not concerned by it as long as it is small and stable i.e not growing. I would rather not have any symptoms obviously but there is risks of making your situation worse with surgery or radiation so I am happy to keep an eye for now at least. Oh okay. Oh yeah I did..... I have a massive tumor, 4cm- most likely acoustic neuroma. Doctors say surgery is my only option. All hearing in left ear will be gone after surgery plus substantial risk of facial paralysis and balance problems. The last couple months I have delved into alternative treatments- I have found one that I think there is viable evidence for shrinking benign brain tumors. With the size that yours is, it might be something you would like to experiment with. I am in kind of a shitty situation because it is already so big. If you want more info, DM me. I am really sorry that you have had this news. Do you have a date for surgery? I cannot imagine what you are going through right now but you will get through it and come out the other side. All the best", "3mm x 3mm x 3mm Got diagnosed a few years ago on an unrelated MRI (had ear infection and lost hearing in left ear, right side has AN), just got the MRI done and it is slightly larger at 3mm. I have not gone further with a doctor yet so I do not yet know what the plan is; I am at the beginning of this journey as a 50 y.o. male. From what I have read and youtubed so far, it sounds like if it is growing and showing symptoms they usually recommend surgery. \n\nI guess I will see. Thank you for having me in the group! Yes, it sounds like it might be time to take action and better to do something now, rather than in 20 years when you are 70. Based on the size, doctors may recommend lesser invasive treatments, which is a good thing. Regardless, best wishes. (47 yo, 5.5cm trans lab patient, 14 mos post op) Does anyone have recommendations for doctors?  If you live or want to travel to the San Diego area, there is a team of doctors at UCSD medical that are like the top gun pilots of neurosurgery. Highly recommend. People travel from all over the U.S. to be seen by them. There is an entire neurosurgery focused department there complete with an ICU unit and post op care. Mine was (is) bigger than yours and I had three blasts of pinpoint radiation.  Seems to have done the trick without surgery (and total hearing loss on that side). Hey man\u2014sorry to hear of your diagnosis. If you check my post / comment history, you can see my full AN story, but basically, if you are showing symptoms, my bet is they try for surgery.  I was in a similar boat, about a year ago. Mine was a little bigger and I am a little younger, but they recommended the medial fossa approach\u2014this approach can preserve remaining hearing, but is limited to smaller tumors (less than 2 cm, IIRC).  They might also recommend gamma knife therapy.  Good places I know are Univ. of Michigan and Utah, in the US.  DM me if you would like to talk more.  I still potentially have a residual tumor that is about your size, and they do not know what we are going to do yet. Thanks so much! When it is safe to do so, we should have a big party somewhere. \n\nI feel like it stinks to have this, but so far I am thankful it is not something that will kill me. It could be worse, you know? So we figure it out and keep on going. P. S. It has grown from 2mm in 2016. You did not have hearing loss? What were the side effects? Nope - no additional hearing loss - just had it tested again last week.  No side effects at all - none."]
