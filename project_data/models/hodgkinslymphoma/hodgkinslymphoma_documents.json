["24 y M with stage 4 Hodgkin lymphoma Hello Reddit ! First time posting on here but have some questions regarding Hodgkin lymphoma. I was diagnosed with NSHL and I am currently on my second round of chemo. I currently have nausea and vomiting and have taken zofran which does not really help. I have also taken reglan which I prefer not to take due to side effects. Anyone have any insights with what help with nausea? Also anyone here in my same situation ? Anyone go into remission after finished with chemo ? Thanks in advanced ! Ask your doctor about Emend (Aprepitant). I hated taking Reglan as I also felt it did nothing for me and the side effects sucked. Emend taken on days 2/3 post chemo for me worked wonders. Very little nausea after taking it. Also my oncologist gave me Aloxi, an IV injection right before chemo that is essentially a 5 day version of Zofran. Good luck! I second Aloxi. I had that as part of my infusion and it helped a lot. I still had a bit of nausea but it was minimal. Also, I think drinking a lot of water helped my symptoms over all. I would drink about a gallon a day. \n\nI also had stage 4 NSHL and have been in remission nearly 4 years now. Feel free to message with any questions! Thank you for the insight. Will ask my oncologist about this medication hopefully it works !  Anybody have any insight on medical marijuana to help with nausea and vomiting ? I live in CA where it is legal. I would not smoke anything if you are on bleomycin. It would terrible for your lungs. I did not find edibles to be super helpful tbh. It really helps more to avoid the nausea altogether than it is to treat it after it happens. Hi OP! I am 29F stage 2 NSHL and have my finale and 12th treatment in 2 weeks. Just had my 11th this morning. I started with ABVD but after my 4th treatment I had a clean scan and was able to drop to AVD. I take Ondansetron and prochlorperazine for nausea the day of and after treatment and lorazepam the day before and morning of treatment to help with anticipatory nausea. I also take a very small amount of edibles after treatment to help me sleep it off. Hang in there and keep bringing all your side effects to your nurses and doctors so they can also try to help find a combination of nausea meds to help! MARIJUANA Id just suggest excercise as soon as you start feeling okay (2-3days) and some pomegranate juice. It was my elixir. Although I personally am not experiencing this myself, my fiance has been diagnosed with HL stage 1a. He is on his 5th round of chemo (half way there) and he takes edibles to help. I would not smoke anything if you are going the marijuana route, his doctor told him to absolutely not smoke as it is not good for your lungs right now while going through chemo. He has not had much nausea though.. good luck with everything! You are not alone, and you will get through this, remain positive :-) Also, drink lots of water and keep vitamins and high doses of vitamin c. Keep that immune system up &amp; running! &lt;3 I used medical marijuana dry herb vape for all of my infusions with abvd. Before and after lol. Had lung tests done before and after chemo and no changes. The medical marijuana helped tremendously with my appetite, nausea, and neuropathy. The people here saying it will damage your lungs cite no evidence and the risks are far overblown. If you are really concerned about protecting your lungs use edibles. I personally felt that they had more therapeutic potential but they also take longer to kick in. \n\nI have requested a research article about cannabis use and bleomycin toxicity. I will update when the researchers grant me free access. Yes!! I had awful nausea and my oncologist had prescribed the whole gamut of anti nausea meds, all with crappy side effects themselves. Eventually they gave me something called Dronabinol, which was literally just synthetic THC. At that point I was like... Why not real weed? \n\nMy dad got me a vaporizer for marijuana, and it was the best I would felt my whole treatment. I wish I would just had weed my entire chemo experience instead of messing around with cocktails of ativan, zofran, promethazine and more. I remember sitting up in my bed eating snacks watching tv just giggling and feeling better than I had in month. It is still kind of rough on the lungs though, so talk about it with your doctor! I am glad to hear your scan is clear and thank you for the info ! Best of luck \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb Thank you for the insight ! I will keep it in mind and has your partner not have a pet scan yet ? Hope all is well for him !", "I am in remission! Thanks to science,doctors and god I am in remission! Today I took my pet CT SCAN and I am cured of stage 2 Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and I hope I can come back here every year and tell you I am still in remission. This is not the end of my cancer journey I still have many tests left. And I could sadly face this cancer again. But I will stay in this sub reddit for anyone who has questions and needs help. I have been throw all your emotions and have had all your questions now it is my turn to answer them. My name is Fabio segovia I am 16 years old male and I am proud to say I am a cancer survivor! Congrats! Congrats \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa So happy for you! I too had the same cancer stage 2 when I was 16. 11 years cancer free \ud83d\udc95 Omg I am so happy to hear that! Gives me hope that I can leave this cancer behind and not have to worry it will return. I am happy to hear your good too! Hey what were your symptoms?", "Anyone hear of Hodgkin's being misdiagnosed? My husband (50) was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer with spread to the bones last year. Chemo did not work. Last week, he had a biopsy on a lymph node. Yesterday, they call him and tell him he may have been misdiagnosed?? They mentioned lymphoma.\n\nI was at work when he got this call and he was so floored he did not ask any questions. Now it is Friday and I have to wonder all weekend long what this means. Has anyone ever heard of this happening??\n\nFrom what I am reading, Hodgkin's sounds a lot better than lung cancer!! \u201eBetter\u201c sounds a bit weird, but in general you could say its less dificult to therapy\n\nMy doctor said its that kind of lymphoma you would choose out of all lymphomas Well, truly it does sound better. Lung cancer has a 6% survival rate. No cancer is \"good\" but there are some that are less deadly than others. Stage four lung cancer is basically a death sentence. I did not mean to sound insensitive. I have not heard of this happening personal but it is not outside of the realm if possibility. Ofcourse no cancer is good but if one had to have cancer then lymphoma is one that has many treatment options and good survival rates. There are 64 different kinds of lymphoma. Did they specify hodgkin's lymphoma?   \nCancers can get misdiagnosed all the time. Especially if his already had metastasized to other tissues.   \nStage IV indicates that it is extensive. .   \nHodgkins in general is more cureable than lots of other cancers, but keep in mind that it may not necessarily be curable for your husband at this point. It could be, but it could also not be, you know?  \nI do not want to be a downer, but I also just do not want your hopes to soar and then crash. No, they have not specified any kind of lymphoma. They are removing the lymph node June 3 so they can find out for sure. I am keeping my emotions in check. For now. I wish you guys the best. I appreciate that and I do so for you too. \ud83d\ude0a", "I got ya homie! ", "Boyfriend was diagnosed\u2026treatment starts tomorrow My (24f) boyfriend (26m) was diagnosed with mixed cellularity Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma in June. Lots of emotions, but we are both lucky to be surrounded by his family whom have all provided a wonderful support system. I could go on about how hard it is on him, on me, how i just want to be there for him but i am not here to tell my story or his, i guess. I think we just want to actually hear from someone who is going through/gone through what he is going through. \n\nHe had the port put in this week, and his treatment starts tomorrow. He had the PET scan last week, and we are due to get the stage results tomorrow. Although, from our understanding, it seems like it does not really matter what stage because the treatment sounds the same. I seem to remember reading here something like ABVD as the four iv\u2019s you can get during chemo? I know he is getting the fourth that starts with a B which he is explained to me to be more harsh than the others. He is receiving two rounds of this treatment (30 day rounds with a treatment on the 1st and 15th day). If he responds after that, they will take him off the B treatment. If he does not\u2026.then we will go from there. \n\nI am posting here just for some more personalized information that he or I have not read via google or heard from the doctor. I am following along other posts, but i guess posting our own makes it feel more personal. He is an over-thinker, and this entire process has led him down a great many Dr. Google rabbit holes, so I am just wondering what everyone is experience has been. How fast did your results come? His PET scan results have taken a week\u2026is this an experience anyone else has had? We do not know his stage yet. How quick did the nausea set in, how weak were you on your worst days, how /ok/ were you on your best days, what kind of support helped you the most, what pissed you off to no end? Whatever your experience, it is going to be nice to hear it from an actual human experiencing the same thing, not the doctor telling him what he \u201ccould\u201d expect or google telling him the million possibilities. \n\nLast, a very personal question. This last weekend, he informed me that his semen had a very red tinge to it for about a week (2 weeks total now.) Him being the Type A personality that he is, he is taken some photos. Sometimes it is a faint red, and you would not really think twice about it if it were not on a white surface. Other times it is something along the lines of \u201chuh\u2026.well that is got a  red color to it.\u201d He received antibiotics with his port surgery, and when he gathered a \u201csample\u201d for IVF freezing after that, there was no red. So\u2026I guess i am looking for a good sign in that. We are asking his doctor about it tomorrow before chemo, and figure if there is anything anywhere else it would show up on the PET scan anyways, but has anyone ever at all experienced this?? Hi,\n\nSorry that you and your boyfriend have to go through this.\n\nAs far as I remember it took a long time to get a PET-CT scan appointment but the results came rather quickly (a few days). \n\n\nI am doing ABVD (stage 2 cHL). I have done 2 rounds (4 injections) and I am waiting for my interim PET scan. For me the side effects start during the night that follows the injection and last around 3-4 days. They include nausea (I have not puked yet though), fatigue (I sleep around 12 hours a day), brain fog and an overall feeling of being poisoned. This last one is a bit hard to describe, but I just feel generally sick. So that is around 4 not so good days, and 10 OK days.\n\nTo be frank, the side effects are not as bad as I imagined. They are very predictable, so it is quite manageable. I mostly have to be careful with what food I eat (to keep my nausea under control) and rest a lot. Sparkling water helps a lot too.\nAfter these 3-4 days, I feel quite good. Of course I do not have a crazy amount of energy like I used to but I can do most things I want without being too compromised. With my wife we have a small baby (she was born on the day of my 3rd infusion...), and I do not feel the treatment is preventing me from doing anything with her (other than changing diapers when I am nauseous lol).\n\nI hope that helps. Good luck with the treatment!! Be careful with further rounds. The effects stack the longer you go through ABVD. The last two rounds were hell for me while the first ones were not that bad. \n\nGood luck and keep up the positive attitude! That is half the battle. This helps a lot. I am so sorry you are going through all of this. It is nice to hear that it could potentially be more predictable, we are both in law school and he wants to continue it in the fall. \nIf you do not mind me asking, what does your daily food intake usually look like? My boyfriend\u2019s been losing weight and eating has been a major struggle. I am worried about when the nausea sets in what he is going to want to eat. \nAlso, have you had any hair loss? Hi! I am(29f) stage 2 NSCHL and started treatment back in February. I am currently sitting at my 10th of 12 treatments. I started with ABVD but after 2 months I had a clear scan and they dropped the B. After removing that recovery has been easier and quicker. I expected the worse side effects but find most are manageable just need to sleep a few days away. I was very overwhelmed at first and spent my time googling everything there is to know about lymphoma. It was time consuming. But once I started it slowed down and I got into my routine. I still work but take 4-5 days off to recover. After those days I start to feel like myself again. I do not really have to rely on my husband much but may ask him to go to the store for me. I am very weak now. I have always been thin and not much of a muscle builder but I have noticed I have lost a lot of muscle mass. As for fatigue I do get tired quicker after a busy day out. They give corticosteroids along with ABVD and this has increased my appetite quite significantly. I was hungry to the point I did not know what to eat lol. I had also lost a bit of weight before treatment but gained some back. I am almost back to what I would consider my healthy weight now. I would not worry about that to be frank! \n\nOtherwise my food intake is anything I can stomach when I am nauseous (taste changes a bit after chemo so I usually eat things with little taste, like crackers and bread) and after that I eat pretty normal foods (what I would eat if I were not on chemo). Surprisingly, when nauseous, eating some food feels pretty good! I also try to eat food rich in fiber because I am quite constipated for a few days after chemo.\n\nI have not lost my hair yet. I was told it may fall quite rapidly so I cut it short when starting the treatment, but I am still waiting for it! This is not my main concern though. Indeed, I have heard the effects are cumulative so I am expecting it to become harder towards the end. It is like a marathon, the last mile is harder than the first one! He is ready to shave it off now, and I do not blame him at all. Thanks for sharing Thank you for sharing. Did you try any form of weight lifting during treatment? I have read light lifting helps in the treatment as well as recovery, which I have been trying to encourage him to do. I am expecting lots of sleeping, of course. Did you experience a compounding effect with the B like others above have mentioned? I do occasionally lift small weights but should do more of it. On my good days I make a big effort to walk a few miles. It always makes me feel sooo much better after. I am a nanny for 3 young kids so I am always moving which I think really helps. The first few rounds were fairly easy it was not until the 5th I started feeling extra shitty for 3-4 days. After they removed B I have noticed it been easier but yeah some treatments are harder than other because new side effects can pop up randomly. Since about the 7th treatment I am getting good at avoiding some This is super super helpful. Thank you. I hope it is going well for you and you get out of this hell sooner than later I know sorry will not do anything but I am so sorry this has happened to your boyfriend and that you are both going through this horrible time!\n\nI was 20 when I was diagnosed with cHL in early July 2020. I did two cycles of BEACOP-Dac and two cycles (4 infusions of all 4 drugs) of ABVD. Both were different even if some of the drugs were the same in the two regimes.\n\nI think I found it got progressively harder as symtoms started stacking up and my body got tireder and weaker. But that is to be expected, and the only benefit with doing multiple cycles is at least you then have experience of the drugs for the next cycle. I found the same symtpoms worsened at particular times during the cycle and that helped me be better prepared for it.\n\nFor example, making sure the right antisickness drugs are taken before I actually started being sick. Much easy to stop it before it happened, rather than take when you are already being sick as it does not work as fast. I was very nauseas as soon as I walked out of the chemo centre and my first chemo was the worst for sickness because the antisickness they gave me before my infusion was not enough. I needed a combo of two different ones in the end taken before I turned up to chemo to allow them time to get in to my system before the chemo drugs started going in. If this is an issue for your boyfriend, he can definitely ask the nurses or doctors about alternative antisickness medicines if the first ones tried do not work very well. (That is a tip in itself too, always say if there is an issue and there is usually something they can suggest to help with the side effect.)\n\nSpecial non alcohol mouthwashes for sore mouth was also something I needed to remember to stock up on for the inevitable issues. (Benzydamine mouthwash was my saviour at times when my mouth was so bad.) The worse happened a few days after for me or up to a week after an infusion. Ice cream, melon, yoghurt, frozen ice lollies and ice cubes were the best things for those days as well! And soft, more manageable food as it can become hard to chew and swallow when the inside of your mouth is so sore.\n\nI also had to learn when I definitely needed to stay in bed and when I would start to feel slightly better and be able to maybe do something during the day. The fatigue was always there for me, but some days were worse than others. Just take it a day at a time.\n\nThese are some of the symptoms I experienced but there were more which sometimes popped up and some worse than others. Hair loss, peripheral neuropathy, \"chemo brain\" and so on are some of the ones I did not mention above but really affected me.  If you have questions about more I can try and answer as best I can!\n\nMy best piece of advice is to make sure he knows it is okay to rest when he needs. It effects everyone differently and people do get different side effects but a general one is that is is very exhausting. You can feel okay one day and maybe able to do something, another day you might feel wiped out. It is important to \"listen to your body\" as they say.\n\nThe best support I received was not people trying to offer me loads of advice who did not know what it was really like, but more practical stuff. Like making me food when I could not stand, driving me to places just for a change of scenery, but also not just wrapping me in bubble wrap and treating me like I was about to break. Yes, I was so sick and yes, it was so hard, but sometimes you just want some normality. Normal conversation that is not about cancer because all you can usually think about is cancer most of the time, and it can be nice when someone just sits with you and does not talk about it. Other times it really helps to talk about it and get it out! Whatever feels best in the moment.\n\nFrom a medical stand point always, always stay alert of signs of infections and fevers. Chemo wipes out your immune system and you need to take extra caution to be careful about these things. They should hopefully go through all this with your boyfriend before treatment.\n\nLast thing before this becomes too long, it might seem impossible sometimes to get through. I definitely thought that several times but I did manage to get through it, even though it was so hard. Even when it feels too much, we often find we have strength in us to keep going that we did not know was in there!\n\nWishing you both all the best x You are truly a gem for taking the time to write this all out. He is a type-A person and he just feeds on information like this! \nHis first treatment was this last Friday. The only symptom he has experienced so far has been fatigue, which has been obviously manageable. He is expressed that the \u201ccompounding\u201d effect of the B is scary, because we do not know what to expect\u2026but we are taking it to be a good sign that this has been a good week for him. But not necessarily blindly \u201ckeeping our hopes up.\u201d \nAll of your advice is so helpful, and I have no doubt we will be referencing some of this throughout the process. Thank you. To him, the more information, the better. It is good to know that for all of these symptoms he could be experiencing, we are getting answers for all of them. I am glad he is not feeling too bad yet!\n\nI am sort of the same. I needed as much information beforehand to try and prepare myself for it all. Of course you cannot always know everything that might happen but if I can be prepared for several eventualities it makes me feel better.\n\nSomething I forgot to mention much of was hair loss but I found this really sad. This happened about four weeks after my first infusions. I had very long hair at the start so I originally cut it short to my shoulders to start with to try and get used to the fact it was going to be gone (plus all my long hair falling out would have been worse and very messy.) Then when it started falling out properly, it was really distressing and I wanted to be in control so I got it all chopped off. I do not know what he would think about that but it definitely helped cutting it first, because a lot of things are out of your control with cancer but you can control that. I felt better because I could control cutting my hair off before it all came out itself; it can feel like doing something powerful even if it is upsetting. We actually just talked yesterday about him cutting it short this weekend. He is always wanted a buzz so we are going to go short and feel out how it feels and go shorter when the time comes. Once he heard it could potentially grow back more thick, i think he had even less issues than he already had lol. Very thankful that this will not be a major point of stress as i feel it would be for a female, but I approach the topic with caution, since it is traumatic for anyone really. \nI cannot even imagine that feeling for you. I am so happy your health has prevailed. Hi! Wondering how your bf is doing now. I got diagnosed Friday and have started my googling. This thread has been very helpful. I have 3 young children (3,6,9) and a major concern for me is when I start treatment, I do not want them to see me a mess. So I am trying to prepare for what is to come. Hey there! So sorry you are going through this. I am sure it is been a lot of information at once, all of it confusing, and some of it very scary, at least that is how it was for us. I am happy to answer any questions you have, although we are still learning too. What everyone has said about predictability has been very true for us. We can predict when he is going to have a day where he sleeps the entire day and when he is going to have a day where he is fine and feeling more like himself. The day he gets his treatment they give him Benadryl, a very strong nausea med, and steroids. The Benadryl makes him sleepy, but the steroids are like adderall for him so he is pretty hyped up for the next 36 hours. After 36 hours, his symptoms start to set in and can last 4-5 days after the treatment day. After that, he starts to feel like himself again and things are mostly...normal. His most prominent side effect is fatigue. Some nausea after his third treatment (although he has been taking a nausea medication every 6 hours for 4 days after treatment to keep the nausea off rather than wait for it to come), a \"chemo flush\" that appears after treatment, and occasional constipation. But honestly, his overall quality of life has oddly improved. He has not even lost hair yet. He is eating again, he is gained a good amount of weight (like over 15 lbs), his color has returned, his neck lymph nodes are not visibly swollen, the doctor said his spleen seems it is no longer swollen just from feeling it, and he has a lot more energy on his good days. His white blood cell counts are low, so we have to be really careful about what we do and what he is being exposed to, but that has been our biggest burden. Do not get me wrong, this process as a whole has been fucking terrible. It is hard, and it is stressful, but to see these positive effects on his health has been so encouraging.\n\nI know for him he is just thankful to have those he loves close to him in this process. He is been scared to have us \"Deal\" with him as a burden, but of course, we all just want to be with him to support and help him. Your kids may in some way want the same, although their making that decision may be difficult. If you want to guard them against the dark sides of the treatment, I would say from what we have experienced so far that will be completely possible since it has been just so predictable. Have you discussed with your oncologist your treatment and pre-treatment medications? After starting treatment and doing more research, I wish we had been more direct about side effects to the overall body especially his heart health. Just something to think about. You are awesome for putting this together and I appreciate it so much. I am very very early on. Has the nodes taken out about 2.5 weeks ago and confirmed this past Friday night as HL. I have made the call to the oncologist but have not gotten an appt just yet. Waiting for a call back. I am just over anxious so I am reading up to prepare myself. It feels like that was so long ago for us, but it was only in June that we were at the same point. Just remember to be an advocate for yourself. My boyfriend has gone down many, many Dr. Google rabbit holes which I do not think has helped him too much, but he also knows a lot more because of it. Maybe the secret to that is taking what you find on the internet with a grain of salt", "I have recently noticed a pea sized lump behind my ear I am F16 should I be worried or is it probably nothing?  So many things it could be, most of them harmless. Get checked out ASAP just in case. Thanks for the reply I am sure it is nothing but I think i will book an appointment just too be sure Probably nothing but it would definitely not hurt to have it checked out. Good luck on everything Thanks If it stays longer than 2 weeks you should definetely get it checked out. I heard if it hurts that is good cause its not malignant. Dangerous tumours usually do not hurt It doesnt hurt at all it is just like a hard lump Does not matter if you feel symptoms or not. It is most likely nothing but please get checked!", "Covid vaccine failure? Anyone get the vaccine and then an antibody test? Was the immune response good? I have been reading that many blood cancer patients do not get full protection. Yes, I did. Leukemia lymphoma society emailed me the other day saying they found the same during their testing and they are not sure yet. Next round should analyze it more. Apparently the same is happening for transplant patients as well. I did! Currently getting maintenance brentuximab, had an autologous stem cell transplant in Sept 2020. I had a good antibody response to the vaccine, as far as I can tell- they do not have a specific number you need to show yet (more research needed), but my number was over 600, my MIL got the test as well (she is a healthy 62 y/o) and had ~150. Based on those numbers I am assuming that means I had an adequate response! Great news, thanks for sharing with me. Wishing you the best. Omg thank you so much. \n\nI am a little closer, ASCT in Mar \u201821 but already on maintenance brintux. We decided I should get the vaccine because numbers in my area are not going down, my husband has to go back to work in a school soon, and my immunoglobulin numbers were normal. Just got my second dose and hoping and praying I have a good response. I have already had one strong allergic reaction to the brintux post SCT so hoping that means my immunesystem is back up and running. Are you in the US? If so, look into the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society- they are doing a study so I got free antibody testing! Yep! I am getting treatment at Huntsman and found out about their study after I got my first dose. Next appointment with my doc (this week) I am going to insist my medical info is sent to them.", "Ultrasound &amp; Biopsy Hey everyone I am just wondering if anyone can tell me the symptoms they had before they got diagnosed. I am due to have my ultrasound and biopsy on Wednesday and let us just say I am shitting myself! \n\nI have a large swollen lymph node on the right side of my neck it is firm and hard and does not move. I first noticed it back in August but it would have been there longer. \n\nI also have extremely itchy/burning hands at times they get so sore and red it feels like hives inside the skin and I sometimes get this rash on other parts of my body it comes and goes. \n\nI have an extremely itchy dry scalp any shampoo/cream that has been prescribed to me does not work at all it is got so bad it is all over and I itch it constantly. \n\nI also have sharp shooting pains across my chest at times and my throat always feel blocked and I have hoarseness when I speak I also find it hard to breathe.\n\nI am just wondering if anyone else has any of the following symptoms hope you can help \ud83e\udd70 I had extremely bad night sweats. I could not make it a night without being drenched. For Hodgkin Lymphoma, that is a huge sign I guess. Also, I was SO tired. Itchy legs (extremely) mostly at night before bed. I had a large lump right above my clavicle that felt soft and did not hurt. I had a tumor next to my esophagus so I constantly would take in a deep breath. Also my chest felt like something was growing in it because of another tumor. Good luck! Just be prepared, an ultrasound does not tell you much, biopsy you will have to wait for the official results from the lab. Thanks for your reply :) I sometimes have night sweats  however it is not every night and it sometimes is only my feet and hands that sweat not my torso or that I would not say for me that it is extreme for me. I am also extremely tired I could have 12 hour sleep and still feel sleepy. My breathing is pretty awful at the moment when I take a deep breathe my chest feels tight and my breathing sounds heavy I will hopefully have some answers soon my scan is in 6 hrs :) That is how I was and after one chemo, I had MAJOR relief. It was actually a relief in itself when I got diagnosed. Then when I was breathing better, it was great. The chemo made me feel so much better, as weird as it sounds. Yes you get a little sick feeling (great anti nausea meds nowadays) and so tired but the sense of relief I had from not sweating, taking a nice deep breath and not sleeping 1000 hours and feeling refreshed. Because of all those negative symptoms, I feel like chemo went pretty well for me. It was not easy every day but I smiled through most of it, worked from home the whole time, (took one day off from being too sick) and there is a new \u201cnorm\u201d to your body. I just realized I was in more pain and uncomfortable without chemo prior than with. I always say \u201cwow I was really sick and my chest hurt.\u201d Good luck and if you need anything or support, I am here for you!! Just diagnosed in the past week. My symptoms were awful night sweats, exhaustion, lump in my armpit, lose of appetite and weight, itchy scalp, pain in armpit lymph nodes occasionally and after alcohol, tight chest and I could feel a spot when I swallowed. Turns out I had a ton inflamed in my chest and a clump sitting on my esophagus cause my swallowing issues. I start chemo in the next week. Good luck! I finished treatment 6 years ago for stage 2 HL. I had similar symptoms as you except my forearms were itchy and burning and I also developed eczema on my face.  I was exhausted.  All the time. I could sleep 24/7. When I was awake I could barely keep my eyes open. I did not have night sweats or Shooting pains. Symptoms are different for everyone though.  Listen to your doctor.

Have a good night", "Prateek (Hodgkin-lymphoma): \u201cThe battle is very personal\u201d Since I was a schoolboy, I was a rather average guy who had \u201cdecent \u201d interests such as playing cricket, exploring the world around me, and dreaming of future excellence. Spending my childhood days in Bangalore, I followed a conventional educational process where I first entered engineering and later moved to MBA. Presently, I work in a leading multinational firm in Mumbai. Returning to work after 6 months was both refreshing and exciting. Though I have gone back to my old ways of cribbing over deadlines, disagreeing with my boss, and sometimes (not consciously) pondering over colleague\u2019s appraisals, I am thankful for surviving cancer and seeing each dawn.\n\nI was diagnosed with Hodgkin Lymphoma. According to textbook definitions, stage 4 cancer refers to the last stage of cancer where the infected cells spread to other parts of the body. The doctors said I was at stage 4, but the carcinogenic cell activity in the spreaded areas was very little. My core treatment to fight the disease revolved around chemotherapy. My body needed 6 cycles that were spread over 12 sittings. Undoubtedly, mental and physical stress weighed me down, but I stopped putting my mind after a while.\u00a0For someone who has been working each day, for the past ten years of his life, suddenly staying back home can be quite challenging. It is a wholly changed dynamic if you are sitting idle. But being an optimistic person myself and support from my company helped me cope with my anxiety. I got a monitor and synced it with my working system. This allowed me to work from home and do at least 60% justice to my role. Though I moved to basic tasks, I still got to check mails, do conference calls, and handle information. My job instilled a renewed sense of importance in me and gave a boost to my confidence. Though I thank God for belonging to an upper-middle-class family, I shudder to think about the plight of the common man who lacks basic education, financial resources, and knowledge of crisis management. My parents, sister, and limited friends were my support system. Though I did not have any role model, I read a little on Yuvraj Singh, owing to my cricket love. Cancer temporarily made me stress less about petty issues like minor business losses and job competition. Now, these are slowly coming back to me. But I had already warned you right at the starting that I am just another average boy. I had an 80% chance of survival and clung to that hope until I won. (", "LULba ", "Has anyone developed an enlarged liver after ABVD? \nI was diagnosed with stage 4 Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma May of 2018. I did 6 months of ABVD. I had a PET scan last week and went to the oncologist the other day to get the results. She told me I was in complete remission but she did not have the addendum to the report. I received a call from her this afternoon regarding the results from the PET scan and again I was told I am 100% in remission but it now showed I have an enlarged liver. That I would need to get an MRI of my liver and see her ASAP. Has this happened to anyone else or has anyone gone through something similar?  Do you have pr-AVBD scans?  They thought my thyroid was enlarged post-chemo, turns out is was always just a little bigger than normal.  Congrats on remission!", "Not cool things people say to lymphoma patients What are some of the shitty or annoying things you want to vent that people have said to you about your cancer? One of my least favorites is \"Yeah but the stats for your cancer are so good. It is not like you have a real cancer\" That was my sister and literally everyone else lol. I actually was stage 3b and i caught it because i was having heart attack symptoms from 20 tumors pressing on my heart, lungs, mamaries, and my liver. Let out any stuff youre tired of hearing about your cancer. ugh I get that all the time. \u201cOh you got the good cancer.\u201d the GOOD cancer?!?!?! Wow I did not know there was a good cancer. It minimizes your experience so much I hate that Do not watch the hodgkins episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm then.\n\nI got to admit I made the joke myself a lot after being diagnosed in 2b. My issue was people being overly grave and apologetic. The obvious shows of pity were taxing.l amd awkward. Even worse was my father losing his shit in public over pharmacy waits and charges. Yeah I was pregnant when I was diagnosed. My doctors had me call the American Cancer Society about assistance because I was driving 2 &amp; 1/2 hrs one way for my chemo treatments. They told me that Hodgkin\u2019s was not bad enough for them to help out with. They really should realize that not every Hodgkin\u2019s diagnosis is going to result in the best case scenario; By the time i was done I had to have a bone marrow transplant. I wound up feeling embarrassed that I had even contacted them.  No one should be made to feel that way. They did mail\nme a wig  that I received 6 months after I was done with ABVD. If that had actually put me in remission I would have regrown my hair by the time I got it lol! oh my gosh that is horrible. i am so sorry! and yeah that seems to be the big thing everywhere i call. they do not think hodgkins impacts people's lives enough. Like yes we are grateful we survived but how are you supposed to get back on your feet after when drowning in debt from treatment?\na lot of patients have nowhere to live, no job, and no help after. YES! oh my gosh literally everyone says that and then you have this internalized shame for feeling as angry or sad as you do during an infusion because it is like you are being ungrateful or something. Like chemo saves many but it is SO TOXIC to your system. there is so much damage. and hodgkins chemo is pretty intense each dosage because of how fast acting our cancer is. I had maybe a month left if i got really lucky and my death wouldve been HORRIBLE. hodgkins is a terrible way to die unless you have like the magical version that barely impacts your organs. like it is cancer. And it kills faster than most cancers. and it goes so easily undiagnosed that some people just die before finding out what it is. IT ABSOLUTELY SUCKS and you have every right to be as upset about it as you want and to pour out your emotions. I will say keeping positive things and people around you can be healing, but you should never feel shame over being angry or sad about your cancer. this is really true! my mom was the same way and i had to get her to stop making nurses cry. but like people you do not even know start sayingthey love you and crying all over you and it is weird and not helpful but people just do not know how to process cancer unless they or their immediate family member had it. I know that I could have had it a lot worse and I am super grateful that my daughter is perfect. I am so thankful that it was Hodgkin\u2019s and not another cancer that would have impacted my pregnancy. I am thankful that that was all I had to complain about:)  My Dad always told us \u201cI felt sorry for myself because I did not have any shoes and then I met a man with no feet\u201d. That is something I like to keep in mind. Everyone should get to\ndo some complaining though :) \"Yea but u are young and survived it so its not a problem to go on, I mean u did not have BREAST CANCER OR SOMETHING\" Oh my gosh I hate that one!! We dont know if cancer will come back and our brain chemistry is totally changed from chemo and chemo was still a massive trauma. Just go to a \"cancer rehab\" after chemo while being in ur 20s, u will meet alot of 40, 50 year old (mostly) women that try to convince u they went through a much worser treatment while at the same time have no fucking clue about Hodgkin treatments like BEACOPP. No cancer is a walk in the park, but it is literally bullshit to compare a breast cancer radiotherapy or something with an almost terminal stage cancer treatment, while some of those \"oh i suffered so much\" patients still being in work because they were so \"bored at home\" and still claim they went through hell just because they were older.\nHell is when u can only crawl on the floor once u actually made it out of bed and collapsing all the time and doctors say ur leukocytes are like below 200 and u have to get hospitalized asap, spending 2 weeks in isolation room, or getting blood transfusions because of anemia on the edge of choking by getting no air to breathe anymore. \nAlso met a lot of people that just think u had some sort of worser flu just because u're young. I am sick of these opinions. The only time I left isolation was to get treatment and see my oncologist. My levels were always dangerously low. They let me out of isolation one time for Christmas and i ended up in the hospital for a week and they didnt think i was going to survive. I was covered in 20 tumors and I had to crawl to get anywhere. I do not know how people work during chemo. I had maybe 2 days a cycle I could stand up without vomiting. Mostly i crawled, someone else had to dress me, i was completely limp and unresponsive most days. Just because it is the \"curable cancer\" does not make it the easier one. That sounds nothing but horrible...! Yea, that is why I say those people with (mostly) breast cancer obviously are so bored and alright with their condition that their idea is to start working again during chemo. I do not judge if there are patients that find some sort of distraction or normality if they do so and works helps them to cope and all, and they feel well enough - there might be treatments that are mild, and they can still do what they want - good for them! But every single therapy is totally different and should not be generalized by clich\u00e9s like \"oh u're so young!\" \"Oh u do not look that cancer-stricken actually!\", \" oh u're not skinny and totally wasted to the bone\". (Often they picture a morbidly skinny cancer patient or actually even expect that) It just has to be understanded that there are types of cancer where u literally are glad if u were able to walk by urself for a while and survive the day, just like u, for example, did. I just hate how especially Hodkins gets so underestimated by society in terms of seriousness and danger during the whole process of diagnosis, treatment and afterwards, just because most Hodgkin's patients are usually rather young and \"might be fine\" therefor to hop out of the bed or seat where u got chemo in and yell \"here we go again, I am back!!! when is my next shift\" or something. \nI also pity that.... I even think its MUCH harder for younger people with cancer to actually crawl out of this situation if u were lucky enough to survive it. I do not say its easier for older people or anything, no cancer is fun... but just picture an 70 yr old recovering from a life threatening disease, he might feel some sort of a \"second chance\" or \"mercy\" coming over him for the relatively short rest of life. He might even feel a new will to live life to the fullest if he probably was grieving about age before. Its a total different view from his position in life, compared to a 20 yr old that wants to have family some day or soon, and basically just started life as an adult, with all these topics, family, career, just before getting run over by the cancer truck. And has to live with side effects on longterm an enormous amount of time longer, than an aged person. That is what I think is underestimated in the general view on cancer and how people perceive the outcome of the survivors, eventhough being thankful for surviving it, it should be more differentiated and not be taken too lightly just because it might seem as a \"treatable and \" lucky\" cancer. PS: I even experienced being bullied by those patients that actually still worked during chemo, they felt superior to me like \"I went through cancer and still did my job, clap hands at me!\" And used this as some tool to proof how strong they were and much willpower they had. Like, i had not it, or something. Oh gosh! Just thinking back to this gets me into rage mode immediately. Literal quote from a 40 yr old breast cancer patient i have met on rehab: \"oh this breast cancer traumatized me so much! Nobody can imagine what it is like... I mean, u are super young, u could not understand, ur body is so strong and resistant to anything, ur chemo could not make that much damage! And during treatment I then was SOOO bored, I did not know what to do all day anymore, my doctors did not allow me to work, can u believe that???? I begged him I want to get back but he did not let me during chemo. And then he even sent me here on this rehab!! I mean what should I do here?? Its so useless, I want to work!! Ohh.. U do not work right now? Are not u bored?\"", "Is it possible to have Hodgkin Lymphoma without a lump? Hi all,\n\nIt started off two years ago with pain in my nodes, then I found one lump a few months ago, and now I have 3 all on my neck. They seem to be lessening in size but I have other symptoms such as itchy skin and constant nausea. Do you think it is worth getting checked out even though they are not as big? They have gone from around 2 cm deep (if I had to measure) to 0.5cm. Yes it is possible. Not all swollen lymph nodes will be palpable. Tumors can grow in your chest. I definitely would get checked out. It is not worth waiting in my opinion. If it is lymphoma, the less treatment you would need the earlier caught. Some lymph nodes you cannot feel. I had large lymph nodes in my chest. Good luck! Thank you. Good luck to you! I hope you get better quickly. Thanks! I am actually five years post treatment. :) I was stage 2B. Yes it is possible had it growing in my chest the second time I was diagnosed. Hope for the best. Will be five years in remission in September", "Looking for some information on what to expect and what I can do to help My boyfriend of 6 years was just recently diagnosed with Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma ... we are waiting to meet the oncologist and set up pet scans and have other testing done to find out what stage it is ... they already told him that he would most likely need chemo and possibly radiation but as of right now all we have is the diagnosis. Wondering if anyone that has went through can give me some insight for what he is in for and what to expect and also what I can do to support him through all this ... background story below ... \n\n\nBackground ... about a year ago my boyfriend noticed a swollen lymph node in his neck being cold season were we live did not think much of it, until he noticed it did not go away with in a few weeks which is when he brought it to my attention... and me being the worry wart that I am i googled it (which I know is the worst ) so I begged him to go to the doctors just to get it checked ... his doctor refers him to a ENT who decided to do a needle biopsy (which unfortunately I was unable to attend due to work) and him being the kind of guy that just goes with the flow and does not ask many questions .. apparently they found some in his shoulder, down by his lungs and one on the back of his neck with a sonogram ... nothing was said they did the biopsy on the largest one in his shoulder and the one in his neck ... 2 weeks pass and we go on Valentine\u2019s Day of all days, and meet with the doctor she tells us that it is NOT CANCER and not to worry about it unless they continue to grow ... her exact words were could be multiple things but nothing to worry about if they are still large or continue to grow in a year we will take them out if they bother you if they do not then they can stay so we set up a follow up appointment for almost a year later  later ....\n\nFast forward to 10 months later and he has a check up with the ENT ... he goes  (again I did not attend bc at this point I am not even worried ) and the doctor tells him well I am really concerned that they have continued to grow and the one is rather large ... she tells him I am going to refer you to a lymph node specialist bc I am not confident in the results we got !! What? You just told us that we had nothing to worry about months ago! So we meet with this Specialist now I am attending the appointments and this doctor tells us that there is definitely something wrong and that they should have been removed back in February to get actual results of what it is ! So we schedule the surgery and they take out the one on his shoulder to test it ... they cannot take out the one in his neck bc it is grown so much that it is wrapped itself around major nerves and there is a very good chance he will loose completely control over his bottom jaw ... so they test it and we went last Monday to meet for the results and he has been diagnosed with Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma, we have to wait another 2 weeks to meet with the oncologist and set up treatment plans etc ... Make sure he gets a port if he is allowed to, it saves his veins! \nIf he wants to eat something then let him eat it, trust me. Even if it is his favorite food. He might hate it once he is done with treatment but it will save him. \nI was on abvd so I cant stand artificially red colored things anymore, he might also grow to hate the color so make sure you dont get anything he would eat during treatment to remind him of it. \nMake sure he is always taking his nausea meds. Sadly to my knowledge there isnt any treatment for anticipatory nausea which will build up the longer he is in treatment. \nI asked my doctor for ativan which helped some.\nIf he is in pain you need to tell his doctor so they can treat it.\nBuy those bottled chocolate nutritional shakes, they are good for when he doesnt want to eat. \nHe might have problems with constipation at first, eventually he will get the hang of the meds and it will even out.\n\nIf you have any questions about anything then I am here to help :) I went through this last year for 6 months.  Thank you so much!! I will keep all this in mind ! It is so new to me and him, it honestly has not even sunk in ... I hope all is going well with him now! I just finished going through ABVD for hodgkins in January and had my boyfriend of 7 years supporting me the whole time. There are a ton of resources online/his oncologist to answer medical questions, but sometimes knowing how to be there for that person can be hard. As a significant other, your feelings of anger or fear are totally legitimate. It is important to talk about them, but also make sure you have a good friend or another support person in your life to lean on when your boyfriend is dealing with his own emotional difficulties through the process. Taking care of you means you can better take care of him. ", "Relapsed Hodgkins Hello\nI have just found this page and I am relieved!\n\nI have diagnosed with stage 4B Relapsed Hodgkins.

I went to the doctor last year for them and he said I probably had an infection like mono. But the thing is they still are swollen and I am really worried about it. I am only 19 and am really scared that I will have to go through chemo and radiation. I am just not sure what else could be causing the swelling since I feel fine. When I got my blood work done 6 months ago everything came back completely fine. Any advice? My advice, do not stress too much. One of the beauties of HL is that it is one of the most researched cancers out there. There are very well known treatments out there that are effective, which is my second reason not to stress. Hodgkins Lymphoma has a very high survival rate! That being said, if you are concerned get a second (or even third) opinion. It is cancer and it is your life, after all. Do not let it go unchecked. Thank you for the advice, it is much appreciated. It helps knowing that it is not a very lethal or aggressive cancer. I will definitely bring it up to my GP next time I see them. I would push back. If they have been there for more than two-four weeks, and more than one, it is worth putting up a stink for. \n\nI had the same thing. My GP thought it was my mono flaring back up. My counts were normal. I had them in my neck so I went to an ENT and they got me diagnosed. I am going to go and honestly just say to screen me for HL so I could have peace of mind. I am not going to let them persuade me into thinking it is something else when there really is not a solid reason for my lympnodes to be swollen for this long. I just want to know so I can get treated ASAP if I do get a diagnosis bc these types of things cannot wait! It really could be anything, HL, non-Hodgkins, Sarcoidosis, etc. but if they have been there for a long time it is not normal.

My partner (26F) completed 6 months of chemo for stage 4 b Hodgkin lymphoma in November. Her first PET scan was 3 months in and showed no signs of cancer, a complete response! Since then she had one scan this month and everything is still clear. The doctor has decided to only check her blood tests every 3 months, and I wanted to ask here if anyone else went this route.  I was under the impression that routine scans are the norm, should insist to keep getting scans? Should we be more vigilant? My last scan was 3 years ago. The research shows that frequent scans do not prevent relapse and usually the relapse is caught by the patient anyway.  Most people who relapse in the surveillance find it themselves.  The radioactive dye that is injected for scans does a lot of nasty stuff so the less the better.

Hi all,\n\nMy 16 y/o son was dx'd with Hodgkin Lymphoma (NSCHL, 2B with bulk) last week and next week starts chemo on 4 week cycles for 6 months and then 1 month of radiation.\n\nHe is also an elite athlete, a hockey player and played at the highest level for his age in Ontario last season.\n\nWhat advice might you give me to keep him as healthy as possible (physically and mentally) as he goes through this? We are willing to spare no expense. I would love to hear your wish lists. :)\n\nMany thanks in advance. I (29F) also have NSCHL stage 2B. I do chemo every 2 weeks. Started with ABVD for the first 4 treatments and then switched to AVD for my last 8 after I had a clear scan. I have 2 more chemo treatments left. Biggest advice for him is to listen to his body. I have about 4 days I spend in bed asleep or on the couch because of nausea or feeling just overall icky. After that I start to feel like myself. Before chemo I worked out and did yoga but as I get closer to the end of my treatment I find that I have lost a lot of muscle and fat which is okay. I do not like being this weak but I know I can rebuild after this. I just had a wedding I went to this past weekend and the very next day I spent almost the entire day on bed because it really wore me out from being out all day and night and dancing. Chemo hits everyone differently and each round can be different. I started off feeling mostly okay and then getting hit hard in the middle. As I near the end it is getting easier but still need days to recover. I second this comment. Finished 4 cycles of abvd 5  months ago. In the beginning I felt poorly for about a week then felt very energetic. But after the second cycle (two infusions per cycle, each infusion spaced two weeks apart) I really began to feel terrible all of the time. \n\nI found that i really had to ration my energy and I still do honestly. If I exerted myself (did normal things for a 20 year old) I paid for it the afterwards. 20M I had stage 2b nschl this the fall of 2020. Took a year off of college to focus on my healing. \n\nList of advice:\n\nAdvocate for yourself ( or son) that you get the best care possible. If possible see if you can get a second opinion. \n\nTake senna or another stool softener or laxative for constipation. \n\nMagic mouthwash for mouth sores \n\nAtivan or cannabis for nausea and appetite. I would have become a skeleton had I not had my munchies. \n\nget comfortable clothing to wear\n\nHave your son trust to his body to know when to rest\n\nSee a therapist or psychiatrist regularly during treatment. I saw my one nearly every week and it helped a lot. Going through cancer treatment as a young person is not easy and it is important to have a non family member third party to talk to. \n\nA heat pack can help his veins not burn as much when he receives chemo. Also I would try to go without a port or picc. I received all of my infusions through an iv each time instead. Totally worth not having something in ur body that can have its own issues( clots, infection). \n\nBland food that does not have too strong of a smell. Eating room temperature food may help. Liquids went down better than real food. \n\nStay away from any acidic food. Or smelly things of any sort. Perfume, candles etc. I would routinely blow candles out that my family would light, around the house just cuz of how nauseous they made me. \n\nGive him space when he needs it. I would not always mind if people saw me vomit but sometimes when ur three pukes in row deep u want to be left alone. \n\n\nI wish that I requested the drug Dexrazoxane( be taken before my chemo. It can prevent heart damage from chemo. I learned that it was an option for me after my heart was already damaged. My ejection fraction went from 63% to 46%. A significant albeit not disastrous drop. Now I am on heart meds for life. \n\nThis mainly taught me that there are many more side effects of chemotherapy and not just hair loss, nausea, and fatigue. I was prepared and more than willing to face these side effects because I just accepted that I will be feeling very poorly for a few months and then it is all over. \n\nFirstly, the constipation and diarrhea I experienced was debilitating for 5-7 days, at times, very painful. The nerve pain and weakness was also more bothersome than I would have thought. Also, now that I am done with treatment my hands and feet are almost always very cold. The most troubling side effect for me has been the resulting heart damage that my ABVD Treatment caused. Due to the heart issues I continue to feel very fatigued. It also does not help that my appetite has improved only slightly since my treatment. I routinely eat only one meal a day and my cup of coffee. I can go on about all of the issues I have now but I do not have cancer \ud83d\udcaa\n\n\nFeel free to dm OP I want to echo how important bowl management is when getting chemo. Seneca and Miralax everyday while on chemo. Otherwise you will suffer constipation and possibly even hemroids (like I did). \n\nAlso I had a major depression episode during treatment. Please talk about mental health either with your oncologists or with a therapist. \n\nHad I started Seneca and an anti depressant right away I am confident my treatment would have been far more manageable and less traumatic on me and my family. This^ \nI wish that I was given more guidance about how chemo may impact bowels . I got the hang of managing my gut after the 6th infusion. But constipation can be extremely debilitating, not to mention it is painful af I guess there is no point in being PC in here. \n\nMy first round I immediately got constipated and did not realize it till conversations with a pharmacist of all people. Started the Seneca and Miralax ASAP. Did not work. Took a suppository (BIG NO NO) that did not work. Took a boat load of Milk of Magnesia and that cleared out my gut in .02 seconds. All of that resulted in me getting a small fever which is a huge problem on chemo. So I spent thanksgiving week in the hospital and then the rest of chemo nursing horrible hemorrhoids  making my life utterly miserable. Cue depression kicking in after not going back to work after the hospital and you get the recipe for 4 months of me sitting on a couch too depressed to do anything before I started meds. \n\nI know this is a lot and pretty graphic but it cannot be overstated how you respond to your body makes a big difference and can make the difference between managing chemo fine and being a shut in inside the home. Assuming he is treated by a pediatric oncologist it might be worthwhile to consult an adult lymphoma specialist. 16 year old is on the cusp between pediatrics and adult treatment.\n\nTwo points to consider:\n\nABVD/AVD x6 is a standard of care for adults as well, but radiation may not be necessary in the likely case he attains a complete response at the end of therapy\n\nIf shortening treatment is of value for his athletic career, there is a possibility to treat with escBEACOPP per the HL18 protocol, which in 80% of cases will be limited to 4 chemotherapy infusions once every 3 weeks. Meaning he will be done with treatment in 2.5 months. This regimen is associated with exceptionally good outcomes (92% long term remission rate \\~= cure rate) but may be more difficult while on treatment.

We are in Canada so things might be a bit different up here, but I will definitely ask some folks what their thoughts are. Biologically, I am sure he is closer to an adult than an adolescent for sure. He is a very \"mature\" 16 year old, at least physically (LOL).\n\nAppreciate the info! This info is HUGELY valuable. Thank you so much. I will put many of these points on our list of questions for the drs tomorrow.\n\n&lt;3 Thank you for the insight. Looking back I wish that I did some things differently. But I give myself some slack because going through chemo as a young adult can be very stressful and making the best decisions (in terms of care) can be difficult given the circumstances. I am making an assumption that his fever is due to the B symptoms associated with his lymphoma. \n\nHopefully, with treatment he can become like his oldest again. It may be worth asking his doc if there is a way of doing treatment without radiation, as it can have harmful side effects that can come on much later in life, especially when considering his young age. However, due to the bulky disease it may be something that is required. Something to consider if he has not started treatment yet is a sperm bank. My boyfriend got diagnosed early June (stage 3 mixed cell. HL) and they immediately set him up with a sperm bank \u201cjust incase.\u201d\nMy boyfriend also lost a TON of weight before treatment, with extreme fatigue. Now that he is started treatment, he is been eating more which I think is thanks to a steroid in his pre-treatment meds. But the fatigue has really just increased. I have been encouraging some mid-day walks but also know full well I cannot push him, and he has to listen to his body first. \nHappy to help with any questions, this has been a scary process but we have found with more information, we find at least some form of comfort. First of all, I know sorry will not do anything but so sorry about what has happened to your son!\n\nIt sounds like he is obviously quite fit already as he is an athlete which I think will help. It will be difficult to retain the kind of energy for sport though through treatment but everyone is different. I think my best advice is taking every day one at a time. Sometimes you can feel so awful, you do not want to do anything. Sometimes you will feel a little better and able to do something. Often during a cycle you will notice how fatigue gets worse and better at different points, so it is important to \"listen to you body\" and rest when you need to.\n\nBest advice is making sure eating enough to help with energy and if he feels able to maybe go out and do some exercise, even if that is just a short walk a day. It can unfortunately cause muscle wastage, worsened if no exercise during treatment (which is okay if just do not feel like it) but after treatment it can take some time to get that muscle back, but not unachievable. I do not know if it might be a good idea to consider hiring afterwards some kind of person to help gain some strength back if he is feeling like he is not as able to do sports as he was before.\n\nI would also recommend with the mental health side effects if you are able to get a counsellor for him or a therapist. The mental impact can sometimes be really difficult to talk with your own family about so sometimes another person can just help to get the feelings out and find ways to deal with what has happened. I found this especially helpful after treatment as I would bottled everything up and realised how not okay mentally I was by the end.\n\nSorry this message is getting kind of long now but I just wanted to try and give some advice. Not that I am a doctor or anything, but I was 20 when I was first diagnosed and still felt very young (on the cusp of being treated as a paediatric patient and an adult) and I think children and young adults can sometimes find different things harder during the process.\n\nWishing you and your family all the best When I was 26 I had 8 months of ABVD and 2 weeks of radiation. Had stage 3B Nodular sclerosis, with very large tumor in my chest. Ironically I was an athlete and had good cardiovascular conditioning so was never short of breath\u2026.horrible itching was my only symptom. I am remission for 20 years and had 2 beautiful healthy children 10-12 years ago. \n\nMy tips:\n1. Get anti-naseau medication and ginger tea\n2. Have them give some IV fluid before or after the chemo treatment to keep hydration up\n3. My oncologist pushed the ABVD even when my white blood cells were \u201ctoo low\u201d he was really aggressive with it and I think that saved me. So really question them if they ever want to delay a chemo treatment. Yes you are more susceptible to infections if your WBC get too low with the chemo\u2026..but if you are young and just stay home that is a risk it might be worth taking to keep with the chemo.\n4. He can totally bounce back into shape after treatments, he should do whatever he feels like now even if that means sitting around a lot. \n\nBest of luck to you\u2764\ufe0f", "Oncologist said proton therapy is not better than traditional radiation -is this true? So I live in Canada and my doctor said he does refer people to the USA for proton therapy, but he said that it would not be beneficial in my case because the dose of radiation that will hit my heart is 9GY which is within the limit. \n\nHe also said that a lot of the push for proton radiation in the USA is a marketing tactic and that it really is not much more beneficial for people with lymphoma. \n\nIs this true? When I was active disease I did not receive radiation due to the increased risk it would put me at for breast and lung cancer since all my masses were in my chest and neck. Had proton been more widely available at the time I probably would have had it. \nWhat stage are you? I was 2B and they felt radiation was not worth the risk. Also- head over to the lymphoma sub and post this.  Def more foot traffic over there I was a patient at Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (after my home oncologist referred me there and had to travel). My lymphoma was very stubborn and ended up having a stem cell transplant. Then a scan showed after that I needed radiation. \nI spoke with a radiation oncologist in Seattle who does that therapy (if I remember correctly) and he said that the dose of radiation I would need would not require proton therapy. Also, it is WAY more expensive for the patient. So with all things considered (cost, pros/cons, risks, probable outcomes) he recommended regular radiation treatment vs proton. \nNote: I was stage 2AE with tumors going through my lungs, close to my heart, and wrapping around my wind pipe. Radiation was very much localized in my chest. But Radiation was a lot easier to handle than chemo! At least for me. I was 2B Unfavorable and underwent proton radiation after chemo. Doc said it was better at pinpointing the target areas and better for my internal organs nearby as well. I have nothing to compare it to but dude effects were minimal and I have been in remission ever since (knock on wood)", "I was diagnosed this morning Still do not know much as I have not seen an oncologist yet, but the emotions are coming in waves. I have to move back with my parents because they live in a city with much better treatment options and I cannot afford to pay rent there. I feel like my life is being torn apart in front of me. My independence and my job, going back to college... just gone. \nAnd I am so terrified of chemo. \nLiterally just got over being suicidal and started feeling so hope for the future in 2021, then cancer swooped in and smashed me in the face with a hammer.\nI do not know how to feel or what to do. I do not even know enough about this cancer. \nI am 23 this is not fair. \nFuck. You just described my life to a T. I completely understand. What a nurse told me in the beginning is \u201cdo not identify as a patient\u201d. As in do not make this your defining characteristic. Try your best to keep some sort of normalcy. Losing your independence is so hard, but losing who you are may feel worse. I may have done a bit too much and pushed to far sometimes. But in the end, I am glad I held on to the things that I did. Like switching to online classes. I was able to stay in school and even take my computer to my infusions so I could distract myself from how fucked the whole situation feels. Professors were surprisingly understanding if I was off by a day or 2. \n\nI am so sorry. There are no reasons and we did not do anything wrong. We just have to kick its ass now and get back to our goals.  If nothing else, you are 100x more badass when you finally achieve them. That sucks... If you ever want to talk about it just send me a message, I am 24 and have had Hodgkin for 3 years now so I do not know maybe it is nice to talk to someone who is not a nurse or doctor.\n\nGood luck and lots of strenght :) I was diagnosed my sophomore year of college. It is definitely a lifestyle switch up, but what helps is staying positive and finding the parts of change that make you happy. (Time with parents, seeing who your true friends are, planning out your life/things you want to do) you will come out of this so much stronger, with so much more insight. If you need anyone to vent/talk to pm me. This is such a great way to look at it. Thank you! Thank you \u2764\ufe0f Thank you \u263a\ufe0f. I am trying to find the silver lining in this and I know I will be okay. Anytime! Feel free to message me if you need someone to talk to about it. That will come with time, just focus on doing what makes you happy. Also do not worry about your biopsy scar, it will heal fully in a few weeks and you will have a cool scar. I have one from my port as well! \n\nMy life became so much better after I went through treatment tbh. I had time to think about who I wanted to be and what I stood for in life. Totally changed my perspective on how beautiful life can be. I was stage 4 as well. Keep your head up and know what you have got people all around you rooting for you. Thank you, I actually do like the scar. I think it will look badass once all the skin glue comes off. I will shoot you a pm so I have someone else with this to talk to. I feel quite lonely with this. So it will be nice. I am sorry this has happened to you but like others have said it will give you a whole new outlook on life. It certainly did for me when I was diagnosed at 26. I was able to finally see what was truly important in my life and cut all the bullshit out. I had both chemo and radiation and met some absolutely amazing people along the way. Chemo is intimidating and I was scared but when I started the staff was so great and everyone was warm and welcoming. My first day sitting in the chairs during my infusion I was introduced to Bill as he was dancing around the room attempting to take his shirt off singing his favorite tune all while receiving his treatment. We fed off each others joy and made it a happy place. This is by no means something that will define you. Keep pushing towards your goals and most importantly take good care of yourself during this time. The little things like getting a good nights rest, eating well, and exercising a bit goes a long way. Please feel free to message me if you ever need to chat. You are going to kick cancers ass live a long joyful life! I wish you all the best I was diagnosed with Stage 3 HL when covid hit last year, did 6 cycles of chemo, and am now in remission. I apologize in advance coz this will be long-winded.\n\nI do not know if you will find any of this useful but these were my experiences:\n\n1) Having a positive attitude made a HUGE difference with treatment. I had a history of self-harm that I had gotten over, and thought 2020 was going to be \"my year\", and then BAM, Cancer! It was frustrating AF but I also knew that if I got through everything I endured thus far, I could also get through chemo. Im not saying every day was peachy, some days you just feel like shit and that is fine...it is okay to feel whatever you are feeling and you will go through the motions of it all...but keeping a positive attitude overall and being upbeat was important as I found that I was able to recover from the treatments faster.\n\n2) I had to go for treatment every 2 weeks and it usually took me 3-5 days to fully recover from each treatment...but closer to the end it took me a full week. It is important to keep your strength up by not being bed ridden when you are no longer feeling sick.I kept my strength up by hiking almost everyday on the days I did not feel like shit. On the days I didnt feel up for it, I cleaned bmy room or put away the dishes just so I did not stay in bed all day. Every bit helps but also do not push yourself too hard.\n\n3) In general, the side effects are cumulative and gets worse with each treatment. However, each treatment is different and you cannot predict how bad the side effects will be. There was one treatment, about halfway through, when I did not have any side effects...and the worst treatment I had was 3/4 through. \n\n4) Bring food and water when you go for treatment!!! You will be sitting there for hours and will want to munch on something at some point. The nurses will give you water (and juice if they have) if you ask though. Also, make sure you bring a charger for whatever electronics you bring. You can literally be there for 4 - 6 hrs! Netflix and Animal Crossing were my best friends.\n\n5) If you have no qualms against edibles, unlike I did, I highly recommend it. The antinauseant drugs I was prescribed only did so much. I was reluctant to listen to a friend of mine, who had cancer when he was in high school, when he kept suggesting it to me. I caved when I was halfway done and OMG it made such a HUGE difference! I was able to maintain an appetite and it even helped me keep food down. It also helped me sleep. I am not saying use it everyday, just for the bad days. I do not recommend smoking weed coz the coughing did not help but the gummy edibles are great. They also taste exactly like gummy bears.\n\n6) I was on ABVD for chemo. I did not know this going in but if it starts to hurt, do not bear it! Tell the nurses coz they can stop it and continue after a short break, or dilute it further so it does not hurt as much! I wish I knew THAT going in. \n\n7) In order to prevent myself from going crazy, I took up hobbies and interests that I previously told myself I had no time for....coz all I had then was time! You will be amazed at what you will find out about yourself and you will continue those hobbies after you are done your treatments.  I learned how to play the guitar and took up photography.\n\n8) Tbh it is actually good you are moving back to your parent's. I did as well and I could not have gone through the experience without them. Food is important and you will not have the strength to make it for yourself for the next couple of days after chemo. Sometimes you just cannot stomach whatever they made, even if it is something like bacon and eggs, but I am sure they will make whatever you think you can eat. If you cannot eat anything, drink protein shakes and/or Gatorade. You need the nutrients and electrolytes. Also, I was so glad to be able to do chemo in a time where we have the diversity of foods that ubereats can provide. Legit did not know what I wanted to try to eat sometimes, so I would browse uber eats to get ideas.\n\n9) Okay...this part is something I am now realizing how important it really is. When I was first diagnosed I read on reddit about how some ppl experience depression following their treatments...it is like they spent ssooo much time battling cancer, and when they got through it...what then? Some ppl said that the feeling/experience of their life becoming stagnant all of a sudden was worse for them than cancer. I recall someone posting that it took them a year after their battle with cancer to pull themself out of their post-cancer depression...and that always stuck in my mind throughout my treatments. I wanted to avoid that at all cost...so while I was going through my treatments I kept planning on what I would be doing after I am done. I did a lot of self reflection and realized that I did not go to school for what I really wanted to do, and that I was quickly outgrowing a lot of my friends. Long story short, chemo is long and arduous journey but I took advantage of the time to start making changes so I have a plan and something to look forward to after I am done my treatments. \n\nAnyways, I hope that helped, and if you want someone to talk to do not hesitate to reach out! You will get through this!  Hey there. Hope you are treatments are going well. Was diagnosed in July 2019 with 2a. Right after college and was working full time... I hear you about it robbing your time and independence. But stay the course and keep pushing. I found that focusing on things 1 month and sometimes 1 week at a time really helped me.\n\nWas declared to be in remission in Feb 2020. Right before covid... There is not a day I do not think about it coming back. Worried about my wife and parents... Do not want to drag them through it again. Was definitely harder on them than me.\n\nLooks like there are plenty of people on this subreddit to talk to. Keep in touch!", "Accuracy of identifying tumor subtype by biopsy (NScHL) My mom (63) was diagnosed with stage 2bs Nodular sclerosis Hodgkins (b symptoms). \n\nI hear that due to the \u2018sclerosis\u2019 (thick) nature of the tumor, often needle core biopsies cannot get enough tissue/cells to ID lacunar cells, a specific feature to NScHL. My moms biopsy mentioned that no lacunar cells were found but it is likely nodular sclerosis subtype. \n\nNScHL can sometimes be misidentified for diffuse large B cell (non-Hodgkins) or Greyzone Non-Hodgkins (which includes a mix of Hodgkins and non-Hodgkins cells). These subtypes require different chemo cocktails, so therefore it is important to subtype correctly.\n\n1) was your lymphoma subtype misdiagnosed based on biopsy?\n\n2) if patient (mom) is happy with her onco, very new to treatment (1 cycle so far), should she get a second opinion just to confirm subtype? \n\n3) are there any other features that might be included in her biopsy/flow cytometry work-up  that would support specifically NScHL as her subtype, as opposed to the non-Hodgkins or mixed types?\n\nThank you. And healthy vibes to those fighting and love to those supporting. I (29F) probably do not have the best answer for you but I had my needle biopsy return very similarly. My doctor said he was 99.99% sure by the info the needle biopsy got but also because I had all the classic symptoms of NSCHL stage 2. To be 100% he did remove my lymph node to do another biopsy to confirm. Thanks for your comment. \n\nWhere was your lymph that was removed? I assume that it came back as NScHl too?\n\nWondering if that is an option for my moms case, although I doubt bc they are deep in her retroperineal area. It was in my armpit and yeah came back NSCHL I would not worry too much, but never a bad idea to have the pathology reviewed at a leading lymphoma center.

I keep seeing people recommend ports because your veins may get difficult to find or hard (?) over the course of chemo and I wanted to ask all of you who are going through it or already finished treatment what you went with. IV or port? I was in GA, USA when I was diagnosed and had my first chemo, they put in a pic line, which had maintenance that had to be done 2x daily. When I came home, the hospital I finished my treatments at put a port in automatically. I think that was routine for them. Over all, I liked having it and would have it placed again. (It was removed 2 years after remission) Sometimes it was uncomfortable to sleep. It did protrude a bit from my chest, but the look of it did not bother me. You, and those of us that have been through any such treatments are warriors, take pride in those scars. Get a port they are a life changer Get a port !!! I had HL 3B and I used IV the whole time and did not have any issues Port is definitely the way to go, good luck! I am stage a \u201cbulky\u201d stage 2B and have had 2 infusions intravenously. It is not terrible, but I am also not a big fan. It is been taking a while for them to find a good vein for me, and then it takes longer during the infusion. I wish I could get a port, but cannot for a few reasons. If you can stay really hydrated, and have good veins, intravenous is not so bad. But do expect soreness at the site, and in the arm. I imagine ports do not have the same issues and might take less time when you get into the infusion. The option my doctors gave me was \u201cget a port or all the needles will basically destroy your veins.\u201d So far, port seems the way to go. Not fun and a little difficult to get used to, but you will. Port...but do not believe the lie that you will \u201cget used to it.\u201d I could not get that thing out of me fast enough when my treatment was over.", "Annoyed with Chemo... I read a similar post recently from someone wanting to quit chemo...I am not going that route, but I just got back a clean scan after 4 rounds and the thought of doing 8 more right now is really fricking annoying. \n\nI know it gives me the best chance of keeping the disease coming back, but each round the fatigue and  pain gets worse...luckily I have avoided any neuropathy so far. \n\nPart of me wishes the scan came back mostlyy clear, so it would feel like 4 more months of this chemo was really doing something...I know that sounds stupid. Also, telling people I got a clear scan and am in remission is great, but it feels like they think its kind of over now, while I have to struggle through more chemo, where I feel like shit for 10 days out of every two week cycle. \n\nSorry for the venting...I know the cancer will kill ya, but the treatment is not fun at all. Cannot wait to be done with this. Been where you are especially when I was stuck in the hospital all I wanted to do was go home got fed up with the mask I had to wear till my immune system was high enough after a bone marrow transplant.

Especially what you said about people thinking you are fine. I actually kept it pretty on the down low that I had a clear scan during the middle of my treatment because I still had treatment to go. I told people at the end of treatment and even then people thought I was fine when I was not. People do not always realise how much it can effect you and it takes ages to recover even if you are in remission. Been there! Had the exact same experience. I have now only 2 left of my 12.

I will be undergoing my pet-scan on Thursday to find out what stage I am in. I am also getting my egg cells removed and frozen which will take some time so I will not be able to start chemotherapy until the end of September. My oncologist said that waiting this long should be fine but I am still concerned that the waiting could worsen the illness. \n\nI was wondering if there is anyone on here who is interested in speaking about this, exchanging experience etc. privately? I am having a hard time finding other HL patients or support groups since this decease is relatively rare compared to other cancer forms. \nThank you, I hope everyone on here is doing well and healing! What were you original symptoms before you got diagnosed? I have a noticeable swollen and painless lymph node right above my collarbone. Other than that my body feels perfectly fine. (I have been having trouble gaining weight for the past few months, though.) I had to wait about a month after my diagnosis before I started chemotherapy. I was worried too but it seems like it is kind of a common practice (at least in the US) because of all the tests I had to have done before my treatment started. Hi u/erklinge. I am sorry to hear about your diagnosis. I was diagnosed with Stage 2 HL with unfavorable features back in late April and I am currently undergoing chemotherapy. By coincidence, I am also a pathologist (I do not specialize in Lymphoma, but I have some insight into the treatments and rationality behind them.)   \n\n\nThere is still some uncertainty in when to initiate therapy in cases of HL; however, all of the research that I am aware of indicates that there is no difference in overall survival or disease free survival if treatment is initiated within 8 weeks of diagnosis (and when treatment *is* initiated later than 8 weeks, the difference is small). As scary as delaying treatment is, it is important to remember that HL is highly curable at *every* stage, and that likely explains why there is such a small effect from delaying treatment.  \n\n\nI am sorry to hear that you are having trouble finding a support group. I highly recommend that you join the Facebook Hodgkin's lymphoma support group. That group has thousands of members who either have HL, survived HL, or have family members with HL. In my experiene, posts like this would have dozens of responses within the first hour. Thank you for this! Thank you so much for your reply. This helped a lot and made me feel less anxious. I hope you are doing well right now and the side effects are not too heavy for you! I am sending you some strength. And thanks for the fb suggestion.

I would be happy to connect. I am 31 F recently diagnosed with Nodular sclerosis Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and going to start chemo soon.

I agree that waiting is normal if you have a certain cell type that is slower to multiply.

First of all, my health has been at a steady decline for almost a year. It started with just some fatigue. Then, i began to get winded so much easier. Also, my tonsils and back of throat/tongue have been incredibly swollen for almost 7 months... maybe an infection, i really do not know if that has to do with anything though. Then, pain in my lymph nodes above my chest, this pain has been going on for almost four months. It is not constant but it happens off and on throughout every day. \n\nFast forward to this last month, my muscles have been hurting. I have been super weak. I am still feeling fatigue. Tonsils still swollen. Joint pain is off and on. And the worst thing is that I am no longer able to do ANY physical activity. Even going up the stairs too fast causes awful shortness of breath and chest pains. I went the doctor and got blood work done and  all that that came back was vitamin D deficiency. I have been taking it and so far it is only helped with my energy/ fatigue. Maybe if i wait long enough and keep taking it then everything will get better? I do not know I just do not see how vitamin D deficiency could cause all of this. Forgot to mention rapid weight loss this last month I would recommend you go and check in with your doctor I did already and he said vitamin d should fix everything but it has not did they run up some tests or something like CT scans or anything.... hopefully you feel better soon No just blood work. Hopefully idk im not a doctor but I am pretty sure if that was enough...I would say see a different doctor for a second opinion or something", "Newly diagnosed but anxious about how long that took Hi to whoever is out there! \n\nSoooo big bummer to be diagnosed with NSHL last week. Since I first began having chest pain, it has taken the doctors about 10 weeks to scan me, blood test me and biopsy me a million different ways before landing on the answer. \n\nMy last scan was a PET scan over 6 weeks ago, showing 4 enlarged nodes in my mediastinum, the largest being about 3cm. This is the scan they are using to stage my HL as stage 1A. However, it seems very out of date to me especially as I recently found an enlarged node in my armpit and upper neck. I want to get a second opinion and new pet scan to see if the cancer has spread, but am also nervous to CONTINUE waiting and letting this spread to more difficult stages and favorabilities. \n\n* I am just wondering if anyone has any idea how quickly this spreads (weeks, months?). Or personal anecdotes similar.\n* As this cancer supposedly spreads to continuos nodal sites, does it make sense to jump from my trachea to my upper neck and armpit, or could these just be a coincidence? \n* Has anyone had Stage 2 *unfavorable* diagnosis and done well with treatment? \n\nThank you and stay healthy! &lt;3 Hello! So sorry to hear about your diagnosis. It is a scary thing to have to deal with\u2014especially in the madness that is this year! But you have got this. \ud83d\ude42 \n\n\nTo preface all of this, I am not a doctor! But I did have the same disease subtype and stage as your about three years ago. \n\nI would not worry about getting a new PET scan, as the first line chemo recommendation will likely be the same no matter your stage (ABVD). I know they are trying new therapies for relapses, but as far as I know, ABVD is still the standard front line treatment. Once you start, they will do another PET scan after a few rounds to make sure it is working. From there they will make decisions about how long to continue the chemo, whether radiation will be necessary, etc. \n\nJust make sure you are sharing the new lumps with your oncologist. And if you are not confident in your doctor\u2019s recommendation, you can ask to get a second opinion! Hi! Sorry to hear about your diagnosis, being diagnosed with cancer sucks. I was diagnosed in April last year after 2 years of constant &amp; extreme itching on my legs and feet. I was diagnosed with stage 2AX. I do not know how quickly HL spreads but I was only stage 2 after itching for a very long time (my only symptom) but it is different for everyone I feel like. Mine started in my chest and kept growing then eventually started spreading all the way up to my neck. ABVD is the chemo pretty much everyone has to receive as first line treatment no matter the stage of the cancer. Even if someone is stage 4. My stage (2AX) was unfavourable because my mediastinum mass was 12cm. I responded extremely well to treatment. I had a PET scan after 4 treatments that showed a complete metabolic response. I finished my 12 treatments of chemo in September 2019 and have been in remission ever since (going on 9 months on the 12th!). Having an unfavourable diagnosis does not mean it is harder to cure but it does require more chemo (12 in my case). \n\nYou have got this! :) Omg thank you so much for the response! Lots of heartening details that I needed to hear! Glad you are healthy again and cannot wait to be there with you :) can I ask what made you decide to freeze eggs? I am going to get a monthly Lupron injection to put my ovaries to sleep because egg freezing was too expensive, but am worried about losing my fertility. Thank you!! Thank you so much for responding! So happy to hear you are healthy again. It is insane how the symptoms present in this cancer. Can I ask if you did anything to preserve fertility? I have heard ABVD can be rough on the repro system. You are welcome! Yes it is insane, the symptoms are so weird and can be related to almost anything. I had a consult with a fertility doctor before starting chemo and the process of freezing my eggs would have taken a month in my case. I decided not to freeze my eggs because I wanted to start chemo right away. My onc told me ABVD has like a 10% chance of affecting your fertility which did not seem that much to me. I do not regret not doing it, the only thing that scares me is if I relapse it might not be possible to freeze my eggs but I try not to think about it. You can always dm me if you have any questions, i would be more than happy to help :) I had HL stage 2B (unfavorable- the nodes were \u201cbulk) in summer 2016. I too did 4 complete cycles (8 ABVD treatments) before they scanned me again and the scan showed I was in remission. I then decided to forego the last 2 cycles and do proton radiation instead.\n\nI have been free and clear with no negative effects, got married and had a healthy baby boy with my wife in the time since then (though I did freeze sperm before beginning chemo just in case).\n\nFeel free to DM me if you have any other questions, I will do my best to give answers from my perspective.\n\nAll the best.  Hi! So sorry for the late reply! I do not have notifications on reddit. I actually did not end up doing it! I met with a fertility specialist and she said that I would likely be able to have children just fine. ABVD does not affect your ability to carry a child, but the effect on your eggs is basically unknown. Her worst estimate for me was that my eggs at 35 could be closer to that of a woman at 40, so later pregnancies might be more difficult, but I have no idea if that is actually going to be the case for me. Even with the \u201ccancer discount,\u201d if was going to be $5k to freeze them and I was broke. Also, my sister had Hodgkin\u2019s in college (yes\u2014we both had it!) and was treated with Stanford V, which is a little harsher than ABVD and had children very easily at 32 and 36, so I felt ok about my chances. Oh and there was some tiny study that ABVD might actually cause the body to create NEW eggs, which is nuts.", "Did any of you suspect that you had lymphoma or were you surprised\u2014and did your doctors listen to you? I feel like it is a possibility I have it, but my my last two doctors have been dismissive towards me thinking I am sick and now I am searching for a new one. Also, some of my symptoms have been GI First, I have had a swollen, painless lymph node under my chin since maybe February. Then I suddenly got really sick at the end of April, lots of sinus issues I stopped eating, started throwing up, became constipated, nauseated every day, could not breathe. Pain in my hip. Lost 10 pounds in 2 weeks. Diagnosed with a sinus infection, given antibiotics. Sinus cleared up, nausea/constipation/vomiting/loss of appetite did not. Fatigue increased significantly, i began napping nearly every day in addition to sleeping at night, bruising all over my legs. It is now July and I have lost 26 pounds, still have nausea, no more constipation. Loss of appetite fluctuates but it is currently in full swing. My entire body aches, I am still bruising, the lymph node is still there and painless and enlarged. I sleep way too much, I drank one glass of wine and the next day I literally felt like someone had beaten the shit out of me, like genuinely punched my arms and back. I have had random periods of extreme itching on my thighs, forearms, and breasts to the point where I am bleeding. I also feel feverish all the time, and had a mild fever for almost an entire week. Oh I also had another infection at the beginning of this month! I somehow got a bladder infection, I woke up peeing basically grape juice one morning and in extreme pain. Once again went on antibiotics. \n\nI had blood work done back in March and it was a little off  and noted that I needed to be retested, but they did not explain it to me so I guess not enough to matter. I had bloodwork again recently and it was still a little off but it was taken when I had the bladder infection so I imagine that had some effect. And I had my vitamins tested and those were perfect. I am not sure if I am going in the wrong direction or if I should ask the next doctor to check for lymphoma or not? The last doctor told me I had IBS and GERD! He stopped listening to me 3 symptoms in and slapped me with IBS when he learned I had Bipolar disorder. \n\nI am just curious how you all went about getting your diagnosis? Not that I have it, but am I allowed to ask a doctor to check me for it? Does that seem like something I should be checked for? Did you go to an Ear Nose Throat doctor for the lymph node. I got nothing from my Primary Physician but once I went to ENT they felt the lump and I got a biopsy. Yes, I had classic symptoms and even suggested it was hodgkin's but I was ignored until I ended up in the ER with a massive pleural effusion, and then spent days on a ventilator. I went to a primary, I am not really used to going to doctors so I was not sure who to go to. I will try to find an ENT then! Thank you! Oh my gosh, that is awful. I am so sorry. That must have been absolutely terrifying!! My PCP told me I had a pulled muscle at first, despite me going to him for an enlarged lymph node. Fortunately, he ordered and ultrasound to be safe. I was still diagnosed 5 months later though after multiple more nodes popped up. The ultrasound report said it was enlarged not due to cancer. can you speak more about it please Do not take no for an answer. You are the patient and you need to be forceful when speaking with the doctors. Tell them what is wrong and what you have experienced and if they keep trying to brush it off then tell them you want a second opinion. \n\nEven if this is not Hodgkins it is serious and you need to get to the bottom of it. \n\nThe ENT will want to focus on the node under your chin. If they feel it is enlarged they should want to run tests and get a biopsy. If it is not enlarged anymore then you should go to another PCP and get a second opinion. Thank you. I scheduled an appointment with an ENT for tomorrow. It is still enlarged and the one on the other side popped up earlier this month as well so I will see what he has to say. I really just want to figure out what is going on because it is been a long few months. My ENT tried to blow through my exam and almost missed my giant lymphnode make sure they take their time and make sure you explain why your concerned. Do not let them pass you through the office super quick cause they want to get done. Jeez, I am really sorry. I am glad they did catch it. It is scary to me how many doctor miss things or ignore things. I know they are humans too but it is just frustrating. I am going to make myself heard this time, unlike the last time, that is for sure. Well I was told after the ultrasound that if the lymph node does not go back to normal in a few weeks to get it checked out again. Life stuff happened so I ignored it for a couple months. But mind you I was extremely active working out 8-12 hrs a week, so I thought that was a good sign. \n\nRight after I moved back to college my roommates convinced me to get seen by a doctor again cuz my neck lump became about 3x2 inches (BIG) and I had more swollen nodes now around my collarbone and deep pains in my chest. That accompanied by trouble breathing, 25 lb weight loss, night sweats, and unrelenting fatigue made a cancer diagnosis very expected to me. A biopsy confirmed it was HL. I started chemo two weeks after being diagnosed. I had to move home and sperm bank prior to treatment. Currently 6 months post chemo. \n\nI still am pretty tired due to heart damage from the chemo ABVD.  But I am slowly yet surely getting back to my full self. Thank you for replying, and wow you are so strong! How long did you have the symptoms for? I hope you get your health back soon! Sure thing! Thank you. It has not been a smooth ride and I have my gripes with some treatment decisions made by my docs, oh well. \n\nLooking back I can confidently say I had symptoms for at least 13 months before diagnosis but I think it is possible I had some constitutional symptoms for about 2 years.\nIt is hard to know for sure because of how general HL symptoms can be until it starts to progress faster. Biopsy can settle all this dilemma , you will be sure if it is a cancer or not and what type is it ,the doctor wil certainly ask about it if he suspects something , visiting hematologist maybe can be good choice since even if it is an infection he is supposed to know Lymph nodes swellings for more than half a year needs to be checke with an ENT specialist,i would go there even more when you feel nauseaus. I have been throwing up almost daily for years, thought it was anxiety. Have always had slightly Inflamed bumps on my lower back where usually there would be \u201cdimples\u201d on girls my size. I have recently went through a break up and had some trauma to my right lower back-but tonight I was peeing and it was so painful and I went to grab that knot on my back so I googled \u201cdo you have lymphnodes on your lower lumbar\u201d \u2014 turns out you do. Then I started reading everything about the itchy skin. I have itchy skin every single day of my life almost to the point where I cannot stand it so as soon as I get home I take off my clothes so I can scratch better. I wash my sheets several times a week because I am sweating soooo terribly that I have to switch the sheets or move to my then partners side of the bed. We are talking hair, back, chest, armpits (im usually not a sweaty or smelly person) but when I wake up I am soo smelly. I also have had this constant itch in the back of my scalp for years that will not go away and I thought it was shampoo I was using. However, I used to weigh 133 on just regular days and now I weigh 110, I was amounting it to stress. But I also got diagnosed with bipolar when I was 19 and now I am 30 and still struggling with the same things even though I try to maintain in a healthy matter. What the heck is going on I have also gotten my tonsils and adenoids removed. And before I got diagnosed with bipolar disorder they checked my thyroid because all of the girls on my moms side have issues with that.", "Survivor Story I was diagnosed in the fall of 2018. It was a whirl wind of doctors visits, tests, results, surgery and then treatments and radiation from November 2018 till March of 2019. \n\nIt started out as a rash that would not go away on my legs and getting strep throat three times in a couple months at the end of summer. Then the lump in my neck finally got to where it could be felt and seen. I was told not to worry by my primary doctor, my wife forced me to go to Ear Nose Throat, that doctor performed a quick exam and almost missed it because my lump was so large it felt like the whole side of my neck. Thankfully she felt it, biopsy, blood work and a pathology phone call and there I was with Hodgkins 2A in my neck. Got a port put in (fuck that thing) and then started ABDV chemo. \n\nI tried to work during my treatment. I made it through almost one month, 2 sessions of chemo and then got so sick I ended up in the hospital. I was only eating 300 calories a day and drinking less than a cup of water. The drugs had backed me up and all of that gave me a fever over thanksgiving while my wife was working and I was attempting to watch our two kids at home. My parents came down for the evening and my mother immediately took me to the ER where they whisked me to admit and I spent 3 days in the hospital with a contestant drip of IV fluids and hardcore antibiotics. I went home and did not get back to work till March. \n\nI sat at home on the couch and watched the world go by and sank into a bad depression. Slept 18 hours a day and lost 30 something pounds from a lack of eating and drinking. I kept going to chemo and then had to get fluids at the chemo treatments plus more fluids on my \u201coff week.\u201d So I am getting 2-4 liters of fluid once a week in the infusion suite. My wife and I finally realize that I am having a major depressive episode (not suicidal thankfully) and got me on medicine. I start turning around in February as my chemo ends and my radiation starts. I am finally feeling like myself again as I go through radiation. I go back to work, start eating again (gained all my weight back and more, oops) and finally found a balance. \n\nI get a reoccurrence scare one year after treatment, apparently I have scar tissue around the main lymph node that was infected and so it showed as larger than it should be in the post CT scans. Blood tests and subsequent scans show no growth and no reoccurrence. \n\nI do not have any lingering symptoms but still use my antidepressant as I still have bouts of depression (possible reoccurrence did not help that). My life has changed for the better in many ways, and for the worse in some ways. I am blessed to still be here and I do not take that for granted. I am trying to make the best out of my life with my wife and kids after this and pray for a long healthy cancer free life from here on out. \n\nI just had to share my story with a group that understands. There are no support groups around me and my while my wife is amazing and a super understanding person I just do not feel like I can continue to rehash this with her. But I just needed to vent or share and offer advice to people who will listen to my advice. \n\nI am glad I started using Reddit again and I am glad I stumbled upon this sub. Hopefully I can be helpful to those who are starting their journey with this disease.  \n\nThere is a light at the end of the tunnel, you can do this and make it through. As a HL survivor since November 2017 who is going in for a PET scan next week due to possible reoccurrence I appreciate your post. It is never easy but we have to keep on fighting for those we love! Thank l you so much for sharing. I too am a HL survivor and it is tough talking to people about it who cannot relate so it is hard for them to truly understand.  Not that I would ever want them to. I relate to the weight loss and sadness that comes along with the disease. I am so very happy you made it through the storm and are pushing forward. You are warrior. Do not ever forget that.\n If you ever need to chat or get something off your chest please feel free to message me. Just know you are not alone in this and even though we have never met I love ya. Anyhow, have a lovely night and I wish you all the best. Hopefully it turns up nothing! \nKeep up the good fight! Thank you for the kind words! \nIt feels good to have found this place and have a community to reach out to finally. Thank you! You too!", "Lump in armpit  Its called latissimus dorsi Had this for a while, have no lymphoma symptoms, but this lump under my armpit, when I press on it , it is hard and does not hurt My lump was soft, pain free, and movable but was lymphoma.  Hard is something to get looked at. Ok, I am going to wait for some time now , if it does not change then I will call my doctor, no other symptoms tho I still have not had any symptoms. Mine was hard and painless too. Doctor always said if it is not painful, then maybe you should start to worry. Any update? Still have not had a chance to see my gp Ultrasound and biopsy should be the way to go", "Just want someone is input So I am 17 and one of my lymph nodes are swollen, it does not hurt much but it is there. I looked up some symptoms and a lot I do not have other than the swollen lymph node, loss of appetite, and nausea. I have not gone to the doctor but I am seriously considering. But the most concerning part is my abdomen has pain. I am hesitant to check out the doctor because a few weeks ago my lymph nodes near my hips were swollen too. So I think I might just have COVID-19 because my mom had it and my lymph nodes are just fighting it. Can I get an opinion? Call your doctor. Yeah you need to go figure out if you have covid so you can make sure you do not spread to others. Best of luck. Well it is been a week since I was finished with my 2 week quarantine so if I did not get it then I do not think I will have it now. Got ya. Well since you said you think you had it, I would personally put lymphoma out of your mind. Your lymph nodes could definitely swell from that.", "Lymph node removal I was recently diagnosed, and I know it rarely happens, but I have an enormous, painful lymph node in my neck.  Would it be out of the question for them to ask them to remove it? There are a few lymph nodes around it that are hard and pea sized, but this one became enlarged months before. I can stomach treatment for the others, but I really just want this one out of my body. First thing : no its not rare. Do visit other posts buddy \nSecond : depends completly on one thing In my case that was the node they removed for my first biopsy! The super enlarged one. \n\nI would just pick up the phone, call an oncologist and ask them about it! If you do not like their reply get a second opinion to confirm. :) That so good to know! I actually have my first biopsy scheduled for Monday, but they said they are only taking a small piece. I would have asked them to relive the whole thing but I did not know that was an option! \nThank you! Lymph node biopsies are supposed to be excisional! Which means its best when they remove a node completely intact because the physiology of the node helps in the final diagnosis. I know this cause I have been through 2 of them! They were done a year apart and by different doctors, in different hospitals! Both explained the the same thing (I am also a medical student so I did some reading of my own). \n\nAt the end of the day it is up to the professional but I would really recommend doing your own research and talking to them about it. Best wishes!! This is exactly what I needed to hear. I have been questioning my biopsy appointment for this exact reason. I would not worry about it too much if they choose not to remove it. It is very likely that when you start chemo you will start to feel it shrink. This can make you feel better that your treatment is working.\n\nMine was removed but I kind of wish it was not so I could know before my interim PET that treatment was working. I have some smaller ones near it and I would be fine with seeing those shrink. I am nervous they will want to do more radiation/chemo for this one huge lymph node. I cannot even turn my head all the way because of the location of this one:/ what are the health implications of removing a single node??", "Fertility Hey, just wanted to know cause I might have lymphoma. Is it likely a man will become infertile after treatment? It really depends on the location of the tumor, where the radiation treatment is focused. You should return to normal following treatment, but if you are concerned you can ask about options regarding preserving your fertility. Do you always need radiation treatment? My understanding is it depends what level you are graded at and your treatment plan with your oncologist. Make sure you ask lots of questions, make a list beforehand so you dont forget anything when you go talk to your doctor. They are there to help you and give you information. I have some lumps in my groin, and have abdomen discomfort, does that signify anything? I cannot remember the source but I have read that Hodgkin's and Testicular are one of the only cancers that effect sperm count even before you have treatment done. Technically the risk with chemo is low and supposed to be temporary but we are currently on the waiting list for ivf. My husband had stage 2b unfavorable (large chest mass) classical nodular sclerosing  HL and is only a year out from chemo. His banked sperm was low but his post chemo sperm has been low, slow, strangely shaped, and whatever else can go wrong with them. We were trying right before his diagnosis with no luck and had no luck after. Our fertility Dr said our only option right now is IVF. That does not mean his fertility will not come back in the next few years but right now I am glad we banked some sperm. Hope that helps and for reference we are both 28 and mildly healthy other than the cancer... Also he had no cancer below his diaphragm. His radiation was all to his neck and upper lung. Hey thanks for the reply, is radiation necessary when treating hodgkins? Cause I heard it is dangerous right? You are right it does have is risks but so does chemo and stop does just having cancer haha We were worried about that and initially did not want to do radiation. His doctor said it carried the same long term risks as chemo did. They really wanted him to do radiation because he was he was unfavorable meaning he had a large mass in his chest. We trusted his doctors and the statistics. Hodgkin's was one of the first cancers diagnosed and successfully treated. That is why the survival rate is so high because they have been treating it successfully for so long. We choose to do it because we trusted the process but do your own research and do not be afraid to get a second opinion. \n\nMy husband had 20 radiation treatments and his biggest complaint was fatigue. He did not get radiation burns until the last week or so. One more thing please, is infertility guaranteed, I mean is your boyfriend infertile now, or does he just have low quantity, did you test? It is not guaranteed statistically you actually have a 5-10% chance of infertility if you do ABVD chemo. Also if you do have infertility there is a chance it can be temporary and will return within 3-5 years. His could come back in the future but we got it tested and right now it is bad. They said his count is extremely low, they are, slow and mishapen too. Bottom line if its important to you I would ask around and find the best priced clinic in your area. Luckily for men it does not delay chemo like for women. My husband banked Friday night and Monday morning then started chemo Monday afternoon. \n\nIf for some reason your chemo does not work and you have to do as stem cell treatment that does make it imposible to have kids later on. \n\nAlso my husband finished chemo 5/19 and radiation 7/19 so its still pretty fresh in our minds of you have more questions about anything HL related. I was told I would no longer be fertile and to freeze sperm. I was told I could potentially become fertile again later but it was not a guarantee. From what I have read online it seems most men do regain fertility.", "Relapse and recurrence and life expectancy questions! Please answer Hello my name is Fabio I am 16 and was recently put in remission for Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma stage 2. I kind of still have the bump on my neck. My doc said it is normal for it not to go away fully. It kind of hurts from time to time not horrible pain but more uncomfortable. Is that normal? And will relapse happen to me? Or recurrence? Is there a percent someone can give me of this? I also heard about the health issues with this cancer and Generally how many years have I lost because of this cancer?  I read it is the second cancer with most year deduction. Have I lost a chunk of my life? I barley even began to experience anything in this world and I am not trying to die at 20 or 40 or even 60 I plan on living a full life till I am a wrinkly old man. Will I be able to? Please be honest Damn hodgeskins is prominent in terms of life reduction? Who told you that? I have had it twice and now I am curious. I hope that you are safe though! I could of miss read it idk seems odd to me too I am just worried I do not want to die I had hodgkins at 18 and am now 36, still in remission. Treatments are getting better all the time, what I had chemo-wise you may get a lesser dose of and thus maybe a lesser chance of a reoccurrence. Talk to your doctor, that is what they are there for!\n\nAlso, when I was diagnosed, I had about a football sized tumor in my chest (so large they classified it as type two) and at last scan it was the size of a baseball. So long as the cells are dead, from what they told me, you are fine that it is hyere. I am newly diagnosed with Nodular Lymphocyte Predominant Hodgkins Lymphoma, stage 4, and I wonder &amp; read about it like crazy as well &amp; think about a lot of the things you are thinking about. I have read a LOT and I have not read anything about it being dominant in life reduction (or however you worded that). Of course I wonder about relapse and refractory issues as well. Notice I did not say \u201cworry\u201d, I said \u201cwonder\u201d, because I am making a conscious effort not to worry. Some days I outright fail hard and other days I am more positive. \n\nEven throughout this whole situation I have had so many blessings from God &amp; I try to remind myself that my steps are in his hands and he knows my path and can bring good out of bad. I have already seen it happen. I also know that worrying is not healthy, will not change anything, and it is better to be positive. It is easier said than done and is a process. There are a lot of good stats for Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma, even at stage 4, like with me. If you are stage 2, even better! \ud83d\ude0a I thank you for this info and ik you will be fine please comeback and update us! What about a odd pain like sensation time time? Happened to you? My lump was probably 2 inches  I cant give you a clear answer on that. Due to the radiation, my chest hurt for a few months (everything was burned feeling) and even to this day I have issues swallowing due to scar tissue. Definitely ask if you are in pain, if nothing else to calm your nerves and figure out the cause and how to alleviate it.", "My son was diagnosed with Hodgkin Lymphoma during the pandemic. He is still fighting but how will we ever leave the house again? \nSince my 15 year old was diagnosed w cancer (October 6, 2020-mid pandemic), we became super vigilant about minimizing our exposure.  We actually stayed home.  We masked and wore gloves and sanitized and washed our hands.  We did not visit or have visitors. We declined invitations to gatherings, regardless of size.  This felt like the right thing to do to protect him.  During chemotherapy, his immune system was at its lowest.  So as our county moved in and out of the phases, our family stayed in phase 1.  And we got used to it.  It is weird to admit that we liked it.  It felt safe for us and we stuck to the guidelines for as long and longer than they were imposed.  Now we are fully vaccinated except for Simon who cannot due to the vaccine creating a false positive for new Lymphoma.  As Simons mom, I am terrified to \u201cget back out there\u201d. Just wondering if anyone else is experiencing this dilemma and how you handle it? I was diagnosed in October 2019 and finished 6 months of ABVD treatment in May 2020. I will say it was really tough to go back out into the real world, but what helped me was baby steps. I started going back to work, but requested a secluded office. My husband still did all the grocery shopping. We slowly started going to smaller events outside only, and then once we were vaccinated we felt a lot more comfortable. Baby steps is key! When will your son be able to get his vaccine? hey. I am 18 now and i beat my cancer in march. And im fully vaccinated. The conditions were really bad here in India. almost everyone or their relatives knew someone that died. it was literally so bad my neighbor advised to not even go on the roof since all the smoke from the covid victim's funeral pyre blew over the city. But i got vaccinated after everyone in my family.\n\nand it is worth the risk. please know as parent (just as mine did) you will always be unsure about him going out. Me going out normally too made my parents freak out at times. But we mustered up courage and i got my shot. and trust me the risk is genuinely worth it. i wont get guarantee anything . You have to just trust him and his body system. hope he is a fighter. please get the  shot. once you do the surety that he is safer is worth every risk. i do not know if any of this was any help but my heart goes out to you. also remember to occasionally hug him and tell him its not his fault, none of this. tell him you are prepared to see through hell for him. i know this is tacitly understood but i so much wish my parents told me this , both of them , each day. Hope this helps . take care. I was diagnosed in January this year and have 2 treatments left. I understand this fear and anxiety well. I was hospitalized for a cold that it really scared me to think about going into public and catching covid. I was allowed to get the vaccine but was told to get it on my left arm because my right side is where my cancer is/was. Sure enough a new lymph node popped up on my mid scan but my doctors knew it was from the vaccine and not a new cancerous node. My doctor also allowed me a month break from treatment to get my immune system up to help make the vaccine more effective. Maybe something to talk to your doctor about..? I totally understand how you feel.\n\nI was diagnosed during the pandemic, near the start, and have sheilded the entire time, regardless of the changing rules around. I just do not trust that it is safe and I do not know how to \"get back to normal.\"\n\nEspecially since I thought the vaccine was my only hope of going out there safely but now evidence has come out that some lymphoma patients who had the vaccine so close to treatment did not develop any antibodies. I no longer feel like that provides me safety! \n\nI do not really have advice sorry, but wanted to say you are not alone in feeling this way! Have you looked into imerman angels, you should! My husband was diagnosed Nov of 2018 and has been out of treatment since July 2019. We still took extreme caution during the pandemic because he has bleo lung damage, also I was pregnant and have comorbidities. We are vaccinated but still mask everywhere.  We still do grocery pick up and he has switched to a permanent remote position. We definitely ended up enjoying being home as well. I am anxious to rejoin society but live in an area where many people are anti-vax. We have ventures out to many parks for picnics and have been to a few not crowded outdoor soccer games. I cannot really offer any advice other than it is hard and you are not alone. I honestly think it will still take a lot of time and possibly a short round of therapy for my husband to be fully ready to go out again. I think the hardest part is not being able to see family that chose not to vaccinate, it has caused hurt feelings on both sides I think. Especially when majority of family faught hard to get the vaccine to protect my husband and our new baby. Good luck and lots of patience to you! Thank you.  This is reassuring.  I consider myself open minded but also intelligent and confident in my decision making, however, the combination of the coronavirus with a cancer diagnosis has made me very anxious.  I feel protective of my family, maybe to a fault.  I know these kids need normal social lives too.  Just not sure how we get there.  And yes, we mask too, even though we are vaccinated.  We probably still will for a while, or until Simons immune system is ready for the vaccine. Thank you.  That sounds very similar to Simon\u2019s path as well.  He went through about 8 months of ABVD.  We were hopeful he would not need radiation but he us in radiation now.  Hopefully he can get vaccinated after his post radiation scans are complete. Thank you.  Your story is amazing and thank you for sharing it with me. When he completes his radiation I think he will be allowed to get the vaccine.  Bless you for your message. That helps so much.  Yes i have read that as well.  I think you have to basically have a recovered and healthy immune system for it to be fully effective.  Thank you.  I wish you the very best Yes, I think so.\n\nUnfortunately they did not know this when they started vaccinating the vulnerable people. I was only about two months out from treatment when I had mine and my immune system was not up fully healthy yet again. I read researchers have discovered that people who have the vaccine within six months after treatment are less likely to develop any antibodies, than after that time period.", "Palb2 and HL Hey all.  I am near my first year of remission for HL.  4 cycles (8 infusions) of abvd chemo and no radiation.  I was 2a/b diagnosed.  \n\nI got genetic testing and was flagged for palb2 mutation.  Does anyone have this as well and what do you know about it is relationship to HL?  \n\nI know this is a tough subject.  Heart goes out to everyone here.  All the best and thank you.", "How To Say No To Events When Sick ", "23 Male. Is this lymphoma? I am going to a doctor once I figure out insurance. In the meantime I would like to run my symptoms by the sub to see if it matches anyone's experience. Reading stories I am having a hard time being certain. I have some matching symptoms but they could possibly be explained away.\n\nCoughing. I am a recently sobered heavy smoker of marijuana for the past 7 years or so, off and on, but very very heavy when \"on\". In the same time frame I have smoked cigs and vaped nicotine at high levels off and on. Both marijuana and tobacco use increased dramatically the past 6 months. Even more so the past 3 months. Up to 8 water pipe rips of tobacco and marijuana a night, more if I had the day off. I know, awful. I have also been sick recently and I am not sure if I am over it yet and it takes a while to shake the smokers lung.\n\nNight sweats. Again I have been sick recently. All instances include resting very near and in the jer stream of a heater, under a down blanket which could easily get overheated. I was also sick during half the instances.\n\nSwollen node. Mine is located right groin, right in the crease inner thigh. Four weeks ago it started causing me pain down my thigh, internally not topically, with no physical signs of issues. No redness, swelling. It feels like a pulled tendon or aggravated muscle but it starts at the node and depletes in intensity further from the node. It worried me and the symptoms matched femoral hernia. Especially the pain feeling sore and tight made me think the artery might be pinched. At work as a cashier at gas station the pain was more than ever before, and I could not ignore the possibility of dying at a gas station so I went to the ER. Bump was lymph node as we know. Blood test no signs of infection. No STDs. I asked if my smoking could cause it. Not alone he said. I asked about stress and he said not alone, it would only aggravate an existing condition. The past 6 months have been a steadily increasing bout of stress. The fear of herniating adding to this. Since moving home it has decreased in size, but the pain remains. (Wow three mandarins) /ignore the pointless reference, I am partially zany from conceptualizing cancer./\n\nLoss of appetite. This could be due to marijuana withdrawal. I have limited appetite without it. 4 days sober now I dont have a problem with appetite, but it is not the same as when I was not sober, which could have been because of the pot.\n\nToday I shoveled off two roofs of about 3 feet of snow. Somewhere around 200ft squared. Very hard work. I felt sick here and there from being so out of shape but my node and leg pain didnt come until later when I was walking home from my friends house. My friend took a bong rip of marijuana and tobacco (the same guy who got me into the terrible behavior) and while he blew it out of the room window some remained. It could be that aggravated my node. It is still bugging me now some 5 hours later.\n\nI know it is a lot of info but specifically I wondered if anyone else experienced 3 out of 10 pain at the site of the affected node without swelling. Specifically groin located nodes and inner thigh pain. The pain does not go up from the node. Could it be its spreading down the lymphatic highway? Is there a more intenerally located node that is more severely affected that is causing the pain via displacement as it grows?\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. Sorry if not having a diagnosis is offensive. I know this might be a bit late and not helpful at all but my brother has Hodgkins and he had no symptoms except for a bump that slowly grew on his neck for months that nobody really noticed till it got really big  Yes that is def lymphoma night sweats are dead give away Yes that is def lymphoma night sweats are dead give away", "Quitting chemo I am 22 and was diagnosed with stage 2a back in February. I am in a trial and was prescribed 8 rounds. But I had a clear scan after my 3rd and 4th rounds and at this point feel like completing all 8 rounds would be over-treating. Considering quitting after the 6th round. Anyone else have a similar experience?? Have you discussed this with your oncologist? I was in a similar position. I was projected to do 6 - 8 rounds total, depending on if the cancer was gone after the 3rd round. It was in fact clear, and then I only had to complete 6. \n\nI had stage 3 Hodgkin's, fyi. Definitelly discuss it with your doctor or another hematooncologist with your documentation in your hands if you are worried. In Europe, you have this right by law, i do not know how about another countries. But i guess you could at least try.\nEdit: also worth mentioning i would be strongly against quitting without any consultation with one or more doctors. Stage II-A without bulky disease (&gt;1/3 of the total chest diameter or &gt; 10cm outside the chest) has excellent outcomes with 3 cycles of ABVD (6 infusions every 14 days).\n\nIf you were early-favorable (i.e. NO elevated sed rate, up to 2 sites of disease, no extranodal disease and no bulk) can be treated with 2 cycles of ABVD + Radiation (you could even be treated without RT though at an increased risk of relapse which is usually localized). \n\nIf your disease is bulky or if you are not receiving standard ABVD therapy (on trial) you should not shorten treatment. You are already on an abbreviated therapy and these treatment courses are based on experience with thousands of patients regarding the safety of minimizing doses as much as possible. \n\n(\n\n( \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nErel Joffe MD  \nLymphoma Service  \nMemorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center  \n\\* Comments are for educational purposes only and should not be regarded medical advice.  \nr/Lymphoma_MD_Answers Man you all are doing less than 8 rounds? I am doing 12 for stage 2b lol I had a clean scan after my 4th round. My doctor has sent me plenty of articles to read about the benefits of completing 12 rounds (first ABVD now AVD). Talk to your oncologist and ask for research articles before making a decision. I ultimately choose to trust my oncologist with my specific diagnosis and plan and figured I have made it this far I can do 3 more. I was clear after my 6th rounds and ended up finishing the rest so that I had a greater chance of it not coming back. I was fucking pissed but looking back I am glad I do not have to worry about it now Same here! I completed 12. I had clear scans after 4. I figured I was already in the thick of things. Might as well give myself my best shot at keeping it gone rather than worrying about it coming back.", "I am kind of worried and have to wait till Wednesday to go to the doctor So yesterday was new-years eve and I drank some alcohol. When I woke up this morning my lymph nodes hurts so much in my neck also those of my armpits.. \n\nIt happens everytime I drink but never really thought about it. Now I look it up on Google and it says it is a symptom of Hodgkin.. If I look at the other symptoms I am tired a lot and sleep a lot when I stay home all the time.. I also sometimes sweat at night. But I have not lost a ton of weight so I am not sure.\n\nI have exams next week and now I cannot focus at all. My mother has cancer (breast, lung and intestine) so guess it is possible. I am only 25 years though :( My doctor does not work on weekends and monday and Tuesday I have a lot of exams at school so I have to wait till Wednesday.\n\nAm I overreacting and worrying about nothing? Thanks a lot for reading and for the advice. I would say always get it checked out. Worse case, you have a diagnosis and can start working on treatment and best case is you do not have Hodgkin's. \n\nAlso, take this with a grain of salt, as I have no medical training whatsoever, but when I was getting diagnosed, I had a surgeon going over my biopsy options. He said we can either do a biopsy of a lymph node (which is the option I went with) or they could give me steroids and see if the swelling went down. The steroid option would have taken a few weeks and the surgeon said a few weeks will not mean too much in terms of staging unless I was already far along.\nAnd people that have later stage Hodgkin's tend to have more severe symptoms.\n\nBut for real, anytime you feel weird, I would go see a doctor of your able. \n\n&gt;My mother has cancer (breast, lung and intestine) so guess it is possible.\n\nAlso, one last thing. Hodgkin's is one of the few cancers that does not really have a family link (or if it does, it is super minor). I want to say I read on the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society that it is really rare outside of twins for family members to both have Hodgkin's. I will put the link in once I find it. Thanks a lot for your advice, I am definitely getting it checked out by my doctor so that I know for sure. I actually do not think I have swellings but I am not sure tho, I am kind of a paranoid person. It does hurt a lot today. \n\nDid the biopsy hurt a lot? I am terrified of doctors and needles and never really had any kind of surgery.. \n\nI will make an appointment with my doctor asap. Again thanks a lot for sharing it with me and I wish you all the best. Stay strong! The biopsy should not really hurt because they will likely use lidocaine or something similar. It is uncomfortable though and I experienced some soreness afterwards.", "Just a few questions I 21m was just diagnosed today. My questions are: if I beat this thing will my life expectancy be shorter? How long will this take to beat? What stage am I likely in?  So there is a ton to unpack here. First thing is, your doctor should be telling you what stage you are in. You should have this info ASAP. Secondly, life expectancy is not an easy answer. But Hodgkins has a really high survival rate. And the further you get away from chemo, the higher your chances are it will not come back. \n\nAs for how long treatment will last? I had a really shit doctor who ignored my symptoms at first so I ended up with the highest stage of Hodgkin, when I finally switched doctors and they found it. But still, even with all that, treatment was only about 9 months total. \n\n\nI will not say it is an easy process but it is one I think most people can survive. If you want more details, feel free to message me.  Pm sent My brother was just diagnosed for Hodgkin two days ago, after puking up blood and going to the emergency room. He was coughing for the past five months and the shitty doctors could not find the cause until now. \n\nHow are you holding up? What is the best way to support my brother? Hey I am 21 and I was diagnosed in December right now on my 3rd cycle of chemo, do not worry you will get cured, if you have any questions feel free to ask we are all on the same boat...hope you get well soon. Ditto. Diagnosed December with HL stage 3. 3rd cycle chemo and PET scans show chemo working well. Treatment is not so fun but when you look around the chemo ward you see all sorts having a worse time... this one is curable! Hi! I hope everything is going well now and you have gotten some more answers. I am 22f and I just finished my own treatment for Hodgkins Lymphoma in January. If it makes you feel better, if you are ever going to be diagnosed with cancer, Hodgkins is the one to have. My doctor described it as \"garden variety cancer\", super routine and easy to treat. It is still scary none the less, but it is definitely something you can overcome!!  Ive heard the same thing. After meeting with my oncologist I am much more optimistic. Thank you.", "My daughter was just diagnosed... My 20 yr old daughter will get a PET scan tomorrow for staging. She has really been looking forward to getting her own place and wants to move out next week as planned, before she knew about the cancer.  I am worried she will be too sick to work and will not be able to make rent. How hard is the chemo? What would you recommend she do based on your chemo experience?\n\nThank you I was stage 4 and I was able to work during chemo. I was diagnosed at 21. That being said doing anything strenuous was still hard and especially with the current virus going around it might be better for her to stay in/not go out and be exposed. \n\nIt is ultimately up to her if she feels she will be able to handle it and every person handles chemo differently. I was only recently diagnosed and live with my mother. I would say she will likely need to stay home. There is just too much at stake. Cancer sucks and it is going to take a chunk of her life. I am so ready to continue school and move out, but it is going to have to go on the back burner now and that is just that. Especially with coronavirus. I do not think anyone with this disease or under chemo should be leaving their house, and you pretty much cannot do that unless someone is buying you groceries. I was stage 3 and had just moved out for my 3rd year at university. I was given chemotherapy and even with only experiencing 'mild' side effects moving home was the best thing. There was no way I could manage making nutritious meals,doing laundry regularly. It also helped to have the support of my family when I would have a breakdown trying to make sense of it all. Also having someone drive me to and from the multiple appointments and field visitors was so helpful. \n\nI would say,especially with the uncertainty of what treatment she will need,and how she may react to it being home is best for now. However do remember to give her space and allow her to do as much as she feels able to do.\n\nHope it goes well and she makes a quick recovery. I have stage 4 NLPHL and am doing the R-Chop regimen. I have had one treatment so far and have had few side effects. I have really only had a bad taste in my mouth on some days and am now experiencing hair loss. I have worked six days a week since the treatment. The PA I spoke to today to check in with me about the side effects said R-Chop is a fairly easy regimen overall. I guess it depends on what regimen she is on. I hope to work through all my treatments, God willing. I pray your daughter has a manageable time as well.", "Mom just got diagnosed Hello all!\n\nMy mom (53f) was recently diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma, most likely 2nd stage in her chest. She met with her oncologist today to go over a treatment plan, and once he does a complete scan they will know which way to go. Unfortunately I was not able to attend the appointment, so that is all the info I really have right now. \n\nMy main question is to parents who have had this type of lymphoma - what can I do to make her as comfortable and calm as I can? She is just so scared with the uncertainty and nervous about chemo and the port appointment. \n\nShe moved in with me and my husband after my stepdad passed away a few months ago, so I am 100% ready to be a caregiver and be there for whatever she needs. I just know that she is stubborn and  she will not necessarily ask. Is there something I can proactively do before treatment starts? \n\nThanks you all, much love to everyone \ud83d\udc9c Just be there for her when she is ready to talk. Honestly. \n\nThere was nothing anyone could do to help me through processing this new part of my life or staying any calmer than I was or was not. Having my wife and friends just be there to process with when I needed it was the best thing. Having my wife and friends treat me exactly the same as before until treatments started was a big help to make it feel as normal as possible for as long as possible. (Not ignoring the diagnosis, just not fixating on it everyday.)\n\nAs for the port placement, it is not as bad as it sounds. The placement is worse than the removal but neither were really that bad, and I was actually able to be awake during the removal portion. It itches, that is pretty much the worst part. \n\nDifferent chemos have different side effects so until you have a treatment plan your not going to get any kind of responses about what treatments like. We would all be happy to share tips and tricks about chemo once you know what kind she is going to receive. \ud83d\ude01 Hey there. Sorry to hear about the news. I had stage 2a classical hodgkin's when I was 23 (2019). Have her look into fasting. I did that and it seemed to really help. Did not have any negative side effects. Was taking ABVD as the chemo regimen for 6 months. I would fast 48 hours before and 24 after. Only threw up once. \n\nI do not think they give ABVD anymore. I think the B, bleomycin, is no longer given to people.\n\nThe cancer was in my lymph nodes in both sides of my neck, both armpits, and my left chest.\n\nIt can be scary, but just be there and ready to talk to her about it. I had some close friends that stopped talking to me when I was in treatments. Probably because they did not know what to say. Was really weird. I had ABVD last year and if this is in the UK then the NHS give you these amazing anti-sickness tablets and I did not throw up once and I never fasted. My top tip for if she ends up getting a PICC line (which is what I assume you mean by port?) is to drink LOADS of water on the day, stay as hydrated as possible. It helps keep your veins nice and big! \n\nOther than that - each person is different. Just listen to her needs, even if she does not actually say them. If she looks tired, suggest a nap. Ask her what food she fancies and go to the shops and get it if you do not have it already. If you can go to any future appointments, take a notebook and write everything down for her. Keep track of her temperature for her (this was recommended by my nurse) and any symptoms so you can report back to nurses for her. Just be there - which it sounds like you are already more than willing to be! Man I wish it was in the UK\u2026we are in the US, but the doctor seems to really know what he is doing as far as treatment goes. Hopefully they have the anti-sickness in this part of the world :) That is great! I am out of the US. Did not take the tablets. Some anti nausea meds were offered, but declined. It is called aprepitant if you wanted to ask about it but it is hella expensive so not sure how that works insurance-wise out there? Best of luck with it anyway! I think so? I am not sure since this is all new to me, but port was mentioned a few times and that she would need to be asleep for the insertion. \n\nI will be going to all future appointments with a notebook and someone else suggested a tape recorder as well in case I miss anything. In my understanding, I was not allowed due to covid restrictions for the first one. Next one will be where I meet the nurses and I guess learn the ins and outs. \n\nShe is just a stubborn woman so I am worried my suggestions will go in one ear and out the other, but I will sure try. \n\nThanks so much \ud83d\udc9c Aw, that is truly awful. I am sorry about your friends\u2026but I am in the same boat where I really do not know what to say either. I try to talk about other things to keep her mind off of it so it is not just the singular thing she is fixating on, but I think until she is in treatment that is really all she can think of. \n\nI will have her look into fasting, thank you so much for the suggestions \ud83d\udc9c Oh crikey, I was not asleep for it! Must be different in the US then.\n\nBest of luck with it! \ud83d\udc9b Thanks so much for the suggestions, glad you made it through \ud83d\udc9c\n\nMy grandpa had a port in, but that was over 10 years ago and it was a little scary. Hopefully it is a bit more advanced by now. It sounds like it if you were able to be awake for the removal. \n\nI honestly had no idea there were different chemos, so  I guess just knowing that is a good starting point haha \n\nThanks again \ud83d\ude0a I had ABVD two years ago in the USA and I was also given amazing pills and never threw up once during treatment PICC line is not the same as the Port. \n\nYou will have to be under for the insertion of the port as it is a process. But it is a light sedation and take less than an hour total. Yes I talked to the doc the whole time he removed it. I def got some major lidocaine injected tho. Removal is much easier than placement.   600 lbs is 272.4 kg", "Worried that i have lymphoma Hey im a 19yo female\n\nFirst I want to say that I know that many here is not doctors and I probably should see a doctor before assuming anything\n\nBut all of you here have some sort of a connection to lymphoma.

The only way is to to release these emotions out of the body, than things should improve.\n\nTo be sure, I would suggest also going to a professional doctor a.s.a.p. with these symptoms. They are serious, and it could be that your body needs some support in the form of medication in case illness makers taking over your body too much or when it turns out to be an infection. Hi!

I have always thought of being a lucky girl but sometimes this takes over and I cannot really be sad about anything because I am in a place where I can bear anything.\n\nNot so long ago, exactly 8 days before my 18th birthday, I was diagnosed with Hodgkin Lymphoma. Trust me when I say that I do not know how to feel about it.\n\nLast summer I started feeling a little bump on my shoulder and I talked about it with my mom. Few weeks later it disappeared but then came back again. I went to a dermatologist who defined it as cyst but, considering that the ultrasound was unclear, suggested to analyse it after a little surgery.\n\nSo, one day, I disconnected from my online classes earlier to go to the hospital. After two hours, or less, I was back at home feeling no pain and having no worries.\n\nThe histological examination had to be ready one week later, but it was not. Once it was, it talked about a benign tumor.\n\nThe following week, my mom received a call from the surgeon who had operated me asking to take an appointment with him as soon as possible. We went there and were told that the histological examination we were given was not complete and that he could not diagnose anything because multiple analysis showed confused results. After a quick check of lymph nodes, that were okay, he dismissed us suggesting a screening every three months.\n\nThe following day he called again and told my mum that further analysis proved that I had Hodgkin Lymphoma.\n\nWhen I was told about it I did not know how to feel about it. Not happy for sure, but not even sad. I did not expect it and I still need to realise what is actually going on with me.\n\nAfter three days I had my first appointment with a haematologist. The first thing she said was that I have to do Chemo therapy. She then talked about freezing eggs, heart ultrasound and other stuff I do not even want to think about. While she kept speaking I had teary eyes and, stupidly, kept thinking about letting my long hair go.\n\nAccording to my parents, who are not doctors but just parents that want what is best for me, she was going too fast and talking about a therapy that could be unnecessary. I was already feeling like giving up: I spent three days with no will of leaving my bedroom and I just wanted to watch old One Direction\u2019s video and Formula 1 content with no thoughts on my illness.\n\nMy mom took an appointment with another haematologist, whom she reached through a family friend who is a surgeon. Once again I was in the car with my parents travelling to a hospital.\n\nThis haematologist received us and, already aware of the situation, \u201cdenied\u201d what we were told. According to him, all the analysis were not done in a proper way (at least not according to his modus operandi) and the diagnosis was weird, considering that I had never had any symptoms. He also told us that the specific type of HL I was diagnosed with  is really rare and talking about a chemo therapy  with no insights was too rushed. He will soon repeat the histological examination and he will take  care of me.\n\nI think that the worst thing about this whole situation is people around me.\n\nMy mom is now hoping for a miracle that will give us better news with the next histological exam; she even brought me to a cathedral to ask a saint for a grace (too much, if you ask me). My dad, following my mom\u2019s thoughts, is thinking about suing the hospital who possibly gave us a wrong response of the histological examination. My uncles and aunts keep calling my mom to always get the latest news. Just one out of my thirty cousins called me and talked with me. My teachers at school always ask me if I am feeling well; one of them talked to me privately and told me that his family and him will be praying for me. I appreciate my teachers. My best friend keeps getting messages from me with all my thoughts and feeling after every appointment and, as I have asked her, she does not make any questions.\n\nWhat I am mostly confused about is my classmates\u2019 reaction. I talked about the whole situation just with 7 of them but I feel like I ended up isolating myself. I do not talk about it too much but I would like to be asked more often \u201chow are you?\u201d. I know that they cannot understand how I am feeling right now, but am I really wasting time hoping that they can empathize with me? I don\u2019 want to be pity but, seeing them every day, I hoped for a better understanding.\n\nMy mom is currently fighting breast cancer. My grandma died of breast cancer. My grandpa died of bladder cancer. One of my uncles died of stomach cancer. One of my cousins died of NHL at the age of 3.\n\nWhy do I feel like everyone expects me to be the strong one? They take this for granted.\n\nI do not want to die but I do not want to do anything, I cannot really bear with all the things that are happening and I do not even find the support that I think I need.\n\nThis is my first Reddit post and I do not even know if I want somebody to read what I am writing.\n\nMaybe I am silly, maybe my mind is exaggerating the first ever bad thing that happens to me.\n\nI also hope that things will take a different turn but I do not want to do anything about it. I just hope that the next histological exam will not talk about something not benign so that this situation will end.\n\nI just wish the best to the people who have been fighting against cancer, in particular HL: you are brave and I do not think that I can compare to you. Hey. I do not know if you will relate to me but. 30, diagnosed with HL stage 2a, gone through 1 and a half rounds of ABVD chemo. Most likely not in the same country as you so I do not know how much my account of HL would help.\n\nThe first thing the doctor told me was that it was the \"better\" of the lymphomas to have because of its high survivability rate. Which is odd because, it is still cancer, chemo is chemo and it sucks. He also said he would not recommend freezing my eggs because some who did, had their cancer come back. (I do not know how true it is, I did not look it up. I just thought, \"let us get this over with\". So whatever happens to my eggs, I will have to accept it)\n\nYou can go through the posts here, it helps to read about other people's experiences. What you are feeling is all valid.\n\nWhen I did some research, some articles can be confusing because they lump together all lymphomas into one article and some facts just does not apply to HL. So, just be careful with that, if you ever want to do some research.\n\nOther than that, just reach out to anyone here, me included, if you need to ask anything or talk to someone. I, myself, do not know how much I could help, being in a different country and possibly having different standard procedures to yours, but I can try.\n\nIn any case, feel what you are feeling but do not let it get you down. We are all fighting this. We are with you. Hey there, I can relate to you in terms of mindset and age. I am 18 now battling HL for the second time in 2 years. Stage 3 last year and now relapsed stage 2.\n\nYou are braver than you may think, and you will come to realize that over the course of time. Being afraid is a completely natural reaction. A way that I have coped with it is by being very open and honest with both myself, as well as friends and family. Sometimes it has helped me to write my thoughts out on paper. Getting both the good and bad emotions out has really helped to clear my mind. \n\nNever try to fight alone. It sounds clich\u00e9, but it is the truth. Having people that you can trust with certain things will help to make the journey much smoother. \n\nAs the commenter said above, it may also help if you read through other\u2019s experiences on here. You are bound to find great stories of triumph, as well as the answers to anything you may be curious about regarding HL. \n\nI hope that everything turns out well for you, if you have any questions or just need someone to talk to, feel free to message me or post it here. Best wishes. A good thing is that even if you do have Hodgkin's Lymphoma, it is considered a very curable cancer, with a 95% cure rate overall. (That is including all diagnosed cases, even ones that were discovered in a late stage.) \n\nThe first sign of Hodgkin's is usually a painlessly enlarged lymph node, and the other symptoms often do not appear unless the cancer has become more advanced or has spread. So, it sounds like if you do have Hodgkin's, it has been discovered early, which is a very good thing.  \nIt is also good that you have a doctor who is doing a thorough investigation. \n\nIf you do undergo chemotherapy, you may not need to have any eggs frozen, especially if your Hodgkin's is in an early stage. I am undergoing chemotherapy right now, but my doctors told me that since I will not need to be on chemo for very long, they do not expect me to have any fertility issues. You may find that to be the case with you as well. \n\nYou also may not lose your hair with chemotherapy. In general, only 65% of people who undergo chemo lose their hair, and 45% of people who undergo chemo do not. So, you may be able to keep your long hair even with chemo.  \nMy experience with ABVD chemo (the type of chemo that is often used in my country for Hodgkin's) is that it is not as bad as I worried it would be. I have been on it for about month and a half, and I might only need to be on it for one more month. I get a little nauseous sometimes, my joints ache once in a while, and I have to be careful about the risk of infection, but I can still do everything that I could do before chemo. I chose to shave my hair off, but it turns out that I did not need to do it. While my hair is growing more slowly, most of it has not fallen out. \n\nRegarding your classmates, it is possible that they just do not know how to react. They may not know that you want them to ask how you are. They may think that you do not want to be reminded of what is happening. They are young enough that they may have never had any experience being around someone who is sick. So, it is possible that they do care about how you are doing, but they just do not know how they should show it. \n\nI hope some of this is helpful for you. We are always here for you, on this subreddit (and other subreddits too!). Do not hesitate to DM or post again if you ever need to talk. Thank you for sharing your story. \nGetting to know other\u2019s experiences is helping a lot.\nWishing you the best \ud83d\udc9c Hey. Thanks for your reply and for the advices. \ud83d\udc9c Thank you for writing this.\nChemo is probably the thing that I am most scared of but I am less afraid now that I have read your experience. Thanks also for writing something about my classmates, it made me realise that they are seeing it from a different point of view and they probably do not know how to behave.\nWishing you the best \ud83d\udc9c Getting the chemo itself is not a problem, it is not painful just inconvenient with the amount of time it takes. Mitigating the side effects of chemo is what takes some time and energy. It is mostly dealing with being tired, changing food tastes, constipation, dehydration etc. But once you have got your side effects under control it is really not the worst thing. \n\nYour emotions sound very similar to what mine were going through all of this. I would make sure to talk to you doctor about depression and anxiety that can come from situations like this. Hey, I was diagnosed around age 18 too. Right at the end of high school, worst news I could have gotten. Lump on my collarbone/shoulder, did not even think it could be cancer at first because of odd circumstances. Got a diagnosis, got to work treating it, and 3 years later I am in one piece, minus the biopsied lymph node and a few months of being baldish (Trust me here: It is hard as hell, but lose the hair if/when the loss starts, before it turns into dog shedding.)\n\nDo not be too upset with your parents or your classmates. Your parents are scared, they have just been told you have cancer.   \nYour classmates do not know if they should give you some normalcy and treat you like \\*you\\* or treat you like a cancer patient with concern and \"are you okay\".   \nYour Uncles and Aunts are concerned for your niece.   \nI hate to say this but, do not be too surprised about your cousins, I have a similar amount and expecting them to check on you is probably more than you should unfortunately. Most of them probably hear about it through your aunts and uncles.\n\nOnce you have an oncologist and a plan for chemo and possibly radiation, stick to it. Keep the nausea pills close by and make sure there is a safe place for you to sit, you are going to get tired a lot. Get a lot of plastic or wooden utensils (they make wooden forks/spoons you can use) in case the taste of using metal becomes a deterrent to eating, which it really can. \n\nYou are about to go through a lot. Find all the support you can. Ask your doctors and cancer center about options. Stay safe in all this stuff going on. You can get through this. Thanks for your reply \ud83d\udc9c Diagnosed at 22 and about to quit chemo early, shit sucks Everyone on here has given you such great advice. I just want to add my experience in hopes it comforts you a little. It felt like forever for me to be diagnosed because my first symptoms were night sweats and weight loss. It was not until months later a lymph node showed up in my armpit and it took two biopsies to get the correct information. \n\nIt is very overwhelming to process all the information at first with how many appointments you get scheduled. It is even more overwhelming when you share the news and everyone you have ever met starts asking you questions and sending their thoughts and prayers. But all of that will slow down and it will get boring and routine. \n\nI (29F) have 12 rounds of chemo and have only 5 left for stage 2. After 4 I got another scan and it was clean! Hodgkins is known for being very curable however you will need to be careful with covid and germs. I was hospitalized for a cold for a few days because of how weak our immune systems get. Chemo is not fun BUT it works and it is manageable. Share every single side effect with your nurses they can help you. I spend about 4 days after chemo in bed or on the couch and then everyday after feel like myself and return to work.\n\nAs for hair: I lost mine immediately after my 2nd round of chemo and I have not met anyone who has not lost theirs. I prepared myself by cutting it short before and then shaving it immediately when it started to go and to me it was less traumatic. I rock my bald head more days than I wear a wig! You will be able to have some fun experimenting with wigs, hats and scarves and know it will grow back quickly after.\n\nHang in there and take it day by day. You will get through it and Reddit is a great place for support and advice I am recently diagnosed with HL and documenting my journey on YouTube. Check it out.  I also was diagnosed right around my eighteenth birthday. I was stage 3b and had sixteen rounds of abvd chemotherapy and two months of radiation. I have been free and clear for almost fifteen years.\n\nIf you have any questions or want to talk, please feel free to reach out.\n\nI will be putting out good energy for you. I wish you the best.", "Hodgkin's Survivor might have it again Sup pals, got diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma around this time last year. Beat it in November, yay. Everything's been going pretty well until I noticed a rash  on my foot and I did some googling and it looks like a symptom of HL pretty scared not going to lie. \n\n\nUnrelated Question what is the chance I will get to have kids normally after chemotherapy.\n\nAnyway going to get a check up soon if it is back I will pretty much just had in my resignation letter to god. Hey man, have some faith that you will beat this. You already did once, you can do it again. I was diagnosed stage 4b in 2015. Did 2 (of 6) cycles of ABVD and my scans showed it was already gone! I finished all 6 cycles and my next scan showed it was back. After months of knowing that I was free of HL, beginning to work out again, having high spirits, seeing it come back crushed me. But my Oncologist had another plan, and so did God as I believe. I did 3 cycles of R-ICE, another scan showed it was effective but still present. After a couple more rounds of a 3rd medicine, BV, it was finally gone! My Oncologist wanted to be sure it would not come back... so I did 20 rounds of radiation and had a stem-cell transplant. The whole transplant took 21 days in the hospital, it was a very boring time, but it could have been much worse. I was blessed to not have many severe side effects. This all finished in April 2016, before my wife and I got married. In November 2019 we welcomed our son, after being told numerous times, and tested numerous times, we would be infertile. I thank God for my family. Maybe one day you will too. Message if you have any questions, we are here to encourage you! My elder brother too has been diagnosed with it. In my opinion for total eradication one needs to supplement the chemo and radiation with the budwig protocol. The information is all available on the internet but I will be happy to assist directly via dm This helped me out a lot mentally man, I have got my scan and appointments in the next couple of days I will let you guys know how it goes, and about the fertility it is probably my biggest fear much more of a fear than having cancer itself but I will talk too my doctor tomorrow about fertility tests. Much love Do not heed this advice from snsred. HL is very curable with the proven treatments administered by reputable hospitals. Alternative treatments are not only unproven, but can even hinder the effects of conventional chemo and radiation.\n\nIt is normal to freak out any time a new symptom pops up after you have gone into remission. Until you get past the five-year mark, you might always worry. But a rash may not indicate you have relapsed. Good luck and do not listen to snsred. Hang in there. You may just be stressed from the anticipation of your upcoming scans. That is normal. Best wishes.", "Question about bloods I do have a few swollen lynpnodes. One golf ball size. I got my bloods done 4 days ago and it came back normal.\n\nDoes that rule out cancer or is there still a possibility of having it ? Go see a doctor! I did! He ordered a X-ray and bloods. I have done both of them and I have still to get my appointment with the ENR.\n\nI just do not know if I am safe cause my bloods came back normal. The results for the x-ray have still to come back. My bloods were normal and I still was diagnosed with lymphoma What stage were you diagnosed with ?  4. But prognosis is good. Do not rely on blood tests though. Thank you for responding! Hi Elk, I have not had a scan yet. But my bloods came back normal and my x ray came back normal which gives me hope but I still have a big lump.\n\nJust got a letter in today confirming my date for the ENT on March 25th. The waiting times are so long.", "Groin lymph nodes I am a Female, 34, healthy, normal weight. I have had an enlarged right inguinal lymph node since Sept 2018, went to the dr and was told its small, not irregular shaped, and that i probably only felt because im thin, not to worry. I went back in October, for a different reason, but casually mentioned the node. Again, not to worry. I went back a third time in Dec and bloodwork and ultrasound ordered. Bloodwork came back normal except positive ANA, so more was ordered, I am awaiting results. Ultrasound report as follows:  \nexamination of the right groin demonstrates visualization of a hypoechoic complex ovoid structure measuring 0.8x0.7x2.5cm, a second similar hypoechoic lesion measuring 0.8x0.8x0.3cm, a third similar architectual characteristics measuring 1.0x0.69x0.2cm and a fourth lesion measuring 0.6x0.6x0.5cm are seen in the right groin. Lesions demonstrate some elements of central vascularity. Overall, lesions demonstrate an overall reniform shape. The appearance is compatible with multiple right inguinal nodes bilaterally enlarged. Impression: findings compatible with multiple mildly enlarged right inguinal nodes as discussed above. No other soft tissue lesions or masses. \nI asked to be referred for biopsy. I have an appointment with a general surgeon next week. Does this ultrasound report sound worrisome? I am not and have not been sick at all, so these seem to be enlarged for no reason. I do not have any other symptoms; I feel perfectly fine. Not a doctor, cannot give you medical advice but...  Given your age and the fact that you are a female hodgkins seems unlikely.  Good luck with the biopsy! Thank you. I am very worried. I guess I will just have to wait this out until Wednesday. I really hope they will do the biopsy then, but I am betting since this is my first appointment with this general surgeon, and he is never seen the report or ultrasound disc, I will be given a second appointment for biopsy. This is so frustrating, I just want this thing, whatever it is, out of me, now!!! Hey OP, what happened?  Just curious... I saw the surgeon. He ordered a ct scan with contrast. It showed no signs of lymphadenopathy, all sub centimeter lymph nodes of no significance. He told me to wait a month or so and see if it goes down and if not then we might consider biopsy. I can still feel it, in a couple more weeks it will be a month, so I do not know. It is so strange that an ultrasound and ct scan showed such different results! The only thing I had done between the two scans was take a round of doxycycline. I wonder if I had some kind of infection that I did not know about and that shrunk it down that much? Who knows! I was just glad with good results, but it is still in the back of my mind because it had not completely gone away yet. \ud83d\ude15 Glad you are ok.  Cancer does not generally shrink but lymph nodes do swell for a million reasons.", "Got biopsy results today Hi everyone.  I just made a new account because I had posted on my other one how I was having prolonged lymphadenopathy form my Covid vaccine and I was sure that is what it was.  Guess what\u2026Nodular Sclerosis Classical Hodgkins Lymphoma.  Biopsy results back today.  I am reeling a little bit, particularly because now that it is the weekend I cannot even get an appointment scheduled with an oncologist, let alone figure out what is going on.  Just when Covid was almost over and I could look forward to all the plans I was making, here we go\u2026. I am so sorry for the bad news. Sending all the good juju your way. It is so so so hard in the beginning when you are still finding out info/trying to scramble to get what you need. Hang in there. You got this, and you e got this whole forum behind you cheering you on. I hope it gets better from here. Take your time to process this. You will be okay.  It will be ok. I agree with the take time to process comment. \n\nRemember that it is not a death sentence, and it does not have to completely take you away from your life during treatment. This group and others can provide lots of advice to make the side effects of chemo easier to manage and live with. I am honestly so sorry you have to go through this I am in a similar boat. But fortunately for us if you are going to have to get a cancer this is the one to get. Odds of living a normal life are 90-95%. However if you want to have kids later you should look into saving eggs /sperm now. I let it slide by in my haste to get treated, but I am also 42 and had already decided that if I have kids they will likely come with the relationship or be adopted. I will be 40 in 2 weeks and my kids are 3 &amp; 5 and thankfully our family is complete.  My boss is awesome and already ready to be flexible and we laughed a little about how since we are still working from home the timing is decent (we are pretty dark and twisty).  We are just going to figure it out and in the meantime I am going to look for cute short haircuts Well I am already bald so nothing to lose there. But I have had the same facial hair since I was 15, so that will take a bit of getting used to if/when I start loosing facial hair. \n\nMy job has been awesome. They were talking about promoting me to management beforehand and after making sure it was still what I want they stayed with it. It should actually work better for me and give me more flexibility to assist the other developers instead of being responsible for the development myself. That is great!  It will end up that you come out of your treatment ahead of where you went in and not feel like your world has entirely stopped. I know this is an older post, but can you tell me your story? I am going on 9 months of swollen lymph nodes since my vaccine. I have had bloodwork and ultrasounds and they keep telling me I am fine. The node under my armpit was bigger in ultrasound #1 and had gotten smaller by ultrasound #2. Now I feel them in my neck and my skin is rashy on my abdomen. I am freaking out, of course! I saw an ent to get a biopsy and now I am 5 out of 12 chemo treatments in and seeing a great response.  I was stage 3 and have/had? Two 6cm masses in my chest and a couple of hot spots in my abdomen.  It is super treatable if you get started on treatment.  Took all the way to biopsy to show anything significantly wrong Thanks for responding. I do not feel any lumps. It is just tender under my arm pits, at first. Now off and on my neck lymph nodes hurt. I can not feel any lumps. It is so frustrating. I also have a rash on my stomach. I am scared and so anxious about it. \nI am so glad you are responding so well to treatments!", "Bump is still kind of there is this the same for anyone else? Hello guys! I am a couple months on remission for stage 2 HL and my bump has definitely gotten smaller but it is still there, barely visible but with enough attention it can be seen. The bump is on my neck btw, does anyone share the same trouble? Is it normal for the bump to kind be there? Sometimes scar tissue can develop in and around the lymphs that used to have hodgkin in them. At least in my case it never 100% went back to how it looked and felt before and the doctor told me that that is probably because of the scar tissue. Yep I have the same. I am 5 years post chemo. Scar tissue they tell me.", "Need Suggestions Wife 35(F) has been diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma, stage 2a.\nWe have a newborn, 2 months now.\nDoctor has suggested chemo, without radiation and has asked us to chose between the 2 drugs combo\n\nABVD and AAVD\n\nWhich one should we opt for? We are looking into all the details everywhere we can find it. I am only sharing my experience and not suggesting which one you should do (I do not know enough). I am also stage 2 and am doing 12 rounds of chemo, no radiation. I did ABVD for my first 4 then at my 2 month scan I had a clean scan so they dropped the bleo and moved me to just AVD. My doctor would have kept bleo in if my scan was not clean. It is common for bleo to cause lung and breathing issues (amongst others) so I know people are eager to remove it. Since dropping B my side effects of chemo are not as harsh and recovery has been quicker. I have 3 treatments left. I do not regret choosing my route and trust my doctor knows what is best for my situation. Best of luck to you all! I feel your pain.  I also had HL, 2 a  at 36 and was diagnosed when my first born was 5 months old.  He is 5 now and I am still here and in remission.\nFeel free to ask me anything.\n\nI second the no radiation. The side effects do not justify the means and chances are she has tumors in her chest and you do not want to damage her heart or breast tissue. Also AAVD works well and studies show you do not need the bleomyacin. Just from my experience...lymphoma is slow growing. My doctor suggested radiation to make sure that all of the cancer was gone. I did have the node removed before. He said  chemo was too fast and would leave some cells behind that radiation  would not. I have not had any side effects except a bit of my beard fell out. It has since come back. Thanks a lot that helps a lot. Nice to hear that you are doing good and wish you a speedy recovery.  That Is an interesting take from your doctor, from what I am aware Classic Hodgkin\u2019s is generally very aggressive (although takes to treatment extremely well) which is why it is treatment is one of the more aggressive types (along with breast cancer treatment). I have also had NLPHL which is a slow growing form of Hodgkin\u2019s, and chemo still works well on this as well. If the cancer is only in one area and caught quickly then radiotherapy can work well but if it is spread further then chemo would be recommended I had NLPHL, did catch it early. Stage 1. His logic was that it being rather slow that an aggressive treatment may leave some cells behind opening a door for new cancers. I agree for stage 1 NLPHL just radiotherapy makes complete sense! I had stage 3 NLPHL and had chemo but the chemo for NLPHL is much more gentle than for classic. \nI am assuming OPs wife has classic as abvd/aavd are standard treatments for it, I had abvd myself when I had stage 2a classic  My local oncologist and the head of oncology at the Sarah Cannon research center in Nashville both recommended AAVD. The long term risks is much lower and if she starts to have neuropathy symptoms they can drop or lower the second A. Thanks. I got an appointment at Mayo clinic as well for second opinion. I will discuss it with the oncologist. As far as I know AAVD is not approved for stage 2A.\n\nIf the disease is not bulky treatment can be administered as ABVDx3 (RAPID protocol) or ABVDx4 (CALGB protocol) both with excellent outcomes. Depending on the location of the disease radiation is a good fallback in case of an incomplete response. If the disease is early-favorable can even be treated with ABVDx2+RT.\n\nFor stage III/IV disease AAVD has a marginal advantage over ABVD of 5-10% in long term remission (=cure) at the cost of more toxicity. Outside of clinical trials I opt for AAVD but am very light on the trigger to switch to ABVD/AVD.\n\nA second opinion with Mayo is a good idea.\n\nErel Joffe MD  \nLymphoma Service  \nMemorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center  \n\\* Comments are meant for educational purposes only and should not be regarded medical advice.  \nr/Lymphoma_MD_Answers Thanks a lot Not completely suggesting what choice you should make at all as obviously I am not a doctor but this is my experience if it helps at all in any way.\n\nI had Stage 2E and was given BEACOP-Dac x2 and ABVD x2. I was 20 at the time though (now nearly 22) so they thought I was more able to withstand this kind of treatment. But my oncologist said this was the best way to treat what I had, but to be able to cut radiotherapy from my treatment plan (radiotherapy has breast cancer risks so we wanted to avoid that if we could as it would mostly have been directed at my chest area.)\n\nI showed good response half way through and was in remission by the end of treatment.\n\nI would really just make sure if you can to research all your options, get second opinions if that is possible and weigh up the differences between different treatments and long term effects etc. and cure rates so you have all the information to make a decision with. I (F 31) was also recently diagnosed with HL (stage 4) and I have a 2 month old! I am doing AAVD because my doctor believes I am young enough to handle the regimen and it has proven to reduce chance of relapse.  He referenced Echelon Study's positive results. Only 1.5 cycles in so I cannot report on effectiveness but my body has been handling it well", "F*** Covid 19!! My husband is 23 and we have been married for a little over a year and during that year he was diagnosed with stage 3B HL. This is his second time having cancer so I know he can make it through it. He is finished his main part of chemo and he is getting ready to go through a stem cell transplant. And he is going to have to stay at that hospital and around the hospital for about 2 months. Well I was going to be able to stay down there with him that way he will have support but since the Covid 19 is going around I cannot be down there with him to hold his hand while he is going through this. Any suggestions oh how to handle being alone in the house while he is gone? I am used to him always being here or me being with him. We have no kids and we limit visitors since it is also flu season. Cause I do not want to get sick and I do not want him sick.", "Symptoms but no diagnosis Hi all,\n\nI have recently become concerned that I may have Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. Over the past 3 years or so I have noticed that if I have drank a fair amount of alcohol, then the next day I will have a very tender pain under my arms, in my chest, in my neck and up to my hairline. In addition to this, I have a lump under my right armpit which swells when I have been drinking. \nI went to the doctors about this in 2017 and had blood tests, where I was told I had some elevated levels (I cannot remember what, I wrote it down on my phone and have since lost that phone) which indicate there might be something going on, but were not high enough to warrant further tests, I was told to be retested regularly. \nAround 2 months ago I got concerned after I noticed the lump was consistently bigger and went to my GP. I had blood tests, an ultrasound of my stomach and liver and an ultrasound of the lump. None of which have come back with anything. \nI have now been left with no follow up (mainly due to covid-19) but I am really concerned because I have read lymphoma can only be diagnosed with a biopsy. Does anyone have a similar experience? Or have any suggestions of what I do next? My dad had Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma before I was born and I am really concerned \nThanks! It can only be *diagnosed* with a biopsy, but it can be *detected* in many ways before that - blood tests, ultra sounds, and sometimes CT scans are the main ways (as well as simply observing with the naked eye if the swelling is bad enough). Two thoughts for you: First, lymphoma is a big jump to make just from tender lymph nodes. If you do not have other symptoms (drenching night sweats, etc.) I would not draw that conclusion, especially since this has gone on for so long and everything has come back clear. Second, if you are unsatisfied with your doctor's response you could always see a new doctor. A second opinion never hurts if it will calm your nerves. Realistically you need a CT scan followed by a biopsy to be 100% sure. During the process of getting diagnosed my blood tests showed high CRP levels (indicative of inflammation) and I had an enlarged lymph node as well as fatigue and night sweats. The pain after drinking alcohol is actually considered an obscure symptom and is not very common. I would keep an eye on the enlarged lymph node and keep a symptom diary to go over with your doctor. May be worth getting a 2nd opinion too if you are concerned.", "What was your most interesting moment while going through treatment? I was diagnosed at 18, and have been in remission for 18 years (36yo now). I dont remember much during the treatments, aside from the nausea, but one moment really stuck with me.\n\nDuring my second PET scan, I expressed concern about the radioactive sugar. I asked the radiologist if there was anything I should avoid, and he told me to \"go hang out with people you do not like\".\n\nNothing serious, but I still chuckle at it. I often wonder if he became a supervillain or something. I got free Chipotle burritos multiple times because the cashier was \"inspired\" by me. Lol\n\nAlso age 18, during diagnostics the bone density scan technician tried to set me up with his grandson. My dad was there and I had a boyfriend so I was able to evade that one pretty quickly. \n\nEdit: Amazing to learn you have been in remission for so long! I am at 10 years remission but still feel like it could end at any second. It gives me hope to know you have made it so long.\n\nEdit 2: Added blurb about scan technician. Scanxiety is real! Every time I have to go to a drs appointment I worry. I think that it comes with the territory.\n\nOne of my moms old coworkers made it to 40 years remission at last check, do you go to any of the \"light the night\" events that the LLS (Leukemia and Lymphoma Society) hosts? That Is a great time and you get to meet lots of survivors. When I first started treatment I was in the cancer hospital for pretty much a whole month.\nOne night a nurse came running into my room and was like \u201cno way! I saw the name and birthdate and knew it had to be you\u201d\nTurns out one of my best friends from high school that I has not spoken to in over 10 years works as a nurse there now.\nShe stayed on as my nurse throughout my treatment, it was great reconnecting again even under the crappy circumstances. That is awesome you got to reconnect!", "Sun exposure after radiation I am 4 months post radiation for NLPHL. I am always outside and love to fish. Went out fishing for a couple hours yesterday and came home with chills, went out again today for maybe 30 minutes again with the chills. No pain, no sunburn. Anybody else had this happen? I did not have radiation but ABVD. It took me about a year to go out in the sun without chills. Then another few years before my skin felt \u201cnormal\u201d. I felt like I had fresh baby skin the first year of two. No pain or burn but my skin got hot and I would feel feverish. Sounds the same, thanks. Do you have any pigment damage? I have brown marks on my arms from the chemo. I do not I have rhino virus. I had both ABVD and Radiation, I had issues while in treatment and I remember my eyes were really sensitive to sunlight for a while after. I did not go outside enough to see if my skin was, but my newly shaved head definitely was not happy.", "Notice a lymph node? ", "What is the average growth speed of Hodgkin's lymphoma? Hi guys i am 16 and have been diagnosed with classic Hodgkin's lymphoma. The thing is we are considering an ayurvedic treatment , but it is getting delayed due to covid -19 \n Caused lockdowns. Can someone tell me wether if waiting a week is safe or not so then we commence the chemotherapy.\nAlso just for you guys  ,the ayurvedic one is quite renounced . Seems like you are going to wait a week at least between diagnosis and chemo. I was diagnosed a week ago, and still am doing some of the things required to start chemo. Some people take months to get from diagnosis to treatment. I do not know how fast it grows, though. Hopefully someone else will answer that, because I want to know too. I am not sure exactly how fast it grows either, but I remember when I was sick it was a 2 month gap between finding out and actually starting chemo so a week should not hurt. You got this little warrior !!! My messages are always open to you if you have any questions or just need a friend who gets it. :) Thanks. Needed that I was stage 3 at diagnosis and the doctor advised it was fine for me to take the 4 weeks needed for me to undergo fertility preservation treatment. I had nodular sclerosing classical Hodgkin's lymphoma. Hi friend! Sorry to hear that! In 23 and just got diagnosed yesterday! Natural treatment will help tame the symptoms and bring your immune system ready to fight. I would say start your auyvedic treatment now and keep it consistent before chemo. I have been taking turmeric everyday since I found out I MIGHT have it so it would help you to man! Well thanks for the support and advice . But just turmeric, is better applied as a cream on your face. Try finding 'tulsi' leaves And just just gobble 2 daily. They are excellent immune system boosters. Since you do take turmeric everyday, you might follow this. And one last thing , the thing is I am preferring this ayurvedic treatment because it saves my body from all the bad effects of chemotherapy . It is renounced to have cured patients who were declared uncurable by the current medical science. Nice meeting you. Sorry to hear about your diagnosis. I was diagnosed at 23 and am now 29. It can be a very confusing and definitely overwhelming situation especially when you are so young. I had conventional treatments and a clinical trial and I am now cancer free after my second bone marrow transplant. Just to share a little of my experience, I did a lot of research into natural and complementary practices and in my opinion there is no substitute for conventional medicine, plenty of fluids, exercise, and a well balanced diet. If you are shying away from chemo because of something you read on the internet I strongly suggest you do more research. I had a rough go but Hodgkins is very treatable and there are very few things I would have done differently knowing what I do now. Also it may be a good idea to check out clinical trials. Recently there has been a lot of trials trying to incorporate brentuximab into initial treatments to limit toxicities. Just as one example. But good luck to you and if anyone would like to reach out I would be more than happy to help in any way I can. Cheers. Thanks! Good to have someone i can reach out to Brother, get well soon, you are not meant to be in bed for long. You and likes of yours, the young bloods, are needed in the field.\u0935\u0940\u0930 \u092d\u094b\u0917\u094d\u092f \u0935\u0938\u0941\u0902\u0927\u0930\u093e Hey thanks alot. Did you just look up my history? I chatted with you in chodi i guess. Lol.\nDo not worry. Kamine log asani se nahi marte. Aur mai bhi kamina hun. Of course brother, I did, and who said you going to die, it is highly curable.I said get well soon.", "Abdominal pain side effect? Hi, I completed my first round of Brentuximab + AVD last week for stage 3S HL (yay spleen!) It went really well...almost too well. I have had few side effdcfs except some fatigue, restlessness, indigestion, and mild nausea. I am pretty on top of my nausea meds though. I  concerned it is going to get worse...but trying to avoid those thoughts for now.\n\nI have noticed that I do get some pretty intense abdominal pain...feels like a mix of gas and cramping. Sometimes it subsides, other times its so bad it wakes me up at night and is hard to fall back asleep. I do not feel the urge to vomit or go to the bathroom...the pain just sits at the base of my diaphragm.\n\nAny advice? Any thoughts? Is this the chemo/MAB or is it a response to some of the oral meds? Is it the cancer? Most importantly, how do I manage it?\n\nThanks in advance.  Please talk to your oncologist about what you are experiencing, they would be way more qualified to help you. :) Yeah, of course I will do that. But considering this is likely a side effect, I am curious about others experiences with it and potential solutions they have found...otherwise, what is the point of this group if you all just refer everyone back to their MD? I do not mind helping with side effects the MD thing is to keep people without a diagnosis coming in here asking if it is HL all the time. \n\n\nI had pain down in that region and it was constipation. Like bad. Started Miralax and Senecot and that got rid of it. Could that be the cause of your pain? I was wondering about that. I did have 5 bowel movements yesterday morning though...have been taking senecot since day two fearing constipation, and have been pretty regular. Today though it is been not as productive. I may try some miralax tonight and see if that helps. Thanks stranger. No problem! Abdominal pain and diarrhea or constipation are quite common side effects of A-AVD (25-35%) each. If very bothersome your oncologist can switch to AVD and add the Brentuximab at the end or switch to ABVD/AVD (just delay the ABVD a bit as bleomycin and brentuximab do not play well together). They can also try to decrease the dose of BV per protocol (I do not like it much for various reasons beyond the scope of this discussion).\n\nErel Joffe MD\nLymphoma Service\nMemorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center\n* comments are for educational purposes only and should not be regarded medical advice Thank you for your response! Definitely alleviating to know its likely a side effect. Took some pain meds last night which really helped sleep, but do not want to have to rely on that route. I will discuss these options with my oncologist on Monday at next treatment.\n\nWe are trying to avoid bleomycin due to its risk to the lungs. But good to know there are options if the pain worsens cumulatively as I go through this. I am in a clinical trial but also have had some bad stomach pains, hemp oil and other CBD products really helped!", "My lymph nodes grew during my second chemo trip.please advice or any similar cases and what to do. Hey there. I was diagnosed with classical lymphoma in February and since then have been on chemotherapy. My second PET scan showed a singular 3.6\u00d76.3cm lymph node in chest region. This was after total 6 chemos. Then i had 4 more, which i completed on August 29. I had my PET scan again and now it shows  increase in the size and also increased splenic index. Please tell me anything you know of such cases ,and if possible please guide me. I have my 12th midterms from 19th September abd dang i am trying to manage. The report was heartbreaking, but not the time to cry . Can anyone explain what us splenic index and whatdoes an increase mean? Mine swole up between two sessions a bit. I told my doctor and she said it will be fine. \n\nNow I do not know about your case so you should probably just ask your doctor that question. But know that being worried is only going to make you feel worse. Thanks Are you feeling better? Not worried but not any better either. Looking it up or asking about it if online will probably only intensify your worry. Mine came back immediately after I was done with chemo...and here I am 7 years later. There are options if that actually did not work. So calm down. I know that is just about impossible but give it a go. Ok thanx", "Support groups?? I am having a hard time finding a support group. Diagnosed with stage 2 HL 10 days ago. I feel terrible venting to terminal patients about my curable cancer, but also want to talk to people about undergoing chemo and what it is all going to entail. So far, ABVD seems like it is going to be pretty easy to tolerate. Does anyone have any experiences with this? How about any knowledge of cold caps to prevent hair loss (or did you even have any)? Happy cake day! I am sorry about your news. It depends what kind of support you are looking for, you might find reddit can be very encouraging, helpful, or distracting. I think something about being in a support group is that it should not matter how severe, new, curable your case is, but you should be there to help each other. That is something that a terminal patient might have to personally deal with. I understand where you are coming from, I felt like I was cheating cancer because I could still be active and did not have many side effects. I had ABVD every 2 weeks for 6 months, I think that is 12 cycles. Some people still go to work while they are on it. Most of the side effects can be premeditated. I am not sure if you are going to get the booster shot 24 hours after a cycle, I did after the first cycle. It knocked me on the ground (fatigue) for a couple days after but I only got it once. At the hospital I was at for the remainder of my treatment they said it was not necessary. Or was not in their protocol. Hey man, tell me about yourself. I am a senior in college in Iowa who is in remission from S4 HL. I play rugby and study sales at school. I love life and if you need someone to vent to pm me for my Snapchat and number. I feel the same way! Like I have cancer, but I am cheating it. Like I am getting off \u201ceasy\u201d relative to others. And you make a good point about the support groups. All I know is this cancer feels like an invasion of my personal space like I have never felt before or knew was possible My hair started falling out on the day of my second dose. A few days later it was coming out very quickly. I just shaved it off and was done with it. Did you also use ABVD? How did you cope with losing your hair? I had A+AVD, so instead of Bleo I had brentuximub. Honestly I just figured losing my hair was inevitable so when it started coming out I just took the initiative and got it over with.  I made a YouTube video series on my entire treatment and one of the videos is where I shaved it off. About 3/4 through the treatment I was taken off the Brentuximub and then it started growing back a bit. I am in 2 support groups specifically for HL on fb and honestly they were a god send while going through it!!!! \nBut I agree, while I was in it (in May 2016 I was diagnosed stage 2b and did ABVD no rads) my onc gave me info to a local cancer support group. But I was 24, so my concerns and problems were definitely not the same as the 60 yr olds in there. So I voiced my opinion to a lady helping run the group, she started a \u201cyoung people\u2019s cancer support group\u201d and I thought it was awesome, til I showed up and everyone was 35-45 yrs old. Thanks \ud83d\ude1e\nBut I have been in remission since June 2017, last scan was a yr ago, and I am due for another but the health care system is a fucking scam and I cannot afford copays. I digress. \n\nI would also like to tell you, do NOT get ahead of yourself babe. ABVD chemo gives hodgkins such a great prognosis rate because it is so fucking brutal. You will have bad days and good days. On my bad days, I felt like I got slammed between a semi truck and a brick wall. And on good days, I cried, a lot. They never prepare you for the mental turmoil you will endure through this. So keep that in mind. \n\nBest of luck in everything babe!!! And seriously, go find those support groups on fb. Just search Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. Some really great and amazing people in there!!\n\nI would also like to add sorry if this looks funny, I am on mobile lol. And yes I was losing my hair from the beginning but only small bits. After my second dose a whole bunch was coming out. My son who was 5 at the time asked me why I always cried as I was picking up my hair from everywhere and if my hair made me this sad why I did not cut it all off. I was getting my head shaved within the next 30mins. It was hard being bald sure, as women we tend to use our hair as an extension of our being and think it tells others who we are. But man it is just hair, it grows back. Wear a wig in the mean time. American cancer society will provide you with a free wig too. My hair started growing back extra curly. Like REALLY REALLY CURLY. Now I am 3yrs post my last chemo, and my hair is long, not really curly anymore. But you could not even tell I was bald 3yrs ago lol. And yes I have gotten a few trims since then. THANK YOU!! This is super helpful. Did you find that the side effects got worse with each dose? It is so hard to find support groups. I am 30  stage 4  and so freaking new and overwhelmed but positive but I feel like an experiment as things start to happen. I have had first chemo and feeling symptoms a week later I also am abvd and every 2 weeks  for 6 months.", "What day of the week to get Chemo My wife is starting her chemo. What day of the week she should chose.\nShe works in Information Technology.\n\nShe will be getting 6 dose of ABVD. Whatever works best for her schedule\n\nA Thursday or Friday infusion may be ideal if she plans to work through treatment, so she can recover over the weekend. \n\nI would get my ABVD and then after a negative pet AVD every other Tuesday. I honestly never even considered what day I received an infusion because regardless of the day one receives chemo it will have the timeline for side effects is the same. \n\nFirst few days very fatigued then after a week most sides can be managed fairly well given the circumstances. I got ABVD and had six rounds too. I went on Thursday because I was interested in working at the beginning of my treatment. It worked out well for me. By the second weekend (off week) I was not feeling like total trash and would be able to go to church and while I was working it was good to have the Friday and the weekend to recover. \n\nFor what it is worth, Friday\u2019s were not actually all that bad, it was Saturday and Sunday that I really started to feel the effects of mouth sores and sensitivity with food the most. As long as I slept in for a long time on those three days the next week was not awful. Your wife\u2019s miles may vary on those types of things tho. I had mine on Wednesdays. I was pretty wiped out for the rest of that week after Wednesday but the rest of the week moving in to the next one gave me a bit of time to feel a bit better before the next infusion.\n\nIt really depends on how bad you feel and whether you are planning to work through it as well, there might be an easier day to pick to fit around a work schedule. Hi, I am currently in treatment (only 2 left of my 12) and receive AVD (started with ABVD). I have worked throughout and get my chemo on Friday\u2019s. I am able to return to work by that following Wednesday or sometimes even that Tuesday. I had 6 rounds of a clinical trial that included the A+D of ABVD and 2 immunotherapies. Personally my worst days were days 4-5 post chemo so after my first couple of rounds I switched my infusions from Thursday to Tuesday. Im a student so my schedule was a little more flexible than most but felt good enough to go to class Thursdays and Friday\u2019s. Definitely stay flexible! Second this. I worked it out with my employer that I would get a Thursday infusion (ABVD), take a long weekend and be back on Monday.\n\nI did notice that after the midpoint, the cumulative toxicity started getting a little more difficult to deal with, so I ended up asking for more time to recover (I returned on Tuesday).\n\nWith that said. Everyone responds differently to the treatment. I knew some people who never seemed phased by ABVD, and others were quite ill and had routine visits to the ED after infusions. I do not think that is normal or expected, but you and your wife should be prepared to be flexible with her work schedule if needed. My suggestion would be a Friday if she is still planning to work.\n\nI did my infusions on Friday at \\~12pm (8 doses of ABVD). I worked full time (and mostly remote) through treatment, and only took off half days for the chemo infusion day. She could then recover over the weekend, and likely be up for working the following Monday. \n\nThis schedule meant I was giving my weekends up for recovery during infusions, but then did not have to entirely consume by couple weeks of PTO I had available during treatment. If her work schedule is different, then I would suggest adapting accordingly. I found that if your taking steroids for a couple of days after a treatment. You will feel pretty good till you stop. I.e. I was taking dexa. For 3 days after a treatment, so my worst days were the days that followed that. \nJust information. My treatments were on Wednesday and my worst days starting Sunday-next Wednesday. Then I would feel pretty good the second week before the next treatment. \n\nHope this helps. Good luck and power through. You got it. One thing I have learned is that everyone responds quite differently to treatment. My chemo is on Tuesdays (2 more left). Through most of my treatment Friday's have been the worst days for me, but lately it is been either Thursday or Friday, but even on these days I can work a little.\n\nMy advice is do not fret too much about when you get treated. I was trying to time it so I could work too, but in the end they put me on Tuesdays and I did not think twice about it, I wanted to start treatment asap. Had I chosen Friday -- as I wanted to -- I would be having my worst day on Monday.", "Stage 4 Classic Hodgkins Lymphoma. Hello, my name is Carson and I was diagnosed with stage 4 Classic Hodgkins Lymphoma in August, 2020. I had been experiencing horrible night sweats, fevers that would come and go and I had a cough that would not go away. I had been dealing with these symptoms for a three month period. Each time I tried to see A doctor, I was tested for Covid-19 and sent home to quarantined for two weeks. After the third negative test my wife decided to rush me to the ER. It was there, after an X-ray of my lungs, that they found the lymphoma. After the lung X-ray, I received a CAT scan and the results showed that I had lesions, in the words of the doctor, \u201c...All over you body.\u201d. That night we drove to Providence Sacred Heart Hospital in Spokane, WA so I could be seen by a specialist. My diagnosis was confirmed. I also learned that a portion of my spine had been completed overtaken by the lymphoma and the symptoms I was experiencing are called B symptoms. I received my first round of chemotherapy at the hospital and released shorty after. I continued to receive chemotherapy at a local clinic and after the second cycle I went in for a PET scan to see how the lymphoma was responding to the chemo. The results of the PET showed that all prior lesion had disappeared, even what was found in my spine. I had gone into remission. Given the extent of the lymphoma, it was hard to believe that just after two cycles it was gone. But it truly was. I received my last round of A+AVD chemo on January 5th, 2021. I am due for a PET scan sometime in March. We are keeping our fingers crossed that I am still in the clear. Recently, I have been experiencing night sweats again. I will been taking to my Oncologist about that. Otherwise, we remain hopeful. I hope whoever might read this gains something from it. This group here is awesome. Reading other\u2019s stories and the support being spread is something beautiful. Especially in these trying times. I wish the best for all! So I randomly came across this searching for something on all posts related to covid and something over came to read this. But just wanted to say I am really glad you are in remission, stay strong! This will give hope to people! Hope you are okay, sending all my love and strenght &lt;3 I am happy you came across it! Thanks for your kind words! I am going well! Thank you so much!", "Ugh prednisone again... I have a strong history of acid reflux and for that reason I do not take any NSAIDS. I started RCHOP on 7/9 which includes prednisone. This is a very strong anti-inflammatory and caused my reflux to act up so bad it landed me in the hospital! It also caused so much inflammation and acid in my GI tract that my hemorrhoids were burning! Anyone else have this issue? If so, did they offer an alternative? I am terrified of my next round of prednisone as I have been out of commission for the past week and as if I fell into a burning ring of fire!!!!!!! Sorry it is hitting so hard. Prilosec otc was enough for me for whatever that acidy burning sensation was. Man! It is not even touching it. :-(", "How to support someone with HL Hi everyone, \n\nA friend of mine was diagnosed with HL yesterday.\nShe is being super strong/mature about it all considering she is 22.\n\nI was wondering if anyone could let me know what they found helpful while going through this extremely hard time.\nFor example, things you appreciated that people said (things that annoyed you); items that make the process easier, etc.\n\nI have supported family members through cancer in the past; but every type is so different and brings different symptoms/challenges.\n\nPS: she is been coughing a lot since there is pressure on her lungs; I have been searching for something that could maybe help soothe that? \n\nI am trying my best not to ask dumb questions, but I just want to be as helpful and supportive as I can. Most of the articles I am reading more medical/scientific and less on the human side.\n\nAny insight at all would be soooo appreciated.\n\nThanks, I would suggest sitting with your friend during an infusion  or two if they are open to that.  Bring some magazines, candies etc.  \n\nIf she is coughing from the pressure it is probably due to the masses in her chest so that will go away once the chemo starts to work hopefully. \n\n\nYou will want to help keep her healthy, I remember someone gave me some fun smelling hand sanitizers and lotions.  \n\nNutrition is so important during chemo.  Keeping her fed and hydrated is key.  If you can think of some healthy foods and drink it will benefit her overall well being. \n\nIDK, everyone is so different in their journey.  Just stay tuned in to your friend  you will know what to do. The fact that you are concerned enough to post here says so much about they type of support you will provide! Ask your friend what she needs, what she feels. She will try to explain it to you but will not succeed. Make sure she is the most comfortable she can be! Tell her she is going to get through it, even if you do not believe she will. Tell her she is so strong. If you assist to any of her chemo treatments, you can play with her head/hair. Rub her back. Ask her if she needs anything. \n\nI was diagnosed with Hodgkin Lymphoma when I was 19, and I have to admit it is a pretty selfish disease. You do not care about anything else but your comfort. So make sure you are not talking too much or annoying her. Keep things calm, make her laugh. \n\nBe excited for her! Every time she finishes a treatment encourage her and congratulate her, and have a countdown!!!! Eg. You have 11 treatments left!!!!\n\nIt is not an easy thing to support someone who has Hodgkin! You will have to pretend a lot and hide your fear. You cannot show your friend that you are worried, or scared or sad! You have to be nothing but positive, even if you have to pretend. It will help her a lot!\n\nGod bless! Good luck with everything and I hope your friend goes through this with ease! Hi. I was also 22 when I was diagnosed with HL in December 2016 and after 6 months of chemo and 1 month of radio, I am cancer free now. I am glad your friend is being strong. More power and strength to her. \nI had a real bad case of cough and I remember no amount of medication helped but nebulizer. My surgeon nebulised me after my biopsy surgery and that was the ultimate cure for my cough. \nI was on steroids to stop my menses so that I do not bleed and lose blood in addition to the blood loss my body was going through because of chemo. Those steroids increased my appetite and made me gain weight. And when I was told by the people who used to come to visit me that I do not look ill or when they expected me to not eat because apparently my appetite should die, it was very annoying. Please do not tell someone they do not look ill when they are. Something is eating up our bodies from inside, be sensitive. I had also not lost all of my hair which was a major surprise for most people. Everyone is body is different, the last thing you should be doing to a sick person is telling them that others have it worse or their journey is easier. Everyone is threshold for pain differs. Cancer is not an easy fight but it does not have to be a very difficult one for it to be worthy.\nThe things that helped me the most throughout my fight were the unconditional support from my friends and family. I will be forever grateful to them for being there for me like they did. It is our fight and our own, but it really really helps when we know our dear ones have our back. I daily played board games with my family, they were there for all my chemo sessions, I was well fed and was reminded to take my meds on time. These were the things that made the fight so damn easier for me. \nHodgkin's Lymphoma has a very good prognosis. I am sure your friend will be super healthy super soon. All the warm wishes from my side. My daughter (24) just finished treatment for HL in June. One tip that she passed on to other\u2019s starting chemo was to have a mint to suck on or gum to chew on when they flush the port before and after the chemo treatment.  \n\nIf you can be there during treatments, that would be nice.  Just to have someone there to go get them something to eat or drink, to help unplug the iv so the patient came use the restroom (numerous times), to make sure they have a blanket and pillow for comfort, would be appreciated.  Take cues from the patient whether they want to talk or just rest quietly. \n\nMany times people do not know what to say or what to do.  Keep in contact and do a few little things to let them know you really care and love them...Inspirational items or cards are nice. \n\nWishing the best for your friend. You are correct. As someone else who is mass is located in the chest, nothing will help the cough until that goes away. \n\nI think my biggest thing is people always wanting to know how I am feeling and constantly wanting to talk about it. Sometimes I just want to pretend things are normal. I do not just want \u201cto be\u201d cancer. Talk to her about other stuff too. \n\nOtherwise, just be supportive and positive! I have also found journaling to be very helpful in getting out what I am thinking. I do not like to use Facebook or anything to get things off my mind (you are welcome), and it is better than complaining. I say do not keep asking what she needs help with. It is kind of hard. We just do not know. I am currently receiving treatment. Right now these are the things I most need as I enter into treatment 5 of 6: \n\nSomeone to stay with me EVERY SINGLE DAY, not just a few hours, all day. I am too weak to even make a meal. \nI do not know what I want to eat so do not judge me when I decline every offer. Look stuff up for chemo diets and help me figure it out. \nBe flexible and offer to just come over on any available days, the company is appreciated. \nGift cards! \nNo plants or flowers too much work unless you know she likes these things. \nDo the laundry. \nClean the house. \n\nJust some things off the top off my head. \n\nThey also made me a chemo bag but it is full of stuff I do not need because you sleep the whole time. I need a neck pillow, charger , socks and blanket. \n\nHope that helps from someone in the trenches!!! \n\n\ud83d\udc9c Thanks so much for responding! It means a lot! You are completely right. I noticed she has to explain the situation/updates multiple times a day to friends, family, and coworkers who check in with her. I will definitely try to focus on different conversation topics and maybe ask her mom for the full updates instead so she does not need to repeat it for the millionth time!\n\nThank you for responding, I really hope your journey to recovery goes well! Thanks soooo much for the advice! \nI will try my best to be a positive rock for her, while not being annoying! It seems like a tough line to walk, but I will make sure I get it right.\n\nAlso, pillows and blankets...I will make sure to bring lots of comfort options! Thanks so much for the well wishes; and congratulations on kicking cancer\u2019s butt! \nI definitely understand what you mean. I have watched people try to comfort her by downplaying HL...they obviously mean well but as you mentioned, it does not warrant the intended response.\n\nI will definitely take all the advice you were generous enough to share! My mom also started like an email group or text group to help update family with all of the pertinent information. It made it easier for both of us to update everyone without making a million phone calls Thanks so much!!! Neck pillow, charger, socks, and a blanket are all added to my list now; thank you!! \n\nI will definitely be spending as much time as I can with her. She is close with my whole family, so I will make sure we are all stocked up with comfort items\n\nGood luck with treatment 5 and 6!! Wishing you all the best! Hi just joined this thread and I just wanted to give your friend hope that there are survivors that live a long time after treatment and that she will get through it and it will make her stronger for it. I am a survivor of stage 3 Hodgkin's and a bone marrow transplant. And that was 30 years ago!  So cancer can be beat and for her to not lose hope.", "Difficulty in getting focused Hello, i am a 2b stage HL doing therapies for more than 2 years now. I am not here to write my story, but instead I want to describe you this problem ( title) i am getting more and more during this period.\nBasically I study at university, and during this time I noticed I am getting distracted really easily and it takes twice for me to understand something I read. I get so angry because I know i can do better but I am not like before I started treatments. I still keep studying because it helps getting brain trained, but sometimes I get so demotivated. Any suggestions? Thanks in advance and stay strong. I went through treatment for stage 2b HL for a year and then for another year for a relapse. In remission now. This is something I noticed to. I could not focus, I could barley hold a conversation as I would just completely forget what I was saying or forget the word I was looking for. \n\nI was worried about it but my consultant and nurses promised me it was completely normal. In fact they called it \"chemo brain\"....kind of similar to baby brain for women when they are pregnant.\n\nI am afraid I do not have a solution for you. Just some reassurance that it does get better in time, which I know is not ideal when your at uni. Maybe the uni could make some exceptions for you, give you a bit of extra time to do things. I dunno.  I am about a year out of treatment now and I would say I am completely back to normal. \n\nWishing you all the best in your treatments and at uni. You got this! I am ADHD. I noticed even on my meds while on chemo I felt like I was off them. Off them I became a mess and ended up stopping work. \n\nIt is chemo brain but very similar to ADHD. Some of the helps usually employed to that will likely help you. And it got better for me after treatment was over HL caregiver here not patient but I have heard of many people having success with either an antidepressant adderall or both. My husband has been thinking about asking his Dr. He is a year and a half out and still feels the fog and just general slowness. Maybe talk to you dr about ADHD meds?", "Why cannot blood tests detect hodgekins lymphoma? I am curious as to why the blood test can detect non hodgekins but not hodgekins? I had mono when I was younger and have some swollen stiff nodes in my neck, they are not very big but have also had night sweats since I was 21. I had a doctor tell me that I for sure do not have cancer because my blood tests are normal? Is that true? I am very confused as to what could cause this then. From my understanding they do have tests for hodgekins but I know they are not perfectly reliable. The same day they did a biopsy on a lymph node the blood test came back negative. It took a CT scan to get them to do a biopsy on me. Why is it so hard to get doctors to check this? I see a lot of people having issues with that. Are enlarged stiff lymph nodes common or something? Yes they are. I stupidly Web MDed mine after feeling a stiff node years ago. \"99% harmless amd will shrink in months.\"\n\nDid not see a doctor until I started getting rashes on my head 5 months later. Yeah I have had mine for a long time. I used to get rashes too but have not had them in a while. A couple years ago I had it all over the back of my scalp. Well shit. Are you diagnosed or just worried? Get to that doc yesterday! No med insurance anymore got to wait til November. Just worried lol I went to the doctor a few months back and she was like \u201cnothing to see here\u201d the lymph node is not very big persay but it is the biggest one I feel but not the only swollen one and it is like completely fixed in place. If I have this I have had this since I was 21 at least. I got mono when I was 18 and noticed the night sweats and fatigue around 21. I am 28 now. Oh jeez. HL is very aggressive so I would think you would be in much worse shape after this much time. Well I can hope it is not that then, I do not feel too bad really to be honest I just cannot think of another explanation as to why they would be stuck in place for all these years like that. What kind of symptoms would people get in later stages? Like how do/did you feel physically? Loss of energy, night sweats, shortness of breath (it was 8 inches jammed against my left lung), circular rashes on my headn and weight loss (disguised by my low carb diet.)\n\nI honestly did not recognize the symptoms as overly alarming. I was living it up, had started a new stressful job, and figured stress and diet were messing with me. Were the night sweats on and off or just drenching every night? Holy hell 8 inches? That is huge! How are you doing now? I first noticed something weird when I was 21 I got this weird rash all over my body that I thought might be a fungal infection, it itched pretty bad but was worse when I got in the shower, then the night sweats started. So it caused the artery to bulge? I think it was just physically interrupting my bloodflow. Pretty consistently waking up with a very wet undershirt.\n\nI have a dead fist sized scar in my chest now. My port was removed after 3 years, my CT scans are down to yearly...so all is well so far! Congrats man that is great!", "Classical Hodgkin's Hello, I have been diagnosed with Classical Hodgkin, I am going to the doctor's today, I do not know which stage I am on.  \nI am 20f, life is really hard and I cannot afford too much, are there any activities, measures which could improve my chances? The medical community has been really good at fighting off this one for 50 years. Get better first. Worry about finances later. Hospitals will take small installments dragged out in perpetuity. Thank you, although I have been scouring the internet reading through stuff, this comment still helps.\nThank you again. What did the doctor say about the survival rate thing for you and what stage are you on?\nHow many rounds of chemo are you going to get? I was told I had an 8ninch tumor between my.lungs by a tech and did not see an oncologist for 8 days. Be your own advocate! Check out the lymphoma board.  Tons of knowledgeable people.  I had stage 2b. Your stage will decide the course of treatment.  Feel free to ask me anything! Will check it our right now, thank you so much. You will likely get ABVD or some variation 6 cycles which is 12 chemos. You do not need to do anything special to improve your chances other than complete your chemos &lt;3 Getting my PET Scan by the end of the day. Thank you for the kind comment. &lt;3 Hello! I just found out, it is stage 4. Hey, since you had previously recommended the lymphoma board, and generally been kind, I thought I would tell you this: I just found out, it is stage 4. \nI have not been told details exactly, because they worry I will be anxious.\nSo I do not know where all it has spread, but the doctor said to stay optimistic. Well stage 4 is not ideal but I can tell you the chances of going in to remission and even a cure are very good.  I have spoken with so many people who have put stage 4 lymphoma behind them.  Stage 4 mean that is it is below your diaphragm and possible in your bone marrow. \nTalk to your doctor about immunotherapy - my understanding is that is an option now. \nHave they told you the sub type yet? For instance, I have classical Hodgkin\u2019s, nodular sclerosing lymphoma. The subtype will also have a say in your treatment. \n\nYou have a lot of life left in you and there are a lot of treatment options for this type of cancer.  The timing totally blows and it is even more scary when you have children.  \nJust to give you an idea though, I worked while going through chemo and had a 6 month old at home.  I also lived across the country from any family or friends (we had just moved.) so my husband and I managed it all by ourselves.  When I was first diagnosed I envisioned myself with my head in a toilet for months. \nThat was not the case.  I did not lose my hair either. \n\nThey will give you meds for nausea and anxiety.  Then steroids to help you bounce back from the chemo.  \n\nStart eating a healthy diet and drink a ton of water.  Water is going to make or break you during chemo. \nYou are at the scariest point of this all right now.  When you get your treatment plan you will see that this is doable. \n\nKeep your head up!!! I am rooting for you.  And again, let me know if you need anything.  Sorry to hear that. How is it going so far?\nHave the doctors given any more info? I am M/25 and I had stage 2 HL, classic one and got 4 rounds of chemo. \nI found out that I felt awful, anxious and weak when I did not eat properly. So please try to eat better.\nSalads helped. I kind of went vegan throughout the process because I thought meat would be harder to digest than vegetables. But that is just me. Drinking light beers helped my stomach quite a bit. I would start drinking in the morning and it would atleast make me not want to die.\nI also got xanax prescribed for the first few days after the chemo sessions, to curb the anxiety and bad feelings. \nDo not eat anything too spicy. \nAnd remember to do things that you love and enjoy. For me, it was music and I did what I could. \nIt might suck so do not feel ashamed of talking to others. I got a lot of support from my nurses and stuff. My 20 yr old daughter is getting her PET scan tomorrow to stage lymphoma. For a long time she has been looking forward to moving out. Supposed to move next week! I told her I have no idea how tolerable the chemo is, and if she will be able to work. I am worried she will be really sick and will not be able to afford rent. How awful is the chemo? Do you think she can work? What advise in addition to hydration and a good diet (which she lacks) would you suggest? Christ, sorry to hear that. I would say that you should definitely confirm all these things with her doctor as I think it affects everyone differently. I got very weak and tired all the time. It affected my mind pretty badly as I have always been a fit and strong guy. I shaved my head to make sure I stay ahead of it(mentally, like to be in control) and it did help. \nHydration is always a plus but you should also make sure she is getting enough food. I stopped eating properly and it made things worse. \nI also got xanax (alprazolam) prescribed for the first few days after every chemo session. I had severe anxiety attacks so it was a lifesaver.\nI also recorded my weight every day to keep an eye on it. It helped so I knew where to go in a sense. \nAlso, try doing things she loves with her. If she is able to do them. \nAnd maybe she should stay with you for a bit. As I said, it affects everyone differently so it might be better than mine, same or worse. \nAnd try to stay strong. It was annoying for me to have to assure others that I will be fine and them bawling their eyes out when I was trying to stay positive. It could not have been 8\u201d, probably 8cm. I had a chest tumor too. It was an almost 4 inch (10cm) mediastinal mass, it was enormous and rare, and if it got any bigger I would be dead. 8 inches is more than double that, it is not possible. Congratulations on remission, it will be a year for me in July! 8 inches is 20.32 cm Thank you bot, but I already know that lol I am sorry but you are incorrect. I am probably much larger than you. Stage 2B hiding between my lungs, restricting my breathing and requiring emergency treatment. Thank you for informing me on my medical condition. You are welcome, but I was not being rude, I am just repeating what my doctor said.  Im not a small person and I was told I was millimeters away from death or paralysis. The X-rays show it taking up nearly my whole chest cavity, but mine was more on the left and very wrapped up in my heart ventricles and nerves. So maybe the location is the thing that made the size of mine more deadly. My tumor was restricting my breathing too, in fact it collapsed one of my lungs :( this became permanent even after the sternotomy and excision of the tumor. It paralyzed my diaphragm and vocal chord and now I choke on the majority of every liquid I try to swallow, my voice is practically a whisper, and shortness of breath is normal. The pain inside will not go away over a year and a half after the surgery. The treatment was an emergency situation for me as well, I was not able to look into freezing eggs and now I will never have children. I was 2B too. So bittersweet, so happy to have survived but I am still massively struggling with the aftermath and the reality of everything that happened. I hope you are healthy and strong now. The virus makes me so worried with my poor immune system and my damaged lung. Ive been really afraid", "Worried! I have a bump under my jaw near my neck is it a tonsil or a lymph node that is swollen I have a small bump that is a bit bigger than the other one it is right under my jaw near the neck, is that a lymph node or a tonsil? (I have had HL stage 2 already and survived) is my cancer back? Or is that part of the body commonly uneven? Or is it just a swollen tonsil? I am very worried I struggle to even workout because of the fear Hl comes back. It may be. Get checked and see. At MDA on Friday for follow up scan.  Should be clean for 10 to 15 years. We wait and see. It sounds like a swollen lymph node but may not be anything sinister. Have you been ill recently in any minor way (ie I had a swollen lymph node when my new ear piercing was healing, and also again when wisdom teeth were breaking through and giving me some grief). If you cannot pinpoint a possible cause and/or it persists more than a week or two I would go to your GP. Nothing wrong with being safe and it is what they are there for, but also try not to assume the worst (I know it is hard) xx I get this all the time since having HL. It sometimes gets really large and or hard to the touch but then they go down. I find it is usually when the allergies are bad. At first I would freak out but it is been 4.5 years and it happens all the time for me. Sometimes it is one side, sometimes both. Definitely under my jaw close to my neck, the furthest back where my jaw meets the neck. I just checked and one side is there the other isnt. Hope that helps. My oncologist said the first signs of reoccurrence would be the same symptoms you had when you had HL the first time. If it is soft and painless that is when I worry .", "I am Dying of Hodgkins... I have been doing everything to fight my hodgkins lymphoma for 16 years. I have done all the chemos, radiation, immunotherapy, you name it. I am ready to die. The treatments have ruined my life. So, my oncologist said, without treatment, I have 6 months to a year. He is kind of an ass though. He is told me I am fine and backtracked. He is put me in hospice and then I have lived. However, I am never getting treatment again. I want out. I have bulky disease going up my left groin. I can feel those. The size of cotton balls. Theres one higher up on the right which I cannot feel, but is on my scan, and my spleen lights up. I have got the Hodgkins Itch as well. \n\nDoes anyone know what it is like to actually die of this. I moved in with my mom when my dad died and she tells them she is my caretaker, but she is cruel. My palliative care doctor said I will start to get more sleepy and sleep most of the day. They keep saying they will make me comfortable, but I am pretty sure they mean morphine. I cant take morphine bc of the itch. Am I going to die screaming in pain and scratching my skin off while my mom abuses me? \n\nHelp! It probably depends how it spreads. If it goes to your lungs, bones, etc. Could cause a lot of bone pain, could cause you to be unable to breathe. Will likely cause extreme weakness. I obviously did not die of it, but I was stage 4b at diagnoses with it in my lungs and bone marrow. Between March 7 (diagnoses date) and April 7 (first treatment) I went from itching and a mild cough and declined so rapidly I could barely leave the couch due to lack of energy and stamina. I was coughing violently all day and night. Scratching my skin with a serrated knife. Back pain so bad I could not get comfortable in any position. I do not know if that is how it will get for you, but it is how mine progressed, and it did it very quickly. \n\nI am sorry this is happening to you and I hope you can stay comfortable.  If your mom is not taking care of you appropriately, tell your doctor and ask to be in hospice because you may lose your ability to advocate for yourself once you hit a certain point and you will want to be made as comfortable as possible. Hi PunkyPosy I am very sorry to hear about your situation. \n\nI think the first question is why do you need palliation ? are you in pain ?\n\nMy expertise in palliative care is limited, but palliation can be done with fentanyl patches or IV that cause less itchiness than morphine and there are agents that can be added for the itchiness.  Medicinal Marijuana may be of help in some cases. There may also be use of palliation with other psychogenic agents like MDMA and psilocybin (possibly only on clinical trial). NYU has a good palliative care department involved in a lot of research, but most large cancer center should have strong supportive care. \n\nFrom the Hodgkin's lymphoma perspective, I do not want to make your situation more complex, but if you want me to have a look at your records and tell you if there are promising clinical trials that could be \"game changers\" for you, please feel free to message me privately and I will do my best to help. \n\nErel Joffe MD  \nLymphoma Service  \nMemorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center  \n\\* Comments are for educational purposes only and should not be regarded as medical advice. I know that you are done with treatment, but have you seen other doctors? My doctor sent me to MDA in Houston just because he did not see Hodgkins very often and was not sure about the treatment. They are very good. The treatment they prescribed was completely different from the one he wanted to use. There is  an entire section of the hospital that only deals with lymphoma. \n   I do agree with the previous post, if your care is not good get different. Make sure thins are right before you cannot anymore. If you are truly finished fighting, I wish you peace in your coming days. I have had hodgkins for 16 years. Ive done chemos, stem cell transplant, radiation, and immunotherapy. I gi to Hershey Med. They are good, my cancer just doesnt behave like hodgkins. It was in my chest, but when they treated my chest, it jumped to my groin. They said hodgkins doesnt do that and I probably had leukemia, but when they tested it, it was hodgkins. I have seen other doctors, they all get overwhelmed and tell me to go to Hershey. \n\nAbout drugs: I cannot do medical marijuana because my lungs are too bad to smoke ut and when I do the edibles or the oil, I get so paranoid that it isnt worth it. I have had to take sleeping pills or ativan to calm me down after trying medical marijuana and it was indica, the kind that should make you sleepy. I was a mess. MDMA, I WISH! Where am I going to get ecstasy? I dont know any drug dealers and my friends arent going to help me. My mother is useless when it comes to drugs. I felt normal when I used to find ecstasy at parties. It was so nice to just feel like a normal person. We may do patches. I am in pain, but not enough that I want to start patches or a IV drip. To be honest, I have only been refilling my morphine pills because I dont have enough money to go to Switzerland and my state does not have a Dying with Dignity law. \n\nThe itching is a whole other monster. I need a fork to scratch the thick skin on my hands. My arms and chest have sores all over bc there are sometimes i just need to scratch. I HAVE to. I have researched it. I am not really itchy. It is a miscommunication in your brain. The hodgkins somehow sends an itchy signal to your brain so you scratch. They have given me gabapentin to numb the nerves. I can tell I am gaining weight on it. They want me to switch to Lyrica, which also has huge weight gain as a side effect. That is like salt in the wound to me. I am going to die, now I am going to die fat. I was so thin and pretty and now I wont leave the house or let my friends visit. I dont want to be remembered this way. \n\nClinical trials are out. I was paralyzed during my first radiation. You would think I could sue and youd be right. The students didnt line up the lazers to my tattooed dots. They got frustrated and zapped me anyway. They made me feel like I would recover. They never used the term \"paralyzed.\" When I finally realized I was paralyzed permanently, I called a lawyer. He said the statute of limitations was about to run out. When I called the records people to get the reports and scans when I was admitted, she told me i never went there and there were no records. I just saw the radiologist to appease my mother, he also was unable to find any records about my first radiation. Is not that effed up! But yeah, that is why I cant do clinical trials. I have a secondary issue that they caused. \n\nI had hospice about 6 years ago and the nurses came twice a week and took my vitals. At one point, a tumor touched my spinal cord causing WAY more paralysis than usual. My dad had to carry me to the bathroom. My mom is very cruel when it comes to this. I think she wants to scare me into getting more treatment. I think, maybe to get away from her, I should go to a nursing home. I mean, I would like to die here. I am currently sleeping and spending my day in the bed my dad just died in. It sounds morbid, but it is the best place to watch TV. He died in November in his sleep. He was my best friend, so I thought I would just die where he died. My mom is just so mean to me. Like, I am weak and want to sleep, but she wakes me up. She encourages me to take adderall. She calls them my pep pills. She gets mad at me bc I dont want to go anywhere. I am DYING. I dont understand and I cant get her to stop. She invites my 3 year old nephew over who I adore and who loves me because she thinks I will get out of bed for him. I will, but it is getting harder and I told her I would not be able to go to his birthday party because A. I am sick and B. My sister throws him these huge parties and her friends look at me like an animal in the zoo. I dont want to put myself in that situation and get sick. If my mom had to take me home, she would harass me for days about how I ruin everything for her. My mom is a good person, she just hates me lately. I am going to die itchy, in pain, and being insulted by my mom. This SUCKS. \n\nMy nephew is coming today with my sister, who treats me like my mom. She is super rude about my cancer. I got a lot more attention over the years bc I always needed to go to the hospital or treatments. She said it must be nice to not work and she wishes she had cancer. \n\nI am in quite a predicament. How sick do I have to be to get in to a home??? Opioids do not work well on me and morphine can cause young women to vomit violently, so I have been put on keterolac instead, which is also anti-inflammatory. That has helped me. \n\nYour doctor is not a good doctor. Telling you you are fine and then saying you have 6 months? WTF.\n\nPlease, if you have not, contact other hospitals, like Memorial Sloan Kettering, or MD Anderson Cancer Center, or the Mayo Clinic. They are the best for cancer.  \nExplain that your Hodgkin's is not acting like Hodgkins, that treatments have not worked, etc. and you need experts. \n\nPhysician-assisted suicide is legal in several states in the US, so you do not necessarily need to move to Switzerland if you really want to go that route. I also remember watching a documentary about right-to-die advocacy organizations and activist networks that help people access assisted suicide drugs (sometimes even in states where assisted suicide legislation does not exist.) You could contact some advocacy groups:\n\n( Regarding MDMA or psilocybin I have contacted a few colleagues to see if these are only available through clinical trials or if there is a way to get them as part of standard palliative care. I will pm you with answers.\n\nRegarding parents (and as a parent) - though parents can be overbearing particularly in stressful times, I have found that when you realize there is never ill-intent in their actions (most parents will never knowingly do something they think would harm their child) it makes it easier to be forgiving of their shortcoming. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry I cannot be of more help.   \nFeel free to pm me if there is anything I can do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nErel Joffe MD  \nLymphoma Service  \nMemorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center  \n\\* Comments are for educational purposes only and should not be regarded as medical advice. Wow, that is so amazing of you to offer to do that for him. I just want to say thank you very much.", "Any post treatments problems? I am one month remission of stage 2 Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma I did chemo for 2 months. Anyone who has been in remission for a while have you had chemo problems? I  heard it can harm your body in the long run and I am wondering if it is common and if the harm is not good like heart disease and stuff. I had chronic fatigue for a bit and I just felt weak. Eating healthier, drinking less alcohol and working out 4 times a weak kind of fixed it. Atleast put the threshold somewhere I can handle.\nOther than that, I dont think there is any other issue with me. I do value my health and life more now and I feel a bit focused on things that I want and like more than before. \nJust stay generally healthy and you will be fine, hopefully.\nYou should stop overthinking for now. Just focus on getting better and make sure to eat well and sleep well. Maybe get something to take your mind off it. It depends on the drug cocktail regemin you were prescribed. But I am 29 years out from stage 2b Hodgkin's and I have not too many at de effects at least not directly attributed to chemo. I feel like my circulation is worse than the normal person as I try to keep in shape but it could be genetic or age. \nMy advice is to not overthink it and assume there are no side effects unless it is cryatal clear. I tend to try to not use cancer as an excuse but rather a method of encouragement and confidence. You got through it so be proud of that accomplishment! Stay strong!

More below  Do not get to meet with the doctor for another week and a half ... wondering if anyone can give me any insight on what these results mean  It means everything is normal except nodes in your neck, which is consistent with your lymphoma. You have cut off part of the report - usually the \"impression\" section at the end of reports like these is the most useful. Awesome thanks ! Ya it would only let me upload one picture ", "COVID19 Vaccine 2 Pain I posted awhile ago after the first round and asked if anyone had pain where their large lymph nodes were. Did anyone get night sweats, pain in spleen or anything weird that was not a top symptom in the list after the second round? I am trying not to panic (I am coming up on 5 years post treatment). But the symptoms seem so similar it is bizarre. It must be from the vaccine though since it happened right around that time. I did not have any symptoms with my vaccine, but a friend of mine (no cancer history) got painful swollen lymph nodes in his arm-pit after the second dose.\n\nThe vaccine is meant to activate your immune system (hence swollen lymph nodes).  If it were me, I would give it a few days to a week and call my oncologist if it did not go away on its own. This makes me feel much better THANK YOU. I mean I feel bad that your friend went through that. My underarms are really sore too. It also does not help that where I live, this time of year, is allergy hell, so I am sure my lymphatic system is already unhappy. I will keep you in my thoughts. I am only about 4 months out from chemo, so I still panic every time I fill any little twinge anywhere.\n\nThe good news is that my friend was totally fine after a couple of days. Thank you! I will be five years in a few weeks. The anxiety DOES get better over time but when something big like this happens, it freaks me out. :) My oncologist is having me wait 12 weeks after my 2nd dose for my 4 year post treatment scan.  In also on a Facebook group where people's bloodwork has been all fucked up after their vaccine,  so it is definitely having that effect.  My oncologist said she is seen a lot of false positive scans already in their office from it. Wow, really? That is kind of not surprising based on how I feel. I am emailing my oncologist now to see if she should have me wait. What Facebook group is it? The group is called living life after Hodgkins lymphoma. I was actually a little annoyed by her response at my visit because i had emailed her a week beforehand asking if I should postpone my vaccine in light of my upcoming appointment, and her nurse responded that I should get it and not delay. Then at my appointment Monday, she was emphatic that I wait 12 weeks to scan after my second vaccine, which is not til April 20, so my scan cannot be til July. I was really hoping to just get the scan over with, which is why I planned to delay the vaccine til afterward,  but alas....here I am. And I definitely do not want a false positive so I am going to take her advice and wait it out. Not going to lie, though....I am a little freaked about all these reactions to the vaccine. I KNOW it will happen and even should happen, but I am so not prepared for the PTSD reaction that will inevitably follow.", "My Cancer Story.. (Cancer at 26)  I just had my biopsy last week and am waiting for the results. Keep fighting", "Question? If you have Hodgkins Lymphoma do your symptoms hit all at once or do they come one by one? I still have not had a symptom.  I did catch mine early. My symptoms came very gradually and I did not realize anything was wrong until I noticed a lump. I had no idea. Symptoms were gradual...although I should have had my lymph nodes checked months before I did.", "My fiance has HL I am sorry if this is not allowed. I just am looking for some advice. I recently got engaged to my Fiance, a day after we found out he has Hodgkins lymphoma stage 1a. Im not exactly sure what stage 1a means, but he only has 2 on his neck I believe, he had a scan and there is not any others elsewhere. We have a lot going on right now. We are moving into an apartment together, just got engaged. I know there is never a \"right\" time for cancer. He is been staying positive and is doing well. He just had his port put in, and has been in pain. Its starting to hit me that this is actually happening. He recently lost family members to different types of cancers, (two within the past two years) and I know he is scared to go through chemo as he is seen what it can do to you. I am also very scared. I am trying my hardest to be the best for him. He starts chemo next week. I want to make this better for him in the best way possible. So I guess I am just asking for some advice? Any recommendations? He turns 21 on Monday as well, everyone is saying his body should handle everything well being the fact he is extremely healthy and young but its unpredictable and I just want to make this process as well as possible for him and help in anyway that I can..i know I feel awful about this but I cannot imagine how he feels or is going to feel. thank you in advance If his doctor uses the same system as mine did, 1a is very good, it means first stage I think. Less cancer inside of him, better chance for a faster treatment. I know I had \"Stage 2\" which meant mine was \"in both my left and right sides, above my diaphragm\".  \nI am trying to give you something positive here, but I am not a doctor, just a fellow HL survivor, exactly the same age, though my diagnosis and treatment were 3 years ago now. Chemo is scary, but it works very well on HL.  Get a lot of plastic dinner ware, spoons and forks especially. I know one common Chemo symptom most people do not expect is \"metal mouth\". You cannot stand eating with a metal utensil or out of a metal bowl. Be ready for nausea too, keep the anti nausea pills on hand where he can get to them at any time.   \nDo not forget the cream that numbs the skin on the port, I forgot it a few times, that needle stings.  \nHe is likely to be VERY tired most of the time, so try not to go too far from somewhere he can sit down and rest.  \nMore than anything just make sure you are there, and hold on with him.   \nGood luck to you both, stay strong. I went through a similar thing with my partner, she was diagnosed with HL and moved in with me at the beginning of treatment two years ago - currently cancer free and still living together! My advice is to do what you can to save on the burden of caregiving/housekeeping. I was working full time when she moved in so there was the adjustment of living together / exasperation with all the dishes, groceries etc that needed to be done. We did not have any family in the area and all of our friends did not take any initiative to help. We were in our early 20s and I think they just did not understand yet, or did not want to really think about it. But anyways - grocery delivery, and stocking up on easy to eat freezer food that is not his favourite to eat when he feels like crap and you are not there to feed him. Avoid favourite foods when nauseous, and my gf had a preference for bland food. I am a 2a survivor. Had it in my neck also. \n\nThe port never really feels great, it will stop being itchy right about the time they are ready to take it out. lol\n\nMy biggest problems stemmed from severe depression I had from the situation and the chemo messing with my brain. I would not move for days at a time and had problems from not being active. Getting on anti depression medicine at the end really helped change my experience. \n\nGetting constipated is a common problem, Miralax, Senecot, and lots of water are going to be key to have in your house at all times for him. \n\nWhen he starts chemo his food tastes will change. The only thing I could eat and taste over the metal were spaghetti with red sauce and spicy Mexican / Asian dishes. That is all I ate for 3 months of chemo. \n\nThis is big and scary, but this is beatable. This is not a death sentence. Your fianc\u00e9 can make it through this and if your here asking questions I am sure you will be an amazing supportive person to have in his life. Second on the always tired! Really good point about not going too far. I relate to you and your fiance so much. I was diagnosed with stage 2 HL right after I got engaged in 2019. I am so sorry you both are going through this. \ud83d\udc9c \n\nMy best advice is just be there for him as much as you can. Go to appointments (doctors, treatment, etc.) with him if you can (idk where u live but with covid some places are stricter than others so if you are able to go, go.)\n\nAs much too as you want to be there for him (and this might be the opposite of my previous advice lol) just be sure to make time for yourself here and there. Go out for dinner with a friend, a walk, read. Whatever is your \"therapy\" just be sure to do something for yourself. Seeing my fiance be my caretaker (and as much as I knew he wanted to be there for me as much as possible) I always felt bad bc he did so much. So I tried to make sure he made time for himself whether it was buying him a gift card to get a massage or making sure he went out once in a while to get out.\n\nLike you said even though there is no \"good time\" to go through cancer one thing you will know unlike other couples who do not have cancer or some sort of health thing during their engagement is when your special day comes and you exchange your vows you both will know what it means when you say \"in sickness and in health.\"\n\nHe will have his bad days and good days. For me, planning my wedding was what helped motivate me to get through it. He will be okay. It will be difficult at times but you both will get through it and come out stronger. I am thinking of you and your fiance! If u have any questions please do not hesitate to ask!! \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c Stage 2b 20years old - I had a total of eight infusions four of ABVD and after negative pet just AVD. I highly recommend looking into getting medical marijuana. I would not have been able to eat without eat and it helped me not need any of the anti nausea meds I was given post infusion. Best of luck First of all, I can totally relate to your situation. Our relationship started February 2020, his mom died from cancer 4 months later. We moved into our apartment the week after her passing. Fast forward to January 2021. We got engaged and two days later, he was getting surgery to remove his masses, then we got the official diagnosis about a week after our engagement. Everything happens so quickly and it is a lot of information thrown at you at once. I am so sorry this is happening to you, but just know you both will be stronger for getting through this so early on in your relationship. I also want to give you props for being what sounds like a very caring and supportive partner. \nSecondly, as far as advice goes, find your support group. This is hard for him, but it is hard for you as you navigate this portion of your life together. As a caregiver/supporter, you will wear down at times and need a break. Take it when you can. As someone who tried to do everything and be everything for my fianc\u00e9, I burned out quickly. It is okay to ask others to help with things and it will help both of you in the long run. One thing I wish I would done differently was let more people help, so I could better support my fianc\u00e9. It is not selfish to take a step back and have someone step in when needed. \nThird, make time for each other. We go on weekly dates. Whether its a car ride and ice cream, dinner, or a movie night at home, find time where you can be together and really have that time to focus on your relationship. It is easy to put that on the back burner during chemo, but try to do it as much as possible because it really does help. \nFourth, even though he is young, offer to pick up slack where it is needed. He will need a lot of rest after treatments, and it is less stressful for him to not have to worry about bills, food, chores, etc. I meal prepped a lot and left him food for while I was gone that he could easily make. He appreciates that a lot. He never likes to ask me for things, so I found doing them before he could ask was helpful for him. \nOn chemo days, we usually \u201ceat out\u201d afterwards. Whatever he is able or in the mood to eat I have delivered. Chemo takes up most of your day, and is very draining (for you as well), so that is something that has helped us. \n\nSome things that have been helpful so far:\n-A chemo shirt: They sell these on amazon for a decent price. It has zippers on it to easily access his port during treatment. I bought it for his first treatment and my fianc\u00e9 loves it.  I will include the link to the one he has in a separate comment for you. \n-Medical marijuana: This is the only thing that helps his nausea and has been a lifesaver\n-Numbing cream for port: Make sure to put this on before each treatment. \n-Make sure he is taking his pre treatment nausea meds. It helps lessen nausea during treatment.\n-For foods during treatment, choose things that are not his favorite. As time goes on, he will associate it with chemo and it will make him sick. \n-Therapy. My fianc\u00e9 has bad depression since starting chemo. Be an ear, a rock, an advocate and a friend to him. He will need it. But also encourage therapy/counseling either during or after treatment (or both). Antidepressants may be needed. \n\nThis is a hard journey, but he is young and has you in his corner. As a little inspiration, my fianc\u00e9 was diagnosed with Stage 2B Hodgkins Lymphoma. After surgery and 2 cycles of ABVD, the cancer had disappeared. He is now on Cycle 5 and almost done with treatment. It is one of the easier cancers to treat, especially in the early stages. Stay positive and practice self care and you will get through this and beat it together. Best of luck to your fianc\u00e9 and you. You got this! Chemo port shirt link: ", "During chemo ABVD did anyone experience breast pain and a increase in blue veins on the breast and chest. And also heart palpitations?  I experienced increased breast pain when I would get my Lupron injections, and heart palpitations I have experienced since chemotherapy. According to my oncologist,  because the heart muscle is one of the main organs that sustains 'damage', heart pain and palpitations are fairly normal, as long as it does not last or cause you any sort of breathing problems. Thank you for the reply I did notice heart palpitations for sure. Almost like butterflies in my chest. But they only lasted a few seconds. Yes to all of this.

This is her latest checkup. Her physician adviced her that it will take 2-3 chemo session, and 30 day radiation to cure or remove the lump around her neck. What can radiation cause to her body? I dont have any idea about radiation, she only had chemotherapy before.. And it was too painful to watch her undergo on that medication. My oncologist was talking to me about having to do radiation but I decided not to and she does not recommend it for young people, but since your mom is a bit older I think her case is different.... anyways you could check out this link and it shows all the side effects of radiation...

Did you experience infertility after treatment? I am 24F and have just been diagnosed with stage 3a Hodgkin's lymphoma. It is not in my bone marrow or organs and I am healthy otherwise. My oncologists are recommending 6 cycles of ABVD chemo with no radiation. One oncologist does not think I need to freeze my eggs while the other one supports it. What is your experience? Any advice? Mine recommended it and I did it.  I was 32. It was not an arduous process and my insurance covered it so I figured I should.  My fertility was significantly diminished afterward, but after about 18 months it came back mostly.  I was told to expect early menopause though, so we will see what happens.  I am 36 now and used one of my frozen embryos to make my now 2 month old. \n\nI also had 6 cycles of abvd. I was diagnosed at 29, I am now 31. I apparently had a low egg count so I chose not to harvest because there was a low chance I would get anything viable. \n\nI am now 15 months post- ABVD and my period still has not returned. They cannot really tell me why but my guess is because I did not have much to begin with. \n\nLong story short, if it is feasible for you and does not delay treatment, I would do it. You would rather be safe than sorry if you want children in the future. I (23F) was recently diagnosed with hodgkins 3b, and mine recommended it, so I did just to be sure that I have the choice later in life if it turns out that I would be infertile. Im in the middle of 6 cycles of beacopp.\n\nI would recommend it, just to have a failsafe if you do want to have children later on (I am not even sure I want children, but I want to be able to have that choice still).\nYou do have to complete the IVF before the chemo starts, so make sure that that can be done if you go through with it!\n\nAnd all the best with your treatment! I had stage 2a at age 25, and I had 8 rounds of ABVD and no radiation. I felt strongly that I should freeze my eggs, but honestly none of my doctors seemed overly concerned about it. I went to a specialist and everything. At the end of the day, most people\u2019s answer was that it was my choice. It might be completely unnecessary to freeze them, but they also could not 100% promise that I would still be able to have kids... Since it is $$$ and my husband and I are open to alternate methods of growing a family, I decided to risk it and did not freeze any. Taking time to freeze eggs would have meant delaying treatment, and even though Hodgkin\u2019s is slow-growing, knowing that I could get started with treatment immediately brought me peace of mind at the time. I feel that I made the right decision. I was 26 at the time and since it was so expensive to do the procedure, plus delay treatment and money to keep the eggs stored, we decided against it. I do not regret it at all since I know we can grow a family by adopting or other means. However, I had my period the entire time even when my iron count was so externally low during chemo. A few years later the doctors said I would have absolutely no issue getting pregnant if I wanted to. I think if you have no feelings to adopt and you absolutely know you want to have your own baby then you should definitely do it because there is a chance that the chemo can mess with things. It is funny though because after going through everything I did, I have no desire to have my own baby. I love being an auntie. My friend froze her eggs and now does not want kids but she says she does not regret paying for it since if she wanted kids of her own later and could not because chemo, she would have been very sad. She ended up donating them. 25F Diagnosed 5 years ago stage 2AE (Currently 29weeks pregnant). All of my doctors recommended it. I have had PCOS since a young teen and so I never thought I would be able to conceive anyway. I never had regular periods either. My tumors were fairly big so I did not want to wait to collect my eggs, so I did not. \nI had ABVD, ICE, BeGeV, BEAM with an autologous stem cell transplant, then finished it off with radiation. It was one hell of a fight! I had more chemo than I was anticipating in the beginning, but each time I would start a new chemo, my doctors would ask if I would like to collect my eggs. Each time I would say no (I have always wanted my own kids, but I was too depressed to believe it would be a reality for me). I never collected them. I have been in remission since December 2017. \n\nI got married last year, and got pregnant 7 months later! Surprise! My husband and I were shocked, excited, and scared because we did not plan to have kids for a while. Whoops lol :) so far me and baby are perfectly healthy (waiting for an echocardiogram for me since, y\u2019know, damage) I am 29F with stage 2. Prior to starting chemo I spoke with my doctors and a fertility specialist. All were confident that I would be able to get pregnant after ABVD chemo because it is not hard on your reproductive system and told me only 2% of women loss their ability to. Another factor I took into consideration was I would of had to start the process of harvesting the next week and they cannot guarantee how many eggs they would be able to collect. Plus it is really expensive on top of all the other medical bills I would be seeing. My husband and I decided we would rather take the risk. I am more than half way through treatment and am still getting my period. If I become infertile after this we are open to adopting Wow. This is freaking me out. I had 4b at 25 and this was NEVER recommended for me &amp; was told fertility would not be affected. Really scared now because I hope to have kids in the next couple of years ABVD is not considered a significant risk to female or male fertility particularly if the patient is younger than 35. Nearly all women &lt;35yo are expected to regain their pre-treatment hormonal profile within a few months from end of treatment.\n\n( \n\nThe reason we recommend fertility preservation before starting ABVD is for the minority of patients who will end up requiring a second line treatment which is associated with a much higher rate of infertility. As most progression of disease occur early after ABVD the ovaries do not recover and it is impossible to harvest eggs between ABVD and subsequent therapy.\n\nSo in advanced Hodgkin's chances of requiring a second line treatment or transitioning to escBEACOPP is about 15%. With escBEACOPP chances of male/female infertility are very high and with salvage chemotherapy slightly better. Ultimately, by egg harvesting before ABVD a young patient is offsetting an estimated risk of \\`10-15% for infertility.  This is then a discussion with the patient whether 10-15% is an acceptable or unacceptable risk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nErel Joffe MDLymphoma ServiceMemorial Sloan Kettering Cancer CenterComments are for educational purposes only and should not be regarded medical advice 25F stage 2A. I would recommend seeing a fertility specialist. I am really glad I did - I ended up taking Lupron, which essentially shuts down your ovaries temporarily to protect them during chemo. I finished chemo in February, and by March my period had returned. It is a bit irregular now, but I was told it can take up to a year to sort itself out again. Oncologists are experts in cancer, not fertility, so I think it is important to see someone who can walk you through all the options who knows your specific case. I did not have enough time to freeze my eggs. My HL was already spread to a few other organs and they said I could if I wanted but holding off treatment to freeze my eggs could end up making it a type of life or death situation for me. So, I went with life with no possibility of children in the future. If I did end up with a miracle pregnancy I would have to cancel it because not only would the child.not survive but til would not have survived giving birth from all of the complications from chemo/radiation/transplants. Was 26 and had Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma nodule sclerosis stage 3B. ABVD every other week for 8 months. Did not freeze eggs, to be honest i just wanted to live and not go through more procedures to freeze eggs etc. Plus we had to start the chemo right away bc the tumor was so close to my heart they were worried it would affect the heart beat or even stop it.\n\nIn remission for 20 years. About 10 years ago, I had 2 beautiful children naturally with no problems getting pregnant or carrying to term.\n\nGood luck to you \u2764\ufe0f", "How did you get diagnosed? Went to my doctor today for a swollen lymph node (for about 3-4 months) and night sweats (2-3 times a week). He told me he was not worried about the lymph node but found the night sweats weird and ordered blood tests. Can you get diagnosed with blood tests? How did you guys get diagnosed? Thank you!\u2019 They will not give you definite diagnosis from blood test, but may be able to speculate based on the results of SED rate and hemoglobin amount other things.\n\nOfficially diagnosis came for me after a biopsy of the lyphnode in the neck. They have to determine that you have the specific cells that cause HL. I had an ultrasound first which shows nothing. Then had an FNA which they told me there that it did not make up the architecture of cancer.. then they sent in samples to look at it under a powerful microscope. They called and said they found a few cells that represent lymphoma that I had to get the lymph node removed. After surgery, a few days later, they confirmed it as the official diagnosis. Just FYI for me, after one chemo session, night sweats went away. The sweats were the worst for me. I was relieved. I had a swollen lymph node for a few months and decided to get it checked by a doctor. He thought it was odd and ordered an ultrasound. The ultrasound results made my doctor refer me to a surgeon who scheduled an excisional biopsy of the swollen nodes. I was given a choice between steroids to see if the swelling would go down or a biopsy. My surgeon said the steroids would be less invasive but answers could take a few weeks. Ultimately I chose the biopsy because I would get a more definitive answer much more quickly. \n\nIt took about two months or so from the initial doctor's visit to my biopsy where I was finally able to get a diagnosis. Had pneumonia a handful of times.  It was winter in Michigan, not completely out of the question.  Went to Florida on spring break and was so lethargic I asked to go to the ER.  CT was pretty obvious, I will never forget the doc there screaming at my pediatrician on the phone.  Biopsy, port, etc a couple days later. That was a shitty spring break. My blood tests and chest x-ray were normal. I only had fatigue and a swollen lymph node. The  primary care doc I saw was dismissive, but I had family history, so I got a referral to an ENT that eventually excised the lymph node for the biopsy. \n\nA lot of people with HL have crazy stories about diagnosis taking forever because the symptoms can mean a bunch of things separately and it is rare. I would try and be persistent about getting more testing until you get a negative biopsy. Especially if your swollen lymph node is painless, rubbery, and along the collar bone. Those are SUPER related to HL. I had a swollen lymph node under the left side of my jaw. Went to a dentist, had an infected implant so that got removed. The swelling did not go away so the dentist sent me to an ENT who did scans and biopsy. All came back fine and she told me to \"not worry\". She was retiring soon so she did not care much. \nWent back and found a more competent ENT. He did the tests again and called me over within a week or so to tell me about the diagnosis. Told me that I will be fibe and sent me straight to an oncologist. The old ENT was garbage. She put on gloves to check, then someone came in and told her that another patient was outside asking for something. She got up, opened the door with the gloves on, shook the patients hand with the gloves on, came back and shoved the hand in my mouth to check the swelling from the inside of my mouth. I was confused and thinking, wait, did I miss her changing the gloves? \n\nAlso, she would ask me a question and while I was answering, she would just casually put her fingers in my mouth and start probing mid-sentence. I got diagnosed this morning. I had a biopsy surgery last monday. I am honestly just in shock. I am so so so sorry. Fuck cancer. You got this! Praying for you \u2764\ufe0f Thank you. I will be okay I know. Chemo is going to suck tho I had swollen lymph nodes in my neck on December 18th, they did an ultrasound, then a ct scan, a fine needle aspiration, and a excisional biopsy. Next week I have a bone marrow biopsy and a pet scan to determine what stage Hodgkins I have. So about 2 months to figure it all out. I see the oncologist on feb 22 to determine the stage and length of chemo. I wanted a sick day from work I had symptoms sure like night sweats and itchiness but I went to the doc for a medical certificate for work tomorrow wanted 3 days off ended up getting 6 months and chemotherapy, not sure if it was a win or a loss A CT scan for discomfort in the chest region", "Pain after alcohol I am 21f. Basically for rhe last 6 months after I drink alcohol the next day or 2 the lymphnodes in my neck and my armpits are very tender, like clockwork everytime after I  drink they are tender. Its not painful. When I googled it (i know) It said that is one of the signs for Hodgkins. Literally that is the only result that came up. Should I be worried ? I have no other symptoms. I think it is worth getting checked out. I was diagnosed with HL on August 26 of this year. Pain after alcohol was a specific question they asked. Did you have any other symptoms ? A cough that I could reproduce with certain positions. I was stage 2. Even if you do not have other symptoms, I think it is unusual. You know your body. With any luck, if it is anything, you can catch it early. I would get it checked out to see what they have to say. I was diagnosed with HL stage 2 of June this year and it was something they asked. Night sweats where the only symptoms I had. That and rashes that would come and go around the lymph nodes in my neck. Should i be in full panic mode right now ? No, please do not go into panic mode. Like the other person mentioned, you know that something is not right with your body and  worse case if it is something along the lines of lymphoma hopefully it is found early. Are the lymph nodes in your neck swollen at all? For me that was when I started to realize something was not right. Then I started having chest pains and finally got it checked out and that is when they discovered the lymph nodes in my chest where swollen. They dont even get swollen when they r tender after drinking alcohol, they are literally just tender, I went to an urgent care the other day and they said my lymphnodes feel \"a little swollen\" but thags completely normal with the cold weather we are having. Did not sound concerned in the slightest even when I did bring up HL. How swollen were they ? Like visiblly big? or only when you touched them coukd you tell ? The left side of my neck swelled up once to where it was visible and then went down after a day or so. But eventually it got to the point where I would rub that area on my neck and it felt hard and about the size of a walnut.", "I am tired of people telling me I have the \"easy, curable, simple\" cancer. The moment they learn lymphoma has a good recovery rate, their behaviours turn reckless. Please think twice before you say something to a cancer patient. No cancer is easy or painless.  Heck yeah! \n\nABDV are not a fucking walk in the park, neither was three weeks of radiation to the neck. God forbid you get it again and have to do a marrow replacement. True the amount of hospitalization I had to go through was crazy and also had a bone marrow transplant. Easy does not describe it I still have memory problems even in remission for a second time. I have been told how \u201clucky\u201d I am so many times I have lost count. Having cancer in your twenties is not lucky no matter how curable it is Easy it is not my friend. I am an optimistic person by nature, so I always focused on \"curable\" when I was going through ABVD and Radiation. It is something easy to get attached to because people want to have hope. \n\nDo not get too angry with those people, they are just trying to have the most positive outlook they can for you. I know it is something you get sick of hearing, and you have every right to be angry and frustrated, just do not start using those folks as a punching bag to let it out. \n\nBe angry, be sad, cry, yell, scream, get a damnit doll and thrash it around. You have every right to. Just try not to take it out on the people who want to be supportive but do not know any better. Be angry at the cancer, and focus that anger into fighting against it.\n\nStay safe and keep fighting, it is not easy or simple, but you can do it. I feel you friend I had hodgkin's lymphoma right before covid hit. 23 years old had my treatment 6 chemos in I mentally snapped and shit got worse from then anticipatory nausea kicked in went to sit in chair one day vommitted until I passed out, insane shit my man abvd especially the dicarbazine is total ass.

I have not gotten the rest of the reports yet, but had the follow up PET Scan.  \n\n\nThis is what is written: (pls console, suggest, till I get to the doctor's on Monday)  \nThere are few enlarged pre vascular and right para tracheal nodes. The largest nodes are approx. 20 x 18 mm. The nodes are showing low level enhancement. No calcification is noted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nImpression: Present CT reveals few small mediastinal nodes. No seziable abdominal adenopathy or pulmonary parenchymal pathology is noted.   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTHESE ARE 2 MEDICAL, IDK WHAT THEY MEAN! I am sorry, just need opinion to calm myself for 2 days It sounds positive to me - not a professional in any way though Hi, I am not a professional but I have some biology/anatomy knowledge and a few of these terms stick out to me.  I completely understand wanting to understand these better in the few days before you are able to speak to a doctor, so I hope this helps.\n\n- pre-vascular and right para tracheal are just groupings of lymph nodes, they are the nodes in front of a vessel that runs near your trachea and the ones just the the right of your trachea, respectively\n\n-They note that some of them are enlarged, which could be because of almost anything.  The size is pretty small, and there not calcified, which are both pretty good indicators that if you do have HL, it is not very advanced.  (Although, if you have not had a biopsy to tell you it is HL, there is very little reason to believe that you do)\n\n-Adenopathy is just an enlarged node, so the fact that there are not any in your abdomen is a good sign.  If you have had a positive biopsy for HL, a part of the diagnostic criteria for stage 3 is that it is spread to both sides of the diagram, so it being present only on side is a good sign that it is only stage 1 or 2, which are considered VERY VERY treatable\n\n-the term \u201cpulmonary parenchyma\u201d is just a fancy way of saying the functional tissue of your lungs, and having no sign of pathology can only be a good thing \n\nI hope this makes sense and helps you calm your anxiety over the next few days, again I am not a professional I just have some experience with HL and some familiarity with these terms.  Nothing here should be taken over the advice of an actual doctor, it is just some things to tell yourself over the next few days whenever you become to worried :) Thank you so much.\nI had 6 cycles of chemo, and was diagnosed with Stage 4 Chemo.

I am wondering if anyone would let me interview them for a research paper I am writing in my English 101 class. It is about Hodgkin Lymphoma and treatments. It will be 8-10 questions. \nPlease let me know if you are interested. My name\u2019s Selina. :)\nThank you! Sure...I have been interviewed by a few organizations regarding it. I do not mind talking to you about it. Happy to answer questions if you still need someone I found someone. Thank you guys so much though!", "I Have A Hero I Call Him Dad Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma Warrior Shirt ", "How to Say No To Things On Your Bad Days So I am asking on behalf of my partner. He is on Cycle 5 of ABVD chemotherapy. He usually is super sick and out of commission from the day of treatment and 5-6 days after. He sleeps a lot, is super nauseous, vomiting, etc. \n\nHis family however, seems to be mad at him for not visiting or missing events due to chemo and its after effects. They say \u201cyou can be sick at home or be sick with us\u201d as a way to guilt him. A very important get-together is scheduled in a few weeks (two days after his treatment) and he is nervous about going because he knows he will be sick and not able to visit. I am worried he will overextend himself and have a tougher time recovering. However, his family will be mad if he is absent. \n\nI see how toxic this is and how it stresses him out. They do not make many efforts to see him (we are about a 2 hour drive away) and do not understand how sick he gets...I am the only one who sees that side. But they get mad when he cancels plans due to being sick. You would think they would be more understanding...Any advice on what to do or how to handle this situation? I have a feeling he will not end up going and they will be upset...But I also want what is best for him and his health. Thanks in advance for your help. That is a really crappy situation they are putting him in but it is so important that he listens to his body. If he is sick and does not feel like going he should absolutely stay home. Boundaries are very important and I understand how frustrating that is to make family mad. If you feel comfortable enough it you will need to have a serious talk with the family and explain how hard chemo is on his body and how sick he gets. Nobody wants to be sick around anyone else. He is also almost done and soon will be feeling well enough to see them. Maybe plan something afterwards Damn they sound like a holes. I would usually make plans with people as normal but preface it with a disclaimer that the plans are contingent on how I am feeling that day and I may cancel same day. Idk if that is considered rude or not but it worked for me. Doing chemo made me less concerned with pleasing people They sound like dicks. Can you reach out and talk to them privately and let them know he is just not up to going and the guilt is not helping him? Remind them he has fucking cancer and the chemo makes him want to lay in bed all day and that they can visit him of they want to see him instead of making him go to them and feel bad for not making it there. Good lord. I am so sorry. I was in the worst place ever after my fifth round of ABVD. I agree with the tell them he has fucking cancer and is literally being poisoned in high doses to kill off cells in his body. He deserves to rest at home. \n\nI am just so sorry. In reality they will never be happy. They will not be happy if he stays home and they will not be happy if he is there and then does not do anything but sleep. These people sound toxic as hell. I do not know if there is anything you can do to really make them happy. I would just stay home and deal with the fallout when he is healthy again. That is really shitty of them. He already is going through such a hard time of beating cancer and going through such a rigorous treatment. The ordeal that takes on not only the body but the mind is insane. His needs and requirements should be top priority and clearly they do not get that, but they expect him to be a giver during that time which is extremely selfish. They cannot guilt him into not being available for them during the time he needs support the most. I cannot tell you what decision would be the right for the two of you but I have to say he is really lucky to have you. Soon this will be in the past and you both will be creating wonderful happy memories together. Yea that is rough.  I had 4 cycles (8 abvd infusions) and while it was not the worst thing in the world for me, I was for sure out of commission for 5 days.  Reading an email was exhausting.  Watching tv was exhausting.  Walking downstairs to eat was a small victory.  So I feel for your situation.  I wish they could be more understanding.  I would say try to reflect their feeling of missing him cause that is where it is coming from.  Maybe with kindness they will put their guard dow and realize they are being unreasonable?  May not play out that way I understand, but worth a try?  Best wishes to you and your family", "Armpit itching Does anyone have an tips to subside armpit itching? It is never ending and nothing helps. Talk to your oncologist, it could be a side effect of one of your meds or whatever else you might be on. Usually they know how to help you out.", "How did you find out you had hodgkins lymphoma?  I found a lump on my collarbone. Went to my doctor and he said it was probably nothing. Came down ill with something (hot flushes, tiredness) which doctors could not really put their finger on (guessed it might have been \"viral hepatitis\"). I mentioned the lump again in case it was linked, and got an ultrasound scan followed by a biopsy. I was diagnosed soon after that. \n\nTo this day I am still not sure if the hepatitis thing was linked to the lymphoma. I was losing weight really fast and was have bed drenching night sweats. I casually went in to the doctor and they called for a chest X-ray and blood work. I have a bulky mass in my chest, a little in my neck, and a little near my hip. After ABVD I no longer glow on a PET scan. The mass in my chest put pressure on a major vein and caused me to pass out. Led to an x-ray, ct scan and biopsy that confirmed it was lymphoma. I also had night sweats for the first two days after passing out. I had a recurrent dry cough that I could reproduce. Felt like the wind got knocked out of me every time. Turns out I had a giant mass in my chest. I had a bump on my neck for over 5 months. Stayed the same size for a long time. Had zero symptoms I went to the doctor and told me I had nothing.\nAtleast a month later my mom was getting worried that the bump was still there. We went to the doctor and I got diagnosed with stage 2 Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. I am officially in remission and will get my port removed soon. I hope this helps and I want you to stay strong. If you have suspicions of cancer please go no matter what. I am glad my mom told me to go because I completely lost care for it and dismissed it. If my mom had not made a appointment I would probably not have made it past my teenage years. I am 16 now How big was the bump?", "hair loss and hopeful humor? (19f)  So, i was recently diagnosed with cHL, stage 2, and after i have my visits with the fertility specialist, i was told i am going to have my first two chemo treatments, ABVD, then get my pet scan for further treatments and allat (everything kind of came up so fast and off i am not wording these right feel free to correct me)\n\nAnyway, my doctor told me that hair loss is more than likely going to happen, which really is not a big concern for me, I was more so curious about any of you guys/gals who had hair loss, or even if you did not have any hair loss?\n\nI was thinking of getting my hair cut the same time as my little brother, the same style as him, because if i am not going to have it, might as well play around with it, right? I was 26 F cHL 2b when I had chemo. I got hair loss after the second chemo. Not terrible but enough to notice. It would come off in the shower or if I ran my hands through it. My hair felt like it was turning into hay. I ended up getting a cute short hair cut then next chemo I shaved it. Honestly, it felt really liberating. I never went shiny head bald but all the oils were coming off/out so shaving it felt really refreshing. I ended up shaving it a couple times during treatment. My husband got me some head oil that men use? Sounds weird but Aveda make it and it felt like lotion. I had purchased a wig but never used it. At some point you look in the mirror and not recognize you. For me it was funny how weird I looked but always new I would look like me again in the future. Some people find that stage hard but I embraced it. Good luck! Everything feels very fast and overwhelming but you can do it! I regret not doing some crazy hair dye ahead of time. Do the hair cut! Regardless if your hair falls out or not, it gets so dry you will want to cut it off anyway. Girl, for starters i know it must have been rough going through everything, hell it is still wild to believe that a lot of people have to go through some horrible things but that is a whole other topic, and honestly i feel like the hardest part would be the not recognizing yourself/myself, but hey i am just trying to make the most of it all, i will definitely do some crazy hair stuff in the meantime to keep me busy and to keep up good spirits, thank you fr for your comment\u2764\ufe0f I 32 (m) shaved my head the week before my first chemo treatment. I took my hair on my own accord, not when chemo decided to fuck with it. \n\nI would wear knit caps because it was winter and acceptable to have that look (and it was warm). Yeah definitely not going to have a medicine take my hair for me either, hoping you had a good recovery man:)\n\nand shoot if that is what helped im going to need to find some comfy ones for this winter:) Bananas will due for some cool looks in the near future haha Once the chemo stopped it was an easy recovery for me. I did ABVD for 6 rounds (12 total infusions). I am\nstill cold, apparently that is a thing after major surgery and cancer treatments (who knew) \n\nMy advice: start taking miralax the day you start chemo. Drink plenty of water, do not stop moving (even if it is just walking), pay attention to your mental health, depression made my treatment terrible. \n\nTreatment sucks but it does not have to be terrible if you take care of yourself. Sounds like your in a healthy mindset right now! Hi! I am 22, female, and went through the same :) Was diagnosed with stage II cHL in January and went through 8 ABVD chemos, now in remission.\n\nI was initially really scared about losing my hair, ngl. I went through ups and downs, until the first chemo came about. I did not start shedding until three weeks after my first chemo (so about a few days after your second one).\n\nIn any case, I decided I was not going to wait until my hair started falling to play with it, as you said. It is true that a few people do not experience hair loss, but the vast majority do, so I would say that the best thing to do is to get in the mindset that it will fall and do something about it.\n\nSo I went to the hairdresser a day before my first chemo and asked for a short haircut, and I actually loved it! It is also a lot more manageable if and when your hair starts falling. It will also give you an idea for how it will look once you start growing it back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wrote an article on my experience with hair loss and chemo, in case you are interested, hope it can help you :) (\n\nWishing you all the best! Treatment is rough but it will be over sooner than you think ;) Also, if you have instagram, I highly recommend following **thecancerpatient**, it will help loads with humour going through treatment. I know I laughed at so many of their memes :) i will definitely take your advice into consideration and probably follow with it, thank you so much\u2764\ufe0f with all my free time i have i will definitely check out that article you made, and thank you for replying i really admired hearing about your experience, even though it was probably hell going through it, you got through it and that is what matters love\u2764\ufe0fAlso wishing you the best while you are in remission\u2764\ufe0f Hello fellow stage 2 CHL! I have 1 treatment left of my 12, I did ABVD for my first 4 then after my clear pet scan I dropped to finish the last 8 with AVD. I cut my hair short prior to chemo then buzzed it down a week after my first treatment which I am very glad I did because the short hairs I had left started coming out like crazy quickly after my 2nd treatment. I do get peach fuzz that grows back but it would look awful if I attempted to grow it out so I just razor it down weekly in the shower. I lost my eyebrows and eyelashes after my 8th treatment. My husband had 2b classic Hodgkin's and did abvd at 26. The hair on his head thinned to the point I worried he sunburn a bit but he still had coverage. His eyebrows and eyelashes were never affected. He already had fuzz filling in by the time he started radiation. He may be an unusual case but he was thankful he did not shave it all off in the beginning. Hi! I am 22F and just finished treatment for stage 2A CHL. I did 6 rounds of a clinical trial (that included doxorubicin which I think is mostly responsible for hair loss). My hair started to fall out about a month and half in, it was a huge amount the first day and then steady chunks from there on out. I cut it to shoulder length and even though it is very thin now it still looks decent. I had Stage 2 Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkins when I was 21m (33m now). Had ABVD chemo for 5 months, radiation treatment for 2 months, and a few surgeries. \n\nLike other commenters I took my own hair after a couple of treatments. It began to be too frustrating finding clumps in the shower and I started to thin really really bad and my scalp became sensitive. Some work friends and I all did it together so it was sorta fun \u2764\ufe0f So, my doctor told me to not immediately cut my hair because even with ABVD the amount of hair loss can vary. I took his advice because I had very, very long and thick hair that I had been growing out for about 2 years so it would be long for my wedding (which was set to take place in March 2021 / chemo began in July 2020). I did loose A LOT of hair\u2026 probably about 60-75%. However, I did not lose it all. I had enough left that once I stopped treatment in November, I was able to wait and let it stop falling out. That happened mid-December. Then, at the end of December, I got Natural Beaded Rows extensions. They totally filled in the lost fullness on my head and covered a lot of my bald spots. The best part is that as my hair grows back, I have been able to look the same! I have not had to deal with the awkward short stages. I kept my little bit of remaining long hair, and when paired with my long extensions my new baby hairs blend in well! After two cycles of ABVD, my hair had considerably thinned and I had a few bald patches on my head, but that was it. I also did not lose lashes, eyebrows, or other body hair on this regimen. \n\nHowever, I had to do two more cycles of escalated BEACOPP afterwards, and with this regimen, I lost all of my hair, my eyebrows and lashes thinned out noticeably and I also lost all of my body hair. Unfortunately you probably know by now, that hair loss is almost inevitable for most.  My 15 year old son had stage 2 Hodgkin Lymphoma ABVD CHEMO for 10 months but he lost his hair after the first couple of treatments.  He dyed it a ruby red color like an anime character before it started to fall out.  He later revealed to me that he wanted to color it so it would not seem real when if fell out.  We ended up shaving his head then because it was coming out in clumps.  Best of luck to you.  I know it is miserable.  You should literally do WHATEVER you feel like doing because you are going to endure so much the least you can do is make your self happy with a weird hair cut or color! How is he now? Is he living a normal life? Hey I had stage 1 CHL but treated as stage two. Surprisingly my hair lasted up until my very last treat. The last round of chemo just knocked out the last I had. I eventually started to look like Cynthia from the rugrats so I decided to cut my hair short (not bald). It was a completely new experience for me. I never thought that I would ever cut my hair but it grew on me and gave me more confidence in myself! He feels 100% it took him about 6 months to get his energy levels back but my a year he was feeling completely back to normal. His only complications are low sperm count/motility, weird nerve pains at his biopsy scar and he does have lung damage from the bleo. It normally would not come up but has made us extremely cautious with the pandemic. Other than switching to a remote job life is normal again. He is about to turn 30 and we just started our family via IVF! 37m. I just started to get some patchy thinning that looked pretty bad, so I shaved my head.", "Could this be cancer?  Chicken nugger is way better", "Concerned? Hi, hope this is allowed.\n\nI am a 22F and I am a bit concerned that my doctor is missing something. Please hear me out as this may come across as weird\u2026.it is to my doctor too. \n\nA bit about my symptoms:\n- Bone/nerve/ muscle pain\n- migraines\n- extreme fatigue \n- lip lesions\n- major weakness \n- low white blood cells for over 3 years (never gone up to normal)\n- Raynauds (diagnosed)\n- shakes and numbness in hands and leg\n- swollen neck glands that have not gone down in 5 months\n- mouth ulcers\n- tonsillitis often \n- new lower back pain \n- tachycardic when standing/ exercising \n- constant hyperthermic body temperature \n\nSo, all this started 3 years ago when my doctor found that my white blood cells were so very low. These symptoms I was having for about 6 months beforehand. I was sent to a hemotologist after 3 more tests weeks later showed my wbc still low. I see the hemotologist and he thinks it was lupus after doing tests. I get sent to a rheumatologist who then does testing. Get told by her it is not lupus at all. So I go back to my doctor and she said we should wait it out for 6 months and see if anything changes.\n\nNothing changes, symptoms get worse. WBC tests come back worse, never changing, always low. She sends me back to the hemotologist who then thinks it is cyclin neutropenia\u2026..but he sends me to a immunologist (Because he thinks it is lupus). Immunologist says he does not know what it is and he cannot help me.\n\nI got thrown from my doctor to specialist after specialist for 3 years. 5 months ago I had an MRI to rule out MS, everything came back normal however they pointed out a lot of my lymph nodes in my neck were swollen. Since then I have been having bloods done frequently and all wbc are coming back low still. The doctor feels my neck each time and is quite concerned because none have gone down and others are getting bigger. \n\nWe are in a cross roads as my doctor does not know what is going on and my hemotologist sent a letter to my doctor saying he cannot help me because he has never seen anything like it and does not know what the cause is.\n\nSo the question, have any of you experienced this? Or something similar? Does this sound like another hemotologist may find something? I worry because my doctor originally thought it was Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma.\n\nSorry it is long :) If your doctor is so concerned about the bumps in your neck then ask them for a biopsy. You are not going to get a certain hit from bloodwork but you will from a biopsy. did you get any test? i am no doctor so i cant say anything but some of your symptoms overlap with some of mine, some dont. i dont think you can narrow it down to hodgkins.\n\nget a histochemistry of the nodes i guess Oh I did not actually think of getting her to do I biopsy. Thank you! I have had a billion tests over the last 3 years, it is insane. I had two major lots taken at the hospitals as that is the only place they could be done. It is just a complicated thing as no one knows what is going on.", "To port or not to port 6 ABVD recommend to wife. She is contemplating getting a port installed or stick to IV.\nI am suggesting to do port but then others have her ears as well who say otherwise.\nWhat is the right thing to do? From what I hear many people who go the IV route end up getting a port eventually anyways. There can be complications with a port like infection or it can just stop working. Overall for most people they work really well. My husband is thankful he got his. He is a year and a half out of treatment and will keep his in for another year or so until he is a little farther out from treatment. I received 8 ABVD infusions all through iv. 100% worth it! Much easier if you do not mind needles, which after a month I would hope you would not. That is the main case I see for a port or for the burning sensations of the veins with iv. \n\nThey dealt with the irritation by changing the vein that got the iv. They used the same one the first three infusions. No issues after they started rotating veins. Bear in mind 6 ABVD cycles is actually 12 infusions, and chemo can damage the veins and make them much harder to use so as treatment goes on it can be difficult to stick with IV for that whole time. From having done both my recommendation would be a port, the procedure is quite quick and once it is in and healed she should not have to worry too much about it, the doctors can use it for both chemo and taking bloods and she can get some numbing cream for before they stick her I enjoyed the port made the process easy, one stick every time and it was in. Highly recommend a port 100% port,ABVD (the V specifically) causes necrosis of the veins which is why they give it slowly and dilute it. It can lead to a lot of pain,burning sensation and vein damage. Port essentially allows them to put the chemo into a much larger vein closer to the heart which dilutes the chemo very quickly and you have less vein related issues. Agreed. Actually my oncologist did not allow me to not have a port because of this. An alternative for short Chemo is also a Picc Port. Quicker to deploy with less pain, but you have to tubes dingling on your arm and its more maintenace in the Hospital needed. An alternative for short Chemo is also a Picc Port. I am a veterinarian (and awaiting my PET scan) and we are taught on oncology if the A (doxorubicin) extravasates in a dog, the results are horrific.  My onco thinks I may be on the low number of cycles and if that is the case we are going to consider a picc line vs a port but have not decided yet. I am almost done with my 6 cycles (12 treatments) of ABVD and love my port. It took about a week or two to not be sore and now I forget it is there. Makes infusions so much easier and quicker. I had 8 rounds of ABVD. I got my port two days before my first chemo. The port made sleeping uncomfortable, it make normal bras uncomfortable/impossible to wear, and I hated tasting the saline flush each time someone accessed it. However, it was 100% better than being stuck in the arm so much and risking the complications of having issues with my veins.\n\nAlso, I was worried about the scar on my chest, but now it is 6 months since I got it removed and the scar is not too noticeable. I had a PICC line in my arm for treatment. So much better for the veins, rather than having to get a cannula in every time for an infusion. yoo i was told after treatment there is also this option of port \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude25\ud83d\ude25\ud83d\ude25. In India all hospitals dont follow the port option. It fucking hurts. each time. my skin is thick or say im kind of healthy so nurses have a real hard time detecting nerves. i ve seen expert nurses take their time with me. and bad ones like bled out my hand. it was the most horrible part for me.\n\nevery other week, they stab you in the arm. but no that is not enough. they remove the needle and stab you with force at the same place. last chemo was hell and i just cried.they bled me out from three points very near to each other. can say i know a fraction of what it might feel like getting shot multiple times lol. sososso SO, the moral of the story is...it might seem to be painful, bad and might hurt. But the very reason is so that the IV hell does not hurt as much. my hands still remeber the painful stabbing and the pang as soon as the chemo would start. I have just had a PICC inserted yesterday and start ABVD in two days for 6 months. I am considered a small adult which means a long length of the line hangs from my arm. \n\nAny recommendations for sleeping/ showering/ clothing? The port has been a lifesaver for me! Worth the time and surgery to get it. My oncologist did not even give me a choice with getting a port I wish I had an option:( Get the port, IV is so scary I had 6 rounds of ABVD. Strongly recommend the port. It never bothered me much once you get used to it. I did have small children that would grab a hold of it off and on, but even that was not painful. \nHaving a port is so much better considering how many times you will get poked throughout the process. Taking blood, scans, treatments. I still had plenty of arm sticks for all kinds of things, but the port does minimize it. \nI found it almost painless to access and it is not sore after like multiple sticks in your arm. I got a port, I did 8 months of ABVD. Strongly suggest the port.", "I am a bit worried about this Have been sick (very fatigued, struggling to eat, itchy everywhere) for a few months but it got really bad in the last few weeks. Went to my doctor and she said my BP was high and my liver was low in position. I was sent to hospital but my tests (urine and blood) came back with nothing. I will be getting scans on my neck because my doctor found a sizeable lump there. I also have lumps in my head and leg. She said at best it is an infection and at worst it is hodgkins. Im not a worrier for medical things but should I prepare myself for the fact it may be cancer? Has anyone here been diagnosed even if they thought they were relatively well? Until the doctor said I need more tests I had assumed I had an allergy to something. I do not care if it is negative comments I just want to prepare myself really. How did others feel before being diagnosed? I had night sweats for months, some labored breathing, and then rashes and severe peeling on my scalp.\n\nHonestly, not all that worrisome before my 2B diagnosis. I have been having night sweats and day sweats too. Breathing is okay but I am a smoker so it is never been 100% anyway. I had a very large mass between my lungs and throat so mileage may vary. How did they find it? I have been told depending on my neck ultra sound I may need a biopsy. I actually went in for an exam after worrying I has psoriasis. Happened to notice a swollen lymph node. Then got an ultrasound on my neck, noticing a bulge in my throat. Then a CT scan finding an 8 inch mass in my chest. Then a biopsy on the lymph node.\n\nA very weird and scary couple of weeks...but Hodgkins, even in later stages, is very treatable. Hoping my neck scan will be fine. But if not then I feel relatively okay about possible hodgkins. I know it is treatable (although also aggressive). I am an over thinker though and already worried about if I have to tell my friends and sister. Friends are worriers, and my twin sister is a diagnosed hypochondriac so if I am ill then she will surely have a freak out. Going to try and not think of it until I get my scan though. I just want to be prepared. Thank you very much for replying and I hope you keep well. Best of luck. I am 4 years clear after chemo and radiation and feeling good. Happy to answer questions anytime. Mu husband at 26 had no symptoms other than an enlarged lymph node on one side of his neck. It looked like he had really been working out one deltoid. He was told the same thing best case weird infection worst case Hodgkin's. He started with an ultrasound with some borderline red flags and moved on to a biopsy that confirmed HL. After a PET scan and bone marrow biopsy he was diagnosed with 2B unfavorable. After 6 months of chemo and about 5 weeks of radiation he is been in remission a year now. It was a long shitty 10 months but only took about 6 months for him to feel normal again after treatment. A year and a half later and you would not even know he had cancer. \n\nTwo things they will tell you a needle biopsy is less invasive but they are more likely to come up with a false negative. An excisional biopsy where they take a good chunk out gives a clearer answer. Also if you are interested in having children later it might be worth it to look into fertility preservation. After chemo and radiation we were not able to have kids regularly. Luckily we had a successful first round of ivf though and are expecting a boy in April. \n\nFor a timeline reference my husband was diagnosed November of 2018 did chemo December through May, radiation in July and was cleared October 2019. It was not easy and his mental health is still a struggle but he is alive and healthy! If you do have HL it has one of the highest survival rates. I was hiking, mountain biking, and skiing off cliffs right up until days before my first chemo. I was \u201crelatively well\u201d but the nodes in my neck swelled up, which is what got me into the doctors.\n\nI had a 7cm mass in my chest which affected my breathing, and had noticed weird burping/swallowing issues which were probably from pressure from the nodes in my neck. I had noticed a slight decrease in my exercise ability (like \u201chuh, that was harder than I remember\u201d on a few occasions) and increase in fatigue, (like needing naps after exercise were becoming almost certain) but I thought it was a relapse of mono brought on by the stress of buying a house, moving and planning a wedding. \n\n\nMy biggest sign was I was incredibly itchy. Like one of my hair brushes turned into a scratching brush for my legs. I had no idea and again thought it was the new house. My blood work was fairly normal. \n\nIf any of these ring a bell, it would not hurt to mentally prepare yourself. This was my biggest concern too. It helps to tell one person, and have them tell other people, or do it all at once if possible. It takes the emotional burden off your already very full plate. Thank you for sharing your story, very comforting. Hopefully it is not hp but if it is I am glad it is one of the more treatable cancers. I am away from family due to university so only have my friends with me right now and I have only told them it could be an infection. Decided not to tell anyone the alternative just in case it is nothing I do not want to cause unneeded worry. I am so glad your husband is okay and congratulations on the baby! I very much want kids so will for sure be preserving my eggs if the news is bad. I relate to this very much. I have been sleeping way more than usual but it is been broken sleep, I lie down and I get neck and chest pain which wakes me up. I have to nap every day. The itchiness has been a torment, funny though you mention hair brush because I have been doing the exact same thing! There is not a spot on my body that has not been scratched with my hairbrush. I have been very nauseous which is terrible but honestly it is the itching that is the worst right now. I have been preparing for the worst by watching YouTube videos of people\u2019s diagnoses story and it is made me feel better about the possibility. If I am being honest it is not the actual fact I court have hp that scares me but more the fact that if I have it then I will have to put up with being poked and prodded with needles constantly - I have a big fear if needles. Thanks for the reply, genuinely means a lot. I have not even mentioned the fact it could be hp to anyone yet. I am going to wait until I know either way. If it is then I have no idea how I will tell people but that is a good suggestion having someone else do it for me. Thank you. Hopefully it will not come to that though but we shall see. I did that too, but at the very end felt the need to just tell someone to help relieve the burden. I am so glad I did. I chose my two best friends. I highly recommend telling someone so you can talk to them about it.", "Crash course in Hodgkinslymphoma Playing basketball with my nephew in the yard. I am 46 he is 11.

I had an abscessed tooth all of a sudden. Then it began to throb. Back molar. I lost a portion of it maybe two weeks before this and was going to have it worked on. That Sunday night with my tooth on fire, crashing headache and woke up in a sweat as though I was laying in a river bed. Sick again on my stomach. Monday I pulled myself together and went to the dentist. Oh that tooth is infected. I never been allergic to amoxicillin. So between that and a script for Vicodin, we will pull it on Thursday. I spent three days in the condition. Upon waking up Thursday the amoxicillin made me look like I was shot by rock salt. I am a mess. Still cannot eat, my pee looks like coffee and yes my poo was like grey pudding. I go to the dentist on what energy I can. Blam, pulls it no problem. Friday I felt a little better. Probably phasing out the pain killers. My brother visited me Saturday and said \u201c man your eyes are yellow \u201c also the allergic reaction to amoxicillin was coursing through me like the gates of hell. I went to county hospital. Within an hour I was transferred to the city hospital. My room was already ready. I was disoriented and was just kept being fed saline drip one after the other. Next morning I was prepped for a stent to be installed between my liver and pancreas. After 5 different thorough tests. Veins - heart - lung - brain - liver, two biopsy one inconclusive then a second one that determined \u201c stage 3 Hodgkin Lymphoma \u201c of the lower extremity. 12 days since I played basketball with my nephew on that day, 98k hospital bill, a matrix Neo chest port. I been already administrated my first two rounds of chemo. I went upon release for the marrow infusion shot ( layman\u2019s terms ) and they warned me within a few days I would develop a bone neuropathy effect. With in 12 days from a bolt from beyond. I do not know how to process. This is all in a nutshell. I am looking at 8 months two session each / two boosters a month. I have so many questions. I had never been a drug seeking person but between all the drugs that were giving to me in the hospital it is usually clockwork I wake up 4 am with a crashing headache and night sweat. I am so sorry to hear you are going through this. I was diagnosed almost exactly 13 months ago, but at an earlier stage (2A) and I have completed chemotherapy.\n\nI know that this is probably all very shocking to you, but hopefully, your doctors have explained that HL is usually curable (even at a higher stage). \n\nI have talked with a lot of people with HL and many of them found that the night sweats subsided fairly early on in the chemotherapy. But you should definitely talk to your team about the headaches. Many of the medications they might have prescribed can cause headaches as a side effect, and there is no need for you to suffer from crashing headaches when a simple change in medication could solve the problem.\n\nFor my part, I had terrible headaches after my first chemotherapy infusion, but it turned out to be caused by one of the anti-nausea meds they were giving me, so after they changed to a different med, I never had a headache again. \n\nI am not sure if you are on any online support groups, but the Reddit group is pretty small and not very active. If you want an active online community, I highly recommend the Facebook Hodgkins Lymphoma group, they have several thousand members, and a post like yours would have dozens of responses from other HL sufferers within the first hour.\n\nGood luck with your treatments! My daughter had this and the night sweats were very bad. The only thing that made her\nBody feel normal and be able to eat was marijuana.

Had his port put in today-but I have a question (yes, it is written down for his oncologist-just thought I would try here in the interim)...his CT showed lesions on his liver, and vertebrae, as well as all lymph nodes. From my understanding-if that is all the Hodgkin lymphoma, it should all go away with his treatment, correct? I had tumors all in my neck, chest, and abdomen that went away with treatment (I was stage 4). Definitely talk to your oncologist for more clarification though First of all, sorry to hear about your son\u2019s diagnosis.  While Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma is a treatable cancer, the process is scary.  I do not think I had lesions (or I may not have understood that I had them) but my treatment has definitely rid me of Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma.  I do not think that answers your question though.

Will I live up to my 80s and 90s I am only 16 and got diagnosed with stage 2 Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. I know there is a high chance I will be cured. But how high are those chances? I have so many things I want to do when I grow up. They say survival rate is over 5 years but why not 10 or 20? Do you really get your life cut in half? Please answer. I know it is scary, but please know that hodgkins  lymphoma  is one of the most treated types of cancer there is. I was diagnosed at 18 with stage 2 (after having it for over 6 months) and I am coming to 18 years remission this October. One of my moms coworkers was in remission for 40 years and still going strong when my mom retired and lost contact with everyone. \n\nTake time to process, and be with those who bring you comfort. Ask all the questions you have to your oncologist and know there are so many survivors out there! I have read that they give you the five year survival rates because it is easiest to track. A lot of people stop seeing their oncologist after they have been clear for a few years or they end up moving so it can be hard to keep accurate records past that. So when it comes to research and statistics they just do not have as much data beyond five years. It does not mean that you are at a higher risk at five years or that you only have five years. Luckily HL is one of the oldest known most researched cancers so the treatment is straight forward and the statistics are good. Since my husband was diagnosed we have met several people who survived HL 10, 20, and even 30 years ago. I know it is scary to think about the future but my husband is 28 now I just tell myself that if he has late side effects of chemo and radiation even 40 years from now science and medicine will be even more advanced then to treat them.  Hope that helps, this is not a death sentence. Thank you so much! Do not even think about this twice. After 5 years you are considered cured. Relapse after they is extraordinarily rare. You are going to live until your 80s or 90s. Oh my! We have a similar story. I was also diagnosed at 18 and am into my 18th year of remission. Says a lot about how good treatment was, even almost twenty years ago!\n\nOP, ditto to above. This is not easy, but there is so much hope and wonderful doctors. Find one you can trust and talk to. Take care of yourself. Glad you were able to reach out here and connect :) To my understanding, the studies measure successful treatment rates (rates of remission) until 10 years post treatment but not after. \nI was also really confused by this was I was diagnosed.

Im a Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma survivor at 16 and plan on adding a lot of blueberries to my protein shakes since they carry a lot of health benefits like reduced heart disease and apparently reduce the chance of getting cancer. As someone who does not want to relapse or get a secondary cancer is it true? Depends.\na) you are just going to eat blueberries while you eat a bunch of sugary garbage along with processed carb/fat heavy stuff while sitting in front of a tv all day.\n\nOr\n\nb) you are going to work out and eat healthy while keeping your stress levels low. \n\nIn either case, its everything else that you do that would matter more than just some blueberries. Eating healthy in general along with working out will have a far bigger impact than any single food item. That being said, you should ask your doctor what they think would help you specifically since everyone is different. \nAlso, I saw your post before and I do not know what is on your mind right now, but if you would like someone to talk to, you could DM me. Largely this. Yes, blueberries have great health benefits but the are not a silver bullet. Focus on eating low inflammation diet, and getting exercise. Eat as much fresh/unprocessed good as possible and limit your added sugar intake. As the classic saying goes, everything in moderation! I have always been super into high antioxidant foods, but   now there is mixed findings(from what I have seen) about the relationship between free radicals and cancer.

Thanks Whilst some of your symptoms correlate with those of lymphoma,there could be any number of reasons for them like thyroid issues,underlying infection etc. Since the appointment is next month keep a diary of your symptoms to see if there any changes in the mean time. It will also help make your case with the doctor if you get brushed off as does happen sometimes. \n\nIt seems like you have had the symptoms for awhile now so if you can see the doctor sooner than next month that would probably be better. Thanks. I am not to concerned, I seen the statistics and lymphoma well still bad is still curable. Just trying to get other information to tell my wife it could be something else. She is one of those people who is a webmd doctor and finds anything that is the worst case scenario. She is been freaking out. I appreciate it. Maybe I can tell her some of that and she will relax until I get home next week. \n\nReally do appreciate the info. Si, well. Did you do the tests? How did it go?

After 6 months my CT scan showed that my mass had grown a bit, but my doctor was not too concerned about it since my sediment levels were normal and so we are my bloodwork. Then later after my 1 year I got another one done (which was like 2 months ago) it showed that my mass had grown even more! And now he is concerned, wants me to do another PET and biopsy bc he thinks I have relapsed or it is another cancer or my thyroid. Idk so many things that it could be.

So quite a difference! This time I am experiencing no symptoms I even workout a lot with no issues and feel great after.

But not Lymphoma. So as a relative and potential carer I would be eternally grateful and absolutely love tips and tricks that I can suggest if anyone has any. \n\nAlso, is it common to be sent biopsy results but not have them be explained beyond a definitive diagnosis of HL? The results are, as with any cancer diagnosis, terrifying (THRLBCL transformation, CD20 positive etc) and they continue to Google which is showing pretty dismal results everywhere but they have to wait the next 5 days before there is a \u2018next step\u2019 and further information.

Although, sometimes an oncologist can be a hematologist too. \nI got my results pretty quickly and my oncologist called me when he found out and explained the diagnosis and next steps. Of course we talked about it further in our next appointment, but I am glad he called me as soon as he found out. It is odd that your family member did not get an explanation. \n\nAnd as for care giving, I appreciated those who wanted to help other than my parents. The most helpful things were meals! Home made bread *chefs kiss.* People would make us food and drop it off so I would not have to smell it being cooked, especially right after chemotherapy. My wife works in a hospital lab (US). With my biopsy the hematologist would see it first then send it to the pathologist to confirm diagnosis. I have no idea why you would go back to step one after having the results. \n\nNow my pathologist told me I had HL and he told me about possible outcomes (not 100% but not as bad as pancreatic etc) but told me that the oncologist is going to have a far better idea and there will be more scans to better determine the scale of the disease. \n\nTry not to google stuff. That is not going to help anyone and could even freak you out and panic you more than necessary.\n\nEdit. And for things being helpful someone went in on a cleaning lady for me and my house. That was the most helpful thing to have someone come and clean my house when I was at infusion so that my wife did not have to focus on cleaning in addition to every other thing she had to pick up while I was getting treatment My doctor is a primary hematologist, but they work in a national cancer institute so they only work in oncology. I would stick with the hematologist.   \n\n\nIf you still have questions about your biopsy results, call your original provider back and see if you can come back in! Most of the time they are totally understanding, that is if they think their specialty can answer your questions. \\+1 for cleaning. Coming over and just vacuuming, cleaning common surfaces, washing the sheets, washing the dishes in the sink, cleaning the stove, picking up dog poop in the backyard, washing the toilets and showers to help prevent me from getting sick, if they are not too picky, washing and folding the laundry. This probably helped the most since it would be super expensive to pay someone else to do this (vs. like meals) and with the pandemic it is something you have to have someone in your house to do, and knowing and trusting whoever is coming in your house made me feel much safer than having a stranger come do it. It is surprisingly not as expensive as people think it is. We paid $150 a month and this lady did almost everything on your list but folding laundry. It was twice a month and even that helped more than you would think. \n\nCovid really messed that up for sure. My chemo sessions are in the haematology center and doctor is a haematologist too but he is also in one other dept. (Sorry I am unsure of details, just doing what I need to do without taking in extra info. Haha) T cell rich histocyte rich B cell lymphoma (TCRHR-BCL) is a actually a subtype of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) often as a transformation from nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma (NLPHL).\n\nFirst, regarding this lymphoma subtype. DLBCL including TCRHR-BCL are highly curable diseases with a lot of treatment options. Standard treatment with rituximab + cyclophosphamide + doxorubicin + vincristine (RCHOP) given once every 3 weeks for 6 cycles (less if the disease is very localized). This RCHOP treatment alone (i.e. before we consider 2nd, 3rd and 4th line treatments) has a cure rate of 70-80% with very good options for those 20-30% of patients who fail to acheive a complete response or relapse. The treatment is not fun, of course, but is quite tolerable (nothing like what you see in the movies).\n\nI would recommend consulting a leading cancer center specializing in lymphoma and with a strong pathology department to verify the diagnosis as the treatment for NLPHL that has not transformed to TCRHR-BCL may be \"lighter\".\n\nThere are benign hematologist (treating problems like anemia, clotting issues, etc.) and hematologist-oncologist (treating lymphoma, leukemia, myeloma, etc.). You were referred to the latter.\n\nThe fact that you had received the pathology report prior to a consult with your physician is very distressing. In the USA there is now a pressure on hospitals to automatically release all reports to the patients within 48 hours, making it difficult for us to consult them before they get the reports. This approach, I think, is driven by past events that important lab/imaging/pathology reports were lost and not communicated to patients or because of a thought that this is better care. I find that it causes a lot of distress to patients.\n\nGood luck,\n\nErel Joffe MD\n\nLymphoma Service  \nMemorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center  \n\\* Comments are for educational purposes only and should not be regarded as medical advice.  \nr/Lymphoma_MD_Answers Thanks for all of your information. \n\nMy family member will be starting the RCHOP treatment on the 26th.

Apparently it is just minimally above a 3 and he said it could or could not be lymphoma. \n\nHere are my results: \n\n\"A PET CT scan of the head, neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis was performed. Images were obtained from the cranial vertex to the upper thighs 60 minutes after administration of 333 MBq of FDG. Noncontrast, low-dose CT was used for attenuation correction. Serum glucose was 5.3 mmol/L at time of injection of radiopharmaceutical. Water soluble oral contrast was administered for bowel opacification.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNOTE: Any fused image numbers referred to in the following report, were taken from a dedicated nuclear medicine workstation and are for the purposes of reference only. These numbers may not always correspond to images transferred to PACS.  \n\nCLINICAL HISTORY:Hodgkin's lymphoma post escBEACOPP. PET scan March 4 suggestive of residual disease. Assess for evidence of progression.  \n\nCOMPARISON: PET-CT dated March 31, 2021. \n\nFor the purposes of reference: - Mediastinal blood pool activity:  SUVmax 2.1 and SUV average 1.3 - Physiologic liver activity:  SUVmax 3.8 and SUV average 1.9  \n\nFINDINGS:  Marginal decrease in the residual left anterior mediastinal soft tissue now with maximal short axis diameter of 3.3 cm, previously 3.5 cm. It demonstrates persistent uptake at its posterior margin with SUVmax 4.9 on PET image 190, previously SUVmax 5.2 (Deauville 4) as well as slight increase in intensity of the focus seen more superiorly on PET image 174, now with SUVmax 6.0, previously with SUVmax 4.1. The latter focus shows associated mild calcification on the CT component, likely related to post treatment change, but the uptake is also seen on the non-attenuated corrected images indicative that it is real and not associated with artifact of attenuation correction. The previously seen areas of relatively intense patchy FDG uptake in the sternum have resolved. No suspicious FDG-avid osseous lesion.  \n\nThere are foci of bilateral uptake in the posterior paravertebral upper neck and to a lesser degree in the supraclavicular fossae which correlate to fat on CT, most in keeping with physiologic brown fat activation. Interval resolution of the previously seen small left level IIA node with low-level uptake which was likely reactive. A small left supraclavicular node shows trace uptake below background mediastinal blood pool (SUVmax 1.9) on PET image 137 (Deauville 2).  \n\nNo FDG-avid pulmonary nodules.  No FDG-avid nodes below the diaphragm. The spleen measures 12.7 cm in maximal axial length and demonstrates uniform physiologic activity.  \n\nThere is mild focal cutaneous uptake in the midline of the upper abdomen / lower thorax.  \n\nOPINION:  There are a couple of persistent small foci of FDG uptake in the residual anterior mediastinal mass, which are above background liver (Deauville 4). Interval resolution of the previously seen areas of intense patchy uptake in the sternal manubrium.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think? I really do not want to put my heart at risk if it may not be lymphoma. Reddit may not be the best way to get medical advice........ Reddit may not beest the most wondrous way to receiveth medical counsel\n\n***\n\n\n\n^(I am a bot and I swapp'd some of thy words with Shakespeare words.)\n\nCommands: `!ShakespeareInsult`, `!fordo`, `!optout` Crowdsourcing medical opinions from non medical professionals is not a great idea. You should go get a 2nd and even a third opinion, though. Oh boy that is as clear as mud! Can you ask your doc what it was that changed his mind? Or the chances of a repeat scan soon? You should ask this on a specific ask doctors / medical advice sub.   \nEven though we all (presumably) have hodgkin's here, that does not mean we all know how to interpret PET scan notes. \nI would like to provide you with some numbers so you can make an informed decision.\n\nIn brief (I expand below), radiation is NOT \"extremely dangerous\" to the heart particularly if the location of the mass is such that we can limit the radiation dose that falls on key structures of the heart. On the other hand, Deauville-4 PET positivity is quite common at the end of escBEACOPP and in many cases may be a 'false positive' (i.e. residual uptake not because of lymphoma). In this regard, since radiation is a local treatment there is always a possibility to wait 2-3 months and rescan or to do a biopsy (both a bit problematic because HL may be very slow to progress, and the biopsies are often not diagnostic). \n\nBottom line, I agree that there is a need to get a second opinion at a center that specializes specifically in the management of Hodgkin's lymphoma as well as with a radiation oncologist who specializes in the management of lymphoma (and can review the images and comment about an optimal heart sparing field). Ultimately, you must remember that preventing relapse in Hodgkin's is the number one priority. \n\n\"Radiation is extremely dangerous to the heart\" - this is an incorrect statement. The risk of radiation to the heart is dependent upon the dose and exposure of sensitive tissue. Most data come from older studies using very wide fields that expose most of the heart to high doses of radiation including the coronary arteries and valves. Today's field usually limit exposure to the heart and particularly to these structures. Even with the \u201cold\u201d fields the risk of long-term death from cardiac reasons is estimated at 3% and the risk of hospitalization for cardiac reasons at 5-15% (higher doses and fields associated with the higher rates). You must remember that the general population has heart disease at a high rate (~7% have ischemic heart disease vs. ~20% in Hodgkin's post radiation survivors). Again, we know that with newer techniques in most cases we can spare the heart completely or reduce the doses considerably, so these numbers are anticipated to be much lower. It is important to remember heart diseases are usually manageable. Finally, at the end of the day the number one cause of death in Hodgkin's patients with incomplete response to frontline therapy remains Hodgkin's. Therefore, if there is a substantiated concern for residual Hodgkin's it is of far greater importance to make sure the Hodgkin's has been eradicated than to worry about long-term complications. In this regard, HD-18 (the largest study of escBEEACOPP in the modern era has demonstrated excellent long-term outcomes for patients with Deauville 4 on end of therapy PET with and without consolidative radiation - a 1/3 received radiation but no comparison provided in the paper between those with and without radiation. This is understandable as only patients with localized residual disease can receive radiation)\n\nHow common is Deauville 4 at the end of escBEACOPP ? on HD-18 there were 444 patients with an interim PET2 positive. Of these 333 had end of therapy evaluation by PET and of these 184 had a Deauville 4 (i.e. 55% of patients who had an interim PET positive remained positive at the end). Overall there were 1100 patients on the study so EOT PET was positive in at least 17% of patients overall (no report of positive cases in those with negative interim PER but can assume low). Most of these patients received consolidative radiation (the indication per protocol was Deauville 4 and size &gt;2.5cm long axis). The cure rate in this population (i.e. never requiring any more therapy) was ~ 90%. Unfortunately, we cannot say what was the contribution of radiation to this excellent outcome. Some indication comes from the HD12 study which evaluated radiation of residual disease (but by CT and not PET) following escBEACOPP and demonstrated a 6% advantage in cure rate in those receiving radiation (approx. 86% vs. 92%). So very possible that even without radiation patients would have had excellent outcomes. Still one can make the case that a 6% difference in relapse carries a greater weight than the increase in cardiac toxicity from radiation. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nErel Joffe MD\nLymphoma Service\nMemorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center\n* Comments are for educational purposes only and should not be regarded as medical advice ^ This squares with everything I know as a diagnostic radiologist interpreting PET, and well beyond. Get a second opinion for sure. My SUV Max was lower than yours in the tumor areas (literally about 0.01 above the liver) and they scored it as a 4 and considered it as active cancer. I would encourage you to go with their treatment recommendations. I personally chose 2 additional months of chemo instead of radiation to my chest (female with family history of breast cancer).  I am almost 2 years cancer free now without radiation.", "Similar symptoms? ", "Relapse rate? Hello! Hope everyone is having a Blessed day I want to ask does anyone know HL relapse rate for stage 2? I will forever be fearful of my cancer returning I just want reassurance I have been told that 90%+ of HL patients have no recurrence. Was told that for low stage, favorable patients the change of recurrence drops greatly, and data may suggest even a 97%+ success rate. So, the chance of recurrence is between 3-10% roughly from what I understand. \n\nThe constant fear is something that many of us share. Intentionally doing some mindfulness exercises, and stress/anxiety techniques can help. For example spending time picturing yourself in 5 years from now, and then in 10, and then in 20. Do not picture yourself based on your fears, but dream some here. Think of the good that could be at those times.\n\nBest wishes. Is HL stage 2 a low stage? My doctor said my cancer progressed very slowly Yes, the stages are 1 through 4.

Is it valuable to track this marker over time?\n\nIf Anemia from disease goes away?\n\nIf B symptoms (sweating and fevers) go away? \n\nHow about a quantitative flow cytometry readout of certain blood markers (CD30 for example). Head over to the lymphoma sub... better participation rate Anemia does not go away due to chemo, it gets worse. And overall blood-work is also bad.\n I would think that the lack of B-symptoms, weight and your overall subjective feeling is the way. \nFor medicinal way, i believe that PET and (i was) under two studies currently in progress is how you can get how it is going. \n\nBut that one thing that will tell you for sure is just time, wait and see what doctor says.\nYou will know if the treatmen worked in just two to five years. Found the names: TARC and CTDNA Prognostic markers are used for prediction prior to initiation of treatment.\n\nOnce on treatment the most meaningful marker is metabolic response on PET.\n\nNo other good markers, though we often track ESR in patients who had elevated levels at diagnosis.\n\nErel Joffe MD\n\nLymphoma Service  \nMemorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center  \n\\* Comments are for educational purposes only and should not be regarded as medical advice.  \nr/Lymphoma_MD_Answers", "Birthday gift ideas for relative about to start chemo. Hi folks. I know this is kind of out of place, and I hope I do not ruffle any feathers. My brother is about to start chemo and his birthday is in a few days. Any luxuries or necessities that you would recommend that might make him smile or things he might deeply appreciate? I know he is having a tough time with temperature swings so I was thinking some bamboo pj\u2019s. Just trying to be thoughtful and helpful and make sure the birthday does not get completely missed by all the craziness going on. Thanks in advance. Hmm, maybe books or something to entertain himself while sitting and getting treatment? At one point someone got me a pillow that was cooling that I liked but my night sweats stopped pretty quickly after I started treatment. \n\nI would also say it does not have to be related to chemo/treatment. I know that it is at the center of things right now but something I really appreciated when going through chemo and everything was the little moments of normalcy. Get something useful like a cooling pillow, heating pad, or weighted blanket all of those were something I loved having during treatment. I would also get him something special that has nothing to do with his cancer, something you know he really wants or would want even something like an inside joke. Like the other person said the best parts and days were when I did not think about it. When I was going through treatment I was gifted this ( from a good friend of mine who was a cancer survivor. It is seriously the comfiest sweatshirt I have ever owned. The big hood allowed for me to kind of hide my face when I did not want to see anyone and also was wide enough for the nurses to hook up to my port without any issues. I wore it everyday for chemo and I still wear it today. If you all have any questions just reach out Someone gave me a coloring book of swear words. I loved it haha Someone gaveth me a coloring booketh of gage words.  I did love t haha\n\n***\n\n\n\n^(I am a bot and I swapp'd some of thy words with Shakespeare words.)\n\nCommands: `!ShakespeareInsult`, `!fordo`, `!optout` I shall require a link to this magical book you speak of please :D A gift card for a massage or something similar, your body freaking hurts after a few rounds. Ginger tea for nausea. I got a lot of coloring books and stuff which were nice, but the best was when someone would plan to take a slow walk around a pretty lake or something to get outside. Magnesium chloride to put in baths if he has one. Edibles. Black out curtains in his bedroom if he does not have some. I also wish I had something like daily harvest back then for smoothies because I was so fatigued and never wanted to eat healthily. This depends on his sense of humour/sensitivity to the diagnosis. But my friend got me a lymphoma plush from giant microbes. You can flip it inside out and it changes into a good white blood cell. I think it is ugly cute.\n\nEdit: edit to say I know it is not what you asked for but I think it is nice to one day be like \"yeah I beat you, you little sh-! *AGGRESSIVELY flips plush inside out* F- yeah!\" That is just me though. I had a rough go with night sweats which led to my diagnosed classic Hodgkin\u2019s stage 2 and I still wrestle with overheating while going thru chemo. I invested in cooling sheets for my bed from Amazon, they were $50 but well worth it. I also got a cooling foam mattress topper. Anything cooling is a big help. Freeze pops are not only tasty but also work as cooling devices when put in ones pocket when going outside on a hot day. I have found cotton (high quality) and linen fabrics to be great in reference to clothing. Also v-neck if he is got a port put in.\nI read books while I am sitting at my 4 hour chemo session but really, comics are a saving grace. It breaks up the long drawn out sitting there and watching the prescription bag drain ever so slowly.  I bought myself an old school game boy too. I pack a tote bag with stuff to do and take my mind of it and also so I can pack snacks-hospital lunches although free, are not very appealing. Also get him ginger candies or a strong flavor hard candy to suck on-one of medications he will get is one that you can literally taste as they push it into your port. It is chalky and takes like the worlds worst grapefruit. Little presents help along the way\u2026and variety is key. He may not be able to eat his favorite things one week but again the next -I get myself a crazy soda/candy for myself to get delivered after every session. It is fun to try new stuff and if it is sucks, oh well, it was fun for the moment and it gives me something to look forward to even when the waves of nausea come crashing down.

Much like the time leading to my diagnosis every medical professional tried to convince me it was all in my head. I have to say that I am doing well. I became a father this year after being resigned to the fact that my treatment could rob me of the opportunity. It is a blessing. Even more so because I had my samples (sperm) destroyed because I could not afford the monthly storage fee. \n\nAs a thought exercise I am curious if any survivors out there have physical changes that were not there before ABVD.

I get my results from my pet scan tomorrow but I will lyk if I see any changes in the future. I think chemotherapy just makes you feel different, I do not think I will ever feel the same but at the end of the day as long as I am healthy I do not care, you know?

I do not know if this was from the chemo or if I was having a mini withdrawal from the Vicodin I was perscribed. There was also a period of time after where I had bouts of depression and possibly PTSD. I remember having flashbacks of the bone marrow biopsy. The 3 nurses holding me down and the hammering feeling of the needle going to my hip. Physically, I would say I am back to normal but I will never be the same mentally.  Thanks for sharing. I have a similar terrible memory of my bone marrow biopsy. The the hammering, the grinding, the vibration in my skull (real or imagined). I had not dealt with the trauma at all until recently when I started sharing randomly. Cathartic to say the least.  I generally do not share. I have found that it tends to make other people and myself feel bad/uncomfortable. I do not need anyone to tell me how sorry they are or that I am a \"fighter\" or any of the bullshit sympathy lines they spew. And I know it is not their fault. They are usually caught off guard and do not know what else to say. I get that. I also feel this weird sense like I am not allowed to talk about it. Like I am alive and I should be grateful and happy that it is done with. Which I am, but idk. There is more feelings there that I do not know how to explain. I do not want people to feel bad for me but I want them to know that I have been through a lot of bullshit in my life. But I never tell anyone because it would feel like im bragging almost.

So, for the past few years now, whenever I drink an alcoholic beverage, I get this immediate ache in what feels like the muscles of my arms, and the muscles of my chest. When I say immediately, I mean like within minutes of downing the drink. I am not an alcoholic or a recovering alcoholic. I do not drink often, just once a month typically. And when I do drink, it is usually a shot or two of vodka, whisky, or wine with a dinner when I am out eating. Every time I drink, the muscle pain flares up within minutes....and then dissipates after a few more minutes (Pain probably last 2-5 mins).....I do not know what it is...but I hear the symptom is common with Hodgkin disease...\n\nI already scheduled an appointment with my doctor to try and figure this out, but I am posting on here to see if anyone else has heard of this or experienced this.... Hello ! I had pain when drinking alcohol and was diagnosed a few months later. For me it was a sip and then it would hurt so much that I would be in tears for multiple hours with pain !!! Definitely go get it checked but hopefully it is something else !! I will, I am waiting on an appointment right now unfortunately. How has treatment been going for you? I would not worry too much !! Hopefully it is just something else. But I would advocate for a chest X-ray!!! I had a large tumor in my chest that I was unaware of until they x rayed me. Treatment has been semi rough but too nothing crazy. On month four right now of chemo! Hoping you will be okay &amp; it is not Hodgkin\u2019s related. Best of luck! Dm me if u have any more questions!! Will do. Thank you. Will ask for the chest x ray :) I am sorry about your diagnosis by the way.

Hi all. 34M. I am still in a state of shock to be here.  I felt fine until about 2 months ago,  when a little dry cough started, but I thought it was my usual seasonal allergies. Then my feet started itching so badly that I was making myself bleed by scratching them. After benadryl did not work, I finally went to the doctor thinking I was having an allergic reaction. He found a swollen lymph node on my lower neck, and I guess that made him suspicious so he ordered a chest X ray, then a CT. I knew it was bad when he referred me to an oncologist the next day, but I still thought it must be a mistake because I felt so normal. It was not until my biopsy came back last week that I actually believed I have cancer. I am having a PET scan next week but my oncologist thinks I am stage 3 based on my CT scan. How did it get this far without giving me any warning? \n\nI have not told my job yet because I do not think they will react well. I have been there less than a year so I cant take any time off without being fired unless they give me the time. I have good health insurance, but if I get fired I am screwed for that, too. Is it possible to keep working through chemotherapy? I work from home,  but the work is challenging and I cannot push off deadlines or ask for easier work so I do not know if I will be able to fake my way through if things get too hard.\n\nI do not even know what I am asking here. I guess it is just a rant. If anyone has advice, though,  it is welcome. Honestly you are probably already through the worst part. At least that is what it was like for me - the limbo period where you do not know what is going on was awful. Once I got a diagnoses things got a lot easier. I had abvd/avd and it sucked, but was manageable especially after bleomycim was removed. Losing hair, eyebrows, lashes sucked, but everything grew back in normally. Do you know what regimen you will have? I assume abvd or aavd. \n\nI was 32 when I was diagnosed with stage 4 CHL and am 36 now and have been in remission since Sept 2017 (although I did just find a swollen lymph node on my neck, which of course is freaking me out).\n\nI was actually in a pretty similar position as you regarding work. I would only been at my job for 3 months when I was diagnosed and assumed I would be fired. It was also a pretty mentally challenging job. I think because I was at a law firm, though, my firm did not want to look bad by firing me over a health reason and was actually very accommodating. They allowed me to take what was essentially an 11 month leave of absence and then come back part time. I do believe that a lot of places will honor FMLA either way,  even if you do not technically qualify. It is definitely worth asking and I would not try to hide your illness from them. Alternatively, I do know plenty of people work through chemo so it is possible if you need to. I had STD and was afraid I would be a liability when my chemo brain amped up, so I decided to take off. I was definitely pretty mentally foggy for a long time so I think it was a good thing I took off considering the nature of my work. Brain fog does not seem to happen to everyone though.  \n\nHas your oncologist said anything about whether you should take off? Thanks for the response. I hope this is the worst that it gets because my anxiety levels have been through the roof the last month ha. I am not even afraid of chemo because I am just ready to get this over with now. \n\nI am also at a law firm, but I am not optimistic that I will be able to take any real time off. I am the only lawyer in my practice group so if I am not working, my clients leave, even if I do not get fired. \nHow did you handle breaking that news to them? I keep imagining they will just let me go as soon as I tell them since I am sure they will be afraid my work will suffer even if I keep working through chemo. What was your brain fog like? Was it just on treatment days? My oncologist did not warn me about that. Ah that is a tough spot for you then.  I did not have that issue since I had other people who could pick up my slack.  \n\nAs for telling them,  I actually just told them from the start as soon as I was sent for a CT. Once I found a supraclavicular lymph node, I strongly suspected lymphoma and so when my GP felt it and said I probably had lymphoma or leukemia, I let my office manager know I would be off for a few days at least since I was paralyzed with fear and there was no way I would be able to work. As for continuing work, I did not really care at that point whether I got fired so I guess that made it a little less of a problem for me lol. I was also not on my firm's health plan so that was not an issue for me either. \n\nBrain fog was difficult. It got bad a few months after I started chemo and just made me much less sharp. Word recall, losing track of thoughts mid sentence...I am sure it was exacerbated by stress but since I still feel it 3.5 years later chemo was definitely a major culprit. It has gotten better, but I am just not as sharp as I was before.  Again, not everybody experiences this, though,  so hopefully you will not and can figure out how to work through treatment without risking your job.

I felt completely normal too, if a bit tired, but hell I was a teenager, teens are tired.\n\n Worked through all my normal classes plus 2 Advanced Placement classes and got a high enough score on the English Advanced Placement to skip two college classes, while missing most of the day Thursdays and all of Fridays for the last 4 months of my high school career, and dealing with the hair loss at 18. \n\nI got through everything, walked at graduation, and kept fighting.\n\nMy best advice is if they put you on chemo, take it, and stay on top of symptoms. Keep your Nausea medicine in reach, if you feel even the littlest bit sick then take it. It is not worth risking \"maybe it will go away\". Get some non-metal eating utensils in case your tastebuds decide to betray you (super common reaction from what I remember) and be ready for your hair to go. It sucks but I felt so much better when I shaved mine. Sitting there trying to hold onto it made me feel like a shedding dog except what was going was not coming back.\n\nYour brain is going to be foggy. Do your best. Do the easiest things you can first and do your best to concentrate on the hard things when you feel clear headed. Check what you can of your work with your boss or coworkers, ask them to watch behind you for mistakes. If you work for a good company, they will do their best to support you while you are working on what might as well be your brain half fried.\n\nI know all of this is terrifying and what I am writing is super scary, but this is the battle we have got to fight. Good luck, and let us know when you can ring that final treatment bell (if you have one) Most of my young patients are able to work through ABVD or A-AVD.  \nYou can try to schedule treatments for Friday afternoon, this way you will have the weekend to recover. Make sure to take good preventative care for nausea and constipation (do not wait for symptoms, rather prevent them in the first place)\n\nI am sure you will do fine. \n\nBest \n\nErel Joffe MD   \nLymphoma Service   \nMemorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center   \n\\* Comments are for educational purposes and should not be considered medical advice Thank you for your response, doctor. I had my first treatment, and while it took a few days to recover, I was able to slog through work. I am feeling much more confident now and think I will be able to manage my symptoms enough to continue to work assuming it does not get a lot worse. Thank you again! One more lawyer to add to the discussion. I am pre-diagnosis, with a PET scan results showing multiple FDG avid nodes: cervical, axillary, mesenteric, plus a large mass in anterior mediastinal that the PET cannot determine to be malignant or not. I am majorly concerned about not being able to work for the same reasons mentioned. We shall see what the future holds. I wish you all the best!", "Remission and diet Been in HL remission for 10 months.  Alcohol is hard on my and coffee does not make me feel good anymore.  No biggie.  Sugar also makes me feel funny and I almost feel my lymph nodes around my neck get affected after eating.  Can anyone relate to this? If those are symptoms similar to what you experienced before diagnosis you should contact your oncologist immediately. \n\nFrankly I know I would of o started having problems with alcohol again. See your oncologist.\n\nWhat effects do you feel with these substances now? Could you give me more details?\n\nFor what it is worth, I spent the days during my chemo absolutely hammered since I could not handle the nausea and I had stopped eating. So when I would get home from chemo, I would start drinking. My oncologist just told me to be careful since it could damage my liver but I hated the nausea and I am not very smart. \n\nMy tolerance was far lower then but it was still pleasant. Even now I drink often but I do not get any weird effects. As for diet, I did notice that I started getting affected by carbs worse (feel sick, bloated and uncomfortable) so I just try to keep my protein intake high instead. Yep very similar to your carb experience.  Just simply feeling off and affected.  Interesting you can drink.  I had bad headaches from alcohol going into my HL diagnosis.  Guess everyone has different symptoms.  Thanks for the input! Were you never able to drink after the treatment then?\n\nWhat stage were you on?", "Flow Cytometry Help! Hi everyone! I am a 20 year old female who is in the midst of being diagnosed. I recently had an excisional biopsy of a cervical lymph node, and still have not gotten the results back, I was supposed to know Monday. My doctor called today and said that the flow cytometry report came back normal, but that my B-Cell count was elevated and the lab wanted to do more tests because it would not rule out Hodgkins. Did anyone here have a normal flow cytometry and still find out they had cHL? Thank you! CHL needs a large piece of tissue to diagnose typically.  Post over I am lymphoma.. much greater response there flow cytometry will not pick up classical Hodgkin lymphoma.  Hodgkin diagnosis will require morphological AND immunohistochemistry to confirm a diagnosis by a hematopathologist.  \n\nYou may be able to find (if very lucky) some clues to CD30 positive cells but diagnosis will not be possible with flow.  Flow will not confirm nor rule out Hodgkin lymphoma.", "Upcoming Birthday - Chemotherapy during quarantine  Hi Everyone,\n\nMy sister is on chemotherapy for Stage 2 Hodgkins Lymphoma and her birthday is coming up. **Her 24th birthday is THURSDAY April 30, 2020.** My whole family is quarantined and staying inside to keep her safe.

HOWEVER, there are bumps all over my body especially my legs. Feels like razor burn everywhere. I am sure it is just my follicles rebooting after being out of commission for so long, but I am just wondering if anyone else is having a similar issue? Any remedies to sooth the bumps? Also, does anyone know how long this lasts? Perhaps it is nerve pain..... I would recommend investing in a quality supplement. Try out nerve renew, its helped me out I had urticaria and dermatitis that started a few months after ABVD chemotherapy ended. The itching drove me crazy. It lasted around 3 months and then disappeared. Mention it at your next check up but it does sound normal. Sensitive skin after chemo is quite common.", "Stage 4 Hodgkins Lymphoma.  Stay strong MAN keep it up i had to take 10  chemos so ya lucky. Also please take radiation therapy seriously it is not painful but it makes me feel weaker than before .(also keep a cool beard man spread breakin bad vibes  it goes with bald head actually good) Wow, that is enought.. I cannot imagine it. I had 6 BEACOPP and after the last one,  i was two weeks  in hospital with transfusions every day and several antibiotics. Antibiotics hurt man. Mine was stage 2 when diagnosed and actually gave a good response in the end thank god the doctor seemed like a demon he was like wut, there is still some left, another 2 cycles and i was like it is so painful id like to die but honestly i did not want to die since have dreams too. MAN it may suck but just focus on recovery . I was so scared when docs told me my heart was very close to the radiation mark i was like eat a lot and excercise a lot dont die dont die dont die. There were many bad experiences but on plus side i got a real cool war scar on my neck. Sorry for the long comment i have exams and i just cannot study. Cheers Thank you! Thank you! Well, i had only the beacopp treatment, it is 6 months since the last dose, and was facing protone radiation after, but they luckily discovered some sort of liquid which spread acros the area where it was supposed to be. My imune system made it seem like it is back on PET scan, so they got me out of the list for radiation treatment, next month i am going to my 4th scan, to see if it did not spread or what the hell is happening there.  \nMore is better. It is not like side effects of the treatment will worsen or something, you are facing those from the start, but more can kill more cells and by a chance destroy it completely. I spent a lots of time inside hospital during the treatment, so i had time to study, to learn what is this about. Not like i could learn in that state much, but at least it keep me occupied.\n\nKeep the hard work. Thanx man. Mine chemos sucked mostly becuz the nurses could not find my veins and after 2-3 times it just felt like they are just stabbing until i do not bleed please bleed cmon. Okay enough chot chat. Going bark. Thnx And i thought I was talking to op in the sub chat man im below average iq rn No worries! I am glad to see that you have a positive attitude towards your treatment and recovery! Thanks bro. It is more like ! survive ! For me though :) Sending all my love from across the deep seas of Reddit. Stay strong friend. Thank you! Stay strong brother and keep fighting Good luck! Stay strong, man.  Looks like you already have a port, so that will help.  ABVD here, with Rituximab (study).  Ask about trials, there is always new science. Sending you all my love and strenght! Thank you! Thanks! I will be needing it! Shoot, I should have been more clear in my description under the photos. I have recently completed all 6 cycles of my chemo therapy. I was in remission after the second. I am doing very well now. Hoping I make it to the 5 year mark! Thank you! Goodluck man. \nCan you also please look into budwig protocol dietwise. I have read case studies of stage 4 people benefiting greatly. I am following it for my elder brother (39/M). Its pretty easy to follow and totally DIY.

Is there a set amount of time it takes to cure? He is only 19. He has already started chemo. I heard that 5 year lifespans are high after a diagnosed. But is that it? You only live maximum 5 years after hodgkin's? I am just wondering why I am seeing that everywhere. I literally just started looking at this cancer today so I dont know a lot. Also, medical stuff is not my forte. But like....how long does it normally take for a person with stage 2 to make a full recovery? Or does it all just depend on how his body heals? I am so sorry for any stupid questions, but I genuinely dont know. Hey! I am sorry to hear that, cancer can suck. Your friend sounds lucky to have you. Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma is one of the most well researched cancers and there is a very high survival rate.  He should be expected to make a full recovery but his doctors will be able to speak into that more. He will most likely be on his chemo regimen for a set amount of cycles (times you receive chemo) and have follow up scans. I was diagnosed with stage 4 HL and started with a regimen called ABVD. I was able to handle the symptoms pretty well and they did not take a huge toll on me. If I had a regular job I would have been able to work the days I did not have chemo. In the middle of my 12 cycles I had a CT Scan that showed there was no more disease in my body! Praise God. I finished all the cycles and had another scan after. Unfortunately the disease had progressed/returned. I was set on a stronger chemo regime and other stuff. Finally, I have been in remission for 3 years now! My Dr. told me that after being in remission for 2 years my chances for the disease to come back drop by 80-90%. I hope you find this encouraging! Feel free to ask any more questions I had stage 4. I have been in remission since January. Your friend will be ok. Prolly 6 months worth of doses and will be in remission as well. Your friend will love much more than 5 years. Prolly into their 80s or 90s like the rest of us. :) Thank you guys so much!!!!!!!!!! You are amazing and a huge blessing!!!! I was diagnosed with stage 3 HL in November 2018 at 24. My oncologist told me at my age with no other health concerns that I did not have anything to worry about, so you should not have anything to worry about with your friend. \n\nAfter chemo, they will have 3/4 follow up scans a year, for 5 years. The five year survival rate just reflects the average likelihood of surviving those 5 years, but it does not take into account age or other health factors. \n\nTotal recovery time varies person to person. It took about 3 months after treatment for me to feel mostly normal again, but I am still not back to where I was pre-cancer. \n\nOne other thing to be aware of is chemo brain. They could get spacey or have mood swings as a side effect of treatment. I would sometimes get irrationally angry over something stupid, almost punched a wall the first time it happened. So just be patient and understanding if it happens. Got stage 2 w bulk diseas when I was 16. Had a full head of hair before I turned 17 (just turned 19)", "Could this be skin lymphoma?  I dont think so the most commmon signes are fever night sweat coughing it may also cause skin itching Thank you Get out Best to try and get seen by a doctor if it is worrying you! It can be scary but you will not get a proper diagnosis from an internet page unfortunately.", "Wife had Hodgkins Lymphoma My wife and I have been married 9 months (together 9 years) and we just found out she most likely has Hodgkins Lymphoma. Sitting in the hospital now with her as she recovers from her 2nd biopsy to make sure that it is what she has but doctors are pretty certain it is Hodgkins. Just looking for advice on how to handle this and as her husband and advice on how I can help. I hate this and wish I could take it for her or just make it go away. We are both 24 and our biggest fear is just that we cannot live out our lives together. I am hearing hopeful things that it is very treatable but we are still scared. This situation are not easy. Suffering for your loved one is worse than having the disease yourself I think. I sincerely hope that she will recover from this as well as I did a couple of years ago. \nStay strong together and enjoy every moment together! My wife turned into my caregiver. \nThe things that helped me the most were cooking and cleaning. \n\nShe had to take over every chore in the house, we got a cleaning lady to help (she came when I was at chemo) and then my friends helped rake leaves and shovel snow. \n\nHer biggest delight was when I was able to help around the house again.\n\nEdit: \nBe there for her. Try and help with whatever she needs. Try not to get angry when she is being difficult (chemo brain is a thing). \n\nYou have been together for 9 years, you can weather this. It will not be easy, but you both will make it. Completely this, I have just finished chemo and for the past 8months my partner has taken over doing almost all the house chores/shopping etc. There were days where I would be up for doing things but just make sure she knows she does not have to stress about those things and should just concentrate on getting better \n \nAlso there will be days where she may just want to stay in bed all day, and days where she feels up for going out etc. Whichever it is just make sure you support her, when I had my low bed days my partner would supply me with essentials (laptop, drinks etc) and not judge that I needed that down time\n\nI wish you guys all the best I (23F) was decently diagnosed with Hodgkins 3b, and even though it sucks (hard) the probability of being cured is pretty high! \nAs for chemo and/or radiation, everyone reacts differently. Just be aware of the side effects and prepare for them. If she gets chemo infusions, bring entertainment (laptop, ipad, etc) and snacks of your own if you want. I have days where I feel absolutely fine, and days where I would rather stay in bed all day long. The nausea is not that present, and if I am its treatable with medication. (side note;  I have the esc beacopp chemo)\nAs for you being there for her, I think you have got the right mindset. However, I do want to say do not baby her: communication is key. I have found that some people look at you very differently and are afraid that you will fall apart  after even looking at a pan and spatula. For me personally, this does not really help me mentally.\n\nAll the best to her and you! Sorry you are both going through this. I am 29F stage 2 and have completed 7 of 12 rounds. It is very overwhelming at first with all the appointments and it is scary leading up until the first chemo treatment. Lots of unknown. Go to as many appointments as possible with her to be an extra ear and to learn with her. Learn all the possible side effects by reading others experiences either in this or the lymphoma sub. Lots of great advice out there!\n\nMy husband has not been expected to do too much extra for me. I do avoid stores as much as possible because of covid. I was hospitalized for a cold so it is very important to avoid infection of any kind. Our bodies cannot fight off germs alone because of how weak our immune systems become even after 1 round.  \n\nMy body is very weak these days. I get winded from walking fast or stairs so know rest is very important and she needs to listen to her body. She may want to spend a few days in bed and let her. Our house has not been an issue to keep up with. I am still able to help with the cleaning but I may have days were I do not pick up anything. \n\nJust be there for her, let her feel all emotions and listen to her. Mentally it is very hard so I suggest looking into support groups or therapy. Your hospital may offer programs or free sessions. \n\nJust know this cancer has a high survivability rate and some day soon you will be able to start moving on from this!", "Lymph node pain/swelling after drinking? Long story short, I got my COVID vaccine two days again and last night the lymph node under my left armpit started to get sore. \n\nAfter feeling it, it definitely feels a bit swollen and is slightly painful. Even when standing with my arms at my side, it hurts. \n\nIt is soft, moveable and the size of the tip of my finger. \n\nI immediately though this was s reaction due to my COVID vaccine, but then I remembered about two hours prior I had one cocktail. \n\nNow I am a bit concerned about *what if* the pain is from the alcohol, which could be something associated with lymphoma. \n\n**Did anyone here have pain after drinking alcohol? If so, what did it feel like? And how long did the pain last?** Are you diagnosed with lymphoma ? You will not get medical advice here. \n\nYou need to call your doctor and get that all checked out. Last year I had two lymph nodes in my neck that got huge. My doctor monitored them for a few months, then finally decided to do two excisional biopsies. \n\nBoth biopsies came back negative, but he said to always be on the lookout and if something popped up under the armpit that would be alarming. \n\nJust trying to determine if what is going on is due to the vaccine or drinking. And for those that suffered pain after drinking alcohol, what was it like? Understood. I called and they said to wait a week or so since I just got my vaccine. \n\nJust thought I would ask if those that had pain after drinking alcohol (associated to lymphoma) could explain what that pain felt like? How long it lasted? And if they could feel their swollen lymph nodes. Swollen lymph nodes happen when your sick too so that could have been the shot. \n\nI was not in pain when I drank alcohol I literally went straight from drinking to feeling like I was hungover with one beer. There was no drunk at all. One time I ran my leg into a table and a massive bruise appeared.  At first I was like \"oh, must be from running into the table,\" but then I started wondering *what if* it was not actually from running into the table,  but was *actually* from leukemia because I know leukemia causes bruises.\n\nThen it occurred to me that I am *actually* an idiot. Lol - After my first shot I had no swelling/etc. \n\nI can barely put my arm down by my side\u2026the lymph node is definitely swollen. \n\nI never drink either, so yes, I am probably worrying about nothing\u2026but it was either the shot or something else (here is to hoping it is the shot). \n\nJust thought I would ask from others who had pain after drinking alcohol if they had pain for very long or if they felt the lymph node swell in the area where pain was. From what I have read and been told, i am in the small category of people whose first and only symptom was alcohol intolerance. The best way I can describe it is have you ever tried to hold in a sneeze? And you feel your blood pressure go up when you do, like theres a big great pressure inside your body, only for a moment though until you exhale from the sneeze? That Is what it felt like for me in my neck, shoulder, and radiated down to my arm (that side is where the node involvement was). Took me about a month to realize, happened almost immediately after drinking though, maybe after 1 or 2 sips I would feel this pressure/soreness. However, it was always relieved with some sort of NSAID or even if I took one before drinking it would not occur. Also was unable to palpate any nodes at the time until a few months later when there were visibly enlarged. Initially though just the intolerance. It would always go away by the next day however.\n\nVery unlikely and rare that this is happening to you. My covid vaccine, which I received after chemo, also caused my lymph nodes to grow and showed on my post chemo PET. Almost certainly more likely for it to be that. But like others said, wait a week and see if it changes. If not call your doc. Write down all your findings in real time so you have something to refer back to and not stumble or confuse yourself. FWIW, the swollen lymph nodes from lymphoma are typically painless. And the Covid vaccine/infections can cause painful swollen lymph nodes. I think your initial reaction is probably correct. \n\nGiven the history you mention in the comments, I would definitely get that node checked out if it has not gone down on its own in a week or so. Thanks for the feedback. \n\n1.\tSo your pain was t in your lymph nodes, but you felt pressure?\n2.\tAnd you did not actively feel any lymph nodes swell after drinking? It was more body wide than lymph node specific?\n3.\tAnd how long did it last after drinking (minutes/hours/days)?\n\nI am hoping/thinking it is from the shot\u2026but I honestly wished I did not drink so I would know it is Covid\u2026now in the back of my mind I am wondering if it is from something else. I say this with kindness: your post history indicates that you are a hypochondriac. You would greatly benefit from CBT, not from seeking medical advice on Reddit.\n\nAlso, you are asking a subreddit of cancer patients. There is a good chance you will worry yourself even more just by the nature of this subreddit. \n\nAnd additionally: this is actually meant to be a support space for cancer patients, as are the other subreddits pertaining to cancer and/or lymphoma in general; we are not here to ensure people they probably most likely do not have cancer. You would not just go and ask cancer patients in a hospital all of these questions, so you should not do it online either. Never hurts to get it checked! I do not get pain from drinking but definitely get drunk/blackout a lot quicker. Cancer sucks but at least I save money at the bars Yea do not listen to me - get a doctor quick.  I had headaches from alcohol.  My swollen lymph node was fairly hard and did not hurt. Apparently that was a bad sign. Regardless, please see a doctor My boyfriend has been diagnosed with HL (his super clavicle lymphnode was swollen)\u2026one of the first questions they asked about his symptoms was whether or not the lump itched or hurt when he drank. He does not drink, so we did not know. But, they said it was a very common symptom. Go see a doctor (maybe a different one) I got diagnosed with Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma last week Tuesday and my swelling lymph nodes are in my left groin , they caused me a lot of pain sometimes so bad I could not move my leg. When I first went to see the haematologist he thought it was nothing because normally people do not get pain. Everyone is different. OP if you are worried get it checked out.", "What is my Onclogist thinking?? So I have lymphocyte depleted HL ,I did 6 rounds of eBeacopp and ended with still Deuville 4. My mass shrunk from 15cm to 3cm. \n\nThey now are starting radiation on the left chest, right near my heart but I am very confused with their choice of dosage.\n\nFrom my research, the studies show that 30GY of radiation is the maximum needed to treat HL. In matter of fact, studies show that in my case which is early stage unfavourable, there was no difference between 20GY and 30GY....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, logically, the maximum dose if given, one would think is 30GY based on studies, but he is doing 40GY!\n\nI am going to call him soon, but I will not agree to do radiation if this is the case. There is simply no research to support his decision. I am highly concerned about cardio toxicity.\n\n The studies show that half that amount is effective. \n\nWhat do you guys think about this? Ask in the medical advice subreddit. There will be more actual physicians there to respond. Thank you I would try to get a 2nd opinion from a research/academic cancer Institute. I would highly recommend you consult a leading center in lymphoma.\n\nTo explain the rationale of your oncologist (which I do not necessarily share) - Early unfavorable HL is treated with 30Gy while early-favorable is treated with 20Gy. However, these are in the context of an initial treatment with ABVD and not in the context of suspected resistant following escBEACOPP. If he truly suspects a localized and resistant disease he wants to provide you with a higher dose to ensure a cure.\n\nThat said, PET has a high false-positive rate (something lights up but there is no lymphoma), and an SUVmax slightly above liver is often Deauville 3 and not Deauville 4 (Deauville is a subjective score where the radiologist is able to discern a difference in the uptake between the liver and the organ - i.e. they have to be able \"see it with their own eyes\" and not simply by the measurement of SUV). In these equivocal cases I usually wait a bit and repeat the scans and if possible always try to repeat a good biopsy (may be challenging for LN near the heart as small biopsies are often non diagnostic).\n\nIf the decision is made to continue with radiation you should also be seen by a radiation oncologist who specializes in lymphoma to make sure you receive a well designed radiation field that spares as much heart tissue as possible especially the valves and coronaries. It is important to remember that if this ends up being resistant Hodgkin's, radiation is a great treatment and the benefits greatly outweigh the potential side effects of radiation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBest of luck,  \nErel Joffe MD  \nLymphoma Service  \nMemorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center  \n\\* Comments are for educational purposes only and should not be regarded as medical advice.  \nr/Lymphoma_MD_Answers", "Lump and itching? Hey everyone,\n\nLast week I found a lump in my armpit. It was somewhat squishy, pain free and moveable. It has since disappeared but now I have constant itching all over my body (no rash, no bleeding, etc). It is so persistent that I am struggling to sleep. Any thoughts? I had blood work done about a week before I found the lump for an unrelated issue and my bloods came back perfectly normal. I am thinking that if something sinister was going on it would have been picked up in the blood work even though this was before I found the lump. I should add I have not changed my washing detergent and have not used any new skin products I would say just let your blood get checked again, just to be sure y\u2019know :) My doc said when i got mine checked up that if its moveable then its not lymphoma (for the record I had lymphoma that was treated a year ago) My bloods were normal and I have Hodgkin\u2019s. Xrays and CT\u2019s would tell more. Oh shit really? Feeling a bit anxious. More often than not inflamed lymph nodes signify an infection of some sort rather than lymphoma. I know it is easier said than done but try not to worry! For piece of mind though, see if you can get any imaging done Thank you :) I hope you are doing well too Thank you, good luck with everything! I have to say my husband's bloods were normal as well right before diagnosis. Luckily an ultrasound of the link can give them a good idea. It is the least invasive and least expensive test. My husband had an ultrasound with some red flags but nothing definite so we did a biopsy. We are thankful to take the easy step first though."]
