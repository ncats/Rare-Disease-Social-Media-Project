["Bone loss in lower jaw. I have been to the dentist today and they have found bone loss through a screening. I have a fibroma in my tounge. I all so have excessive gum overgrowth. Which I have been told before was most likely due to NF and have had surgery on to curb the excess. They have reffered me to a peridontis. Honestly I am feeling very anxious and scared over it. Has any one else had none loss before?  I have read a little into it and apparently NF can cause bone loss. How did it turn out what treatment did you use?  I am sorry you are having this problem. I cant relate but I can offer you my sympathy and I am here to talk anytime. My NF has really gone un checked since I was diagnosed 17 years ago. Everyone is stories on here remind me and motivate me to get checked. The good news is for you that they found it and hopefully it was before it was too bad. Hope you are keeping well and you do not worry too much. Let me know how it goes with the periodontist. They said it was not too bad and my teeth are not in danger of falling out. I definitely will let you know how it goes with the periodontist. I might all so go to an osteopodiatrist and get the rest of my body checked out.  Bone issues are quite common in NF1.  My son (whose case is spontaneous) has sphenoid wing dysplasia, basically his right orbital wall is thinning and will one day disappear.  His eye sockets are thus growing asymmetrically and he will have corrective surgery at some point.\n\nTibial dysplasia seems to be the most common, and I have also heard of bowing of the arm bones.  I have not heard of jaw bone issues but I suppose it is possible anywhere.\n\n I need to schedule an MRI and see what is been brewing in me since gradeschool", "first full body MRI I will be going for my first full scan MRI for my body. I heard that it will take nearly 2 hours to do. can anyone tell me how to ignore that it will be 2 hours long? is there something I should be worried about? like findings? how long will it take to get the results back. I will be going on a Wednesday. I am in my 30s and I am nervous they will find something. I just want to do it for the peace of mind so I am glad I am getting this done. I have not had any issues as of now, but that does not mean that I am perfectly \"fine\" right?", "How do I differentiate fibromas from other common skin growths? Hey all. I am 22 and I just found out I have NF1, although I was diagnosed as a baby - my parents hid my diagnosis from me for my whole life.\n\nI do not have any fibromas yet as far as I know. But I would like to know what they look like when they very first appear, and how to differentiate them from other common skin growths like pimples/cysts/etc, so i can be on the lookout for them if/when they appear.\n\nI do seem to have these little bumps that pop up all over my body and then disappear within a few days. They are soft and seem to be able to move a little under the skin if I press them with my finger, and they will stick around for a week or two before disappearing again. I know fibromas do not go away so I do not think these are fibromas.\n\nAny help is appreciated, thank you! Well, it was terrible of your parents to keep it a secret from you especially considering the related issues: scoliosis and bone deformities. I am 23. I was diagnosed as a baby and I have always been in the loop. My case was hereditary.\n\nFibromas are usually pinkish and more firm. They will have some give. And they might hurt a little if you press down on them or apply pressure. They can come in all sizes. They will not disappear. I am not sure what the other bumps you have are. Maybe speak to a dermatologist about those? To talk about your NF, and treatment a neurologist or neuro-oncologist is your best bet if you are not already seeing one.\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to message me. Also this may be a stupid question, but I saw your other post. Your high school genetics class bought up NF? Most people I have met have never even heard of it. Where the heck were you lucky enough to go to a high school that discussed this? \\*shrug\\* I just went to a regular public high school on the East coast.  was in my genetics textbook as an example of an autosomnal dominant disorder. The characteristics and symptoms of the disease were only very briefly mentioned; we basically covered it to make Punnett squares. But it was enough to make me run home and google it because I would always had cafe-au-lait spots and scoliosis. I am starting to think every little bump that pops up on my body is a tumor. in the past couple weeks I have had a couple little bumps that do not seem to be going away... Wow. \n\nWhenever I bring up my NF to someone new, I always have to explain that it is not cancer and I am mostly fine. I have never seen it used in a textbook and maybe mentioned once or twice on a procedural TV show (Like House, Bones etc.)\n\n People tend to hear the word 'tumor' and automatically think cancer. \n\nI have not really told many people about my NF, although my dad did decide to tell his entire girlfriend's family... hahaha thanks dad That sucks.\n\nI hope that you can get away from your family as soon as you can. None of this sounds like a healthy at all.\n\nMost of my friends know about my NF, though it is awkward to bring up. ", "Experience with bone tumors? I was diagnosed with NF1 in at age 18, via a genetic test. Since I was little (like 6 maybe) I have had a tumor on my humerus. I do not know the medical name of it but I think the doctors back then said that it contains cartilage. I have had multiple MRIs because of it but after a few years they stopped because it was not growing anymore, and I have been basically ignoring it ever since.\n\nIdk if it is related to NF at all (since I think, bone problems associated with NF are rather bowing instead of tumors right?) and when I was diagnosed with NF, the doctor just said \"maybe it is related\" but was not sure.\n\nEither way, the tumor has been bothering me a bit for a few months now. Earlier I could lie on my left side without trouble but now it is quite uncomfortable. And I often have mild pain on my arm throughout the day too, and sometimes a slightly numb feeling (it does not get completely numb but sometimes my fingers just get a bit numb).\n\nIt is annoying but bearable, so my question would be, has anyone experiences with a tumor like that? Are symptoms like this enough that a doctor would consider removing it? Or, because of possible consequences, like nerve damage, would a doctor only remove if it is causing serious symptoms like intense pain or numbness?\n\nThanks in advance! Any changes in pain and discomfort should be something that you should let your doctor know. In my experience when I started having changes in pain, my tumors had become cancerous and needed to be removed. I am not saying this is your case, but you should let your doctor know about any changes that your having. What you describe is a non-ossifying fibroma (NOF) and sometimes referred also as fibrous cortical defects (FSDs) . They are frequent in NF1 and usually do not require intervention . \n\nWe have several skeletal manifestations that go beyond the tibia bowing (tibial pseudarthrosis) from bone tumours to osteopenia and everything in between, so your doctor seems ill informed. \n\nBone tumours however should not hurt and any pain in Nf1, as Wolflmg rightly says, needs to be investigated in nf1. You might have an internal neurofibroma next to your bone tumour. You should consult a doctor, if possible an nf1 specialist, and it is likely you will need some imaging. The best imaging for bone tumours, is not an MRI, but a CT scan, which comes with additional risks for us, so you will need to discuss benefits vs hard of having it done. \n\nThe numbness you feel is another good reason to consult. \n\nWith NF1, it is always better to stay on the side of caution, and when in doubt, investigate.", "Sever NF1 Been suffering for years now. 20+ surgeries since 2011. Pitutary brain tumor and fibromas on nerves all over they cant do shit for. Im in a depressive state on what can I do anymore. Sorry to hear that. Our family member is not doing well either physically or mentally. But there is really only one thing can be slightly changed and that is the later.\n\nIt is easy for me to see and say from the outside but IMHO life is either worth living or it is not. Life, again IMHO, is about pleasures. Try to consider what gives you pleasure (nature, a stiff drink, etc.) and do more of it. \n\nThe basic foundation which my disabled and aged family members always tell me is - every day when they wake they make the decision to live by eating, breathing and doing all the other things to keep their bodies going. So they accept that they have made that decision - and then try to make the best of it.\n\nI wish that this type of suffering could be alleviated but if nothing else I try to be a realist.", "SpringWorks Therapeutics to launch phase 3 trial of its MEK inhibitor for plexiform neurofibromas \n\nAs far as I know this is the first NF-1 drug to ever reach phase 3 trial.  what happens if it passes phase 3?  If the results are good then essentially all that is left is to submit the data to the FDA for review. Six months after that it could be to market.\n\nNo idea how long the trial will take though... Can be years.\n\nWhat is good about this is that MEK inhibitors have shown great promise in other phase 2 trials... Having this available in a phase 3 will open the drug up to many more people that could potentially benefit that cannot get it today because there is no trials recruiting.  I do not follow NF medicine. Partly because I do not want to get my hopes up.\n\nWhat does this all mean? Phase 1, phase 2, phase three. This is all gibberish to me. Phase 1 tests the drug to see if it has any toxic effects on the body. Whether or not it actually works is irrelevant.\n\nPhase 2 tests whether or not the drug seems to work for a small population. This is where all NF drugs have failed up until this point.\n\nPhase 3 tests the drug against the current best therapy. For NF, the current best therapy is nothing, so, a placebo. It will also have a much larger participant count than a phase 2 trial.\n\nNormally a drug has to pass each phase in sequence to be approved to market. There are numerous phase two trials with various MEK inhibitors, all showing promising results. They are not a silver bullet (your plexiform will not disappear completely). But they do look to prevent it from growing literally minutes after first dose. About half see &gt;20% reduction in tumor size after a few months. \n\nSide effects are generally mild, and the body continually responds to treatment for years, which is rare - normally, the body stops responding to tumor suppressors.  Thanks!", "Finally remembered to look this up on Reddit Typical. Surprised to find the group so small. Are people using mostly throwaways for this?", "Brother with NF2 cannot eat anymore My brother has NF2 and from that he has always had difficulty swallowing. But this week it got to the point where he just cannot swallow anything solid, only liquids and soft foods. The doctors said it is not life threatening right now but it is just so sad and stressful to watch him struggle. Anyone else going through something similar or knows someone going through this??? Any advice or stories are greatly appreciated! What is he eating? Are you guys stuffing sugar and carbs down his throat? Because that will only kill him faster, give him liquids like raw milk, Raw Kefir or even blood from a freshly killed goat, Make him some raw liver smoothies.\n\nAnyways, good luck with everything. First of all, I am so sorry to hear what happened to your brother. What he is going through must be very difficult to deal with. Of course, you and your family must be struggling a lot too. First,  it is vital to keep liquids (water, juices) in him as well as soft foods. \n \nLike what the other post says, kefir and drinkable yoghurt can be good. It is tasty and very nutritious. For something with a lot of calories you can try Ensure Plus, or Scandi shake (you can get scandi packets online and mix the power with milk. It becomes a thick liquid, almost like a shake, but it has more than 500 calories and tons of vitamins and minerals). You can also try apple sauce or baby food which may not sound appetizing, but it tastes fine and is really just pureed food.\n\n Also, if you have time you can lightly cook some fruits or vegetables on the stove to soften it up, the puree it in a blender. Let the mixture cool down a bit, and feed it to him. Therefore he can have some tasty fruits or veggies in puree form so it can go down easy. \n\nI think it can also help to give him company. It must be very hard for him right now and it may lift his spirits to have family there for him. Maybe read to him or watch a show together. I wish you, your family, and your brother the best. NF can be a real bitch sometimes...  I do not understand why you would say this, do you understand what this condition is, or does to a person? Thank you so much for this advice, we are trying to stay as strong as possible I have vocal cord paralysis, an unexpected complication of NF2. When my dad (who had NF2) underwent a surgery, he had a stroke in the OR that left his ability to swallow completely destroyed. After that, he needed to use a GI tube for eating. Funpen has given you what I think is the most vital piece of advice. Keeping him company.  Things like this are so difficult to go through.  If meal times are causing stress because of this change you can try audible books. I know it sounds strange but it worked for my family. \n\nAlso if you try the baby food applesauce or pears you can add a pinch of cinnamon. It will make a big flavor boost. \n\nI am sorry I cannot think of anything else useful to help. I will be thinking about you and your brother. It is hard to be strong all the time. Make sure you take care of yourself as well. I have been known to cry in the shower and punch pillows! It is ok. If you ever need anyone to talk to send me a message. Thank you so so much for your kind words, this has probably been the hardest week for all of us and I really appreciate this. I am trying to take care of myself too but I cannot stop thinking about him Thank you for this advice again, I have been spending some extra time with him just playing video and card games. I have NF2 and had a similar problem 4 years ago. I felt like i had something stuck in the back of my throat. At the time i already knew for a few years that i had a meningioma pushing near the medial meningeal artery, waiting for the right time to operate and  remove it. When it was later (partially) removed, the sensation mostly disappeared.  \n  \nThe advice i can give you is to take an MRI, so the doctor can see if there is any tumor that could cause that swallowing problem I am glad that the sensation mostly disappeared for you. My brother has had a history of difficulty swallowing. I do not know if you care, but my brother is actually eating well again! It was just a mixture of acid reflux and anxiety that caused his throat to seize up every time he wanted to swallow. The speech pathologist helped him to realize that he has the ability to swallow, but he just needs to ignore his anxiety about choking. Its happens , especially if he did have an epi9of choking . I have nf2 and I have problems swallowing as well . When I see my neurologist I always forget to mention my swallowing problem. It is very frightening . I still stay away from bread and any thing that is dry and can cause choking . Just keep a close eye on him when he is eating and it might help his anxiety as well . And lots of water . Thanks for this advice. I cannot even imagine how frightening it must be to have anxiety about swallowing, I wish the best for both my brother and you.", "Contrast Question I had my first MRI in 9 years on Friday with contrast and ever since then, the smell of anything cooked in a frying pan is making me gag. I forget if this is normal or not since it is been so long. Do you guys have a similar experience? I am starving but everything is unappetizing right now. I have had contrast many many times and I have never had this reaction. I have had dozens of contrasts but never had this experience so I am not sure EDIT: given current events, you might want to consider mentioning this to a doctor. It looks like odor distortions, and not just odor loss, is a common COVID symptom.\n\n....\n\nI have never experienced anything like what you describe after an MRI. (Which by itself does not mean much, I am not a doctor anything.) But I think if this were common someone would have mentioned it.\n\nAre there any other possibilities? Have you eaten old pine nuts recently? Is your frying oil rancid? Have you been infected with COVID or another respiratory disease? Is pregnancy a possibility? Are any other things smelling or tasting different? Is your general sense of smell different (stronger or weaker) than normal?\n\nIs it just one pan or all pans? Has your oil or butter gone rancid?\n\nIf it is not the oil or pan specifically, I would discuss this with your doctor right away. Specifically because if it is something like Covid the location you got the MRI will want to check everyone to contact trace. I have had contrast before and never had anything like that happen. The only time I smell anything related to the contrast is when they inject the contrast into the iv, but after a couple of minutes the smell is gone. I had Covid back in February and my symptoms were cold-like, I only lost my smell and taste for three days. I had a pregnancy test on Friday before my MRI and it came back negative (I also woke up with my cycle this morning)... I could just be having an adverse reaction to the contrast, I should ask someone if it is not gone soon. Quick update: My mom asked my uncle - who is a radiologist - and he said the metallic taste/smell is normal and should go away after a few days. I am just frustrated I guess that it is even a thing and that I need another MRI.", "Child possibly has NF1 We are based in the UK\n\nI am currently 28 weeks pregnant, my partner has NF1. He has very mild symptoms - not many neurofibromas, hypertension (well controlled with medication). \n\nWe have pushed for genetic testing since we found out I was pregnant. It was not until last week the geneticist contacted me (at 27 weeks pregnant). She was surprised it had taken so long to be referred. \n\nAnyway, she is recommended waiting until she is born to test, we have agreed. We have an appointment with the geneticist closer to my due date, but we are both anxious.\n\nIf she has the gene, what can we expect as a new born? Are there symptoms from birth? \n\nWe want to do our absolute best for her. Any advice or personal stories? There is a great Facebook group called NF mums rock. You should join..I understand symptoms vary greatly bit the first fins are the Cafe au lait macules. Neurofibromatosis effects everyone different, some are effected right away, while others may not be effected until puberty. It was believed after I was born that I had it, an eye doctor was the first one to suggest that I have Neurofibromatosis when I was a baby, I was born with a lazy right eye so I was seeing eye doctors right away.\n\nWhen I was nine my pediatrician referred me to university of Michigan to be checked out for Neurofibromatosis, but results were inconclusive. When I was 15 she was still convinced I had, she called Grand Rapids, told them my history and what she was seeing, they told her to have me to to Chicago, as it was the same distance from where I was at and the doctor there is the best of the best. I would then be diagnosed a couple months later.\n\nIf you have any questions let me know I am 18 and I did not get it through genes, since neither of my parents have it. But they did not start seeing signs until I was 5, which is when I was diagnosed. But it is different for everyone. So I would not be sure. I would join groups like the other commenter suggested such as mom oriented Facebook groups with children that have NF. You could definitely find different stories/perspectives there :) I was the youngest of three. My mom noticed as soon as I was born that I had a lot of  birth marks. She kept telling my dad it did not seem right, he thought it was nothing. My mom then asked my doctor and he happened to actually know of NF and right away counted and took the measurements of them and I was diagnosed at a very young age. They knew it from a verre young age. I had only some speech problems,  i am short, had some caf\u00e9 au lait spots, epilepsy ( went away as I got older) and neurofibromas. When i became 18 they said i do not really need follow up unless i have problems. At 24 ,they found a plexiform neurofibroma. Then they told me that science now thinks yearly follow up is needed for everyone.\n\nOne of the most frustrating things is that some people treat me like a child. It is not because i am small that i can nog take care of myself. It is not because i have neurofibromatosis tharlt i can not take care of myself. Luckily most People know by now. I am in my 3th year of nursing school and i am working as an nursing assistent. Nf1 is a highly complex disease, often misunderstood, underestimated  disease, mainly reduced to the skin tumours that are our hallmark.\n\nClinical signs of NF1 have a different age of onset, in other words they are age-dependent. Each clinical sign of NF1 is not increasing in frequency with age but has its own specific age of onset. \n\nThe NF1 gene, neurofibromin, influences many cellular pathways and in particular four Ras/MAPK, Akt/mTOR, ROCK/LIMK/cofilin, and cAMP/PKA pathways. Most of the clinical research is focused on the infamous RAS, key to the neurofibroma and plexiform development, neglecting the other pathways which play a role in our cognition, bones, vascular health, ....\n\nSome countries will delay genetic testing and opt for clinical signs and will often search for signs that are not present at that specific age. \n\nThe ones that might be present and visible  at birth are the caf\u00e9 au lait spots, the plexiform and the bone dysplasia.  The freckling in skin folds will occur around the age of 4-5, the Lisch nodules even later, at age 10, only 50% have them and so on.\n\nThere are of course exceptions. Nf1 has an unbelievable level of variety when it comes to manifestations and their severity. A person can have only a couple of harmless symptoms, another many more and be a severe case.\n\nSome manifestations are congenital. A child will be born with them and these are the bones dysplasia and it seems the plexiform. They might not be evident straight away , like for example the Sphenoid wing dysplasia or tibial dysplasia, or not develop from birth like the plexiform, some will remain \"dormant\" and unnoticed for years until they start growing. \n\nEarly diagnosis is key. Understanding what the Nf1 gene does and as importantly does not, is very important to give the child the best chances. \n\nWe have made immense progress in the molecular understanding of Nf1 in the recent years, which of course is impossible to summarise in a single post, but to make it very simple, NF1 affect the normal cell life cycle in every step, and when mutated , the cycle is dysregulated in many ways, from excessive cell proliferation, to senescent cells not being removed and replaced. \n\nWhat is also clear now is how important the cell environment is. Nothing in the body acts in isolation. This explains why two people, even two identical twins with the same DNA, the same NF1 mutation will have different outcomes, even extremely different as the famous Pearson Twins have shown us. \n\nThis means, it is not only in the gene and that there might be room for intervention. Educate, advocate is my message. Educate yourself and advocate for yourself or your child. \n\nWe know inflammation (through T-cells)  will drive neurofibromas growth, so an anti-inflammatory diet might help . We know girls have more risks to lose vision to glioma so early detection and treatment is paramount. We know that our fat storage myopathy that makes many of us weak can be fixed with L-Carnitine. We know that neurofibromas have extremely high number of mast cells and that taking a mast cells regulators such as Ketotifen can help prevent (only prevent, not reverse ) neurofibromas and should be considered from adolescence . We know we have a very high risk of cancer (59.6%) so we need regular screening.  We know we have poor bones quality so building high bone density early on is important. We know... we know.... \n\nWe know a lot. Know the issue, try to prevent it or to lessen its impact. No guarantee of course, the cell is immensely complicated. \n\nDespite all we know, we cannot predict. Many of us are totally unaffected, others with the same mutation severely affected. \n\nIn addition to Facebook, there is a patient platform called Inspire in which we tend to go deeper into the science. \n\nI live in Australia, which I believe is as bad as UK (we follow your guidelines) when it comes to education and approach. Very much reactive (wait for a problem to occur) and very different from many countries in which being proactive is recommended. An example : me waiting for a problem to occur before acting would mean waiting for a fracture before addressing my low bone density. Being proactive would mean mitigating my bone loss, and trying to slow it down and possibly stabilise. \n\nWebsites in the USA are so much better and more updated. Check ( and CTF   \n(  ( \n\nNot only for your child, but your husband as well. If we know we have higher risk of cancer, we can adopt and anticancer lifestyle and diet to try to lower that risk, the same for our dementia risk, we should improve cognitive function and adopt preventative measures in our 40s\n\nIn my view, for the NF1 issues that are not congenital, there is room for intervention since cellular pathways are nutrient sensing, both on what is present but most importantly on what is lacking (nutrient scarcity) . \n\nWe cannot fix Nf1, we cannot cure Nf1, but I do not think we are inactive spectators. After I found out my daughter definitely had NF1, thru genetic testing, it explained a lot of things about her. \nWe did not realize until she was 12 that she had tumors on her skull. She always would cry when her hair was brushed or combed but we could not feel any bumps. (I had to change doctors to get a neurology appointment.) Small tumors hurt the same as large tumors.\nI always had her do what everyone else did be it sports, martial arts, art. Each child had the same opportunities.\nSince you, the parent, know your child could be in pain, just acknowledge but do not let the child give up. Always encourage they work, ad much as possible thru the pain and they will figure out how to succeed. Do not give an opportunity to fail\nYou must raise your child like he/she does not have NF. There are no excuses for bad behavior. I realize that my daughter has to push to get out of bed some days but she understands that no one wait for her.\nOn an up note my daughter has her BA from the university and plans to return to school to learn a trade, making string instruments.\nDo not be afraid.\nAll you have to do is just love your child the best way you know how. \nYou child may be the one who changes the world. It took 5 years after I was born for my mum to get referred for my diagnosis of NF1, it does not really affect my life much apart from fitness and the fact whenever it gets too cold, my tumour causes weird sensations, I have had it checked and it is not cancerous or anything dangerous but I live the cold, hate the tumour, I am hoping to get it removed soon Thanks for your posts. You seem very knowledgeable about NF1. The cancer statistic in this post (~60% lifetime cancer risk) is new to me. As well as the increased risk of dementia. Can you shed some light on these? Thank you so much. I am going to link the research to you but before that I want to specify that I am not highlighting this to scare anyone but to urge people to be aware of the risks for both cancer and dementia, in order to do something about that risk. Lifestyle intervention can lower the risk of cancer and I believe reduce our chances of developing dementia. \n\nThe good thing is the lifestyle is exactly the same for both, so by addressing one you address the other as well. One cannot reverse Alzheimer disease, so we should act early to protect our mind and cognition further down. \n\nFor cancer, there is also the imaging and screening that can be done. \n\nAfter reading the cancer literature in 2016, I researched and changed my diet in 2017, enrolled in three clinical trials on cancer incidence in Nf1. This allowed me to stay close to the research and benefit from the imaging being trialled. \n\n**CANCER**\n\nThis was the 2016 study that opened the gate to a new view on our risk for cancers. \n\n(  \n\n\"An estimated lifetime cancer risk for patients with NF1 was 59.6%.\" \n\nIt was also reported in the latest Nf1 book from Tadini and Legius published last year. \n\n\u201c9.20 Oncologic Evaluation  \nMalignancies are the leading cause of death in NF1 \\. Many malignancies occur more commonly in individuals with NF1 patients as compared to the general population, often occurring at an earlier age and with variable prognoses. There is up to a fivefold increase in cancer incidence in the NF1 population and the lifetime cancer risk for patients with NF1 was estimated to be 59.6% in a Finnish cancer registry study \\. The most common malignancies associated with NF1 are intracranial gliomas and MPNST. CNS tumors occur in approximately 20% of patients with NF1 and are usually detected in early childhood \\.\u201d  \nExcerpt From: Gianluca Tadini. \u201cMultidisciplinary Approach to Neurofibromatosis Type 1.\u201d Apple Books. \n\nOther countries have already changed their guidelines for our surveillance . From the French guidelines:  ( \n\n\"Oncological manifestations  \nNF1 is associated with an increased risk of malignancy and a life expectancy about 10\u201315\u2009years shorter than the general population. Malignancies are the leading cause of death in NF1 \\. A patient with NF1 is four times more likely to develop a malignancy as compared to the general population \\.\"\n\n**DEMENTIA**\n\nThe alert on dementia is very recent, July 2021. However it is coming from the same team and research centre that completely changed the view on  Nf1 and cancer, so I am taking this very seriously. \n\n(\n\n\"Dementia and especially Alzheimer disease are previously unrecognized neurological complications of NF1.\" \n\nSo now I am doing what I did for cancer.  Reading about prevention and for that I think Ayesha Sherzai and Dean Sherzai are the best , I bought their books , listened to interviews and what they say resonate very much with me.  I have added alerts on clinical trials portals so I can follow the science and see when and where this will be looked at. \n\nAnother reason not to wait for symptoms before acting, given that Alzheimer's cannot be reversed, but only prevented. However other types of cognitive decline and dementias can be corrected. \n\nMy diet is already pretty good, but my sleep is terrible. I struggle to maintain sleep. I wake up at stupid of the clock and I am unable to go back to sleep. Thank you so much. This is so helpful. I am impressed with your research and your preventative approaches. I do not have NF1 but my daughter does so it is helpful to think about what we can and cannot control. Hang in there. I hope you get some sleep soon! How old is your daughter? Have you ever heard of Ketotifen? 2.5 yo. Tell me about Ketotifen. I am going out now and will write more when back, meanwhile I explained it here ( and there is also a couple more people who shared their experience. \n\nIf I had a child with it, I would 100% consider it at their puberty One can'y talk about a preventative approach  to Nf1 and neglect to talk about Ketotifen, a paediatric anti histamine drug used in young children. Very safe, very cheap. Neurofibroma are made of a high number of mast cells. Ketotifen is a mast cells stabiliser and might help prevent new neurofibromas from forming. It will not make old ones go away. \n\nVincent Riccardi, famous Nf1 doctor, strongly suggests it and many others endorse it. Depending where you live, you can buy it over the counter or have it made in a compounding pharmacy or buy it from Canada, Japan, ...\n\nI think parents should be made aware that it exists and they should be given the choice to try it out when the first neurofibromas appear.  I am taking it because I am on the wrong side of 50 and it is well documented that this is a period of life with an acceleration and worsening of neurofibromas. If you do not mind me asking: does your partner have freckling, or \"freckles\", on the body?Thanks.  My partner was not diagnosed until he was 14 or 15. He is never had any eye problems, did not really have any signs of the disorder until he was hitting puberty.\n\nIt seems such a varied disease, everyone is different experiences. My partner has no speech problems growing up, no neurological problems either. He is got quite a few neurofibromas, but they are mostly on his back. \n\nI have only just heard of plexiform neurofibromas. He does not have any, never had any. He is never mentioned them to me! How do they differ from neurofibromas?\n\nMy partner is 5\u20194\u201d, so not tiny, but much short than most other men.\n\nMy brother has just graduated as a nurse this year! Congratulations on getting to your third year, it is a hard degree! He has the \u201ctypical\u201d freckling on the axillary and groin. Also got it on his lower back. Thank you for the reply! Loads of information for me to digest :)\n\nI want to be proactive, I want to learn everything I can. I want to be her advocate, especially whilst she is too young to speak for herself.\n\nI have been \u201cnagging\u201d my partner a lot more about his diet and lifestyle. He goes away a lot for work, he used to eat a lot of crap (he gets to charge dinner to his work). It is hard to teach an old dog new tricks ;) Baby is not born yet and could possibly very well NOT have Nf1. So, enjoy the lastt weeks of pregnancy and then do the test so instead of worrying for months or obsessing about any skin mark that can occur, you know. If NHS will not pay for it, have it done privately for US$375 at invitae if you can afford it (250 for test and 125 for consultation). \n\nWhen it comes to your husband, he needs to rule out a couple of things with his hypertension. Renal artery stenosis and phaeochromocytoma (commonly called a pheo) are the most characteristic specific causes of hypertension to occur in association with NF1. Roughly 50% of those with hypertension have a physical cause for it, and 50% have the \"normal/general \" population essential  hypertension .  Why does he need to know? Because a pheo needs to be removed and the stenosis needs surveillance. \n\nA lot of new information on NF1 has been emerging, and some countries have been quicker than others at changing the guidelines for our care. There is usually a 10-15 years gap between research and change of protocol. \n\nAustralia is way behind, so I follow the French ones (  . Fortunately, Addenbrooks has agreed to test her cord blood when she is born. So we will not be charged at all for the diagnosis. I am trying not to worry, it is 50/50. I want to be as informed as I can be! Hopefully it will be wasted effort.\n\nAs for my partner, he does have hypotension. He is only just this last year been put on Rampril. He has been monitoring himself for years and mentioned it various time to his GP, but he was often fobbed off because he is \u201cyoung\u201d. \nHe was going to ask about his kidneys at his yearly review at Guy\u2019s hospital, but with the pandemic it is been cancelled for the last two years. \n\nAs I said, I have been a bit of a nag about his diet. If he had it his way, he would eat fried chicken everyday! You can nag all you want, if he does not want to change, he will not . \n\nOn the blood pressure front, please have him watch this segment from the NF Network ( at minute 12. The video is called \" 10 Things Everyone Should Know About Their NF1 \"by by Doug Stewart, MD, Investigator, Clinical Genetics Branch Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics National Cancer Institute. \n\nGood to know, you baby's cord will be tested, and you will be spared unnecessary anxiety. \n\nBest wishes/ Thank you, two more years and i am graduated. \n\nA plexiform mostly is there at birth/very young but not always visible then because they are too small. They often grow during puberty/young adulthood. The biggest difference is that a plexiform neurofibroma has a small chance of getting malignant (like 5-10%) , they can also grow over the full distance of a nerve. Not everybody has them. A subcutaneous can alse become malignant but that chache is even smaller. A cutaneous neurofibroma does not become malignant but may Hurt. \n\n It is mostly important he goes to the doctor if he has pain or other things that sudddenly chance.", "Mom's in the hospital again, losing hope Mom's had many NF2 surgeries over the years, to include a successful brain surgery last year.  She is been to the ER 8 times over the last 10 days though and is in the hospital; we suspect a spinal cord tumor that is on top of something around her hip/lower back.  I expect she is going to be transferred to the Cleveland Clinic once her pain is under control (she is on morphine).\n\nSurgery is worst case scenario but what we expect is going to be needed.  Would love any ideas on breakthrough non-surgical options; our family is crushed. Im sorry that you are going through that. I wish words could help. thanks, they do. This has got to be so hard for all of you.  Bless you and your mom.   thanks You are welcome.  Hope you are ok.   I am soon traveling to Mass Gen Hospital (MGH) to see Dr. Plotkin. My sister has described Dr. P as \"the man who *will* cure NF2.\" My understanding is that there is a new drug that supposedly treats both meningiomas and schwanomas that is being released soon. That is the purpose of my visit-to get on that clinical trial. Do yourself and your fam a favor and look them up.  I feel she will be ok. I also have NF and have had 27 brain surgeries. I have bounced back every time. Positivity is key. Best of luck to her. No kidding, can you provide some details on the trial?  That is really interesting...! God bless you.  That is incredible.  It is indeed all about positivity and we really tried to maintain that attitude.  I am happy to report that while she had surgery it was successful and she is starting to begin the recovery process!! I am glad to hear everything went well. Although the road to recovery may be a long one, she will bounce back. There are several clinical trials underway, I do not want to limit how you are thinking so I want to implore you to check out ( and ( I did two trials with NIH and I will be going to MassGen soon. Let me know if you have specific questions and I will do what I can.  Do you know what the specific drug you mentioned is called? Avastin is the one I did at NIH and not sure on the others (have not met the Plotkin team yet).  Ah okay. I was on Avastin for about five years. I would still be on it but it was starting to fry my kidneys. \n\nLet me know what the others are when you find it, okay? :) Avastin fucked up my joints so I hear ya. I have my appt. with the Plotkin team in March. I really suggest contacting them they have a slate of drugs and trials set up. My sister who also has NF2 researches the science of NF, she claims that \"he will be the one to cure NF2.\"  I will definitely look into it for sure. I know a bit about the science behind it, also. So that is nice to hear\n\nSorry to hear about your joints. How long were you on it? 9 months? That was the timeframe for the clinical trial. I had some positive outcomes but not enough to warrant continuing the drug given the pain it was causing me. Sadly that pain has not gone away in the years since I stopped.  Sorry to hear that :/. I do not know if they just lowered the dose for me or what but I was not in any pain at all. Though I cannot hold my liquor at all now, heh. \n\nIt made my hearing a bit better but other than that it did not shrink any of the fibromas. Though we speculate it slowed their growth.  Yeah that was the final analysis for me too. Sorry to hear about your kidneys. Its kind of absurd how many body parts and systems get wrecked by NF2 and its various treatments.

Good or bad idea, and would it affect my NF? I am a 35 year old male and wanting to add more muscle mass while hitting the gym.  I have heard somewhere that estrogen might play a part in tumors growing, had anyone else heard this? I am also interested is taking a testosterone booster If you looking for \"gainz\" I would drink protein shakes after every workout. Amino acids also help. Take 5 with every meal and after you work out. I put on about 15lbs of muscle in 3 months (although I was working out ~17hrs/week, 3rd month of working out). Testosterone boosters do not do anything.

There is some promising MEK  \nand ERK inhibitors being studied that might eventually be helpful.  \nNeurofibromin fits in to the MAPK/ERK pathway, where excessive ERK  \nand MEK maybe upregulated.

Hi,\n\nMy daughter (15 months) has sphenoid wing dysplasia as a result of nf1 as well. She also has pulsating exophthalmos. We are not sure if there are any plexiform neurofibromas involved, as she has not yet had an MRI yet. From what I understand however, is that, as with many things nf-related, cases may vary greatly. So based on my own experience, and speaking to doctors:\n\n1. Yes. From what I understand, sphenoid wing dysplasia is quite common in nf1. Asymmetry can be mild or severe. In some cases it is really obvious, (like the ones you find on Google image search) in other cases it would be hard to tell if you do not know. The asymmetry is something that can be 'fixed' through operating, though. Damage to the optic nerve however, is not. Therefore, this is what doctors focus on, especially shortly after diagnosis.\n\n2. My daughter had had her optic nerve checked three times over the course of a few months now, and so far, the optic nerve was not influenced by the pulsation. During our last visit, the doctor even indicated that she considers the optic nerve 'safe' and that any future damage to her eyesight would be very unlikely. She did remind us to check her eye regularly though, to see if it has not further 'popped out' as that could happen. Or it could not. That is nf, unfortunately. \n\n3. Yes, it can be 'just' the sphenoid wing dysplasia, but there could also be plexiform neurofibromas involved. The latter would be rare. The only way to tell would be an MRI. Thanks so much for your response.  If you do not mind sharing from your own life (feel free to pm instead of reply) - has your daughter's dysplasia shown externally visible progression over her 15 months of life?  Is it a mild case of SWD?  I just ask as I am looking for assurance that my son will not develop severe disfigurations.\n\nI have noticed that by 9 months, head circumference appears to have already finished half its growth over a person's lifetime from birth according to most growth charts that I have seen.  I am hoping that is some modicum of good news. No problem. And I do not mind sharing it here as it may be useful for others in the future. Feel free to pm me though.\n\nAs to the progression over the course of her 15 months: I am not sure. I remember that shortly after she was born (and not yet diagnosed) I noticed that her right eye was 'bigger' than her left eye, but I did not think much of it back then but it means it was already noticable just after she was born. A baby's/kid's face changes so much during the first few years of their lives however: she looks nothing like she did a year ago and will probably look a bit different a year from now as well. I cannot say that the asymmetry has gotten a lot worse though, just a little more obvious as she has gotten bigger. Yes, her right eye looks a bit different from her left eye, and the upper right part of forehead is a little steeper than the left, but it all falls within 'normal' ranges, I think. She does not look like a disfigured person at all and if you would not know, you could not tell. \n\nAs for the operating: I think you are right. It also has to be quite a severe case from what I understand, as it is merely seen as a 'cosmetic' issue.", "NF2 and peripheral nerve tumors in the arm. I have a recurring tumor in my forearm, which was removed once and grew back. I have a dull aching pain in a different part of my upper arm on the same side. \n\nAnyone experience similar symptoms? If so what did you/your team decide to do? I have NF 1 and in 2018 I have a peripheral nerve tumor that had turned cancerous removed from my arm. It cause a lot of pain, so much that it would wake me up in the middle of the night. I also had one removed in 2014 from my leg. I had to have surgery on both to remove the tumors. Thank you for your input. \n\n&gt; peripheral nerve tumor that had turned cancerous \n\nGood lord. Are you OK? I did not even know that was a thing. NF is fulla fuckin surprises, eh? Yeah, I am fine. Thank you for asking.  Unfortunately yes these rumors can turn cancerous. Crazy! I have one in my right forearm as well. Hurts like a SOB when I hit it on my steering wheel every damn day. Hi I am 45 and I have had one removed from my hand but seems like you remove one and 2 more comes back ? I have had like new growths that hurt so much and these doctors are so slow in doing anything.  Seems like as I am getting older they are really deciding to take over is that happening to anyone ? Are your spine or brain tumors responding the same way? Or does this seem to be a specific response to PNTs? Not spine or brain. They decided to leave those.  Just right hand .", "Question for everyone out there. How often do neurofibromas grow back after they have been surgically removed? \nDoes anyone know the rate of % of tumour regrowth? I had one removed from my bladder the other day. (Extremely rare for them to grow in that area, there are not many known cases) \n\nI am about to have 8 small lumps removed from various places just under my skin, and I am wanting to know if anyone has any idea what the stats are on % of regrowth. \n\nAll I know for certain is that sometimes they do not grow back, but sometimes they do. \n\nThanking you all in advance and I hope you are all well and safe. AFAIK it really depends on how much it they can remove, which depends on the location of it. I have had 2 of them removed: one on the hearing nerve and the other on the brain meninx. In the first case they did not fully remove it because that would have lead to a great loss in hearing, in the second case they did not remove it fully either because it was on the middle meningeal artery which supplies blood to pretty important tissues, and when they tried to remove a bigger portion of it during the surgery the evoked potentials dropped drastically, so they decided to leave a small part of it in place to avoid brain damage. AFAIK neurofibromas on average tend to be pretty mild tumors that grow at a relatively slow rate, and they tend to not spawn metastasis around, so if they manage to remove it fully, they often do not grow back at all. That is what i have been told by people that know better. Right now my tumor on the acoustic nerve (that was removed 10,5 years ago) has slowly grown back, but it is not yet at a point in which it may compromise hearing, while the one in the brain that was removed 4 years ago is growing back at a faster rate and the doctors that follow me are pretty concerned with it; may need another surgery in 3 or so years, even though it is not easy to forecast those things as sometimes they stop for a while and then start growing again  \n  \nI do not have accurate stats, especially on the neurofibromas of the skin that you have, but I am pretty sure that the data exist. If you are really really interested, i might try to ask someone in my family for some article, since they work in academic medicine and have free access to the literature I am not the OP , but i am interested Unfortunately it is different for everyone, I have had four different surgeries and have had tumors grow back, that we are now keeping an eye on. My doctor would prefer to avoid surgery if possible. If they can remove 100% then it will not grow back, but a new one could form theoretically.\n\nThe reason the tumours form is because you have two copies of the neurofibromin Gene. Those with neurofibromatosis are born with one damaged copy in every cell. When the second, healthy copy is damaged, this is when a tumour can form. Thus, if the surgery removes all cells with a damaged second copy of NF, there is no remaining cell that can continue tumour growth. However, new mutations are introduced into the genome all the time, and could damage the Healthy NF Gene in a different cell, causing a new tumor to form I am not a doctor, but I think it depends on the size and method of removal. I recently had electrodesiccation to remove about 50 small bumps, and I was told that they should not come back. With that being said, there were a few of the larger tumors under the skin that will need to be removed via incision because the electrodesiccation was not enough to destroy all of the tissue. I think that the ones under the skin, as long as your surgeon removes all of it, it should not come back. I think regrowth is common. That being said, I have had tumors removed over 15 years ago that have not come back. But overall my case is very mild and limited to certain segments of my body. How mild or severe your case is might play a part in recurrence rate, I think. I have had a few removed. One from the back of my head (not grown back) one from my back shoulder area (not gown back) and, one from my beast area ( not grown back) i think it all depends on, if the doctor removes 100% of the NF.", "Scared of MPNST I have started to worry about MPNST, since it according to what I have read, most common earliest cause of death with people who have NF. Do you know are there some ways to lower their risk, other than early detection? I have only few lumps and non of them are plexiform or (to my knowledge) atypical, but still, that 8-13% risk scares me.\n\nWhat has got me also scared is that I have had some burning pain near my lump. This is really rough and maybe inaccurate estimate, but maybe a 6 cm away from it. It is around maybe a minute or two and then it just stops. It is, not constant and is not every day occurance. I had one maybe a week ago. I noticed that lump like 7 months ago and then there was nothing. There are no other symptoms (swelling, rapid growth (lump has been same pea sized thing since I found it), etc. I have been bit dizzy, but I think that is just because I have been tired, but it is still one of the symptoms..\n\nAnyhow, I am scared that it could be that. What should I do? Go to a doctor, let it be or what? I know this might be overreacting and I should not jump to conclusions, but I cannot help it since I know there is that increased risk. I do not think it is possible to lower the risk of MPNST. You really cannot prevent the growth and how the tumor reacts. It is best to see a doctor if you feel the need. They can order tests for you. If you do not see one, this will be on your mind constantly and will drive you crazy. Do not mean this in a bad way. I can just see it is really stressing you out and it is affecting your mindset. Symptoms you mentioned are those of people with NF. It could be a variety of things. I have never once worried about my condition. You are correct that MPNST is the highest mortality risk with NF.  However, I was just reading a study that indicated that a majority of MPNST deaths are preventable if the MPNST is caught early enough.  (I am sorry I cannot link to what I was reading.  It was several days ago and I read a TON of NF stuff that day and have not been able to find it again).  The size of the MPNST was highly predictive of mortality with tumors &gt;7 cm representing the highest risk.  \nSo, GO TO THE DOCTOR!!! When in doubt go to doctor. Pain does not always mean it is something  malignant. But it is possible. I have had two and I am still here, so I would not believe everything you read. I have had one removed from my upper right leg in 2014 which was a high grade. The other was removed in 2018 in my upper right arm, this one ended up being a lower graded compared to the one on my leg.\n\nI did not need chemo for either one. Both surgeries went well. The one on my leg was about 2-3 weeks recovery. The one on my arm, I was actually able to go home that night after I had woken up from my surgery. Recovery for that one which was mostly feeling sore and not being able to get it wet was about two weeks. I had to wrap it up when I bathed.\n\nFeeling dizzy is common with Neurofibromatosis, that is a pretty normal symptom. The way I knew something was up before I found out about the tumor in my leg being cancerous was, I was having extreme pain in my right leg. Very different than the pain I am used to. This pain was a burning pain, that would shoot up and down my leg, would make me very uncomfortable and would wake me up from sleep. Once the cancerous tumors were removed, that pain went away and I was good.\n\nIf you have questions, please let me know. As I said, lump has not grown rapidly and has always been pretty much size of pea (maybe even smaller) and is mobile. Does that tell anything? Way I would describe pain I had was kind of tingly burning, it hurt for sure, but definetly not worse pain ever nor extreme. I know this because I have had already pheocromacytoma, which first symptom was extreme headache. My pain was constant everyday throughout the day, with those types of tumors. That when I knew something was wrong. Any time anything like that happens, it is always good to contact your doctor, so they can run some test, usually MRIs. I do not want to sound like an dick, but you really should not worry about something that has not been diagnosed. If you are really worried about this, you should see a doctor and if they are worried, they will reportcto a specialist and before that check it with MRI.\n\nI know this stuff is scary, but you should not be afraid of something that has not been diagnosed or something that is not even there. I myself would not be worried, hand pain could be because of a lot of things like physical activity, sleeping positions, anxiety or regular NF pains, etc. but if pain comes back or gets worse, you notice other symptoms or that they would get worse or most importantly, if you have worries that you cannot put on ease, go to a doctor to actually know. Anyhow, I would not be worried that you have MPNST. \n\nAll the best to you and God bless. Plus, I want to add that most of the MPNST's are linked to plexiforms. Not all of them, but pretty significant amount. I know that you know this, since you mentioned you do not have any, but that means your risk is even lower than number that has been presented.\n\nHopefully that gives you some comfort.  Afraid I do not know about the \u2018mobility\u2019 of it, tho others here will, but if you have never had it looked at, please do!  Especially since you are experiencing pain. In the only ever made clinical study about Nf1 and diet, there is an interesting paragraph about the effect of curcumin \n\n\"Another study demonstrated that curcumin increases the sensitivity of neurofibromin deficient MPNST cells to TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand), downregulating anti-apoptotic proteins \\( Curcumin may also exert an anti-proliferative effect by decreasing the enzymatic activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R). In fact, NF1 Schwann cells exhibit an aberrant EGF-R expression, which has been linked to increased cellular proliferation and malignancy \\( \n\nMPNST is one of the most common cancer that we have an increased risk for. Sadly it is not the only one. To increase my chances, I follow an anti-cancer diet, high in polyphenols with enormous amounts of vegetables. \n\nAny sign or changes that worries you, get it checked, which I understand is not easy with COVID or the crazy medical fees you have in the USA Would level of pain tell anything? As said, it is bit of like burning pain, but nothing extreme or unbearable. Plus, it is not on the lumb, but near it.\n\nMaybe, I should get it checked after Christmas if it bothers me still. I have had no new pains for awhile now. I forgot to tell, but before christmas, I got appointment to a doctor in 4th of January and earlier times were not possible. Cannot get my mind off this shit, but I have to so I do not lose my mind or start prematurely planning my funeral :D Doctor thinks it might be lipoma, cyst or just regular nf lump, but wants to be sure, so I will have ultrasound in 2 weeks, so we can be sure. And if they think it is needed, they will take biopsy sample.\n\nAnyways, doc thinks I should not lose my sleep over this and most likely is nothing serious.", "I know I am probably posting here too much but im just wondering some things We have no diagnosis, we just started looking into it, but my 11 month old baby has ~6 CALS and I have a birthmark on my upper thigh which consists of a large splotch of freckles (its been there since early childhood, I am not a ginger, I have no other body freckles.

If I have nf1, is this how its always going to be for me probably? Or is there still a chance I will break out in tumors in the future?\n\nDoes anyone here have legius syndrome? The facial characteristics of legius syndrome resemble several family members of mine. My grandma and some uncles, myself a little bit, and my 11 month old son. Huge heads run in our family. I myself cannot wear a standard sized motorcycle helmet for example. Maybe it is that?\n\nWe are waiting to be seen by a pediatric dermatologist in 2 months (ugh) but i got an appointment for myself in 2 weeks, and i will mention my son's CALS in the context of my freckle splotch and bumps.\n\nHe &amp; I have no neurological symptoms so I am thinking skipping to a neurologist is not what we should do right now, right? His pediatrician had nothing to say other than confirming that they were CALS. Can the dermatologist order the genetic testing herself? I dont know if I am doing this right. for me the first thing that was noticed were the spots.. just a few on my stomach..\n\nthe thing that made them really pay attention was my left leg snapping in half.. X-ray showed that the bone has been taken over by tumor (2 weeks old at that point lol) \n\nI would not skip seeing a neurologist..its a neurological condition, and plus a neurologist would more than likely not bat an eye at getting a genetic test done..\n\nits just a little swab in the cheek, a week later you will have a clear answer, shoot that test is so next level it will show where the nf1 coding error popped up. all I am trying to say is, if your kid does end up having NF1.\n\nA neurologist is someone you want on your side... from my experience many doctors who do not really have any knowledge about the condition will just send you running in circles/ subject the patient to many tests that are irrelevant...shoot they will even recommend surgeries..\n\na neurologist will not have all the answers. but I am positive they will be massively beneficial How do I get him an appointment with one? His pediatrician referred us to the derm, seems like he is not really up on things... First things first, NF1 CALs almost never occur on the face. \n\n\u201cAlthough they can be found anywhere on the body, even if more common on the torso, buttocks, and lower extremities, they do not usually appear on the face, \u201d  \nExcerpt From: Gianluca Tadini. \u201cMultidisciplinary Approach to Neurofibromatosis Type 1.\u201d Apple Books. \n\nI looked up the picture you posted of your leg hyperpigmentation in another discussion and this is not what the inguinal freckles looks like. For Nf1, it is now accepted and corrected, that we are not talking about  freckles but small CALs that are in the skin folds, so if you have them in your leg, no matter if high up, it does not fit the criteria. \n\nWe all develop skin growths over the course of the years. Skin tags and other tissue growth are part of getting older. \n\nNothing in what you say raises any flags for Nf1 but I am not a doctor and in my experience from the patients' forum Inspire, once the seed of doubt has been planted in a parent's mind, nothing but the genetic test can put that mind at peace. \n\nA dermatologist should be able to request a genetic test. Or have a look on genetic testing websites such as Invitae. They have doctors who can request a genetic test, if you can afford it. Yeah i read that too, but is not 4 cals on the face still kind of like... Concerning though? It is so unusual to even have that many, and then on top of that they are on the face? Quite the opposite I would say. Having the spot mainly on the face is reassuring NF1-wise because it points to Melasma more than Nf1. Melasma is a type of hyperpigmtation  that occurs on the face  and very rarely anywhere else. \n\nIt is good you are seeing a dermatologist , hopefully soon. I dont think babies get melasma, I cannot find anything about it occurring I would ask your son's pediatrician if he or she can refer you to a genetic counselor. They can help you get genetic testing for your child. If something does show up they may also want to test you and your significant other to determine if it is hereditary or a spontaneous mutation. I do not know. There are many conditions that come with hyperpigmentation, some are totally benign. \n\nSorry I am confusing you. \n\nBest wishes. Both of my sons have a lot of CALs. One is 7 and one is 4 now and nothing has come of it so far. We were referred to an NF1 clinic for screening and they basically said even though the kids have the spots, that is not enough to make a diagnosis and just to watch and see.", "I am running a race who is taking donations to help fight NFM.

Probably a dozen cafe Au lait spots and a couple of neurofibromas that I had cut out the last few years.  \n\nMy girlfriend and I plan to get engaged by the end of the year or early 2022 then try to have a baby not too far after since we are getting further into our thirties.  \n\nLast night she told me she had been researching NF a lot lately and knows it is basically a 50/50 shot our kid would have it.  She is seen pictures of the really severe cases and is freaked out pretty badly.  I told her that the extreme cases are more rare and data shows most cases tend to be milder.  Any one who went through something similar that could give me some words of comfort to ease her worry? Unfortunately, it is impossible to determine the severity of the case the a child would have. It may possibly be mild, however, it is just as likely that it could be severe. The only way to ensure your child is born without NF is to do in-vitro fertilization (which can potentially be expensive but can be covered by some insurances since NF is a legitimate genetic disorder). \n\nAs long as they already know which gene they are looking for from you, then they can isolate that gene in the sperm and make sure only those not affected by NF are introduced to the egg. This may be something you as a couple would want to look into to see if it is a potential option. Unfortunately every case with Neurofibromatosis is different, not everyone is effected the same way. While you have a mild case, it is possible that your child could have one of the more severe cases or not get it at all. \n\nNeither one of my parents have Neurofibromatosis, I will the oldest out of four kids and I was the only one born with Neurofibromatosis. My doctor say I am one of the more severe, now I do not have it anywhere as bad as the pictures you see online, my tumors are internal and a few have turned cancerous over the years that required surgery.\n\nNow there are ways to help prevent passing the condition, but that would require talking to specialty doctors and would cost money for the treatments. That is not an ideal situation for every couple, but it is an option that is out there.\n\nThis is a serious conversation you two need to have, because ultimately there is a 50% chance your child/children will be born with the condition and unfortunately there is no way to know how it will effect them. There is however now a drug called Koselugo that can help shrink tumors, so things are always changing in the medical world. \n\nIf you have any questions let me know Cool, I did not know that was an option. I will get her thoughts on it.  I am not worrying about it since it is a about 2 years away but I think that might put her mind at ease. Thank you! It is called PGD  you can look it up if you want. They explained it to me but i am a women so i do not know to process for a men. A big part will be the same. My specialists  do advise to use PGD if in want children. Even is you have a mild case, that does not mean your child will have too. I also advise you to to talk to a geneticist early even if you co not plan to have children now ( if not too expensive in your country) They can explain everything better and you have more time to think. The only way that is 80% certain, well there are 2. \nOne 60% success rate and one with 90%\n\nThis what my Neurologist told me, you go to a genetic doctor, and when you decide to have a baby. They will take your sperm and look for the clean one ( dont have NF )\n\nPS: This is in NYC, so dont know where you from My situation is almost same as yours, the only thing is my tumors did not turn cancerous , Nf1 is a multi organ disease. The issues we might encounter in life are not limited to the cutaneous neurofibromas . I was diagnosed as an adult and the first thing I was told was that me being a mild case was no guarantee any child of mine with nf would be the same. \n\nWith very few exceptions, there is no genotype -phenotype in Nf1, meaning knowing how a specific mutation will evolve. Two identical twins with the exact same mutation can have dramatic differences. The Pearsons twins are a famous example. \n\nYou are totally unaffected by Nf1, which is great, and I believe because of that, never having to deal with it, you know very little about it. \n\nThe recent French guidelines ( give a good overview on what **you** should be taking attention to and **you**  should schedule a check up from time to time. \n\nAs suggested by others, preimplantation diagnosis will avoid passing Nf1 to your children. \n\nA new project for a podcast for NF1 was presented at the incubator projects , I did not listen to it all, but an episode is centred on a dad talking about his daughter's journey with a brain tumour. Her NF1 was passed by his wife who was a very mild case. It is the third episode. \n\n( That is good to hear they did not turn cancerous. Yeah when they removed some from my spine,  and after analysis, turns out they were Benin That is good. I have NF1, my mum and dad did not have it I am the youngest of 3 and the only one to have it. Mine is quite bad but the tumours all on the inside, I have had lots of surgery and I have had two turn cancerous. But I have had 3 beautiful girl's and I have got 7 beautiful grandchildren on none of them have got it so that is a blessing. She is right to worry. \n\nI would not lie to her and tell her that it will be fine. I would not be in a relationship based on a lie or hope. Yess to all of this it can take awhile. Literally was going to type a novel about PDG and in-Vitro-fertilization ^^ but it is all here.\n\nI got a PDG test done recently. It is taken about 8 weeks do get the results. And jumping through the insurance hoops can get frustrating. Talk to your specialist about getting a referral for a genetic counselor. When you get the genetic counselor talk to them or the billing department about the billing codes they would use. The NF diagnosis. And the NPI of the facility. Mine cost around &amp;100, but if it was OON it would have been over 3,400. \n\nAlso I applaud you for having these hard conversations. It is uncomfortable and we all have our stories.

Has anyone tried cannabis oil to manage their pain? Not oil, but marijuana definitely helps. It is worth trying, but I would tell you to try it in bud form. wow.

And cost? Boy is diagnosed positive for NF1 but doctors do not seem to see the need for family \\(both children and parents\\) to get genetic tests.  Cannot understand why they will not refer family for testing.  Anyway, we need to find a way to get the testing for all the family.  Any recommendations on where to find reasonable priced testing? Thanks You go to see a neurologist. They look for a certain number of symptoms to be present.  If you need to pay for the tests you might want to just get yourselves (mum and dad) tested. If both tests come back negative there is little point testing the other children.\n\nMy son has NF1 and, as in half the cases, it was a spontaneous mutation. Nobody else in the family has it. In what country are you located? We are in Canada and when my son was diagnosed my wife and I got genetic tests for free.  We were quoted something like $3,000 for genetic tests and opted not to do them since they had some level of false positives, false negatives, and \"could not determines\".\n\n Neuro saw the symptoms and diagnosed. He thinks its a waste of time to test son, or mum and dad since they are not having more kids.   We would like to know whose family is carrying the gene. Half of the time it is random and not genetically passed down.  They will look for neurofibromas, cafe au lait spots, and freckling in srmpits and groin. If they do not have those it is probably random.  Yep, no one else in my family has it, just a random mutation for me. They never needed to test anyone else in my family because they had no symptoms.  It is good to get tested because NF is a genetic disease. You may have members of your family that carried the gene but did not display any traits or have the misfortune of the the gene mutating. However, the children could pass it on to their children and they run the risk of having children born with NF. Genetic testing is a must. I do not believe the statement that half the time it is just random is factual. I have seen very little evidence during my extensive research and study of Neurofibromatosis to suggest that it is random. It is a genetic mutation. Thus a genetic disease. Genes being passed down.   Take the children to their PCP and have that doctor do a small exam. It is likely that doctor would refer them to a Geneticist who may later refer them to a Neurologist. You could also see a dermatologist who would then refer you to one or both of the other specialist.  Many doctors are not familiar with NF and do not specialize in it so are not attune to all of the possibilities.  As parent we want to get this confirmed, genetically. We cannot understand the reluctance of the doctors, PCP and Neurologist to make the referral to genetic testing. It is frustrating and confusing.   Just do 23andme and opt in for genetic results.  The reluctance is probably because of your other child does not show symptoms and neither you or your wife show symptoms or plan on having more children there is no benefit to the test. It is *extremely* unlikely that you or your wife have it if you do not have any symptoms. It is a waste of money and medical resources. I have also heard you can obtain your raw data from one or more of these ancestry companies and then there is another company that you can send the raw data to and they will give you literally everything about your DNA. I would have to ask the person that told me about what the name of the company is.  Ah yea that is the company. Did not realize it was not completely comprehensive.  I was trying to locate NF1 from their results but not sure how that works. I did not see anything. Would NF1 show up on the 23andme report? So I was curious. Turns out there is A LOT they leave out. They do not include NF and they do not even include MTHFR variant which is a very common gene for people to have and seriously messes with ones ability to metabolize folic acid. I recently was tested by a doctor for it and am homozygous. That is really dumb. What exactly do you need testing for? I wouldnt trust those sites even if my life depended on it NF is an autosomal dominant disorder, which means that you can get the disease if you inherit an abnormal gene from a parent. The chance of you inheriting the disease increases if at least one parent is afflicted.", "Does anyone have any experience with sirolimus for pain relief?

My doctor is not ruling out a MEK inhibitor, but wants to try this first. No experience with sirolimus, I take hydrodone and tramadol for pain. If you are having extreme pain, you should have an MRI check. When I was having a extreme shooting pain in my right leg in 2014, it turned out the tumor in my right leg had turned cancerous and needed to be removed. Thankfully the doctor was able to infected cancerous tumors in my right leg and that pain stopped completely. Thanks.

Strange that tramadol knocks you out, I have to take it twice a day and it does not do anything to me other than helping with pain management along with my other pain med.

Had it from about November through July and do not want to go back on it.\n\nThank you. How much did they have you on? Maybe it was a lot more than me.  I think 20mg twice daily? But I could be wrong. It must effect everyone differently, mines 50mg twice daily.  Just found my old bottle - it was 50mg twice daily. Okay, same as me. It just must effect everyone differently. Years ago I was first put on Oxycoden and I was fine the first day, but the second and third day it would make me feel dizzy and sick to my stomach. I was then switched to hydrocodone and that worked and did not give me any negative side effects, it was only a couple years ago my doctor added tramidol. \n\nI will keep my fingers crossed your able to find something that works for you. One thing I have heard is that most medications work within families, so if you have a blood relative that is taking a certain pain medication there is a good chance it would work for you. My aunt read something about it a while back and when my cousin was in a motorcycle accident they gave him oxycoden and he was having the same negative side effects that I had, but when he took hydrocodone he did not have any of the negative side effects.", "Hey, a few questions I am a 20f diagnosed with nf1 at around 7.\n\nDoes anyone else have any trouble with making their drawings or anything similar symmetrical, particularly faces \n\nDoes anyone else have problems with their hearing?

I had a similar experience over here but with signs of dyspraxia.\nI was given an SEN statement (English 504) but my teachers were always puzzled as I was very bright I can not draw to save my life. The hearing in my right ear is muffled since the NF caved in my ear canal I was super into art growing up, but symmetry was always a weakness of mine.

There is also groups we split off into after the main portion. Like one is for parents of kids with NF and another for little kids. I go to the young adults one so I can ask personally if they have experienced things like this. \"Speaking like a person with a hearing loss\" usually just means that you use your articulators (muscles in your mouth) differently. It could be general muscle weakness, which I know does happen in some NF1 cases. Have you ever received speech therapy? And have you gotten your hearing checked? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, I do not have NF (my brother does, that is why I am on this subreddit) but I have always had problems with drawing things symmetrically. It could be for many reasons! Hand eye coordination is one of many issues with us (I have horrible handwriting), so maybe yes it is related? I had speech therapy when I was younger for several years but it did not do much Some people with Neurofibromatosis can have hearing loss or hearing problems, but it does not happen to everyone.

Which makes no sense because it is o Ly the one ear that is giving me trouble and I have no other symptoms and I have gotten allergy tested and all the results came back negative. I tell them this and they dismiss me and I leave the clinic in pain and discomfort. So I am relying more on my wife for this one... personally my allergies in the past couple years have gotten to the point where I feel like I have an ear infection but Claritin fixes that...\n\nSo acoustic neuroma can be diagnosed with an MRI.

I guess it depends on where you look for it, but I have seen stuff about it in news articles just by searching in google and even tv shows over the years. Where are these trials happening? All over is my understanding. My doctor in Chicago is looking to get me into one, they are been going on for a while and have a lot of success. I do not recall the name of the four drugs my doctor mentioned, but I know there is at least four different drugs they are trialing. I am sure if you speak with your Neurofibromatosis specialist they will be explain it. Also many updates can be found here as well\n Yeah. It sucks dude. Asthma, epilepsy and autism are more common than NF though, and the reason why people choose to represent those is because they are easy. For asthma, you show a kid with an inhaler and they rely on stereotypes for autism. And usually, they know somebody with the condition.\n\nIt does get mentioned on medical shows, but it is more of \"Ah. It is NF!\" and it is never a main character. I understand it, it sucks. NF can be scary and I imagine seizures are pretty scary. And I know some people with NF can have both NF and epilepsy. \n\nIf you want more representation start reaching out to writers and TV shows, and ask for it. Take to social media.\n\n But honestly, here, it sounds like you assume that having NF representation in TV would helped to teach your dad what you are going through. Sometimes people are asses and just believe what they want to believe.  But, if you want NF to be represented on TV, it is a crusade you will need to start yourself (with the help of others here) I assume OP means more than just being mentioned as a diagnosis for the patient of the week in medical shows. That is the only place where I have seen it besides \"medical oddity\" shows, which really are not that great for representation since they tend to go with the most extreme cases Was not talking about a medical show. What show has a character with NF? I have never seen it outside medical shows, but there is a character with NF in The Miseducation of Cameron Post. It is not a huge part of the story, but it comes up a couple of a times. Still, it really surprised me when I read it and it got me thinking about representation elsewhere, so I am curious about it, too. I never said a show had a character with NF. If I am not mistaken May in NF awareness month and the ribbons are green and/or blue", "How many tumors? I posted here once. I have one more question. For anyone who did not see my previous post, I am 14, and I was a mutation (this is what the doctors think, I have not been officially diagnosed but my docfors are almost certain I have it). On average, how many tumors is someone with NF1 likely to get? I have heard some people get around 5 and others get over 100 based on a poll that was posted on this sr. I have had one, it was removed when I was 6. I hope I can only get one and have it removed then \ud83e\udd1e I have over 500. My entire body is covered, from the soles of my feet to my scalp, including inside my mouth, on my nipples, and inside my private areas.. Some are the size of sesame seeds, some are the size of tic-tacs, some are the size of grapes. I have had around 20 removed.\n\nThere is very clearly something wrong with me. Some people stare, some kids ask questions.  It sucks. But it is what it is. My life is still very fulfilling; I have a loving and supportive spouse, an incredible, amazing daughter and a few friends who love me for me. I have a public facing job in a customer service related field which can be tough at times. But I did not do anything to cause this - it is not my fault, I have no reason to be ashamed. Unfortunately there is no way of knowing, because everyone is effected differently, some people of a light to mild case of it, while other have a more severe case of it. These tumors can also grow back even if they have been removed. Mine is most likely a mutation as well.\n\nIf you have any question, let me know Ok, thank you! You are welcome I have at least 50 and I have 3 weird patches - which i dont know the name of my biggest ones are on my arms - specifically near the elbows. My biggest is about the size of a marble I am sure i have tons but none of them are visible and they do not hurt a whole lot. (esp when i smoke) If you are 14 and NF is mild for you, it is very likely it will stay that way, at least for me it did The cafe-au-lait spots are the only symptoms I think I have. I do not think that would matter when it comes down to how many tumors I would get but luckily I have none yet. Thank you, though. I will stay hopeful. Unfortunately it affects everyone differently. My daughter has 2 and shes 3 years old. The doctor at the NF1 clinic just gave us an average of \"a handful\" in her life time. I only had the CAL spots, and scoliosis until I was 15. My puberty got delayed due to medications, and they have just started to appear on the outside and more have grown inside since I started going through normal puberty at about 17-18. I have about 10 outside ones currently, a big one in my uterus/bladder. I have at least 4 that I can feel under my skin, one on my shoulder, one near my sciatic nerve (this one has been causing issues) one on my leg, and near the pelvic area. Most of my tumours are on my trunk. My labs said somewhere between 9 and 99... lol. I think it is close to 25 or 30, if I had to wager. Most of them are on my breasts, waist, and belly. They are not super noticeable to others, I have heard; most are subdermal and not pigmented, but there are a few more, purple-toned, more visible ones. And *those* ones hurt when I bump them... However, I do not think there is an \"average,\" per se, as every case is wildly different. I am 22 AFAB. Growing up the only identified tumor was a R optic glioma.   When I started growing through the middle/end of puberty I began getting cute boys tumors. I have had I have had 7 removed, one of them being a plexiform cluster. I currently have 3 more that are cutaneous/known about so far", "ENT Surgeon Reviews Medical Scenes of NF2 Patient from Chicago Med TV Show ", "We were expecting to just get a baseline for future testing, not a call wanting to see us first thing in the morning tomorrow for referral to a specialist.  Update: We have not gone to the neurosurgeon yet but the preliminary diagnosis is Hydrocephalus with pressure on the optic nerves causing malformation. They are expecting to install a brain shunt to relieve the spinal fluid buildup. It is the same as her mother, we just caught it in time to save her vision.", "I was recently diagnosed with NF type 1, what should I expect? What are your experiences? (+seizure brain surgery?) **Sorry this post is going to sound like word vomit**\n\nI am pretty sure I have had it my entire life because my cafe au lait spots have always been on me and growing (and new ones showing up). My parents saw a doctor when I was a few months old they told them it is nothing to worry about.\n\nFlash forward 23 years and one genetics test later, it is true and I ended up having it. Not to talk down to my parents, but they really do not care about doctors too much and brush a lot of health conditions off (same with my seizures, I had a seizure when I was a baby and they never saw a neurologist again - flash forward 17 years and I was having many focal impaired seizures a day since birth).  I plan on having brain surgery to stop my seizures because no medication has ever worked for me, and I am worried my diagnosis will make me have seizures forever. \n\nI am also seeing an eye doctor today for a \u201clazy eye\u201d that only appears when I am tired or under the influence of legal substances. \n\n\n\nI am sorry for asking this question and if it is rude, but will I be able to live a \u201cnormal seizure free life\u201d or is my NF diagnoses a \u201csorry you are stuck with seizures forever\u201d, so far the lab tech and neurologists have told me they are still going along with brain surgery but I have heard stories of other people with NF who had brain surgery and their seizures coming back. \n\n\nWhat has your life been like after your diagnosis of NF? To be honest, Each case is different. I have NF1 and thank god I dont have seizures. However, I ended  up having Scoliosis and tumor removed from my spine, which was pretty hard to experience.\n\nI guess the eyes issue is pretty common since I have it as well, I do checkups once a year.\n\nKeep a good attitude, dont feel bad about yourself. You got this!! You have nf from birth, I was diagnosed about 20 years ago now (I am 24) if you ever want to talk or have questions feel free to message me :)\n\nI have scoliosis and a few plexyforms, I have a large one on the back of my left spine, and a few on my back, now coming into my 20s I have a few fibromas on my arms and face, I also have learning difficulties and adhd. I am really sorry you experienced so much medical neglect as a child. Good on you for taking care of yourself now! \n\nNF1 is a genetic disorder so you have had it since conception. You could have inherited it from one of your parents or it could be caused by a random mutation, but you now have a 50% chance of passing it on to children of you choose to conceive naturally. You can do IVF with genetic testing to avoid passing it on though. \n\nI do not think the seizures necessarily have anything to do with NF1 unless they are caused by a tumor in your brain. NF1 typically stabilized after puberty. I am not sure if you are male or female, but it can also worsen during pregnancy and menopause for women. \n\nI personally was diagnosed at age 7 when I also had back surgery to correct severe scoliosis. I have fibromas on my skin in many places including a few on my face but none are big thankfully. NF1 impacted trying for a baby because it is not something my husband and I wanted to pass on, but we have an amazing and healthy 9 month old now through IVF. Neurofibromatosis can effect everyone differently. Some will have a little to mild case, while others will have a more severe case. I have been told by my doctor who is a specialist in Neurofibromatosis that I have one of the more severe cases.\n\nI am 37, and I have not have any seizures. I do have tumors all throughout my body, some of which that turned cancerous, those were surgically removed. I have some balance issues and some weakness in my arms and legs. \n\nIf you have any questions let me know 18 year old here. When I was first diagnosed at around 5, they found a few benign tumors in my brain. They wanted to immediately operate but they waited a bit and the tumors stayed stable. Since then, I have had MRIs every 3 months and recently has been changed to 6 months and now every year. The tumors are still stable and are even shrinking. They have mainly effected my nausea, which I remember when I was 9 trying many awful medicines which made me feel worse and I would be sick every day. But I managed to find one that worked for me and it was great, I no longer need it and my nausea is better but I still feel weird sometimes. So I would say that things will definitely change for the better, or at least I would hope! I do not have seizure but they are more common in Nf1 than in the normal population. The good new is they are usually  milder and surgery is the way to go. We are , apparently. good candidates for surgery. \n\nHere is an extract from the latest Nf1 book published last year: \n\n\u201cThere is a tenfold increase in the likelihood of seizures in NF1 compared with the general population. Seizure frequency varies from 4% to 13% depending on the study design and ascertainment of patients \\. All seizure types are encountered; however, the commonest is complex partial seizures, suggesting underlying cortical dysgenesis \\. This is supported by a pathological study in which abnormal cerebral architecture, subcortical heterotopia, and glial nodules were found in patients with NF1 and cognitive impairment \\. Onset of epilepsy is reported from infancy to late middle age and is usually mild compared with other neurocutaneous disorders. As seizures may be secondary to other recognised complications of NF1 including parenchymal glioma and aqueduct stenosis, individuals presenting with a first seizure should have MRI brain imaging even if they have had previous normal neuroimaging. Children with NF1 and epilepsy are generally more difficult to treat with a single anti-epileptic drug than children with epilepsy in the general population. Conversely adults with NF1 usually have very mild seizures \\. Individuals with NF1 and seizures may be good candidates for epilepsy surgery \\. In the largest series of 12 patients with NF1 undergoing epilepsy surgery, eight were seizure-free at 1-year follow-up, and another individual had decreased seizure burden \\.\u201d  \nExcerpt From: Gianluca Tadini. \u201cMultidisciplinary Approach to Neurofibromatosis Type 1.\u201d Apple Books. \n\nOf course now you need to find out why you are having them and if, as a previous poster said, there is a tumour somewhere, but to answer you question, there are good chances of you living seizure-free. \n\nBest wishes. Like everyone here said, NF can affect people differently. From minimal small neurofibromas (benign tumors) and cafe au lait spots to multiple disfiguring/ debilitating tumors, learning disabilities, and seizures. A majority of people will lead normal productive lives and may need occasional surgery to remove disfiguring or painful tumors. Some may require nothing at all. \n\nNF is progressive, meaning tumors can grow or your seizures might increase in frequency or duration. I do not know what type surgery you are having so the best person to ask that question to would be your neurologist. \n\nEven though NF is one of the most common genetic disorders, many doctors lack experience in managing  it. Assuming you are US based, many large health institutions have Neurofibromatosis clinics where specialists in that field treat patients. Most patient bounce between genetics, neurology, oncology, and dermatology. A genetic counselor would be a great place to start with referrals. \n\nThe Children\u2019s Tumor foundation is another great resource. It is a great place to find information, studies, specialists, and connecting with people and families with NF. Try your best to get your parents on board and support you (I know it is easier said than done, but it is important). Take them to a fundraiser. The Cupid Undie Run is a really fun time (more of a drink fest than anything). It is a great opportunity to connect and meet people with NF. \n\nGood luck with everything and reach out if you need something. NF1 does not \"typically stabilize after puberty.\" Sadly that is when the party begins. There is no way to predict progression. My doctor told me that however you are through puberty is basically how you will be going forward. I guess stabilizes was the wrong word. Your doctor is incorrect. There is no way to know. I was diagnosed with it when I was 6 weeks old and now I am 31-years-old. Every experience is different. I am both grateful and sorry to say that I never experienced seizures with my diagnosis. Everyone has varying degrees of it as other people have said. I tend to have a moderate case right now because I will be having surgery to debulk a lime-sized tumor from my cheek. Embrace the good days, it will be hard... I know this really well myself but you will have them. I hope your case is not too bad and that you get all the help you need. She did not say definite but your severity is unlikely to change after puberty. I went to an NF specialist found on ctf.org. I am not sure why your so sure. Are you a doctor? Depends. I have been diagnosed with NFI. around 10 y/o and never had a seizure. I have pretty bad scoliosis though (surgery when I was 12 y/o) and a lot of neurofibroms on the torso. IQ above 130 of European standard. I do know that each person is different. I do not get seizures. I used to have a fibroma on my optic nerve. Luckily it went away on its own! But if the fibroma would have gotten bigger, I could have gone blind. But right now, I have been dealing with extreme back pain. I might have to get surgery. Not for sure though. \n\nI have done a ton of research on NF1. I wanted to learn about it. I even did a research project on it in middle school. Not too many people do that much research on their diagnosis (I did not want to use disability, disease,or illness). When I am asked what my diagnoses are, I tell them each one and many people are surprised at how knowledgeable I am when I am asked to explain what NF is. I do have the occasional tinnitus (ringing in your ear(s)). I have glasses. I needed glasses starting when I was in eighth grade. Every single year, (except for a couple of years) I needed a new prescription. I also did not wear my glasses for a couple of years. I just got a new pair about a month a ago maybe. I can tell my eyesight got worse. (I did not like wearing glasses because I would get headaches, they were uncomfortable (due to my ASD. Like having the arms be behind my ears etc.) Luckily, this pair has not given me a headache. I do get frequent headaches. As people said, every case is different. There is no way of knowing what to expect as NF is progressive. You can speak with a neurosurgeon and explore your options. I have had a relatively mild case for my whole life. Just had 27 brain surgeries. Hopefully things work out for you. Hi. They found out I had NF1 when I was 8 years old. We went to doctors before but they told us nothing was wrong with me however my parents knew it was because my right eye was more down then my left eye. When I was 14 they thought I have to get an operation to my head/brains to get my eye up. This was a little shock because it came out of nowhere. However a few weeks later when we tlked with like 5 doctors they said we cannot do it because there is a swelling at the brain. So, I never had a surgery and I do not think I will if it is not a must. \n\nIt is really different for everyone and you can also talk with your family about it, how will it be and what will the consequences be. I hope this helps a little bit :)", "New Doctor in St Louis Hey everyone My name is Lauren and I am looking for a new Doctor in St Louis Missouri.

What is the best way to remove tumors for cosmetic reasons? 24 F. I have seen dermatologists and plastic surgeons. Trying to figure out what to do about how to remove small &gt; pea-size surface tumors from my sternum/breast area. The Plastic surgeon he could cut them out using plastic surgery techniques, but he still wouldnt recommend it because apparently, the sternum area does not scar well especially in Caucasian people.\n\nI went to see a dermatologist thinking I could get a co2 laser/laser or another less invasive procedure and he said that he would only cut them out as that was the best way to get all of the tumors and for it to not grow back. He seemed to think it would not scare that well.\n\nObviously, I am getting different advice but I just want something that has minimal risk of scarring. Honestly, I do not care if i have to pay every 5 years or so if it grows back while i am young.\n\nI think i may be predisposed to keloid scarring but I am not sure.\n\nIt is really frustrating because I am so self-conscious and because I live in a city where no one really knows about the condition so no one cares or can relate to it. I also feel like most male doctors I have seen dont really 'get' how important minimal scarring is to me, they just seem to think I want them removed and that is it- I guess DRs do not really understand how self-conscious women can be about scarring even if we have this condition? I always feel like they think that if they remove them for us they have done all they can? I dont know, should I just get them removed and then go through cosmetic scar treatment?\n\nAny suggestions? Sorry if this post comes across a little I am not sure what country you are in, but I would look for a plastic surgeon that knows nf. Do you have a neurologist that you can ask? Maybe they could give you a referral?\n\nYou can also see if any surgeons in your area do electrodesiccation, I hear that could work quite well. Look at some pictures online and see if the \"after\" pictures meet your expectations in terms of scarring.\n\nEdit: Also, sorry if I am prying, but I took a look at your post history. Again, I do not know your country, but see if a psychiatrist can give ketamine infusions. They are supposed to help for depression refractory to medication. I also hear that psilocybin is supposed to work wonders, but that is not an option in many places. Sorry again if you did not want this mentioned here, but I know nf can play a role in depression. Depends. I have dozens of skin tumors removed via laser, they did not grow again and the scar is next to non-existent. Some of them are on my breastbone. What I was told it that the lower on body scar is the poorer scaring is. I have surgically removed some on collar bone some 20 years ago and the scar is almost invisible. And I have others surgically removed to. And the amount of scaring massively depends on general personal ability to heal and how good is the surgeon good with stitching. It might be best to speak with a Neurofibromatosis specialist, generally given the difficulty of these tumors it is not always recommended to remove them unless it becomes necessary. I would also see if your doctor could get your approved for Koselugo, which is the medication that can shrink tumors. I have been on it since June and I feel like I am noting a some shrinkage of tumors. I have not had an mri yet to confirm, I am sure I will within the next couple of months. I live in Perth Western Australia surprisingly a lot of people do not really know about it at all I have seen plastic surgeons but none really specialise in neurofibromatosis, sure plastic surgeons know about it but they do not really specialise if you know what I mean. I have mentioned electrodesiccation to my doctor but he just looked at me like I had two heads when I asked if he could recommend anyone for it.\n\n\nThanks for your help mental illness wise but yeah do not think Australia is up on ketamine treatment for mental illness we are pretty conservative in that department, honest it is hard to even get cannabis for medical purposes at the moment.\n\nAlso dictating typing so if this reply comes out weird know why haha Sorry what do you mean when you say lower on the body? Top is the head, so from the head down to legs. So you are saying you will scar worse on your feet? I have never actually heard that before I was just thought it was down to genetics how bad you scarred. Interesting. I just repeat what I was told. It has to do something with how much blood vessels are in the area. Ah ok, yeah it seems so common that people know nf, but do not know know it. It is a shame that your physicians do not consult with others to gain a better perspective. I am in NYC and we are fortunate to have some specialists. If it is important to you and are able to afford it, you can consider coming to the US for the treatment...we even have therapeutic ketamine haha.\n\nSince our healthcare system kind of sucks and does not cover \"cosmetic\" procedures and most mental health treatment we have to pay out of pocket, which may benefit a \"medical tourist\" because the physician may work on a sliding scale. Your post is not arrogant. We have the right to have high expectations . I am in Australia, like you and even in Sydney, the level of ignorance around NF1 is shocking. And the dismissal about our condition so frustrating  . \n\nCTF Australia ( has sponsored a CO2 laser for the removal of neurofibromas. Some years ago, I was put on the waiting list but when my name came up after a couple of years, I declined because by then, my neurofibromas had gone down dramatically with diet and I told them to move down the list. \n\nYou could maybe try to have a Telehealth appointment with the NF1 clinic at Royal North Shore and be put on the waiting list as the last resort and hopefully our borders between states will not be closed and you can come to have treatment. \n\nThat is the last resort. You obviously something sooner and closer to home.  Call CTF and hopefully they can guide you towards someone, a service. \n\nPosh skin clinics offer electrodessication in Sydney, I do not know about Perth. \n\nCould you test   a couple of neurofibromas with different techniques and wait a couple of months to see the scaring? \n\nSome time ago, a paper came out suggesting a new surgical approach with minimal scar  \n\n( . \n\nA Mek inhibitor cream is currently the subject of a clinical trial with very good results, but it is still some years away. I am still mentioning it to say new treatments, in the form of pills, cream or surgeries are being studied. \n\nLast, I had a BCC removed from my face, a 5 cm long cut, and unless I point it to you , you cannot see the scar, so even highly vascular areas can heal properly. I had a fibroadenoma removed from the bony part of my chest, again minimal scar. \n\nThe surgeon told me , very fair people, like the Scandinavians, scar beautifully. The darker you are, the less optimal you will scar. I have olive skin, and I am still happy with my scars, so it is very individual. \n\nAnd once again, you are not arrogant because you ask for good options, cosmetically satisfying 5 cm is 1.97 inches &gt;Could you test   a couple of neurofibromas with different techniques and wait a couple of months to see the scaring?\n\nThis is what I have done, I had several removed from my chest/sternum one was a plexiform neurofibroma and required a fairly deep cut to get all of it, it left a fairly large scar but it has faded over time. The second was a cutaneous neurofibroma, this one the doctor basically shaved off (we did the same thing to one on my foot). The one on my chest was pretty small and left a little scar but is better than the bump. Both were removed because they were irritated by shoes and a bra. \n\nI have gotten mixed answers about the electrodesiccation and the CO2 laser working on me, so I have not investigated that too much. \n\nPM me if you want to chat some more. I think that makes sense actually, the deep graze on my knee never healed as well as the graze that was on my elbow. You want the tumors removed for psychological reasons not cosmetic.

My mom's cutaneous neurofibromas did not appear until she was mid 40s. I am now mid 40s and just now might have one on my eyelid (not checked yet, might be something else). My daughter is 19 and has not had any appear. Our symptoms are more the non-visible kind. Thanks for the response. I hope it is not rude too ask, but how bad did it get for your mum? Was she covered in spots, or just a few here and there? Mostly just clustered on her arms by her elbows- like on the top part of her arms if they are relaxed on a desk? They have not really gotten worse than that, that I know of. I guess I am not much older than you, but my case is also mild. One plexiform neuroma, and no other tumors. It grew slowly when I was a kid, was partially removed in my 20s, is pretty stable now. No one would argue: it still sucks (it is on my face). But I do not have pain or a lot of the medical complications other folks do.  I was told, basically, if you do not see growth in puberty or early 20s, you probably will not see it afterwards. I am 40 and have not seen an NF doctor in more than a decade. That is great to hear! I hope nothing comes up as we age.   \nI think I misspoke when I said that my bumps have been \"virtually unchanged\". I have grown a few since then, but very few and very small.   \n\n\nI have been hearing different things from different people: Some people say that their doctors say that most of the growths of nf1 will occur in puberty and a little after that, and whatever you have by then will more or less be it, save maybe a few minor ones here and there.  \n\n\nSome people get them at a steady pace yearly, and some have periods of inactivity then a \"blooming\" stage entering middle to advanced age.  \n\n\nIt is really this uncertainty that is hard to live with, TBH. But fingers crossed, we fall into the majority of NF1 sufferers that suffer only mildly in their lifetime. I have been worried about this as well. I have more several fibromas on my back and abdomen and I am worried about being absolutely covered in them. I am hoping the new FDA approved NF drug for plexiforms will lead to a drug for subcutaneous fibromas. I am a 44 year old female and notice more and more as the time goes by, but honestly they are really small and can only be seen in certain light.\n\nAs far as NF can go, I am certainly not upset with having the effects that I do.  My son is 15 and has lots of freckling everywhere but again, it could be a lot worse.\n\nIf it does get worse, I would probably look into removal and other options. Well, NF is a highly unpredictable condition, but from my understanding it is unlikely to progress too much once you have gone through puberty. At least this is what my doctors told me and I am now 27 and a part from caf\u00e9 au lait spots and two fibromas on my chest, I look \"normal\" on the outside.   \n\n\nHowever, my vision has become worse and worse over the years, but I am thankful that I am not blind and hope I will not lose my vision. I am 53 and have had a mild case all my life. Just a couple small here and there. No one would know. They have not gotten worse.", "Does having NF affect your height at 16?  There was a thread about this not too long ago. There were a couple of people there that were very small, but I think they were mostly female.  I am presuming you are male by your username. I was + 1m70 when I was 13. Now I am 1m80 at 40. If I had not that botched back surgery I would have been much taller. \n\nSo from my experience, no. It should not. I was just wondering because I am only 170 at 16. Oooof I am 168 at 24\nBut ofc I am guessing that is due to other genetic forces My dad is 6' and most off my cousin are 5'9'' 1 of my cousin he is 6 months younger than me if like 6'2'' I am 43 and I am 5 foot 9 1/2 inches\n\nI am from the states so we do not go by cm It is fine, I am from the UK, so we pretty much use both, This might be a good read for you\n I was 5' when I was 16.  I started growing more rapidly at 17/18 and then topped out at 5' 10\" when I was 19. I am 28 and Fem, and 4'10\" \nHaving NF has, and can sometimes make one shorter. My tumor took a lot of my growth hormones so I am short in stature. It is also a common trait with NF I am 23 and only 169. I am a 5'9 13 year old girls so in my case no Ey I am 16 as well and I am extremely short I guess 4 foot 8 lol", "pain. does anyone ever get random sharp pains throughout their body? wondering if it is just a random thing or if it is NF related and means tumors are growing :(  I do constantly. It I actually what brought me to my doctor were they finally confirmed I had NF (NF3/Schwannomatosis)\n\nI actually had to change careers because of it. I will get random shooting pains in my entire right side of my body which will cause me to pretty much lose my balance and fall. It sucks. I have even had occasions where if I start coughing ill somehow tweak one of the Schwannomas just right and send shooting pains throughout my body. Type I here, and I know I do now and then. The worst offenders are in my back, neck, and feet.  I do all the time! For years I thought it was normal until I mentioned it to someone and they looked at me like I was crazy.\n\nBut for what it is worth, I do not necessarily think it means tumors are growing. It could just mean existing tumors are \"acting up\". I get it all the time but I have a crap load of tumors which are the cause. I do get pain from my neurofibromatosis that comes and goes. It can be located in one spot or more. Lately it is been my right arm.\n\nDepending on the level of your pain can mean different things. I have my normal pain that is caused by the number of tumors pressing on my nerves. Then I have have cancerous tumors that cause very intense pain that was unbearable. \n\nIf you have a spot that is really been bothering you and not going away at all. Best to get an MRI of where you are having the pain. In 2014 my right leg was really bothering me more then it used to. I could not enjoy sitting watching a movie or going out to dinner. An MRI scan showed that it might be cancerous so I had surgery t remove the tumor and after it was removed they ran test on the tumor and it turned out to be cancerous. Me. I found out i have tumors on my nerves attached to my spine and lungs. I hurt every single day now. 4.5 years of constant pain. Waiting for surgery consultation.  aww i am sorry to hear that :( do you see a neurologist regularly? lately my body just hurts, i cannot explain it, but i am wondering if i should find one and schedule and MRI i have been getting them in my face and just randomly throughout my body. how do you manage the pain? lol i always wondered if people without NF experienced it or if it was just me lol. but i hope it does not mean more are growing. :( i just cry thinking about what my future holds. i sometimes pick the little bumps i feel growing on my back because i would rather see a scab than a bump.  i only had a full body MRI scan when i was 9. for half my live i thought everyone was like us, covered in spots and could get bumps. but i have been considering getting a neurologist and doing a full body scan since it is been so long  aww i am sorry to hear that :( i hope the surgery relieves your pain.  :(  I get full body scans at least once a year ever since I was 15. My doctor who is one of the top in neurofibromatosis is in Chicago I see him about 2 times a year.\n\nYeah, I would recommend getting full body scan seeing as these tumors can increase in size and number over time.  i need to but i am scared, literally my whole life i have hid from my NF, i felt like if i did not address it, it meant it was not there. i have opened up to a few friends about  it and the guy i am dating, but sometimes i feel like they do not know the extent of it and i am like scared to introduce him to my mom because then he can see what it can do to me :(  i have so much resentment towards my mom, like why was i born with this. i have reached out to a therapist and am going to start seeing her. i feel like it might help me cope with my issues.  I hate having it, but I know I cannot ignore it, especially now since one of my tumors turned out to be cancerous. \n\nI did not find out until I was 15. Doctors always believed I had it when I was born, but test results back then were inconclusive and since no one in my family seemed to have it there was always that chance I did not have it, but once puberty hit the on switch basically turned on. \n\nIt is not really your moms fault. There was a 50/50 shot. It is just bad luck. Me being born with it likely had to do with a distaint great or something grand parent on either of my parents sides having it and I ended up getting the short straw out of my siblings and cousins.  i know, i need to start dealing with it, it is like my whole life i have been told how it is not a big deal, but it is like....it is a big deal. hope everyday they find a cure for it...or at least a way to manage it. i just feel like it was selfish of my parents to have kids knowing there is a 50/50 chance. if i decide to have kids i am doing IVF or adopting so i know i would never pass this on. How did you find your neurologist? i live in a bigger city, so i am sure i might have one here that could be familiar with it. i have surgery scheduled on november 10th to get a tumor on my elbow, wrist, and left hip. i cannot wait.  My pediatrician told my parents there was a doctor in Chicago and in Grand Rapids. My parents first called Grand Rapids as that was closer, but after them hearing about my case and progression of what was going on, they said I need to go to Chicago and see the specialist there. And that where I have been going ever since.  I honestly, have not been in about 9 years. I really really should but I just cannot afford the deductible to go so I just manage. Best I can do is keep a log of pain and episodes and if it becomes unbearable I will go again. Suck but it is just how I have had to deal with It. Luckily the pain is nothing like it used to be though. I usually just try to bear with them until they pass if I dont have ibprophen or something similar :/ I try to look on the bright side by saying at least they are all on the inside and are not disfiguring :) i am hoping that is how mine stay, all on the inside. i see some growing on the outside but you can only see it in certain lighting  I had a fibroma on the back that had random shots for a short while, and has been quiet since. Then one on my shoulder that would not stop and was painful to even gently touch. Eventually got fed up with that fucker and had it removed. Yeah, I am the same way. And for a long time I was so freaked out that I think I held myself back from living life. But ultimately, we just have to find a way to live with the uncertainty, right? For me, that means planning for the future just like anyone else would, and when I feel pain or panic, I just do a lot of yoga and mindful breathing :) i need to start back into your and working out. i felt so much better about my body when i was  i notice a lot of my pain occurs after work, i stand on my feet for most of the day. wonder if there is any correlation  I have definitely experienced this a lot- I am 21 with NF1 and I have always noticed this. It seems to come in waves for me, sometimes I go a while with no pain, then it comes back for a while. My neurologist told me this is likely caused by the nerves around the bumps or plexiform being pinched,\n\n", "Aspergers/Autism I have NF1, struggled with pain most my life, suffered discrimination from employers and have gone through life facing discrimination and hardships. Lucky to have a good health service here. \nMy question, has anyone been diagnosed as autistic or having ASD later on in life. I am in my 30s and they think it is aspbergers as the tests would indicate this. I am awaiting a definitive diagnosis. I am hoping this will make life a little easier \\--This got kind of long and ramble-y so **TL;DR:** My daughter was diagnosed at 16, I was not but it makes a lot of sense. A lot of people now are being diagnosed later in life because Autism understanding as a diagnosis is still growing.--\n\nMy mother, myself, my daughter and my son all have NF1. My daughter was diagnosed with \"near\" autism a few years ago at 16. The  doctors who tested her said she had some markers but did not really qualify for a medical autism diagnosis but if we tried some other testing by another agency (which turned out to be a state run pediatric therapy program that has since gone defunct) she might qualify for a \"educational\" autism diagnosis. What all this hair splitting lingo boils down to is what aid she is able to apply for. The educational autism diagnosis helped her to get an IEP at school, and an alternative path to graduation. (which she should have been qualified for when she was diagnosed with ADHD at 9 but the school system does not always advocate the best for kids and I did not know any better at the time) She was also tested for social (pragmatic) communication disorder, which they said was \"borderline\" - not a very helpful diagnosis. She would probably be rejected for state aid in the form of social security or disability.\n\nI have since read up a bit on Autism, Asperger's is sort of a defunct term, though doctors may still refer to it as a lay term that non-medical people may relate to easier. It is no longer separated from Autism and is considered part of the Autism Spectrum. SCD is on the autism spectrum - ADHD is not.  I was never tested, but it makes a lot of sense for me - especially the SCD, and for some things I have seen in my mother. My son is showing some signs, and he may be tested again at some time in the future, but for now he is already on an IEP for things so there is no rush for a definite diagnosis. I have heard of a lot of people being diagnosed later in life, especially as Autism understanding, categorizing, and definitions continue to change and expand. When I was a kid, Autism was just the kind you saw in the movie Rainman, and even ADHD was just emerging as a diagnosis. Autism in girls took way longer to be recognized. I have done a screening exam called an AQ50 and scored highly. 41/50. Reading up about it now would explain the struggles I have had as I have had a seemingly ordinary life for some parts and the bits I have struggled with made me think for years I was somehow inadequate. I am hoping that they can help me through this as it would make life more bearable. I am from the UK so the lingo may be a little different. ASD is a recognised name as well as the formative 'aspergers' not as commonly used If you want to find support and therapy suggestions, be careful which advocacy groups you approach. Autism Speaks is widely considered among the Autism community a bad advocacy group for their focus on \"curing\" (which they seem to have dropped now), and catering to the voices of carers rather than the Autistic people themselves.  **Autistic Self Advocacy Network** is actually run by people on the spectrum. Thanks for the advice Diagnosis of autism amongst females is heavily underweighted. I got diagnosed with adhd at 29 and autism at 30.", "Has anyone in the US been able to claim social security benefits for them selves or for a child because of NF?  I am on ssdi since 2018. Finally have health insurance again. Just had surgery on Monday had a tumor size of a navel orange which is the size of a four month baby in the womb.  I wish i had been on ssdi along time ago maybe i would be getting more then 522 a month. I mean i was born with neurofibromatosis types 1 and 2. Yet only get 522 a month. Thank God for my boyfriend and my family. I also had to sign ul for food stamps because seriously 522 a month does not last unless i literally only spend what is needed but at least im more independent then before No, but I have friend got SS because of his toe. While I have multiple tumors throughout my nervous system and I can barely get help with health insurance. I hate it here. You can apply for benefits for your child under your own number. Your child is not eligible for social security benefits using his/her own number because he/she probably did not work enough quarters. That (adult) child could be eligible for SSI, a food supplement program and/or Medicaid.\nSocial Security benefits are different for retirees. Yes. I was denied of course the first 2-3 times I tired, but once I got a lawyer then I was approved. And then a few years after receiving SSI and Medicaid benefits, when my dad applied for retirement I was able to apply off of him as well to get a little extra income and also be placed on Medicare.", "Anyone with bone issues but otherwise mild case? My 2.5 year old son was recently diagnosed, and I am having a really hard time with it. He has a bowed tibia bone that we sort of caught by accident with an Xray, which led to his diagnosis and made sense of the other symptoms he has had along the way. (large head, low muscle tone, cafe au lait spots) I guess I am wondering if anyone has had bone issues like bowed long bones or scoliosis but not a severe situation in terms of tumors? I know they say NF1 is highly variable and you cannot predict it but I cannot help fearing that already having all these physical symptoms means he will have many tumors as he ages. \n\nFrom what we have learned a bowed tibia bone only happens to 10 percent of NF1 patients so it is not very common. However I think he could have gone a long time without us noticing as it is not obvious without an Xray. I keep reading of all these mild cases where people reached adulthood not even knowing they had a syndrome at all and cannot help but hoping he has a chance to be in this category. Any personal stories would be appreciated. Yes. I have scoliosis and kyphosis. And also deformed sternum bone, which is like poped-up. It looks like i put a small tenis ball under my shirt. Has your child been referred to an NF Physical Therapist MD? Thank you! He has had a physical therapist since six months when he was not sitting up. He has always been behind on gross motor but we did not know precisely why until now. He has since learned to sit up, crawl, walk - just a little later than most kids his age.\n\nHe was diagnosed with NF1 at a genetics consult last month and he has seen an ortho who prescribed him a leg brace to keep the tibia safe and an ophthalmologist who did not see any Lisch nodules or anything. We are close to Children\u2019s Hospital in Denver and advised to come see their NF clinic in about a year unless anything comes up like he has bumps or seems in pain, etc. Did you get a specific mutation called out in your genetics results? In the past year or so a few genotype - phenotype correlations have been discovered. We did not get a genetics test - they were able to clinically diagnose based on his bowed tibia and 10 or so cafe au lait spots. She also said he had the arm pit freckling but it looked to me like cafe au lait spots in his arm pit. \n\nWould the genetic test shed light on how severe his case will be? It was presented to us as not necessary since they can diagnose based on his symptom. It can... For example, microdeletions result in the most severe cases and are present in about 5% of cases. Other mutations guarantee no neurofibroma burden.\n\nCurrently there is only about 5 mutations out of hundreds for which they can predict symptoms, but there is always new correlations being drawn - there is also genetic therapy being studied... For example, nonsense suppression is being studied for NF1 but would only apply to those with nonsense mutations.\n\nYour doctors are correct in that it is not needed for diagnosis, but it is definitely useful knowledge to have and will only be more useful as more discoveries are made. You seem very well informed! That sounds worth looking into, but at this point I am too scared to risk getting more bad news. That would be devastating to learn he was set for a more severe case.\n\nWe have switched our diet to the Mediterranean and are giving him turmeric in case that does any good, which I really hope it does. I am having a really hard time with the sitting back and waiting and there is nothing you can do about it philosophy. I want to do any and everything I can. Yes, it is a struggle as a parent - I also tried to grasp at any ounce of control I might be able to exert over my son's situation.  You have to be careful trying home remedies though - the turmeric/diet study had an incredibly small sample size and was not clear on which turmeric supplement they used.\n\nAlso - you might want to look at this -  Yeah I think like twelve people right?Just grasping at straws here! But thanks for the info about turmeric. It was twelve people split into four groups... the Diet + Turmeric group had only 4 people in it. Also - if you have any other questions feel free to ask.  I believe I was the first person to post the Mediterranean study on Inspire - I am wondering if that is where you saw it.", "Subcutaneous tumors in breast and fallopian tubes I was researching how complicated a hysterectomy and top surgery (aka breast removal) would be with nerve tumors involved because I am trans (ftm). I tried to get an Essure procedure when I was 19 at planned parenthood and they said there were too many nodules blocking the entry to the fallopian tube. I assumed they were fibromas but I did not know that was rare for NF1, which I was diagnosed with at 12.  I also have multiple subcutaneous tumors in both breast and when looking into it, I am only really finding articles about breast cancer. I live in SoCal and have had a really hard time finding doctors that are informed on NF1 so if anyone knows any info about tumors in those locations or good questions to ask a new primary doctor I plan on talking with at the end of this month, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you! I am also in socal working on almost same issue  (ftm with lots of tumors on the chest looking into top surgery).  \n\nI will tell you what I find out as I do, and we may end up referred to the same person Awesome, I will update when I get more info too :) Hello! I am in the Midwest, but I am also in quite a similar situation. I have not really found anyone else, so this is a little exciting. I am NB AFAB, but am considering these procedures and HRT if compatible. Perhaps we can all network or help each other out.\n\n I understand that estrogen encourages fibroma growth, however I am also shut down when inquiring, as it goes. Even when. I do not out myself, inquiring about treatment is met with, \"well we do not know\" answers. So any hope for progress has fallen flat so far. At the very least, discouraging estrogen production may have a positive effect in reducing fibromas (and helping with gender stuffs!). Although, it was implied to me that any form of HRT has consequences with NF. However, it seems that 'inducing menopause' for lack of a better term also can cause an explosion of growths. It is so tricky to balance and I have not had any positive reactions when seeking help. It is so rare to have neurofibromas inside the reproductive organs and not on the external genitalia, you have to question if the nodules blocking the Fallopian tubes are actually neurofibromas and not any of the different kind of benign tumours that affect the Fallopian tubes such as hydatid cyst of Morgagni, leiomyoma, fibroma, teratoma, and mucosal polyp. \n\nToo often, doctors or even us , will be too quick and assume that whatever we have is  just  \"nf related\". \n\nStill, I had a look for you in my NF1 books and there is hardly any mention of reproductive organs involvement and only in the latest from last year do they mention the genitals but not the organs. Copied here for you. \n\n\\----------\n\n\u201c8.5 Urogenital Features of NF1\n\nPlexiform and diffuse neurofibromas involving the genitalia are unusual. Plexiforms involving the bladder and lower ureters have been reported somewhat more frequently, with the majority identified in males in early series \\. The function of the urinary and genital tracts may be affected by adjacent pelvic neurofibromas or involvement of the nerve plexus supplying them. Urogenital malignancy risk in NF1, aside from pelvic MPNST, is not known to be elevated.\n\n8.5.1 NF1 in the Genital Tract\n\n\u201c8.5.1 NF1 in the Genital Tract\n\nGenital hypertrophy is recorded in association with NF1, but this literature is largely limited to case reports \\. Precocious puberty (affecting up to one-third of those with optic pathway glioma \\, and much less common in other children with NF1) may accentuate this. The internal or external genitalia may also be affected by the presence of neurofibromatous tissue and localised overgrowth observed \\. Anecdotally, males with NF1 may be at a higher risk for cryptorchidism, as is the case for Noonan syndrome and other disorders of the Ras-MAPK pathway, but this is not a particularly rare phenomenon in boys in the general population and standard orchidopexy procedures are likely to be effective. Neurofibroma within the gonads appears extremely rare, with individual reports only \\. Extensive plexiform neurofibroma involving multiple pelvic organs is a rare presentation that can be particularly challenging to manage.\u201d\u201cPhysiological aspects of fertility are not usually affected in individuals with NF1 unless pituitary or other endocrine problems are present. Sexual dysfunction may be prevalent for many, frequently interlinked, reasons including body image \\, other psychological factors and concurrent physical or mental health issues.\u201d\n\nExcerpt From: Gianluca Tadini. \u201cMultidisciplinary Approach to Neurofibromatosis Type 1.\u201d Apple Books. \n\n\\-------- \n\nI would go back and ask to identify the nodules. Once you know what they are you can make a plan. \n\nNeurofibromas on the breast area and in the breast are quite common and they are only a cause of concern when they interfere with the mammogram imaging making it harder to identify a cancer amongst a lot of neurofibromas, reason why we should get breast MRI as an ideal imaging for routine breast cancer screening. Other than that, I do not think they will cause you any trouble when you have your surgery. \n\nConcerning lowering oestrogen levels, please consider and investigate increasing the amount of fibre from vegetables. High **fiber** intake  leads to reduced estrogen absorption in the colon and increased fecal estrogen excretion ( 30 , 31 ). This may be why studies have shown that higher **fiber** diets are associated with lower **estrogen levels** and reduced breast cancer risk ( 31 ). \n\n ( Thank you so much for all of your info and all the time you took to compile all of that! That is super helpful and  I feel much more prepared to talk to my new primary doctor. Thank you again! You may want to check out Dr Andre Panossian. He is a board certified plastic surgeon in Southern California (Pasadena). He has worked with all three types of NF, and if you go to his site, he also has a list of published articles/case studies that he has been a part of. He will most likely have your answer, or be able to direct you to someone who does. I will, thank you! I am not sure the \"explosion\" of neurofibromas we experience at menopause is linked to the menopause or is it maybe  the \"age\" at which menopause occurs, because men experience the same acceleration without going through menopause (and no , you cannot compare andropause with menopause). \n\nIt appears it is more linked to ageing, cells turning senescent, accumulation of DNA damage, less efficient sirtuins and a lot more. Ageing is still mysterious. All the age-related disorders in all the different organs seem to occur roughly at the same time  in the 50-60 years range and this includes Nf1. \n\nI recently started taking ketotifen because I have reached that bracket and I have a preventative approach to my nf1.  I throw everything  - including the kitchen sink (in which I wash my many veggies) - at Nf1. \n\nTalk to your physician about ketotifen. It is cheap as chips ($15 roughly for a month supply) , super safe and Dr Kaleb Yohay from the Comprehensive NF Center at NYU Langone talks about it in his NF Network video ( (jump to 1h14 min) . \n\nIt is important to stress the point that it is not a reversal drug, but should prevent the formation (I hope so at least!!) of cutaneous neurofibromas by inhibiting mast cells and that combined with the diet from the Italian study I talk about here (   it could help. \n\nTime will tell. I also have tumors in my reproductive system, it makes care extremely hard. It is definitely rare for them to be there. I hope you find some information and a good doctor. Do you have problems with UTIs because of them? I have been told by drs that it is unrelated but I am very hygienic and have done everything they have recommended. I have only ever had one uti and it was before the tumor was found. I am a germaphobe so I stay pretty hygienic. My mom has NF1, (no tumors in the reproductive system though) and she has had multiple utis/bladder/kidney infections. I also used to live in Southern California and had extreme difficulty finding care or really anyone who knew what NF was. I am in Portland now and it is still pretty bad. I am having issues getting a hysterectomy because of my age. Okay, good to know, thanks! Yeah, it seems only very specific areas have either great NF programs or no one knows what it is (no in between). If you were still in SoCal, I would recommend Planned parenthood but I am not sure they have that in Portland", "Anyone in Washington state? Anybody here in WA state? Preferably western Washington. Just curious - I have never met personally anyone else with NF1 in my life (besides maybe seeing one person with it at a restaurant years ago) I am not sure if you are familiar with the Inspire community ( but they have an Nf1 community and if you go on the search function for friends and put \"Washington\" as state , this list comes up\n\n( \n\nYou could also start a discussion and suggest meeting with someones.  \n\nHopefully some reddit members will also come forward.

Looking for a doctor to remove a few small neurofibromas.", "How old were you when you started developing tumors? Hello everyone,\n\nI am 18 and I inherited NF1 from my father. So far it is given me no issues and I only have multiple cafe au lait birthmarks. Besides the birthmarks that I am a bit shy about and cover up with clothing, I do not think about it, but occasionally I do think about it and I get anxious wondering if it will get worse. My father has many tumors over his body, but I have not noticed any on me. Can anyone share with me when they started to develop tumors or other symptoms of NF and how NF has affected their lives as they got older? Is my \"luck\" with few symptoms early on a good sign that it will stay that way or is there no telling what could happen?  I had my first two plexiforms before I can even remember!\n\n I was around nine, they were little, but I was not fully diagnosed until age 15 as puberty turned on the in switch. Before then when they tested me result were enconclusive. Now over the last 20 years since I was diagnosed I have had four surgeries from 2001-2018. The last two in 2014 and 2018 were to remove tumors that had turned cancerous. And tumors I had removed in either late 2006 or early 2007 have begun to grow back on my cervical spine, we are keeping an eye on that right now.\n\nIf you have any questions let me know  I am just like you, 18 with only Cafe Au Lait marks. My mom says I just have a minor form of it, and it is unlikely I will develop any major tumors. I do get tiny bumps on my legs, and stuff on my face that can just be acne. If we have luck, that is all that will happen.  I was born with two brain tumors and have small fibromas on my body, mostly located on my arms and trunk. I am a 22F  My mom was in her late 40s before any visible fibromas formed, she has clusters on her arms, but that is about it. My daughter (18) and I (43) have not developed any yet, though I suspect deeper tumors. I cannot really remember but looking at old pictures I guess around 6. Got a lost worst once in the last few years  Hello, my name is Racine and I have NF1 and had developed my first tumor younger than the age of 1 but was able to remove it when I turned 2. Then at the age of 16 found out I had more tumors one in the thorastic spine and a plexiform tumor in my lumbar area.. I am now 23 almost 24 let me tell you...... it is not easy :( \nI ended up getting pregnant and my tumors blew up everywhere around my body I have about 10 different hot spots in my pelvic/spine area (internal)  with plexiform tumors and just a week ago I found out they are inoperable and there is not much more they can do.. \nbuuut everyone who has NF do not get all the same symptoms some are very mild but for me as I am getting older it is getting harder. Good luck to you and your father  I was finding a few lumps here and there before I was 10 but it was not until I was in my mid to late teens that they really started coming in. Fortunately im now in my mid 20s and they are still only quite small. Most of them are about pea sized. Do they hurt? The internal ones, I mean. My twins have it, but only one seems to have one. It is like a miniature extra rib. It does not bother him now but he is only 5.  I seem to only have quite a few or maybe none at all,fortunately. I am 17M. All I really have is the spots and what seems to be a few subcutaneous firm movable bumps on my arms and legs and fingers and a few near the tailbone, they are not even visible but can be felt. I am not sure if these are neurofibromas though. But otherwise I am fine, which is really good. I got my first neurofibroma on my wrist when I was 11 (it is now on my lower forearm due to my arms growing with puberty). Next one was on my upper breast at about 13. Then another on the back of my thigh at around 17.  Yes they do. It is very painful. A sharp stabbing pain that makes you jump I am on the same situation. But i also have lisch nodules in my eyes. 22 I want to say seven or eight, but I could be mistaken. I would say I was 3 almost 4 when I developed 2 very large plexiforms. One on my neck and chin and another on the back of my head. They grew really big so at the time doctors refused to remove them because they assumed they would grow back pretty quickly. I had them removed when I was 21 and 22. \n\nYou cant tell I ever had one on the back of head but the plexiform on my neck completely messed up the skin and there is some of it left. I also had a very large one removed from c3 to c6 two times when I was 20 and 21. A few other smaller tumlrs removed last year right before my 31st birthday.", "bumps under skin i am 27 and was diagnosed with NF when i was a baby, usually it does not bother me but lately ive been getting so depressed thinking about what i could look like 20 years from now and who would ever want to marry someone like that. i also decided i do not want kids because i know hormonal changes can make NF worse, i also would never want my children to have this awful disease. luckily i do not have my cal spots and the ones that have bothered me i covered with tattoos. \n\ni also keep seeing all these bumps that look like their below the surface but you can only see them in certain lighting. will those eventually surface on top of my skin or will they stay where they are?

Thumbs up from me. **Radiofrequency ablation**\n\nRadiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a medical procedure in which part of the electrical conduction system of the heart, tumor or other dysfunctional tissue is ablated using the heat generated from medium frequency alternating current (in the range of 350\u2013500 kHz). RFA is generally conducted in the outpatient setting, using either local anesthetics or conscious sedation anesthesia. When it is delivered via catheter, it is called radiofrequency catheter ablation.\n\nTwo important advantages of radio frequency current (over previously used low frequency AC or pulses of DC) are that it does not directly stimulate nerves or heart muscle and therefore can often be used without the need for general anesthetic, and that it is very specific for treating the desired tissue without significant collateral damage.\n\n***\n\n^( ^| ( ^| ( ^| ( ^| (   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.24 I will reply to you as well for your visibility since I am so slow, but consider ( if you have some facial fibromas that are bothering you. **Radiofrequency ablation**\n\nRadiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a medical procedure in which part of the electrical conduction system of the heart, tumor or other dysfunctional tissue is ablated using the heat generated from medium frequency alternating current (in the range of 350\u2013500 kHz).

If we are talking about tumors below the skin like mine, I guess it is a toss-up. Mine took a couple of minutes each tops with some careful aiming of the probe and feeling for if they were properly gone.\n\nAnyways, here is a paper on an RFA trial for NF patients:  Thanks, that is good to know. My guess is that by the time my son needs something like this there will be viable prescription drugs but I will be happy to share with those in the greater nf community!  I also have it. Im 24.

I still have those coffee spots and freckle spots near my hip area. \n\nSometimes I forget I have it, in fact through being 10-22 I forgot I had it. But now its really getting to me.

Thanks.I just wish more people have heard of it,  I do not even know much about it to be honest. I have not got any large bumps(yet)  just those small freckles and stupid big head.

Hopefully it will help.", "Recent NF1 Diagnosis: where can I inform myself? / what do I do now? Hello people, \n\nI was diagnosed NF1 a year ago after a genetic test (mastocytosis was suspected). Now of course it is not mastocytosis and some growths have already been found. \n\nNow I am supposedly a rather mild case, however since the diagnosis more and more lumps have formed (mostly on the head). Now one has also become inflamed, and it has to be removed, because it is causing a nice amount of pain. \n\nMy questions are directed more at those affected with a rather \"mild case\". According to my doctor, this statement cannot be made. According to him problems can suddenly intensify with increasing age.\n\nNow, of course, I am concerned about my life plan and I do not understand the world anymore. The helplessness towards this statement \"Either something happens, or it just does not\" makes me quite nervous. Social exclusion due to disfigurement, pain or the loss of my ability to move or see have now already been mentioned to me in the doctor's appointment. \n\nI do not know now whether and how I should react to it. I was 27 when I was diagnosed, I am now 29. Supposedly these cases are considered not to be a problem if I develop neurofibromas this late in life, but on the other hand no one here wants to give me a guarantee. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo the people with a similar, mild and late diagnosed course: (TLDR)\n\n\\- How do you deal with your situation?\n\n\\- What was the course of the disease like for you? Am I worrying too much? \n\n\\- Have you adjusted your life direction/planning after receiving the diagnosis? (Insurance, career, family planning?)\n\n  \nThanks in Advance\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for my English, deepL made some weird suggestions. You are the same person today that you were before your diagnosis. \nMy case is very mild. I am 44F and have lots of little bumps, spots, and possibly nf related comprehension issues but may just be your standard ADD. \nThat being said NF is very different case to case. And life is up to change in an instant with anyone. \nI would say find a good doctor. Find good support groups. And stay away from Dr Google. \nIf you need someone to talk to I will do my best with my advice from my own experiences as my son has a mild case too. You might want to look if your country has a NF(1) foundation or similar. They should be able to provide you with every-day information that specialists or doctors might not. I live my life without any worries and do not really worry about the future. I have had some issues in the past with surgeries but overall, I have a mild case. I do not get stressed out about my situation. It is ok to worry but I would not let NF take over your life, especially if you have a mild case. Life\u2019s too short for that.  \n\nI have not adjusted my life for anything. It is been a while since I worked but in just enjoying life as much as possible. I have a very active social life and never really stay in. It is a good thing to live to the fullest. Ctf.org is a huge resource ^^ This I have a very mild case, if I did not happen to have a daughter who had a very attentive nurse who noticed her birthmarks I still would not know I have it. Kids get monitored closely, as an adult you need to advocate for yourself and keep on on the research. As others said ctf.org is a great resource. Females over 30 should have annual mammograms. Other things depend on symptoms. I have migraines so I get an MRI every 3 years keep an eye on things. It is very much a hurry up and wait disorder, which sucks. Do your best to not let it consume you, take it one day at a time. I am going through the same thing as you. I (26F) was recently diagnosed with mosaic nf1. It truly caused me to have a major depressive episode worrying about my future as well as body dysmorphia with some of the tiny bumps that I have. Fortunately, I sought out professional help by seeing a therapist and started taking antidepressants. That has helped immensely, in addition to talking to my supports about what was going on. I also told my doctors of my concerns, and I recently had electrodesiccation to remove most of the bumps on my body. While I might continue to get more, I can always go again. Right now, I have hope knowing that there are ways to treat the bumps, and the advancements with the MEK inhibitors will only continue as I age. 20yo, I got nf1 but kind of hard, my doctor said I had more than 100 fibrome only in me right leg. People do not seems to notice for what I know or they just care. More NF1 is developing less I want a kid. Insurance I am to young for that shit. Career Imma take the normal part.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nsorry for English to I was diagnosed at age 18 a few years ago, also via a genetic test. So far the only NF-related symptoms I have is high blood pressure, cafe-au-lait spots, freckling and scoliosis (I do not know to what degree). I also have some symptoms like muscle weakness and symptoms similar to ADHS but I have never been diagnosed with that one.\n\nI was not diagnosed by my family doctor but in a endocrinologist center. They told me to get a head MRI (which I had recently gotten, and it was fine, so I did not need a new one) and an MRI of my torso (which I unfortunately messed up to mention to the neurologist that I was also sent to, so I never got that one... and I am too ashamed to ask for one now). I was also sent to a neurological exam. That neurologist then told me that I very likely have a very mild case so I would not need any regular doctor visits, and can basically \"forget\" that I have NF. I should however go to the doctor if there were any strange, new symptoms. And if I ever wanted to have children I should also consult someone. But I have also heard that people with NF should go to the doctor once a year no matter what, so I do not know what is actually best now...\n\nI also went to a dermatologist later for another reason and when I brought up NF she came to talking about light sensitivity related to NF and that people with NF should also see an eye doctor (sorry, I do not know the professional term for that), but I have also neglected to do that one yet, so I unfortunately cannot tell you what to expect there. I would say the biggest hurdle is a psychological one.  You have to learn to accept that the course your NF takes is out of your control.  As someone else mentioned, this is true of anyone, but with NF you do get a window into possible futures that can be scary.  \nI think you have to focus on what you can control, and do your best to set the rest aside.  You can control having a good doc in an NF clinic.  You can control having annual checkups and any recommended imaging.  You can control how well informed you are.  You may also wish to participate in NF fundraising/awareness activities, which will also help you feel in control.   \nI recently saw a quote that says \u201cFear is a liar\u201d\nSometimes fear is necessary, but in situations like this, fear is indeed telling you lies about your future.  All the things your fear imagines will not come true.  Do not let yourself be a victim of imagined scenarios, instead simply be present in the truth of what actually is now. Hey there,\nI was diagnosed as an infant because it runs in my family. However, I have been fortunate enough to have a \u201cmild\u201d case as well. \n\nThe not knowing how bad it can get or if it will ever get bad in all honesty gives me so much anxiety, I am not going to lie. But like others said, I try to focus on the things I can control. I also struggle with a little bit of body dysmorphia. Most of my bumps are on my torso, so come summer time I get a little self conscious when I try to wear crop tops or bathing suits. \n\nMy husband and I have talked about our options for family planning, and right now we think we will still try to the natural way to have a family. However, that being said, it does worry me to that pregnancy will just cause the the bumps to grow like crazy. Career wise, I do not let NF affect my goals. Insurance has not been an issue for me, either.", "What specialist should I take my baby to, to look at his spots? Do we start with dermatology? Or go straight to a neurologist? I would say neurologist - so you can go straight to planning their first brain scan if the diagnosis is correct. Good luck! neurologist for sure.\n\nthe spots are a minimal issue..the tumors are what you need to keep an eye on. They will not think its weird that someone comes in with only skin signs? You might need referrals from the primary pediatrician first. \n\nThe pediatrian can also provide the other doctors with the initial medical records.\n\nSince NF1 requires specialists, you might have to wait months to get appointments.\n\nFor us, the genetics and neurology appointments were easier to get but the pediatric optometrist and dermatologists had months long wait.

I only remember going into the operating room and being woken up. So happy it went well! I had several removed a couple months ago. Still a little tender in some places but otherwise very glad it is done.  Thanks! Mine was internally in my neck.  Mine were not too sensitively located, just had seven all over. Could not do much moving around for a couple weeks.  Glad to hear yours were removed successfully. Did you have external ones or internal ones? This was my first big one having removed. Mostly just beneath the skin, some a bit deeper. But none near organs or brain/spine. I am fortunate. It was primarily ones in my thigh and beneath the ribs I kind of felt all the time, so constant pricking and emotional stress was enough to finally get them out.  I have one other in my ear and one in my skull somewhere but those are the only other two I know about. The one in my neck just appeared one day in April and I started feeling it. Such a weird thing.  Hooray for tumor removal.  I have had one schwannoma removed from just above my clavicle on the brachial plexus.  Surgery went well and recovery was pretty easy overall.

My family had been told that once we likely did not have it, especially once we passed a certain age.  This is where the lack of information can be really harmful.  I had been experiencing pain in that region, and referred pain to my shoulder and arm for years, but just chalked it up to playing a contact sport and lots of impacts.  (I used to play roller derby.)  Then, my sister was diagnosed with a schwannoma on her sciatic nerve, and I realized that the troublesome spot just above my clavicle was probably a schwannoma.  I got an MRI, and confirmed that was likely the case.  It is been frustrating, because even with the diagnosis, my medical team had been reluctant to give me the actual diagnosis of schwannomatosis, and wanted to treat this as a one off, even though both my sister and I each had at least one.  We finally did genetic testing, and confirmed the diagnosis, but only after I had another MRI and confirmed more tumors in my spine.  Whew, sorry.  That did not really answer your question.  No, I do not remember finding it, I just thought it was a particularly stubborn muscle knot.

Although I have noticed in the past year significantly more fibromas and neurofibromas. I am curious to others experiences and if this slowed down for you etc? I have mostly been lucky my entire life with having a mind case as there was a family friend in my town that had a very severe case and people always told me I would end up the same way which scared me as I know he is had a very hard life despite being the most generous man alive. Just looking for others advice or experiences or if there is anyway to tell how severe it may get?\n\nMany thanks My NF (and my sons) is both pretty mild. I was not diagnosed till I was 21 and that was by a dermatologist. I had started to get lots of \u2018funny bumps\u2019 on my breast and trunk area during my first pregnancy. I remember having a good amount of the cafe au lait  and axillary freckles but I grew up in the 80's and nothing was ever mentioned about it from my family Dr. I just always assumed I was born with quite a few birthmarks. My childhood and adulthood have been mostly unremarkable and have had no real problems or complications with NF. Although, I did just have a 7X9cm fibroma cut off my spine so I highly recommend regular MRI's to make sure everything is ok on the inside. Mine was found by accident and I was asymptomatic. I am 36 and I have been unchanged for years. I got a few fibromas and that is all. My mom is more covered on her arms and torso and bone on her legs. NF can vary from each person and unfortunately no one knows how bad it will get. Mine unfortunately did not slow, it continue to get worse. I was diagnosed when I was 15, I am 36 now. Tumors for me have continued to grow in size and number, some that I had removed 10 plus years ago have grown back and in 2014 and 2018 I had tumors turn cancerous. My specialist who actually diagnosed me says I am on the more severe side. This condition effects everyone differently it seems, so everyone can be all over the place. There really is no way to know how bad it can get for someone unfortunately. Hello. My parents were also told that I have NF at birth. I am the only one in my family with NF.

Google (the most reliable of sources) says if you are not diagnosed by 10 then you probably do not have NF, I was diagnosed when I was 17 after having issues at marching band, after talking to my Dr. she recommended further testing. After various tests I got the diagnosis. When and how were you diagnosed? No idea when it was \"officially\" but apparently I showed signs of something being wrong at birth. I got my son tested when he was around 1. He had no symptoms, just the CALs, but I went to medschool and I vaguely remembered something about the disease. He is still perfectly fine, he just has a genetic testing saying he has a point mutation on NF1, so we keep a closer eye on him. I was around 16.  :-) I was diagnosed at the age of 3. Now, this was the late 70's and information on NF was not known. My parents drove me all around Southern California and finally found a doctor who knew about it.  I was 15, though doctors always believed I had it, but results were always inconclusive I was diagnosed like at 2 (officially). Since my paternal grandma, and my father have it, it was just waiting around to see the physical signs. Nine months was when my parents found out about me. I think it is still fairly uncommon and unless your dr is aware of it, you may go years without knowing. It just so happened the dr who realized I had it had other patents with it and even my eye dr had done a case study on it (of all things) when he was in medical school. 1, when I had a neurofibroma removed from my foot.

Diagnosed in December at 38. I have had rather large fibronueroma on my thigh that I had been getting tests on, but between moving and then covid it was slow. I had a renal infarction(probably due to the lump,  according to a nephrologist) that slowly led to piecemealing all the symptoms together until I took the test. Pretty much at birth.

I was 7 when my mom read a tiny blurb about it in a parenting magazine and diagnosed me herself. Took me to a doctor to get formally diagnosed. I was diagnosed at 17. My son was diagnosed at birth. I was in my mid teens, had a family history but not my direct parents, and no serious symptoms showed up until my leg stopped working I got diagnosed very very young. Like 1 or 2 My family has a history, so I was able to be diagnosed before I was even born I had my first surgery in 4th grade, so at some point when I was very young. It runs in my family... my brother has it, my nieces do, my mother did. I was diagnosed when I was 6 weeks old. My mom noticed three little cafe of latte spots on my leg and since she was a brand-new mamma, she decided to ask the doctor about it. They said they could not officially diagnose me until I was three but my dad said he knew the whole time that I actually had it. I think I was 2 when I got diagnosed and it was in 2006 I was diagnosed around age 2. We had to send my scans to someone in a different state then me and they told us a doctor in my state and then I got diagnosed. 8 yrs old I was 21 and having a routine mri of my heart for a completely unrelated medical condition when technicians spotted abnormalities of my spinal cord. \n\nLots of tests later they said I had nf2 but they have never actually found the gene that caused me to have it. So I have all the physical signs of NF but nothing in my dna to suggest I have it. \n\nNow I am 27 and the doctors are still looking for the spelling mistake in my dna. Wow. This disease is so rare yet so complicated. I was diagnosed aged 12, I think", "brain tumors NF2 Just wondering if anyone is out here with NF2.... I am 22 and I have two brain tumors that need surgery. Just looking for someone who might understand to talk about it I guess I have NF2. I had brain surgery last year to extract most of my left side acoustic neuroma near the brain stem. It went really well and I fully recovered. I had some temporary facial weakness at first following the procedure, but everything went back to normal after a month or so maybe even less.\n\nI am preparing to have surgery to remove all or part of the neuroma on the right side in about a month. I know a bit of what to expect now so I am feeling optimistic, but still a little skeptical since it is still brain surgery of course.\n\nI can try to answer any questions you might have. Hey, thanks for your response. Your situation seems to mirror mine a bit. My left side tumor is against my brain stem and my right side is much smaller. \n\nHow long did it take you to recover from your surgery? When were you able to return to work? Did you need anyone else to help you during your recovery? \n\nWhere did you receive treatment? Were they fancy specialist doctors or regular specialist doctors?\n\nIs your left side hearing gone? Do the doctors expect your right side to lose hearing after surgery?\n\nThe otologist who diagnosed me said he might recommend removing the small tumor first to try to preserve hearing in that ear, and have a second surgery remove the medium/large tumor. Did your doctors mention anything like this? Should I be trying to preserve hearing or am I just being wishful? \n\nThanks again. I have been reading about side effects and complications of acoustic neroma surgery. It looks like so many things could/will happen. It is really scary. It is scary especially when we are at this stage in our adult lives. I am 25 but I will be 26 next month. My tumors are/were similar in size at least for a while while they remained stable/unchanging. My right side tumor has recently grown too much in 6 months to put off so it will have to come out to protect the brain stem, much like the tumor on the left.\n\nIt took me about 1.5 months to recover last year. My doctor said at least a month would be needed. I was able to return to work after fully recovering for 1.5 months. During recovery, I needed to be careful about moving around mostly due to balance issues. Granted, my ability to balance felt the same before surgery because it had already declined so much over time due to the tumors. My parents and my fianc\u00e9 were the ones who primarily helped me out. They took me to all of my post-op appointments and physical therapy as well.\n\nI am in the US. I recieved treatment in Dallas, TX at UT Southwestern. My specialists are very experienced in this type of condition. My ENT/Neurotologist is one of a few in the state who implants ABIs. He implanted the one last year and I will be receiving one for the other ear in the upcoming surgery with the same surgeons. I also see a neuro-oncologist from time to time who specializes in the condition.\n\nSo I have been deaf for two years now. This happened before brain surgery though so preserving hearing was not a priority, which may have been for the better. I understood a long time ago that these surgeries would ultimately result in total hearing loss on the operative side, however, due to inevitable damage to the auditory nerve in order to reach the tumor. Not as much care had to be taken to avoid damaging the auditory nerve in my case. My ability to balance was already shot so that was not a concern either. That left the focus on preserving facial nerve function, avoiding damage to other cranial nerves like the trigeminal nerve, etc.\n\nMy doctors have always preferred watching and waiting. Monitoring with MRI scans every 6 months or more frequent depending on the severity of the condition. Once things start to look threatening in the scans, that is when we act.  I had the brain tumors for a long time before they got big enough to worry about having them removed. Before I was deaf, I was on Avastin chemotherapy to try and preserve my hearing by keeping the tumors stable, but that stopped when my ability to hear significantly declined. I had undergone that treatment for 6 years at that point.\n\nSince these tumors are benign, and less aggressive than malignant tumors, it might be best to put the smaller tumor you have on hold for the time being in order to keep hearing in that ear if it has not already declined. I am by no means a doctor so big grain of salt, but maybe you could talk to your doctor about that approach just to see what they think since they are far more equipped to handle this situation. You could even PM me for details about specialists if you would prefer a second opinion.\n\nSorry that this is so long. I wanted to be sure that I answered your questions. Feel free to send more questions my way if you have them. I will answer them the best I can. u/catsandrappers091 Kutz and Kleese?  Twinsie!  \n\nHow did you react to Avastin?  I am about to begin treatment with Avastin next week, and I really do not know what to expect.\n\nAlso, have you used a cochlear implant before?  If you have, how does it compare to ABI?  I have Cochlear Nucleus 7 installed a few months ago, but it is quite likely that I might need surgery in the next two years and might have to get an ABI installed. Small world!\n\nI was on Avastin for about 6 years up until almost 3 years ago. I had some breakthrough bleeding issues that were treated with estrogen but it was not terrible. I did get swollen ankles and high blood pressure, hence the swollen ankles. Avastin also affects the kidneys so protein uptake was decreased and it would show up in the urine a lot. Unlike other chemotherapies, I did not get really sick or lose my hair. Sometimes, I would go through treatment and then run errands after finishing up.\n\nI currently have a cochlear implant but it has not worked for me. In a month I will have my second acoustic neuroma surgery to remove part of the tumor and swap out the cochlear implant with a second ABI. I already have one ABI on the opposite side of my brain that was implanted about a year ago, and I have benefited from it moreso compared to the CI, but I still have a way to go in terms of improvement I think. Soon I will have bilateral ABIs so I am looking forward to that to see if it would help me more than with just one implant.\n\nSorry for the late reply! If there are any other questions, I will do my best to answer them.", "I want to gain more muscle So, I know it is harder for us to gain weight or muscle due too NF1. Which I am one of those people..

I have NF1 diagnosed couple months old. I have chronic back pain, and was diagnosed with Dural ectasia, as well as tibial dsyplasia from a young age, other than being drugged up, my Dr has not really got any other options for treatment. Anyone else have this NF related manifestation? \n\nThanks guys \ud83d\ude01 I have dural ecstasia as well and unfortunately there is not really anything they can do for it at this point. I do not think it is super well researched in general yet for treatments (it is only found in a couple of disorders: (NF, Marfans, Ehlers-Danlos, and ankylosing spodylitis). Can also occasionally occur in trauma such as a car crash. As of now drugs are the only treatment for dural ectasia (and the pain it causes). There is not any treatment or surgery for it. Thank-you for your reply\ud83d\ude0a You are welcome. I know it sucks, but I have talked to my doctor a lot about it too (he is one of the most knowledgeable in NF) and it is basically what he says. Another expert suggested acupuncture for pain but I have not tried that yet and that is obviously not permanent or readily accessible.

Hi All, \n\nI am working on producing a number of podcast episodes re: Social topics surrounding NF (Ex: explaining visual symptoms to peers, dating with NF, coping with uncertainty of a diagnosis, sleep issues etc.) as part of a hackathon project I am working on. The plan is to produce 30min episodes in which 2-3 people can give their thoughts on the same topic to hear different viewpoints. \n\nWould love to hear if there are any topics you all are interested in diving into as well as anyone who would potentially want to get involved as a speaker. I would be happy to share more about the project in general if anyone is interested as well :) I do not have many ideas but I would love to listen! This is a great idea. I would love to see this pair both patient/individual stories with medical professionals, to give a really broad perspective on what NF IS, and how it impacts people\u2019s lives. \n\nI am curious how this fits into a hackathon. Fantastic idea! \n\nIt would be great if in addition to sharing nf stories, you could have doctors and researchers as guest and talk about treatment but also prevention, which is an area totally forgotten. I would love to hear **recent** opinions from specialists about some of our manifestations and what can be done for them. Once a week or a fortnight or once a month, it would be nice to have an expert debate on: \n\nWhat should we do to avoid severe bone loss? \n\nCan a high polyphenols  anti -inflammatory diet help with the neurofibromas? \n\nHow should we  supplement with L-Carnitine to treat weakness ? \n\nShould everyone be tested for a hidden pheochromocytoma at the age of 40? \n\nWhere are we in the gene therapy? \n\nand many more, all based on the guidelines of several countries and/ or recent papers.  \n\nBased on what I see on the platform Inspire , the question about my child has 4/5/6/..... cafe au lait, do they have Nf1? might be a successful episode, because every week, and sometimes,  daily , there is a parent. \n\nLeaving the science/research and health aside, discussion topics, would be to have some episodes around **children**, how do you tell a child they have Nf, how to deal with all the medical appointment, how to help with school, ... and then humour as well, a \"what no to tell someone with Nf\"  . \n\nAnd please do not forget people with Nf2 and Schwannomatosis, they are already neglected by science and research.  \n\nPlease do share your project , from the hackathon to the podcast and everything in-between!  There is a Facebook group called faces of nf, I love the idea to hear the voices of Nf! yes sounds Fantastic. Perhaps some episodes on a review of clinical trials updates in research and pathophysiology etc.  perhaps identifying issues in learning that may of been ignored in childhood? That is a really great idea - we have been considering one on selumetinib but we could probably expand into a wider number of clinical trials. Will add these to the list! Will make sure to post the first eps as they are produced. As for hackathon, it is run by the CTF and one of the tracks is focused on NF. We are building a website to house the sites and they never specified the type of solution so we are within the constraints :) These are such great ideas - will add them onto the list and planning to get an NF focused clinician to speak on the more medical topics. Definitely good to include NF2 and Schwannomatosis as well. We will be sure to post + send you the initial episodes as they are produced :) Will definitely share on this page when the first few eps are out! I will be looking forward to! \n\nHere are a couple of names you could try to get on board for your clinical episodes: \n\n\\- Diet ; Prof. Melone from Napoli, Italy\n\n\\- L-Carnitine : ass. Prof Schindeler, Sydney, Australia, \n\nBecause they are doing something to help us **now**  and any of your listeners at the end of the episode can take the decision to try their recommendations and see if they help. \n\nOn the webinar page of the NF network, ( there are several names and topics. \n\nI have always found Dr. Kaleb Yohay very kind and empathic, and you could invite him to do a shorter version of his video (  and another important one is ( bt Dr Doug Stewart. \n\nBest of luck! That is a tremendous idea. Kudos to you and your team. Looking forward to hearing the results. Good luck! L Carnitine combined with MCT and a reduction in LCFA in NF1 and muscle soreness/weakness is an interesting one and one that is treated with dietary intervention. seems to be a really intriguing area.   Summers and \n\n(\n\n I love this idea! I would love to speak on the podcast but I am a minor and I am uncomfortable with putting myself out in public like that. It is an amazing idea though! Love this!  I think an episode geared toward parents with a newly diagnosed child would be really great.  Not just what to expect for the future, finding the right doctors, etc, but also how to handle the child\u2019s experience, how to explain it to them and so on especially for a child going through surgery, chemo, etc.   \n\nWe have just participated in a study on this topic.  I am pasting the initial email here in case you want to reach out to the researchers.  \n\nPasted:\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nDear Jacqueline,\n\nResearchers are looking for parents of a child/children who have been diagnosed with NF1 to participate in the study: \u201cEvaluating Pediatric NF1 Diagnosis Disclosure Concerns from a Parent\u2019s Perspective\u201d. In this study, disclosure refers to the action of making a diagnosis known to the child. Recent research has explored parents\u2019 experiences raising a child with NF1 but has not specifically studied parents\u2019 experiences telling their child about his/her NF1 diagnosis.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to evaluate the concerns, barriers, failures, or successes parents have experienced when they have, or have not, chosen to tell their child/children about an NF1 diagnosis. We hope to use this information to better understand different perspectives held by members of the NF1 community. In addition, this information would be useful to help medical providers address parental concerns and provide high-quality, supportive care to families like yours. You were selected as a potential participant because of your membership in the NF Registry.\n\nIf you are interested in participating in the study, you will complete an online survey that will take no longer than 10-15 minutes. The survey will also ask if you would be interested in being contacted to participate in an audio only interview call that should last between 20-60 minutes. The interview will include more open-ended questions about your personal experience with your child\u2019s NF1 diagnosis and the disclosure process if it has occurred. If you wish to be re-contacted to interview, you will be prompted to provide your name and email address so that the interview can be scheduled. The interviews will be recorded and transcribed, but your name will not be included.\n\nParticipation in this study is voluntary. You can stop taking the survey or stop participating in the interview at any time. There is no payment for participation in this study.\n\nThis research is being conducted as part of the graduate requirements for the University of Alabama at Birmingham Genetic Counseling Program.\n\nIf you have any questions about the research please contact the Principal Investigator, Madeleine Franchi, at \n\nTo access the survey and learn more information about the study, please click the link below:\n\n Also\u2026our NF clinic at Johns Hopkins is headed by Dr Verena Staedke who is terrific, always involved in the latest research, and participates in public speaking on NF so I imagine she would be amenable to being interviewed for the podcast. And one more\u2026\u2026 Dr Maria Acosta at Childrens Hospital in Washington DC is a pediatric neurologist who is particularly knowledgeable about the behavioral and learning challenges of NF1 in children.", "Has anyone had a nerve test? What exactly are they going to do?. They are doing a nerve test next month because I have been having pain in my left foot. Its likely that it is a bone spur but there is a bump about 5 inches above my ankle my doctor thinks it could on a nerve and that is what is causing the pain in my foot. Theres at least three different things that could be called nerve tests that I have done. I do not recall what any of them was called. \n\nThe most basic thing is they send you to a neurologist, who has this weird needle thing. On one end its very sharp and on one end its sorta ball point pen level pointy. \n\nThey just alternate if they poke you with the very sharp side or the vaguely pointy side. They are not breaking the skin, it does not hurt at all, it is just kind of \"does this feel sharp? what about now?\" while they move up and down your legs/arms trying to find an area that cannot tell the difference between sharp and not sharp. They also might break out a( that is like a wheel covered in needles, again this does not hurt or break the skin at all they just run it across your skin and if you have numbness you will feel that it feels different in whatever part of you does not feel stuff correctly.  (I used to get this done once a year and my doc would do it really quick and i would just say \"pointy\" or \"not pointy\" or \"nothing\" depending on how it felt, with me laying on my back so i cannot see which side hes using on my legs)\n\n\nThen theres more invasive stuff:\n\ntheres one where they stick electrodes to you and shock you. Not as bad as it sounds, just makes your muscles tense up all of a sudden without you asking them to. They basically just do that a few times in several different places and theres a computer that somehow knows what is going on with that.\n\nThen theres a thing where they stick long skinny needles in you and they measure electrical activity that is happening in your muscles and some computer makes a reading.\n\nI am not a doctor,  but i have been a patient a lot of times and I have a lot of nerve damage, and I would expect them to work down the list, though you might get the last two at the same time. Thank you very much EMG testing. Check to see if how many tumors are growing on your nerves.  Not too painful at all. Tiny little needles. If you have ever had acupuncture or a tattoo it is sort of like that. Less painful than a tattoo", "who is scared about this new health care bill US? im terrified.if i had to get private insurance im screwed before obama care a plan with a 40,000 deductible was quoted 600+ dollars a month from 4 differnt insurance companies, i was declined ACHSS (az state health for low income) for being single white male, post obama care i was quoted 150 month with 6000 deductiable.  i am married and on my wifes plan now, just worried dor future.i read the bill and its messed up even considers people who are transgender a pre-existing (i can see them adding gay, bi, lesbian) to that as well ,  You are not alone.

More details in post. Hi! My husband has a very mild case of NF. His mom and sister both have more severe cases. He has never been officially diagnosed, but most definitely fits the criteria. \n\nWe are about to start a family, and want to screen the embryos to make sure they are healthy. Our doctor told us he would not help us until we saw a genetic counselor. As far as we know there is a 50/50 chance of passing it on. The doctor is not familiar with NF, and told us the possibilities are endless and depending on the results of the tests, DH could have anywhere from a 0% - 100% chance of in fact passing it on. Does this make sense to anyone else? We have done lots of research, as has DH's mom, and we have never heard anything like that before. \n\nIt is frustrating since the wait times for genetic counselors in our area are around 1.5 years, coupled with a year-long wait list for IVF. I am eager to get started but find it kind of pointless to see a counselor at this point. \n\nAny input is appreciated! Thank you! We see a genetic counselor but my son has some other medical reasons for that. We do plan to have a discussion with him and a high-risk ob before trying for another child, and we are going to have my husband and I tested for NF. But I agree, it is 50/50 chance. Very odd of the doctor to think otherwise. I would send him some of the research, perhaps the children's tumor foundation site, and ask if you can discuss it with him again.  You say you are eager to get started. Wait for the genetic counselor. 1.5 years of waiting is better than a lifetime of problems for your child. Read some of the depressing threads in this sub and see if you do not want to wait still. This is not your life you are gambling with. It is your child's.  Maybe I was not clear enough - we know we are doing the IVF with the PGD. Our doctor is wanting to send us to a genetic counselor because he is not sure the % chance that my husband would pass it on to a child. We told him 50/50, he disagrees and wants us to see a specialist so we can get \"accurate\" information. He thinks if the chances are less that we would pass it on, we might not want to do the PGD. I am confident with the research I have done it is 50/50. I do not see the point in waiting when we know we do not want to take the risk regardless.\n\nI was simply curious to see if the counselor can tell us any other useful information that would be vital for us to know before proceeding with the PGD. That is all. Rest assured I am quite familiar with what I am dealing with.    If your doctor cannot Google ctf.org or so basic research,  I would suggest finding another one. I am also active in the childfree sub,  and you would be surprised the crap they try to pull. I am glad you are doing the pgd, just be wary of the laws in your locality when it comes to terminating the pregnancy if the doctor makes a mistake.  I was born with it, but neither of my parents have it or my three younger siblings. It is possible distant family member on either side of my family may have had it, but no one knows for sure. Since your husbands mother and sister have it and he shows signs of having it, he may have a light or mild case, but would still be a carry of the disorder which in turn can be passed onto any of his children 50% and in turn they can pass it on to their kids and so on.\n\nNow I have heard there is way to have kids without passing on the condition, but it is costly and would have to be talked with a doctor that knows about this stuff.\n\nThis condition can skip generations, that is likely what happened to me, so while you may have a child not born with the condition they still carry the gene for the condition and at some point a child can be born with the condition.  We went to one before IVF, and all he said was the 50/50 thing that we already knew, and that I had about a 40% risk of getting a lot worse if I carried the baby.   We saved as much as we could, and were able to afford a surrogate.  We now have twins. Congratulations! Do you mind me asking if you did the PGD with IVF? No, my eggs were not viable anymore.  We used a relative's donated eggs. Sorry this is late. I am looking to go th\nrough this process. The chance of passing NF is 50/50.  With PGD ivf basically they test the embryo before they would do the transfer. Once you do the pgd ivf the chance is super slim , however theres also a chance all  could be affected. Before doing that y\n\nour husband would need to do g\nenetic testing so they know exactly what gene or whatever they are looking for .I was told this information by a genetic counselor as well as by a fertility clinic that does the PGD ivf.  The genetic counsellor told me that place they recommend for the genetic testing is the university of Alabama.(I think) .\n\n Hopefully this helps.\n any ivf clinic worth its salt SHOULD have an in house genetic team.  look for a different IVF clinic, also, why is there a wait list for IVF?  what part of the country do you live in, none of this makes sense to me, could be because im from the NE though. I am in Toronto, Ontario. That probably accounts for a lot of the differences. ", "Is this wrong? Basically, a long time ago I decided to never find love because of NF. I do not want to have kids because I have been through a lot and struggle with a lot of things because of NF, and I would not feel comfortable bringing a kid into this world, knowing there is a chance they will go through the same thing.\n\n\nNow I know, I do not have to have kids or I can adopt if I get married but it goes beyond that too. I will be a liability to my spouse. I have had 4 surgeries already and I am not even 30 yet, and even with insurance, surgery is not cheap.\n\n\nI would just feel guilty living with someone the rest of my life, knowing there is so much baggage that comes with me.  I wont have kids and its 50% because of my nf1. You can totally find love but it has to start with self love (not masturbation joke) and once you can be confident and comfortable with yourself you will find someone who will love you for what really matters, not the nf. \nIf you want kids, adoption is always an option and maybe even if the foster chid has nf, you can be the supportive role model so they can learn to live with it as well. \n\nIts tough but i bet that youre tougher and someone who balances the already daunting task of dealing with human existence and nf on top ot would make a strong and compassionate spouse and parent.\n\n No, you are not wrong at all.  Hi, lurker here. So mostly what I want to say is as far as relationships go, do not think of yourself as \"baggage\". The thing is, everyone has baggage. Everyone has their own quirks and difficulties. That includes other people you would be in a relationship with. They will not be perfect either. When you go out in the world to look for a significant other, you look for one who would be compatible with you anyway. There are going to be people out there with their own neuroses that they will be worried will bother other people accepting, what people are willing to accept in a partner is different in everyone. It is not out of the realm of possibility to find someone who loves you for you and says they do not care about the other stuff. You deserve happiness. As someone who managed to snag someone and get married, it is so much more helpful to go through life with someone who has your back when you are suffering, and when you face the difficulties you face. A relationship is a two-way street, each person has their strengths, and they help eachother with their weaknesses. By all means, be upfront with people when dating, having or not having children is a fair dealbreaker for some, but there are plenty who do not want any either. What I am trying to say is(I am sorry if this is all rambling), have faith in people that they will understand you, your condition, and love you too.  I do not think you are wrong but I do not know. I mean I would really love to have kids some day but I do not know if it worth the risk.  Nobody can decide what is right and what is \"wrong\".\n\nThat being said the saying \"Those Who Mind Do not Matter, and Those Who Matter Do not Mind\", comes to mind. OP you there? Yes. Still here.  Im 20 and have been through 2 rounds of chemo (tumor on optic nerve)  and have had a tumor removed from my leg as well. I think about this often if I can find love... should I have kids? As far as having children you said the same thing I have been saying for years I couldnt stand to see or put someone in a world of never knowing what is to come, constant pain. But that is the thing.. life is beautiful and sometimes you just got to live it!! You hit the nail on the head about adoption, but NEVER EVER give up hope because when you give up theres no point... keep that fire burning dont ever stop yanno? And on the subject of finding love, you should most definitely never give up on that either!!! Having that someone who can be by your side through thick and thin is the whole point of being together! When you find the right person they will want to be with you no matter what you have what is to come... because theres nothing that can stop the power of compassion and love. It keeps your fire alive because that is what lifes all about. Dont be scared of death, because without death is the only thing that makes life worth living is death itself... otherwise we are all just existing not living. Embrace your life, live life and love man. Never lose sight of what is truly important. Thank you for your kind and inspirational response. I will keep it in mind. I am still pretty young and thus naive at times. I cannot make you promises that I will find love but I will keep my mind and heart open to the possibility. Of course friend! Posative vibes all the way! Feel free to DM me if you ever need a pal to talk with! :) ", "Do these look like CALMS to you? More information in comments.

What if I have a tumor near/on my lung? Unless you have a history of respiratory infections, I would not worry too much and keep taking the suggested precautions. I dont think it will have any direct effects. But i was thinking that if there is a respirator shortage NF may be listed as a preexisting condition and make you not a priority. Do not believe so, but if you are concerned you could always contact your doctor about it. Are people with pre-existing conditions being passed over for treatment? Unfortunately, if hospitals become overloaded, healthcare workers will be forced to make some horrendous decisions. Or more accurately, triage guidelines will be developed to be followed. It happened in Italy and could happen in the United States and many other countries. It is related to how everybody has been talking about \"flattening the curve\". I do not know if Neurofibromatosis alone would be included, I think it is probably far too varying for anybody to make an ethical generalization. I have two small tumours on my lung too! I am just being super careful and washing my hands an insane amount. I also work with young children so constantly exposed to germs..... If you are a smoker, or if you have reduced lung capacity I would take extra care of the precautions. But I do not think having NF would make you more susceptible in getting covid19 I have NF (1), but also have numerous other medical conditions/issues, therefore, I am immunocompromised and also a high risk since I also have restricted lung disease. It depends what your health is like. Im guessing that NF (1) lowers your immune system a little, but if you only have a mild case of NF with no other medical issues then you should be okay. \n\nOn that note, though, you should still stay inside and practice social distancing. Even healthy people are crippled by this virus and healthy people also die from Covid -although it is only a small percentage of cases. Be mindful, careful, a stay home if you are in an area where it is bad. I do not believe so unless you have underlying health issues.", "Neurofibromatosis in the breasts I recently noticed a lump in my left breast, and yeah, I should probably just wait until I go to the doctor until I worry, but yeah... :/\n\nFrom what I have read, breast cancer lumps are usually hard to move while mine does move quite freely. So I am not *that* worried about cancer. But since I have NF1 I suspect that it is connected to that. \n\nI have been diagnosed just two years ago and never really had a check-up, just an MRI of my head, I do not have any visible tumors but as far as I know neurofibromas can be invisible from the outside too, right? And now I did what I should not have done and googled and found a page saying that neurofibromas in the breast usually require an amputation of the breast as a precaution, since there is an 10% chance it might turn into cancer.\n\nHas anyone here had an issue similar like that? I know the lump can just be a cyst or something else but I am just worried now... \n\nI am *going to* book an appointment with a gynecologist but I just found the lump so I think I am going to need a few days. Hey! I have got a several (benign- at this point) neurofibromas in my right breast. They move quite freely too. I have actually had them for a few years now and it never caused too many problems until recently, where I have had a lot of pain so finally going to go through with surgery. Let me know if you have got any questions or you just want to talk bc I know I struggled with not having anyone to talk to who got it Always get those checked. Save the boobies!", "Im transgender  and pre op. I have NF1 and i fear that even after top surgery i wont be able to walk around shirtless.  I have got it worse and I do it. I have got a mark across my entire right ribcage, with neurofibromas all under it. i have covered a lot of mine with tattoos, it is helped my self confidence significantly Do not ever be ashamed of your body, if people say your spots are ugly or something else, they probably  have problems with their self esteem  :-)  I have one that literally takes up my entire back and it has never bothered me an ounce  This post is a little old I see but I am just starting my transistion and have NF1 as well. If you see this and have gone through any of this process could you help me out with what to expect? Or anything I should know. Thanks! ", "Another Medical Name I have done it! Had blood taken a few weeks ago and seems they think I have pheochromocytoma which is a rare tumor of adrenal gland tissue. This might be due to the Amitriptyline I am on but more tests. \n\nI am truly fed up of all the hospital appointment I have. While I know I have it lucky and there is a lot of people worse off than me it still another punch in the face or feels like it.  Pheochromocytomas are rare, but they are more common in people with NF. It is unlikely the amitriptyline had anything to do with this, but if you have any concerns talk with your NF specialist. Thanks I am seeing part of the team next week this appointment was booked months ago and more in December so hoping for results soon. I had one taken out in March. Surgery was super easy - only spent one night in the hospital.", "Alcohol or substance abuse habits? I am new here and hope I am not beating a dead horse with a common topic. I have NF1 via spontaneous. I am a moderately functional alcoholic and do not mind a few other things on occasion. Not counting cannabis. I do not think that NF predisposes one too these things. But living with the physical side has played a part in my lifestyle choices. Anyone else experience any thing similar and care to discuss. In general people who experience physical pain and discomfort at higher scale and frequency are more likely to use more substances more often. I personally have not heard of any implicit connection between the genetic mutation and the propensity to use mind altering substances. I would say it is more because of the pain, discomfort and of course emotional toll the disorder takes. I am not a Dr just some guy who has nf1. I do not have any, but I rarely drink dont really care too much for it. I also do not do any drugs or cannabis. Now as far as pain and discomfort goes, that very normal and common to have, but everyone with Neurofibromatosis can feel it differently. I do, but unsure if it is related to having NF1. I have partied since I was a teenager and it helps with the pain\nMy Dr prescribed me Tramadol and I have been on it for 4 years. It is not effective but takes the edge off the pain. O do not find cannabis helps the lake, but it does hp me sleep a bit better. I enjoy going out and do so on an almost regular basis. During the current time, I typically drink about 5 days a week, but do not really see it as abuse. Stay away on Sundays and Mondays. I am very responsible and know how to control my alcohol intake. It has nothing to do with pain as luckily, NF does not cause any for me. I have been through a lot in terms of surgeries though. Yeah, but with food. I did not care much for my body due to its appearance - not that many can tell while I am wearing clothes but I knew what I looked like underneath. So I would eat a lot of junk food and highly processed food very often cause I had the mentality \u201cwell, I am ugly. I might as well be fat too\u201d. \n\nI do not do that anymore. I certainly do not eat super healthy but I do not eat unhealthy too often either. i smoke weed and use CBD instead of anexity or depression meds and it is very helpful, i do not like drinking tho, i get sicker and drunker faster then my friends who do not have it Same? I cannot get drunk before i get bad. Is this related to NF1? I use cannabis. Mostly for my mental state but it helps me sleep better and feel less pain also. Im often low energy, hence feeling depressed. I also have anxiety and Ive always been more sensitive to impressions than most people around me. I come from a family of addicts myself.  Mostly just alcohol.  I completely avoided alcohol all together until I was in my mid 20s for fear of becoming an alcoholic.  I only tried cannabis a handful of times until I was near 30. \n\nBut about the time I turned 30 I also got a job that allowed for medical marijuana so I decided to get my card and experiment a little.  \n\nIt has made a huge difference to me with not only reducing my pain, but I feel like I am more focused throughout the day (while not consuming) than I was before smoking regularly. \n\nNow back to your question.  I do not feel that I have an addiction to the marijuana. But I do look forward to getting home and having that end of day session.  \n\nCannabis aside, I definitely have an addictive personality and can become addicted to many things where I will binge on them for days/weeks/months.  And this can be simple things like country time lemonade, nesquick, chips and salsa, Chinese food, etc\u2026 \n\nFor me, it is difficult to enjoy most things in moderation, and for this reason I will never try any of the \u201chard drugs\u201d", "Help trying to understand So I have a younger brother he is 13 he has type 1 I think, he is pretty normal nothing out of the ordinary he just has 2 bumps/tumors one on his left hand and right foot and I just want to be able to understand stand more of what he is going through and not just think he is being lazy when I am trying to help him at school work or anything else he does, he is my younger brother I love him I do not want to make him think I am being mean when I am helping This is really sweet of you. I do not have learning disability so I cannot help you here but you sound like a great sibling xx I have Neurofibromatosis type 1, I was not diagnosed until I was 15, though doctors always believed I had it, but test results were always inconclusive. It was until after I had hit puberty that the on switch was turned on.\n\nIn school I had trouble, especially in math and reading. When I was nine I was diagnosed with dyslexia, which is something that Neurofibromatosis can cause.\n\nPhysically, I have issues with balance, my right leg is weaker than my left leg. I have had my right leg give out on me when walking. I do have pain throughout my body which I take two pain medications for. With out it I would not be able to function. I also have weakness in my right arm.\n\nI have had four surgeries related to my nf. \n\nIn 2001 I had a tumor removed from lower right arm.\n\nIn 2006 I had tumors removed from my cervical spine (had that not been removed I could have woken up one day unable to get out of bed)\n\nIn 2014 I had tumors removed from my upper right leg (they were high grade cancerous tumors that caused a lot of pain, some painful that I did not even feel like going out to dinner with my family)\n\nIn 2018 I had tumor removed from my upper right arm (these were also cancerous, but a lower grade)\n\nI guarantee your brother is not being lazy. I am sure he is in pain. I have had pain episodes that have woken me up out of my sleep. Imagine have a burning pain throughout your body that last for 15 minutes straight with no relief.\n\nNow Neurofibromatosis does effect everyone differently, not everyone is effected the same way. Some people only have a few tumors, others like myself have them all throughout our entire bodies.\n\nIf you have any questions, let me know. I also am type 1 and I had a lot of trouble learning at school, it took me a long time to grasp things. I remember getting lots of bad grades up until high school. It took a lot of hard work, studying every night for hours. I remember feeling helpless and just wanting to quit, but my mom pushed me everyday. I would not be where I am now if it was not for her. So kind of you to want to understand better, and to help your bro!  \nMy son has NF1.  In addition to the physical effects he also has ADHD.  He is crazy smart but can have trouble learning new info in a classroom situation.  I work with him on anything that is tough at school.  For him, the toughest is math because since middle school he is learning math that requires several complex steps to solve a problem.  He knows how to do each step, but struggles with remembering the order, as is typical with ADHD.  \nI think that the biggest challenge might be getting him to allow you to help him.  If he does not want to say that something is hard, perhaps check in with him after a test or report card and say something like, \u201cThis grade is crazy!  You are so much smarter than this!  Maybe you just need to hear it in a way that is different than your teacher explained it.  Would it be ok if we tried that together?\u201d\nYou have got all the right intentions!  Good luck! He is kind of young, so I understand it can be hard to approach him in the right way. Maybe it is better to let him know you are there for him if he would need any help instead of forcing it on him as he might inerpret that as you seeing him as too dumb to make it on his own.   \n\n\nI never really struggled too much in school. In elementary, I did have some issues with holding pencils and other problems with my coordination and I also fell behind a bit due to going on chemo, but overall, I did well in school and was sometimes among the better in my class even. Today I even hold a university degree.   \n\n\nThe thing with NF is that it is very unpredictable and affects everyone differently. As I said, it might be better to just let him know you are there for him and give him the freedom to ask for help if he needs it.", "Have any of you got a DOT physical would neurofibromatos be an issue?

There are tumors growing in my arteries and one in my neck wrapped around an artery as well.  If they decide to start growing it will be quick.

My boyfriends mom died almost exactly a year ago from a tumor growing on her brainstem from nf1. My boyfriend has had a tumor since he was a baby and it has never caused any problems. Lately though he constantly tells me he is old (he is  30). His mom was 52 when she died so he has it in his head he is middle aged and only has like 20 years left. I have been shrugging it off and pointing out that his grandma died from the disease in her 80s, so his death  ks not as imminent as he thinks. Now, though, i want him to be tested to see if anything is going on up there. He works a lot so i said i would help find a doctor who specializes in nf1. \n\nAlso, our 2 month old has 15 cafe au lait spots, so he might have it as well. Kind Of worried about him as well. His pediatrician  said she would look for more signs later on when he is a little older, but it seems like i find new spots on him every  day.\n\nWe are in the Dallas area. We called a specialist here and they wont have an opening until February. We are willing to go out of state if we have to if we can get an appointment before the end of the year. We have hit our out of pocket max with our insurance, so anything medical (in network) is completely free until the end of the year. \n\nAny help or advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nAlso, you people  are pretty amazing. I wish more people knew about this disease because while its pretty common, i had never heard of it before i was pregnant with my daughter (2 years, does not have nf1). My boyfriends mom was an amazing lady and when she was dying, it was just heart breaking to see her go from alright to dead in 5 months. She didnt get checked out annually because her husband was a dick. When she was in pain anytime she asked to go to the doctor the entire time they were together (30ish years), he would get mad and say she was going to make them lose their house because  they didnt have insurance, so she just never said anything when she was hurting. The pain was probably an early sign, and had she been checked 4 or 5 years before, they might have had a better chance with radiation or chemo. Instead, my kids have to grow up and not remember her. When she was in hospice care at home (they live with us), she tried to take a bath one day and couldnt get out of the tub. I would usuaally help her, but was asleep at the time. Her husband bitched about how helping her get out hurt his back and it still hurt 2 hours later, s o she said she wouldnt ask him anymore.  The next day i got up and heard a noise in the bathroom. She had tried to take a bath and couldnt get out, so she had been stuck for about 30 or 45 minutes because she didnt want to ask him for help.Her husband still lives with us and i have not spoken to him or acknowledged  his presence  since October  because of how he treated her before they found the tumor and how he neglected and abandoned  her during her last 3 months. When she was in the nursing home, he didnt visit her a single time.\n\nI know all of that was too much information,  but oh well.", "DISCORD  Joined! Thanks, Sarah!", "Should I be concerned with the pain i am having? I have been dealing with pain from NF my entire life. But more recently due to my job and increase amount of work I am doing to my day-to-day life, the pain has been getting worse. And I do not know whether it is me being out of shape or me just figuring out something new with my enough. In the past when I have told my doctor, my specialist, about this, they have just brushed it off and did not really do much for it. Should I insist with my doctor about doing something for it, like maybe an MRI or something like that. Or should I just go with the flow and live with it. I am also a college student so dealing with this type of pain throughout my arms and legs is very hard when I have to bike to certain classes. I would talk to the doctor with NF it is good to be extra careful. I am in a Facebook group and I know others have said they have joint issues. I do not really have daily pain but I do get this awful pain in the back of my head and neck I cannot even move. I am scared to death that it could be something bad. I get those as well. But I will tell you that lots of non NFers also get them. For me it was a tension headache, sometimes exacerbated by mild hangover. But good head and neck stretches have helped enormously. Sometimes our pain is just because we are human. \n\nGet regular checkups of course.

This was in 2014. Then in 2018 I started having similar pain in my right arm and once again it was a tumor that had turned cancerous.\n\nIs your specialist one who is a specialist in Neurofibromatosis, if so they would like want to order MRIs to see what is going on. Yes, I am hopefully meeting with them soon we will see! Good luck to you, I hope the appointment goes well. Was the pain continous? I get ached and pains but nothing unbearable. Yes, the pain could last for a while and then go away for a while and then come back. That pain would last until I had the cancerous tumors removed.

All these years with these birthmarks, and I never knew that it had anything to do with a genetic disorder. I have a tumor growing in my groin area, that is why we found out about the NF1 to begin with. From everything I have read, the surgeries can be very dangerous. My tumor is involved with nerves that have to do with my lower body movement. I am so terrified that I am going to be disabled and have no one to take care of me. My doctor seems to know nothing about NF1, and I feel like I am getting the runaround. I just got through dealing with three years of dealing with breast cancer that is now in remission. But between chemo, surgeries and reconstructions, it has been something I have dealt with for quite a while. Now I am slammed with learning that I have NF1. To say the least...I am terrified! Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Hi!  Welcome to the sub.  I am a fellow NFer who has lived most of my life knowing I have NF.  I inherited it from my Mother as did my sibling and my child inherited it as well.  I am sorry that you have had to deal with so much already and know this.  It is a lot to take in when you have a disorder such as this.  NF is unpredictable and can be really scary.  \n\nMy first recommendation is to get a doctor who knows about NF.  Its very important that you have someone who is in the know.  Next, request to see a doctor that specializes in generics specifically one who has experience with NF and if you have an NF clinic available to you, you should get onto one. Hopefully all of these resources will be able to help you formulate the best way to manage your NF as managment varies greatly from person to person.  Feel free to message me privately if you would like to talk!  I am happy to listen and offer what ever advice that I can.  Good luck to you fellow NFer! Similar situation, except I knew I had NF1but I was symptom-less until recently.  Where about do you live? You may want to find an NF clinic locally. The good news is neurofibromas tend to be slow growing so you could be stable for many years. Thank you so much for your reply! I just might be reaching out. You really need to see a doctor who is familiar with Neurofibromatosis, so they can recommend a surgeon who knows what they are doing. I was diagnosed when I was 15, I am 37 now. And my specialist tells me exactly who is going to do my surgeries when I need them. I have have three major surgeries that he picked the surgeons that preformed the surgery on them.

I have NF1 and do not bruise easily. There may be another cause for the easy bruising. I used to bruise pretty easily too. I had a very low ferritin level (a precursor to anemia). \n\nMy GP thought it might be NF related, as we could not figure out a reason and (not a vegetarian, no GI issues, no heavy periods) and I did not have the classic anemia symptoms (some internet research I did said asymptomatic anemia is pretty common). My neurologist did not think it was NF related.\n\nI did have two iron infusions earlier this year which improved the ferritin level drastically, I do not notice as many bruises as I used to. yeah My son who has NF bruises easily but I have always just chalked it up to his boy-ness.  Often, though, he does not know how he got his bruises, so maybe?  Never thought to associate it with the NF.

I have mostly just cafe au lait spots which i think are so cute.\nI dont have any full grown tumors but im starting to see some appearing on my tummy. Like make 20 which is really scary. I had one appear about 2-3 yrs ago on my arm.\nUp until now my sex life is normal and i dont feel self conscious about my body but i am starting to get anxious that the tumors will appear and make me feel self conscious I have mostly just cafe au lait spots which i think are so cute.\nI dont have any full grown tumors but im starting to see some appearing on my tummy.

But if you are a girl, do not take anything that messes up with your hormones, like birth control.\ncan I ask you something weird, do you have cafe au lait spots on your butt as well ? Im female yea and it worried me cause the lil bumps seem new or maybe i never noticed them. I have  a lot of cafe au lait spots on my boobies. I think i only have one timy one on my butt. Redheads, such as myself tend to avoid the beach out of fear of being scorched by the sun, those that brave it are not afraid to expose their massive number of freckles. Because I am a redhead, I think people just assume my caf\u00e9 au lait spots are giant freckles. Freckles are very common, as well as birthmarks. Will people notice your freckles and caf\u00e9 au lait spots?  \nProbably.\u00a0 Will they spend much time thinking about it? Probably not.\u00a0 Will they approach you and harass you?\u00a0 Highly unlikely.  \nYou may be surprised to learn that a lot of guys like freckles, although some may go a little too far with how much they like them, but too each their own. I know it is clich\u00e9, but the more confident you are with yourself and your body, the more people are going to be attracted to you. Average and below looking people get laid everyday, we sleep with other averages and below people", "surgery. i am getting surgery on the 10th to remove some tumors, one on my right elbow, right wrist, and a cluster of them on my left hip. has anyone had them removed on the elbow/wrist. curious to what the recovery time is for that, since you move those parts of your body a lot  I had a little guy above my left wrist removed and I was using it just fine the same day. It was sore for a week or so while the cut healed but no issue otherwise. This was 3 years ago.  This was not my wrist or elbow, but I had one removed from my knee earlier this year, along with several others. I felt the most discomfort with that one, since it was on the joint and bending.  It was not really too painful, just an annoying discomfort.\n\nI would just give your wrist a week or so before moving it too much, to avoid pulling the wound apart. I had one right under the wrist bone removed a few years back.  It did not hurt any more than any others I had removed (I actually had three removed on my back today and I think they are the worst so far - but I probably just have forgot how painful they can be).  Only thing that sucked was on my way to get the stitches out, I popped a tire and tore a stitch trying to get my spare out before the tow truck arrived.   that makes me less nervous about it. i am actually excited to get them removed because i am so insecure about them.  that is what i am worried about since you move those part of your arm the most. i am right handed so that is especially going to be difficult. i am just glad i took a week off of work now.  i have never really had any remover aside for the one on my chin that they did at the office. the shot to numb it hurt the most, after that i felt nothing. i do not know what to expect but i am just excited to have them gone.  Everyone is recovery is different. In 2014 I had a large cancerous nf tumor removed from my right leg. I was up and walking around after they woke me up.  I also had a small one removed from my left wrist when I was in school . Was just a day surgery . Was in and out very fast . ", "Random sharp pains Hello all, I was diagnosed with NF1 at a young age and I have never really had any issues with it. I see a doctor every few years, I have had scans here and there but overall not much. I do however, get random sharp pains. It is pretty random when and where it happens. Is this a normal thing for NF? Do you experience it as well? I go through my ups and downs when it comes to pain. I have days that I deal with it and others that it is hard for me to move around. I have experienced chronic pain since around 2014 and have been treated for it since 2015 after a spinal surgery, and a few times a day will get spasms of pain in my nerves (this has been happening since around 2010) some days are pretty bad but most days are okay. From what I have noticed in various NF groups chronic pain is common for us. It depends on where you mean. Is it just a sharp pain when you are sitting there doing nothing or a seeming light stroke on a fibroma? I had very bad reaction to touch on a couple I had removed last year but other than that no sharp pains on their own.\n\nI do get the pricklies on occasion, that is the most non-provoked I get. Yep! Gets worse when I am stressed, it is weird. NF1 as well. I would go and get it checked if you can. I would get sharp nerve pains in my legs and it would be hard to piss. I thought it was due to a lack of exercise, but they found a growth in my spinal cord on accident while scanning my abdomen. Turns out that was causing all the pain. Better be safe than sorry, and tell doctors everything. Interesting, I do as well,never occurred to me it could be linked to nh1.\n\nThanks! It depends on the pain, when I was having really sharp pains that were out of the norm for the pain I usually had, my Neurofibromatosis doctor ordered scan and it turned out the tumor was cancerous and needed to be removed. Once it was removed that pain went away. Then four year later I was experiencing similar pain only on a different limb, that also ended up being cancerous and needed to be removed. That happened back in April 2018. I am doing good now. I do not mean to scare you, but if this pain is painful and new you should get it checked out sooner rather than later.", "MRIs? Hello, my fiancee (F26) was diagnosed with FM1 this year. She is always been aware of her birthmarks, she got them from her mother, but did not know it was an actual skin disease. Her's is minor, a few spots, and one large red bump on her arm. I have been browsing this sub for information and a lot of people mentioned getting regular MRIs. Why is this? Should she be getting them? MRIs help with detecting tumors and monitoring their growth, they are pretty much xrays for soft tissue. You said it was a minor case, so I would not stress about getting one unless she starts having difficulties or a doctor reccomends getting one. However, it might be wise to get a full body scan done, just as a precautionary measure.\n\nAlso, you might want to start searching for a NF specialist in your area if that has not been done already. She has talked to just her regular doctor about it, and they determined that aside from how she looks, this should not affect her. I will like into a specialist though. Neurofibromatosis is not a skin disease, it is a neurological disorder. So people who have nf get checked by MRI to check for tumors which is a factor with nf. Tumors can form anywhere in the nervous system including brain, spinal cord and nerves.  She probably should have one if she never had one before to be safe and see if she has any tumors inside causing issues, although if she doesnt have any symptoms besides the markings on the skin hers is probably mild. It in my opinion is better to be safe than sorry and get checked out.\n\nHas she had genetic testing to make sure she does have nf? She does have a small bump on the right side of her lower back, which she showed her doctor, and he said it was fine. Does that sound like a tumor? fibromas are the bumps on the outside of the skin. There is a lot unknown still with nf and it is hard to know the facts because everyone is told somthing differnt. For me my bumps outside have always been contected to tumors inside. So I would say its likely she has tumors if she has bumps. It does sound normal for neurofibromatosis though. Like it doesnt sound like she has any worrisome symptoms. It is so much more than a skin disorder. It is a neurological condition which can cause behavioral disorders also (Not in every case though). Definitely would recommend an MRI and eye tests as tumors can grow behind the eyes and cause blindness. My son has a tumor in his brain which needs frequent MRI scans to monitor its growth. Get as much medical help as you can. I dont know where you are from, but here in Ireland there is not much awareness and my sons GP at the time had never heard of NF. I find it worrying your girlfriends doctor has not given her all the basic information about NF. That sounds like a neurofibroma,  which is very common with patients with NF. They are nothing to worry about, causing discomfort and cosmetic issues at the worst. They can be removed by a plastic surgeon if needed. I would get MRIs regularly as a kid to detect tumours on my brain. They found one on my brain in 2001 and in 2002 I had to get surgery. It is precautionary because for some people they show no symptoms of a tumour. It is not horrible, just annoying. We would always make a day of it. For me I lived an hour away from the hospital which was in the city. I would miss school, my parents would miss work, and we would spend the day shopping and eating to try to make the whole thing easier on my young self. \n\nAnother thing is to find a good eye doctor. NF can cause lisch nodules to form in the eye so it is good to have a doctor familiar with the disease who knows what to look for. If this is the case, it sounds like your doctor is not familiar with NF and has not made any attempt to learn more.   Please go to  (  and read a bit for your own knowledge and find a doctor or specialist with some experience.   If you need help finding a doctor in your area CTF is a good resource, also, you can find many state/city related NF facebook groups. It is a neurological disease/Disorder &lt;---- we can sit and argue that point until blue in face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMRIs usually require recommendation, unless she is having issues, they won' recommend anything,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNF is  progressive but normally see the issues around Hormonal changes, Skin issues although embasrassing do not usually cause to many problems I have 100s of fibromas on my chest back, arm and my head.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe best idea would be to monitor it, for any drastic changes. this is not exactly true it needs to be monitored, Fibromas are classified as Tumors, they are nerve sheath tumors, and if it does start to cause pain you need to see the doctor as it can start wrapping around Nerves, and if it is a plexiform fibroma it needs to be continually monitored for growth, as those types are more common to turn cancerous.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI get you are not wanting to freak him out but acting as if it is a nothing burger does not help him Neurofibromatosis can cause tumors to grow throughout the body and become wrapped up in the nerves. In some cases unfortunately these tumors can become cancerous. They can also grow in places that can harm ones life. I have had a few cases, over ten years ago I had tumors that were pressing against my cervical spine, had these tumors not been removed I could have woken up and not be able move my legs one day. Then in 2014 and 2018 in my upper right leg and upper right arm I have had tumors become cancerous that needed to be removed.\n\nI tend to have yearly MRI scans and see my Neurofibromatosis specialist at least 1-3 times a year.\n\nThis is why I have MRIs on a regular basis. Neurofibromatosis does effect everyone differently so everyone is plan of action is different. Well it will definitely affect things if she wants to have kids. There is a 50:50 chance of passing it on and it is impossible to predict how severe a child of hers would have the disease. Could be mild like her or moderate or very severe. Severe symptoms are really scary: brain tumors, spinal cord tumors, large tumors on the skin and basically anywhere inside the body, etc.", "NF1 Waking up w Stomach Pain &amp; Body aches Hey there, my fianc\u00e9 (21 M) has been waking up for the past few weeks with awful stomach pain, body aches and joint pain, and just wakes up exhausted. I did not think it was NF1 related but maybe it is a possibility. I give him some pain killers and within a few hours it is gone and he is okay, but it is just the same routine everyday and I am wondering whether it is NF1 related. We have a doctors appointment booked too, which is next week so do not worry or bother commenting he should see a doc, just wondering if anyone else is familiar \ud83d\ude0a I have not been woken up with stomach pains, but I have been woken up with body pains in the past, in both 2014 and 2018. I do not mean to scare you, but those pains turned out to be related to cancerous tumors, which I had removed and that pain went away.\n\nAt the doctors appointment make sure he describes the pain and the location of where it is happening. If it is Neurofibromatosis, the doctor will likely order MRIs and other scans to be done. Okay, thank you for this, completely appreciate it. He was diagnosed with NF1 when he was a few months old so yeah, I will tell him to do this, thank you so much! You are welcome. I hope the appointment goes well. Best of luck with his appointment.\n\nI had a schwannoma on my S1/S2, and it certainly caused body aches and nerve pain across my back and abdomen, down a leg, up to my armpit, etc. There was also a correlation between it growing (size changes between MRIs) and my gut being able to eat normally or having constipation. Some days I did not feel like eating at all.\n\nThankfully, things went back to normal when that sucker got taken out. Fellow NF1 here Please, please get it looked at. I dont not want 9 alarm you, but mine started hurtimg it turned put to be cancer. I am still here, but if they had caught it sooner I might be in a better situation.", "discord? does an nf discord exist? would anyone be interested in making one? I can make one! I believe there is a few but most have no activity at all or the ones I e just checked links? I was in one, but I think it got shut down, but it was not very active at all. I can make one!\n\n I can make one!\n\n", "I got approved for Medicaid! I can see a specialist for the first time in my life (and one from NYU too!) I am honestly so happy. Could not afford to see one before as my old insurance was being an ass about it lol. I can finally gauge where my condition is at (was born with NF1.) Such a weight of my chest which is needed as I have been going through a lot lately. Just a question about your insurance, were you just trying to go see a specialist, most require a referral, and once referred, they usually do not deny it unless said one is out of network.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEither way congrats That is great hopefully the doctor is within your home state, otherwise Medicaid insurance can get very picky about you wanting one in-network. I had gotten Medicaid back in 2011 or 2012 and they always made it an issue when I needed to see my specialist in Chicago. I live in Michigan, I have been seeing this doctor since 1999 when he diagnosed me. I always had to get special permission and it pretty much had to be renewed every six months and a lot of times they would deny it and I would have to appeal their decision. Thankfully my primary doctor was always ready to have my back.\n\nI now have Medicare, so that should resolve the issue for me needing to go out of state. \n\nI wish you the best and stay healthy. So happy for you!!  It is ridiculous how difficult it is to deal with insurance. Yep, luckily the doctor\u2019s are all located in state and accept the Medicaid plan I chose as well as straight Medicaid. Going To definitely make sure that everything is covered prior as I do not want to be surprised with a large bill in the mail lol.  And thanks :) It was really inexpensive insurance that would only pay a portion of the costs. I would be left with a significant bill still as my premium was very high. At least that is what I was told. Oh, man. Even when I got the approval for certain procedures they would turn around and would not cover it. Then they would give me a hard time when I tried to appeal. So glad I do not have to deal with that as much lol You are welcome, take care Should be easier for you now. I never had luck with an appeals. Even when I had proof of preauthorization. Lucky. I make too much to qualify for Medicaid, but cant afford any of the medical bills. Congrats on being able to qualify. I too have the condition (mutation in the womb). I live in the UK and recently been under the care of a specialist in a London hospital. Great to find experts in the field.  Wishing all the best to all", "scared i am scared of growing tumors on my spinal cord or brain or something I know it is hard, but try not to worry about it. I had a tumor removed from my spinal cord 4 years ago and it has not grown back and I am perfectly fine. You will be okay, just remember to do yearly check ups to make sure everything is okay. How old are you?  If you reach a certain age with a low amount of tumors, it is a good sign you may have few as you age also. Also what type do you have? If youre a man and youre past your teen years youre going to be okay I have tumors grow on my cervical spine and they were removed 10+ year ago by an awesome surgeon. I know Neurofibromatosis can be hard, but we cannot live our lives in fear. We have to take things one day at a time. Age does not have anything to do with it. I was in my 20s when I had tumors grow on my cervical spine and they were pressing against it, they had to be removed this was 10+ years ago. This passed winter I learned the tumors have grown back, they are not pressing against my spine like the last time. I was told back then that I likely would have to have surgery again in 15-30 years. Unfortunately age does not factor in. Really? What type do you have, I have type 1 and my neurologist told me that since ive been stable since my late teens that I shouldnt see anything other than slow growth of subcutaneous neurofibromas. I have one on my face that I will need to remove some day but its growing slowly I have type one, my condition has gotten worse since I was 15 when I was first diagnosed. I have had cancerous nf tumors removed in both 2014 and 2018. Unfortunately this condition does effect everyone differently, but as far as I know there is not cut off age for tumors to stop growing or even new ones appearing. It just how ones  own body chemistry reacts to it. Definitely, I was diagnosed in 97 and my original prognosis was that I would never go to college or be independent. Lots of physical, occupational, and behavioral therapy later. I am finishing college and it looks good. I hope you find a treatment plan that helps and that your tumor growth slows down Thank you, my doctor is hoping to get me into a trial. I was supposed to be in one in 2014, even had to get special permission from the trial heads, because I was too old they said, but then we found out I had a cancerous tumor in my right leg and that put a stop to me being in the trial. \n\nI did go to college, a local community college and I am able to drive a little bit, unfortunately for me Neurofibromatosis has not been too kind. Doctors had always thought I had it when I was born, but could never give a full diagnosis until 1999 when I met a specialist. It seems that once I hit the age of puberty that set things into motion, which based on what I have read can happen with some people with Neurofibromatosis. I do manage to work a little bit at an after school care at my old elementary school. It is not much, but it is something to keep me busy and something I am able to do. \n\nI just hope that I can get into a trial to shrink some of my tumors maybe even stop new ones from growing or old ones growing back, especially since the ones on my spine have seemed to grow back. It would also me nice to shrink the one on my right leg has it is pretty big. I do not know if shrinking it would help with my balance and limping issues, as there is likely some nerve issues going on, but every little bit helps.\n\nAnyways I wish you happy help and good luck with your classes. 18 i have NF1 and i do go to therapy thank you for your concern if you have not had any surgeries by now, you will likely not have any going forward. Im 26 and I only started to have funny feelings, like numbness but the doctor told this could could easily be anxiety. Anway is that true what you said about NF? I know nothing about NF tbh. There are different degrees of NF impacting people lives, which is why it can go unnoticed in a large segment since it has minimal impact. Yeah my doctor told me that many people have it and go through life without knowing. Sometimes not knowing is good lol.", "Diet while taking Selumetinib Does anybody changes their diet while on this medications? My doctor say stay away for grapefruit but that pretty much it.  Do you still eat normally with fast food, ice cream, etc. Just because you can i do not know if you should....you know? It is pretty common for many medications to carry a warning abiut mixing with grapefruit. This is because it alters the manner and intensity in which the medication gets absorbed into the bloodstream  which means increased side effects or altered time release of the intended effects.\n\nThis particular medication should be taken on an empty stomach in general, but grapefruit is the only food specifically recommended to avoid. Should not or should. They recommended on empty stomach?\nI was thinking since it is chemo is it a good idea to stay away from sugar. I want ice cream. Thank you for asking for clarification I was typing quickly and typo made it pretty  unclear.\n\nIt is recommended to be taken 1-2 hours before or after a meal, but that grapefruit is the only food that will have a specific chemical reaction with the medication itself I still eat the same stuff as before, I have been on the medication since June. It is not uncommon to be told not to eat grapefruit, a number of different medications out there recommended the same thing about avoiding anything with grapefruit. Yes, take the pills on a empty stomach and do not eat anything for an hour after taking the pills. Also feel free to eat ice cream as normal, unless you were directly told not to. I myself still eat ice cream. Grapefruit and vitamin E are the two mentioned not to use. Many skin creams contain vitamin E so read the labels.\nOutside of the three hour no food window you can eat everything. My daughter's no food window is four to seven; Koseluo medication at 6, AM and PM. What is the dosage for your daughter \nRight now I am on 25mg morning and night.\nHas her plexiform turmors shrunken at all? Her dose is 40mg, twice a day. Yes, some are shrinking. She has hundreds of tumors so the doctors focus on certain ones when they do the volumetric measurements.", "Anyone have any gastro/digestive issue?  I have acid reflux. It is been an occasional issue for years. But I take occasional medicine, it is not too bad. Yeah, I have gotten really bad stomach aches that cause bad diarrhea, my heart then races, I feel hot and sweat, sometimes I feel like I am going to pass out or get sick. I also feel weak in the legs and tingly feeling throughout my body. Once all that passes I get a bit of the chills. These only happen after dinner, like seven of the clock.\n\nI do take pantoprazole, which helps. I only get these bad stomach aches maybe one or twice a month, sometimes every other month. Where before it would happen much more often. That sounds a lot like panic attacks? It is not. Has nothing to do with a panic attack. I eat dinner, then about 20 minutes later, I get painful stomach aches and have horrible diarrhea along with everything else I mentioned I have GERD due to a hiatal hernia not sure if its related to my NF. Ah that close after dinner gotcha. Yeah, that close. I pretty sure it is related to my Neurofibromatosis and I do have tumors in my pelvis and pretty much all throughout my body and take several other medications. It might even be a time sort of release, given I can eat the same thing that upset my stomach at dinner for lunch the next day and it bother me. \n\nIt is weird, but I am happy I am not having multiple times a week, which was happening a few years ago. Gastroparesis Iyes, I have IBS-d that now has involved to include IBS-c. Fun times. Also plenty of stomach aches, reflux. And others I do not know the English words for. Does it happen every meal? Does it depends on what you eat? Or how much? No it does not happen with every meal just dinner, I can eat the same thing for lunch that I had for dinner and it does not upset my stomach. Does not matter what I eat, sometimes it bothers me and sometimes it does not. The amount of food does not seem to matter, I do not over eat or anything like that. god yes! I have gotten endoscopes done but they always find nothing. It is super annoying because I can feel something in wrong but cannot get answers. My dr thinks its ibs but he testing other things to make sure and making sure it is not related to my nf It has been suggested by my doctors that it is entirely possible that it is due to NF. But they are not sure yet on the how and why. I was diagnosed with gastroparesis  several years ago. When I did the emptying test, I still had 70% of the eggs in my stomach after 4 hours (quite severe). Was about to get the gastric pacemaker &amp; gave acupuncture a shot. Cleared it right up. No idea if it was related to my NF1, but it might be worth a try. Thanks! I was evaluated as a candidate dout a clinical trial for a gastric pacemaker but my small intestine also has slow motility. Mine is definitely related to NF 1.\n\nMuch improved now that ive stopped taking narcotic pain meds though!", "Second surgery in exactly 6 months is tomorrow. Surgery tomorrow.  My last surgery was exactly 6 months ago to the day.  This time my neurosurgeon will be going in through the side of my throat and put a little metal cage around my cervical spine for support. \n\nI do not know how many months later he is going to have to go in again from behind and take out the hardware with screws that are loose and causing me pain. \n\nStill staying positive.  I must admit I am not scared at all.  It will probably hit me when I wake up after surgery and if I am in pain with the collar on.

We might have similar issue. Hope it will go good Did they go into the front?  Did you have a hard time speaking or swallowing afterwards?  I had some people tell me they could not talk and some people say that they had to be on a liquid diet for a week or so, or at least soft foods like pudding and stuff I had from the back, its called spinal fusion surgery, because I have Scoliosis as well. So they took some bone from my hips and put in a cage so it can heal in my cervical area!! I just wanted to drop two lines and say \"best wishes\" for the surgery. \n\nIt sound super complex (and almost sci-fi) and I am always amazed by some of these surgery techniques!

Recently I was talking to my brother who just finished medical school and he said he thinks there is a chance my flexibility is linked to my NF because of (put in medical jargon I did not understand here). \n\nSo I ask you all, do you find yourself to more flexible than others?   Did he use the term hyperlaxity? And I have pretty flexible joints myself Hyperlaxity does sound familiar, I cannot say for certain, but thinking about it I remember the root word \"hype\" being used.  \n Yes. Mine have become less flexible as I get older. My daughter and my son both have hypermobility. My son also has flat feet, and the combination is taking a toll on his knees, even at 5 years of age. NF2 here, opposite problem. Always stiff, sore, and bad mobility of joints. Weird how close but how far.  This in interesting, just looking at the replies there seems to be some link to NF and good or bad joint mobility  Bad flexibility was actually how my NF2 was diagnosed.  I have hyper mobility. NF 1 I am NF 1 and I would not say I have either good nor bad flexibility. But of course everyone with NF is different.  Opposite nf1 here Well I have nf1 and i have Hypermobility in all of my joints in all  fingers, So i definitely  think flexibility have something to do with nf1.   :-)   My daughter has NF1, but we think she may also have Ehlers-Danlos hypermobility type which would explain her loose joints.", "TMI buttt it needs to be answered Does anyone else suffer from constipation and bloating? I do not know if it is related to my medication I am currently taking but I wanted to know if anyone else has similar problems. Much love to you all and I hope you all are staying safe and healthy during these times. :) xo Lots of medication can cause constipation, check the side effects and talk to your pharmacist/doctor. MiraLAX is a good over the counter option It could also be from what you are eating, lack of fiber or too much fiber, or what have you. I have issues with that but I have IBS! And I do not have NF. (My son does).  If it is a new problem and you have new meds I would definitely run it by your doctor. Absolutely. Happens when I eat too much salt or sugar in a day. Also causes my nerve pain to flair. I have IBS-D, always had. Never took medicine. It is hard to say of there is any link with NF since so many people have IBS. Take Psyllium. Pure fiber comes in capsules. 2or3 3x daily. 1000 ct btl for like 15$ on Amazon. Good stuff", "Nf1 and nosebleeds Hi, my son was born with nf1 and he often experiences nosebleed, like twice a month. I am wondering if this is a common problem with the condition that he has? Thanks for sharing \ud83d\ude4f When I was little I used to have nose bleeds at lot, they eventually stopped I would say when I around 7 or 8. I am not sure if they were related to me having Neurofibromatosis. I was diagnosed with Neurofibromatosis until I was 15, but it was always believed I had it, but any time they tried to test me before that results were always inconclusive. Nosebleeds are pretty common in many young children, especially in dry air. Hydration and humidity helps prevent them. Also, discourage nose picking (not the easiest thing to do with young kids!) I used to get them every couple days as a kid (now 29) and they would last at least 20 minutes and they varied from being heavy or light \nSome time\u2019s I got them durning the night when I was sleeping, I hated them as a kid \nI think mine stopped around 13ish \n\nI have had NF1 my entire life, my daughter is 7 and she gets one or two every few months, but as someone said above it could be cause kids like to pick their nose \nCould always speak to your GP at the next visit This might be the least helpful answer... but I have NF1, and as a kid - starting around 2nd grade - I did have pretty bad nosebleeds. They slowed down in college and are very rare now. No doctor ever tied them to NF... I also had pretty bad seasonal allergies, and nosebleeds seem to follow that cycle.\n\nThat said, it is worth a question to your doctor, especially if the nosebleeds cannot be tied to anything else (nose picking, allergies, dryness, etc). While NF1 may not specifically cause the nosebleeds, they can be a sign of other underlying problems (that can be NF relateD), so it is worth getting checked out. Doctor said I would get less nosebleeds if I kept my finger out of there. I have never experienced nosebleeds...not even in childhood..\n\ndoes he eat a pretty healthy things ? \n\nmake sure he is upping his water intake I ask about the healthy foods and water, just cause I was raised on some hippy foods and no sodas and stuff...idk I am intrigued..never heard of nf1 and nosebleeds being a thing..but would not be surprised with all the weird things this coding error causes", "The big vote is tonight Tonight Congress is voting on NF research funding. The House has voted yes to 20 million dollars being allocated to NF research. The Senate vote will be in by 12am eastern. i had no idea! can you link the source for this, i would love to read up on the decision tomorrow. maybe since they are in the christmas spirit and finally decided on that gracious $600 stimulus check they will vote yes for this! Interestingly the 20 million dollars and the new stimulus are connected by an omnibus bill. \n\nThere are basically a bunch of smaller bills (some related to each other and some seemingly random) that have all been lumped together so that they only vote once to pass several measures. \n\nMy info is coming from colleagues I have in the non-profit sector who hosted briefings to get politicians to vote yes on the NF research so I do not have many links to official new sites. I know that info will probably be posted to CTF and NF Network websites and social media after the official vote. **UPDATE** \n\nThe bill has passed the House and Senate. Now it just needs Trumps signature. oh super cool and interesting! thanks again for sharing i will have to look around today to see what was decided :) And they couldnt do this in a standalone bill because why? I agree that it should be. \n\nThe bill that passed last night was actually the 2021 federal budget. Yay", "Concerned about new, different marks on my skin I have been diagnosed with NF Type 1 since I was a toddler, but fairly recently I think some new skin patches appeared on me. They are different to the cafe-au-lait spots: they are lighter, and have a slightly different texture to the rest of my skin. Is this an NF thing or something else? Without seeing a picture It would be hard to tell. How often do you see a neurologist? I have an MRI scan every year or two, and see my NF specialist about the same frequency. My daughter would get dry looking small patches on her skin (before we knew her diagnosis of NF1). Her skin would darken and then smooth back to regular appearing skin. Later we realized that where the skin had appeared 'dry' a tumor was forming underneath. I will definitely ask my clinic about them next time I have an appointment then, better to be on the safe side. Thanks", "covid vaccine? I have NF1, and I do not know anyone else with NF, so I came here. I was wondering how others feel about receiving the covid vaccine? I have just been wondering if it could possibly negatively affect someone with NF or not. I do not know much about this and wanted to get some outside opinions ! I am going to get mine today I will give an update if I have a bad reaction Yo, I also have Nurofibomatosis and I too have concerns taking the shot based off it, among other reasons that makes me avoid the needle. I say just sit it out. If you do not know then you should avoid. There are not many of us so any article on it will just be wishy washy at this point. That is what I am planning to do. I am not antivax or anything, but I feel like there has not been enough time to really gauge how people with NF react to it I know the feel, its hard to say the reason why you will not take it sometimes and the need to say that you are not \"Anti-vaxx\"  \n\n\nAnd the side effects are enough to drive someone away. Like if a shot makes you sick, shake, and gives you shivers there must be something up. I have had both rounds and the most severe side effect was after that on the day after the second one I was extremly tired. Hi. I have NF along with my brother and dad. We all got the vaccine and are fine. I have been involved in the NF community since I was a baby and know a ton of other people with NF. So many have gotten the vaccine and are fine.. My mom and I both work for our local NF organization and have contacts with specialists who say NF should not be a risk fact in getting the vaccine or not. It should be perfectly safe for you to get. The specialists did not even think having NF would cause a bigger risk if getting Covid (unless maybe you had tumors around the lungs). If you are worried about the needle causing issues, I get pricked a lot for blood tests and have had no increase in neurofibromas or anything in my arms. I hope this helps a bit.\n\nMy mom (the only one without NF) had the worst reaction to the shot. The rest of us just had sore arms. Reactions just depend on the person honestly. Bad ones still only usually last a day or two which is great compared to actually getting Covid. NF1 and got the J&amp;J beginning of April.  No negative effects other than soreness at injection site for a few days, which is normal. I had johnson and johnson I was just tried the next day. I have NF1 and have had both rounds.  Other than a sore arm for the second and being extremely tired for both, I was fine.  There is nothing about NF1 that should prevent you from getting the vaccine.  As far as I know, we are at no more risk than someone who has not got NF1.  But I am no doctor.  \n\nConsider this, as far as being vaccinated, being vaccinated does not just provide you with protection from serious illness but it also protects everyone you come into contact with.  As with any other illness, the only way we are going to make any headway with this is to vaccinate a majority of the population whom are able to be vaccinated.  Please do not forget that there is still a huge portion of our population who cannot be vaccinated.  I strongly suggest you consult a specialist with your concerns.  Considering the possibility of severe illness and or death is a known outcome of Covid, you should know all you can in order to protect yourself.  Do not forget as well that Covid19 is leaving people with longterm health issues.  As someone who already has issues pertaining to my health because I have nf, I do not want any more issues.  I really hope you find some answers so that you can make a decision that you are comfortable with!  Good luck friend. There is a reason some people react to the shot.  That is your bodies immune system doing its job.  Its a good sign if you get mildly ill because you know that your immune system is working.  A lot of people react to vaccines in general for the same reason.  There is also evidence that suggests that people who have previously had Covid19 may have a stronger reaction to the vaccine because the antibodies already exist in their system.  Even for those people symptoms have been reportedly mild compared to the possible outcome from actually contracting covid!  A sore arm and being super tired was well worth avoiding intubation and or death, reduced lung capacity, cardiovascular damage, brain damage...etc etc. Is lost of mobility in a side of your body one of the signs that its working? There are cases where people, even as young as their early 20s, got severe stroke like reactions after taking the vaccine.   \n\n\n3000 plus people have died after taking it.  \n\n\nThe vaccine is not even FDA approved   \n\n\nAlso, our genetic condition is not something that we would want to fuck around with, have you seen what it is? We do not know how we will react to taking the shot and would rather not risk it. I asked qhen I got mine and was told theres no data showing any issues Yes, that my be true but 500k plus have died from covid.  As well, many thousands more have permanent side affects from having had covid.  So yes.  Yes, me personally, I would much rather avoid the known outcome of covid with a vaccine that is known to prevent covid.  Nf not withstanding.\n\nAnd for the record none of the three vaccines, while not fully approved, have been approved for emergency us because we are in an emergency situation.  If they had not been approved for for distribution and use then no one *could* get vaccinated.  \n\nLastly, you are giving medical advice which is at the very least disingenuous.  Not only should you not be offering medical advice to someone when you are not a doctor but you certainly should not offer medical advice that is dangerous.  Telling someone to not get vaccinated is not a good idea.  You are going to get someone killed. Telling someone to get vaxx can also be considered giving medical advice. If me telling someone not to get it is medical advice.  Also, using strong phrases such as \"You are going to get someone killed\" Can also be seen as disingenuous because you are trying to push a point.   \n\n\nI speak from a point of understanding in this case, seeing as we both share the same condition.   \n\n\nYour first response felt like it was copied and pasted and was a bit condescending honestly, as if you did not take a moment to understand where the op was coming from. I suggest you talk with your doctor. My neurologist (an NF specialist) told me there is no evidence to suggest NF would have any negative effect or interaction with any of the vaccines and encouraged me to get mine. I was vaccinated back in March because of my working situation as I have been in extremely close contact with people at work since then. Some people have some reactions to the vaccines, such as soreness, aches, and fever, which lasts a day or so. I did not have any reaction other than a bit of soreness in my arm.\n\nIt is vital, and especially important to the immunocompromised among us, that we get our vaccines. Get your shot! I did not tell anyone to get vaccinated.  I merely stated that the reason vaccines exist is to prevent illness. I absolutely understand what the OP was asking.  I offered my own anticdotal experience with the vaccine as someone with NF.  I also shared known scientific facts about getting the vaccine vs not getting it.  For anyone.  Even cancer patients are looking to be vaccinated, those of them that can be.\n\nTelling someone to not get the vaccine because some people react to it poorly, as is normal for any vaccine, is very dangerous.  Especially when we absolutely know what happens if you catch covid.  If the OP is concerned, they should speak to their NF specialist.  For myself, because I have NF, I have enough health problems.  I do not need to see any more doctors due to the side affects of covid.  \n\nCovid has also caused strokes in young people.  As well as permanent loss of taste and smell.  Brain fog.  Honeycomb lung.  Cardiovascular damage.  This is likely not an exhaustive list.  \n\nMy point is that you are far less likely to have an adverse reaction to the vaccine (once again, people react to vaccines poorly all the time) as you are to becoming seriously ill and or dying as is associated with Covid19.  Also, you are not as likely to pass the virus to someone else who may also get seriously ill and or die.  Once again, vaccines are only effective if most people have them.  That is a scientific fact as well as a medical one. The last thing you said was super important! I have NF1 and got both of my shots and had no side effects, but it is different with everyone so I am not sure... I saw your other comment stating that you had NF. I did not mean to insult by saying that you would not understand. I am just used to people talking down on myself and others on the internet.   \n\n\nHowever, I still stand by my suggestion. That Is all it is a suggestion. The reasons I used, though not all of them, are true.   \n\n\nI rather not take an unapproved and rushed vaccine.  I shared my 2 cents to the OP. Its u to the OP to decided what the OP wants to do.  \n\n\nThe OP can ignore me if the OP likes. I know I am not taking it, and I will still be here  tomorrow to high five you yesterday my friend, Peace.  \n\n\n(Yes I made a AT reference, sue me) 20M with NF1, I got my second shot of moderna about a week ago. The first shot I felt sore in the arm. The second shot I was also sore, but the next morning I had a headache and felt dehydrated. Just take Tylenol and drink plenty of water after your shots and you should be fine! How do you get involved in the NF community? I have never met someone with NF to my knowledge. Where do you live? Many places have local organizations. Not all do though. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are also many Facebook groups that you can chat with people that have NF and you may find local people with NF. One group that accepts people from all over the world is \"Faces of Neurofibromatosis\". I am from Oregon! I feel very apprehensive about it. I have tumors all throughout my body, even had cancerous ones and I take multiple medications. I also had a bad reaction to the flu shot a few years ago, where it left a discolored little bump on my left arm, right where they did the shot. On top of that I should be being placed on the Koselugo, I will find more about that on Thursday, I am not sure if there would be any reaction with that or not. Should more when I see my nf specialist.\n\nOne other thing that concerns me is my dad has a rate autoimmune condition, which he was diagnosed with about 10 years ago. He and the flu shot a couple of years ago and it caused him to have a very bad reaction to where he ended up in the hospital. He was really sick in 2019 with his autoimmune condition. Thankfully he is better now and while he did get Covid in November, he did not really get that sick. He is been informed by his doctor not to get the Covid vaccine. I guess one concern I have is that some day I may end up having the same condition that he has. I got a lot of other things from him, not Neurofibromatosis, as mine was most likely a mutation, but I got other medical conditions inherited from him, so I guess I feel that the odds may be against me. \n\nEither way, I will probably discuss it on Thursday when I see my specialist and go from there. It is good to hear someone else has concerns too with the vaccine. I am not concerned about the day-after effects like feeling tired or anything. The long-term is what I am most curious and concerned about. I am feeling iffy about the whole thing, but I have not consulted my specialist about it yet. Anyways, I hope you can find out what you need! Long term in my biggest concern. I am not concerned about feeling tired and normal stuff like that, I am concerned about down the road, a few months and years from now. Thanks! I still have a lot of confusion over the vaccine, since there is so many sources saying so many different things it is hard to know what is right aha. But I trust the science, I am just wanting a little more info to see if there is any possible long term effects. Yup, that is how I feel too. It does not help me much when people are just telling me to \u201cget my shot\u201d when there is no way to know how it will affect NF patients long term :p I have NF1 &amp; fully vaccinated with no side effects at all. Both were AstraZeneca. I know. In understand the need to want to get a shot out, but there is no data on the long term effects, especially on people with certain medical conditions. I would really like to see data results on that. I got pfizer and has absolutely no symptoms for both of the doses and did not notice any negative changes in my NF I had them both. Only a sore arm for both. NF should not negatively affect your response. Any side effects will from the vaccine alone. I drank a lot of water before my second shot and some after. Had some POWERADE afterwards as well. Had a bottle of Pure Leaf green tea, which I hear can be helpful. These helped me stay side effect free. There is supposed to be a NF Northwest but it seems like they never really got started. They have no website or Facebook, but are listed on the NF Network site. NF Network or Children's Tumor Foundation may host events in your area. Otherwise, I would suggest you join the group Faces of Neurofibromatosis on Facebook (if you are on Facebook). You have to post a short intro but can find a ton of people in your area and from all over that may want to chat or even meet up. I wanted the shot so bad I asked my doctor hoping one of my conditions (nf and something else) would qualify me to get it early. Nope! I was told I was exactly like the rest of the population as far as the virus and vaccination goes, both in terms of my susceptibility to covid and my response to the virus. \n\nGot my second shot almost two weeks ago, looking forward to being fully vaccinated! I also have NF1 and I have had worries about getting the vaccine because of having NF1. If I did not have it, I would have gotten the vaccine right as it was offered to the public. I have only one tumor form the condition, but I do not know if a new vaccine can cause any further problems. I have had other vaccines in the past, which never caused any problems with me, but with the covid shot being new, I just do not know.  RemindMe! eoy There is a 22 hour delay fetching comments.\n\nI will be messaging you in 7 months on ( to remind you of (\n\n( to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.\n\n^(Parent commenter can ) (\n\n*****\n\n|(\n|-|-|-|-| I know this is old so apologies for jumping in. I also have NF 1 and worry about long term impact the vaccine could have on NF.  My doctor agrees with me as he stated that there is no longitudinal data, so we do not know of this would cause issues down the road (though the same could be said for those without NF...but having NF, Hashimoto\u2019s, and lynch syndrome makes me hesitant to get it since I have enough issues as is).  He also said that when I had COVID before the vaccine came out, I was so mild that he is not concerned and I am unlikely to get it (and spread it) again.  Based on my doc\u2019s advice, I am waiting for more data.  I want to know other perspectives as well since all I have seen are comments focusing on short term reactions.  I do not care about a sore arm and feeling sick for a couple of days. I am worried about long term impact since these are the first mRNA vaccines and trials on humans are not that old.", "Tinnitus Hi NF1 Team,\n\nInteresting question I have for you:\n For any of you that have tinnitus, and have NOT  had any surgery... \nIf you shake your head, does the sound change?\nNo pain.  Just like dog...it feels pretty good...\ud83d\ude01... Shaking your head..\n\n   I get a very harmonic sound in my ears or hearing.\n\nI just do not want to go in to another appointment for some more ridiculous problem that is no problem.\n    I have gone in and had my ears looked at no problem.\n\n I just have not talked to any one on my care team about this interesting finding... Thanks.. I do have Tinnitus, and ha! I have always tried to explain this feeling and sound, and yeah! It does.

I am 27 and am currently going through the diagnosis stages because of a neurofibroma found on my scalp. I am supposed to get a brain MRI in the next few weeks.\n\nLately i have noticed one of my eyes has slightly worse vision than the other eye, and feels weird and my eyelid keeps twitching.\n\nI am obviously concerned about a brain/optic nerve tumor. However, 3 years ago I had an MRI due to unexplained pain and it came back clear other than a small white matter lesion that my neurologist did not think was anything.\n\nCould an optic nerve tumor have developed in the last few years? Most of the things I read seem to indicate it happens when you are younger. \n\nCurious of your guys' thoughts on the chances of optic nerve tumors later in life. The chances are small but not inpossible, go to a ophthalmologist Would a ophthalmologist notice something? I wear glasses and have gone every year for the last 5 years or so. I have not gone for about 18 months, but they always said my eyes looked healthy. The last time i went they tool pictures of my eye. They were able to see my nerve was normal. So i assume that you would also see if something is growing. Also they tested my eye maybe your eye sight just is worse and you need stronger glasses. I could not drive afterwords cause they use eye drops. So if they take picture. Make sure you have a driver or go with public transport I have worse vision in one eye. My ophthalmologist says it is not NF related. An MRI a few years ago was all clear. A optometrist says it is astigmatism. Go to the eye doctor. It is very common for prescriptions to change in your 20s. Most likely yes they would notice something if something is going on. In fact when I was born, I was born with a lazy right eye, so I saw eye doctor very early in life and it was the eye doctor who first told my parents that I might have Neurofibromatosis. It would not be until years later that it was confirmed though. Yes. Obviously tell them your full medical history, and say you are concerned that you might have an optic glioma. At that initial visit, the doctor might ask you to get an MRI scan of your orbits. Prescription changes are normal from what I understand. I would definitely get it checked out by an opthalmologist! It is always concerning to have vision problems. It could be an array of things (refractive error, dry eyes, eyelid twitch--from blepharitis, eyelid strain, etc). It is also normal to have eyes with slightly different refractive errors. \n\nIt is quite rare for OPG (optic gliomas) to lead to vision problems after the of 18. My neuro-ophthalmologist released me from his care recently because stability//vision loss does not occur in the adult population. Yes, go to an OPTHAMOLOGIST and tell her directly that you have NF. \nYour vision may just be changing and it has nothing to do with NF. I have a more bad eye vision in my right eye. It has gone from 120% to 80% in a year. I heard this two weeks ago but they do not know what the reason is so they will check me in 6 weeks again to see if there is difference. My right eyes does not see blurry but it feels like it needs to work very hard and the vision is less but the MRI looked good but maybe they want another MRI-scan I had something similar, they thought I had optic neuritis. I was given steroids and my vision returned to normal. Really? Do you remember what kind of Steroids? And were they oral or like an IV or eye drops? I had IV steroids. Some neurologist wanted me to do that and was convinced that it would help me if I had 3 days of IV Steroids. I asked another neurologist and he told me that the first one was wrong so I ghosted him. \n\nDid the Steroids work immediately? They did, this was about 10 years ago. Did it a actually help you? Any side effects? My First Neurologist said that it would help reverse Optic Neuritis and that it would get rid of the Visual Snow They did help me. Since it was 10 years ago it is hard to remember all the side affects but nothing significant. I think I was sore/groggy. I think there is conflicting information out there but they helped me and I have not had any vision issues since.\n\nMy current Ophthalmologists who specializes in NF shared how there was a mass study with people where many people over the past ten years. In the study, it shared that many people who were diagnosed with optic-neuritis were actually miss-diagnosed. So it could be a both and with your two providers. I experienced positive results but that many not be the case for everyone. :)", "NF1 + Transgender....I basically won the lottery.... 26 years old, I was born with NF1, first in the family.

Does anyone have any info if infused lotions can help stop/shrink skin lesions ?  I have never heard that and I see a specialist regularly. There is however a drug that was approved by the fda that does show to shirk tumors. I hopefully will be on it soon, I just completed a bunch of tests, now I just need to wait for my doctor to go over all the results and get back with me. Never heard of it, if there was I would of bought a ton already... The only way is surgery.

It is a hard world to navigate but we navigate together. I do not see how or why your sexual identity is relevant to the context and your particular concern. Anyone can have NF and whether they are straight, gay, cis or trans, they will worry about being \"romantically inadequate\". I understand how you feel, I avoided dating or getting close to people purely down to my nf. I am scared that they will see the NF marks or find out about it and run.

I saw a commercial for the new show, Dr. Pimple Popper and usually I turn away because I cannot imagine anyone wants to watch that but then I heard her say neurofibromatosis and had to look! She is apparently attempting to help a lady in the newest episode with getting rid of some of the bumps. Just wanted to let anyone know who might be interested in tuning in! The TLC website says the show comes on Wednesday\u2019s at 10/9C.  Are all bumps created the same way? I guess I never thought of them being different consistency. The way they were explained to me was that tissue wraps around nerves and pooping would not really do anything. Can some bumps be popped? I actually have no idea how she is going to do it. I think the show is called Dr. pimple Popper but she works on all kinds of things. I could not tell from the commercial how she is going to operate on the lady. \n\nI cannot imagine how they could be \u201cpopped\u201d but I guess I will have to watch and see!  I cannot help but feel this will not end well.  Do not have TLC but I would like to know how this turns out.  Why not? What are your concerns? I just hope the show will not depict us in a unkind light.  I will let you know!  Doctors need to be skilled at removing these lesions. I have had dermatologists and plastic surgeons do far different quality of work. Most surgeons are just skilled butchers and hack away until whatever it is they are getting is gone. You need a skilled plastic surgeon to get rid of larger masses, especially the tumors that have the blueish appearance. They all have massive blood supplies. I had one on my head removed and the doctor almost stopped due to the severe amount of blood loss. Total size of the lesion was 1.5cm. These are not to be fucked with, much less removed for entertainment purposes.  Ooops, they died. Dr. Pimplepopper is human and deals with the aftermath... every once in a while, you have to have a sad ending in order to make the happy endings believable. ", "Dealing with NF1 and my healthy outlet. Hey everyone! \n\nI am new to the community here on Reddit. I am looking forward to getting to know each and every one of you. I am here because I have NF1. I have always been shy to talk about it and never really talked about it with anyone. Last year, I discovered a charity called Cupid's Charity that is raising funds for NF. They have made great strides in raising money for NF too! If you have not heard about this charity they do an event called Cupid's Undie Run, where people run in the event in their underwear. The point of this is people with NF cannot hide or cover up their spots or bumps. I am participating again in the 2022 run. ( How it works is that the money does not go to me (obviously) but it is through my profile through my charity. They do a fundraiser system where you win prizes based on how much money you raise. This has been such a healthy outlet for me. This charity has introduced me to some great people already. If you have not heard of this charity, I think it is a great thing to get involved with. I understand what works for me may not work for others, but I thought I would share. :) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also started doing charity streams for NF1 too, but that is been hard to get off the ground lately.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been reading some of your stories and my heart goes out to each and every one of you! I will defiantly be interacting with the community more. :) This is a great charity. I know the guy that started it. Never participated in it but did a lot of fundraising for NF in the past. I have NF1.  My family raised nearly 2 million for the disease by running a golf tournament for a number of years. You are doing a great thing. Keep up the good work. Thank you OP, such an amazing thing to be involved in. Wish I had the confidence to do it \u2764\ufe0f Haha, thank you. I am so excited to do it. However, rasing funds has been quite hard for me. Seems like some of my friends do not want to donate to me. I get it hard times right now due to covid. I guess I am just stuck trying to figure out how to get funds. Any advice? That is amazing! How did they raise so much? I am having trouble raising money right now. Are you working at the moment ? The message board at work if you are , promoting here is a good place to start too \ud83d\ude42\nThink you are right though for a lot of people times are tough. Does justgiving work for this kind of thing? We had people from across the country participate. We had celebrities and sponsors along with other participants from everywhere. We had a bunch of raffle and auction items that helped raise good money. \n\nThere are infinite ways to raise money. You and your team members can do some sort of event to raise money. If you have a hobby, you can create an event out of that. Does not have to be big. It can just be you doing something like waking or running a 5k and have people donate/pledge to you. You can simply do this by going around the block or walking trails. It is much easier to raise money if you are running an event rather than just asking. You can also put in a small donation yourself and ask for matches. This strategy has worked for people in the past. If you and your team members donate $25 each and get 10 people to match you, you will raise $1,925.\n\nNo matter what you do, make sure you plan for it so it can be a success. Do not promote it too much because it can seem to some people that you are being pushy. Fundraising can be tough but if you think outside the box, you will be amazed at what you can accomplish.", "Nf and speech problems Does anyone else struggle with their speech/communication? What are some ways you have overcome it or things that can help improve it? Work in a call center,  I had the tendency to always speak really fast, jumble words..  \n\nThis has helped me with controlling my speech  since I speak all day, and there is no anxiety with this for me since we are not face to face ...\n\nNow for communication (face to face) I still have issues with that due to anxiety      weed helps ( I do not take much I typically take one 10mg edible break it to 4 pieces ) 2.5 mg day this way I also do not get the high effect ..\n\n(Note I am only saying that due to fact that anxiety medicine  has caused me to have seizures and anger issues) NF1 or 2? (or other?)\n\nI recently learned that NF2 is classified as a communication disorder meaning it affects all parts of communication, including hearing (we knew this) and speech (this was new, to me at least). For about 3 years I have been dealing with vocal cord paralysis that nobody seems to understand or be able to help. I have done speech therapy to no avail and I am currently on Bevacizumab that also seems not to make any positive changes. (Also: deaf since age 10 on the left side, gradual losses on the right, currently over 90dB loss on my \"good\" sde). So now, I both cannot hear and cannot speak. I mean, thank god I know ASL and I am a native signer. I dunno how I could have finished my PhD without that language skill. Maybe I will try microdosing. I get high to easily so I never do it when I need to be out and about. But I have the same issue my words just get jumbled up alot and articulation is another thing I need to focus on. I have NF 1 and have a hard time expressing my thoughts. I also have a very hard time in interviews due to anxiety and Nervousness I used to have speech problems when I was a kid, but my parents did put me in speech class for it. I do speak differently, and have my own weird accent, but nothing major. For those familiar with me, they understand it, but sometimes I do have a tendency to speak fast and jumble words. \n\nI will say that when I am having a bad flair of my fibromyalgia my speaking gets worse, like my brain is not correlating what I am reading with my mouth. I just try to take those days easy in terms of talking. I speak slurred and fast. I have my own weird accent too! I speak fast and jumble words and mispronounce words. Growing up I seem to recall having problems communicating. Worked in a call centre, talking to random strangers every day then things got better from there. So my suggestions are practice more and care less about what other ppl thinks. :)\n\nMy two kids have speech delays. Seems to be worse than mine ..trying to figure out a way for them to improve :) Speech has always been difficult for me especially with NF. Since mine is on my face it is hard for some people to understand what I am saying. The best advice I could give you is to not rush what you are saying and do not get mad at yourself if people ask you to repeat what you said. This is probably why foreign languages and I do not mix \ud83d\ude39 I would be interested to know what your accent is like...I literally say different words in different accents....some come out southern, others British, New York, Canadian/Newfie it is weird YES! what the hell is with that????\n\nlike I get that my anxiety causes my to mess up words...\n\nbut sometimes its more than that, it sometimes feels like my tongue does not work properly..\n\nwhat makes it more alarming is I feel like its just been becoming more common and worse after turning 25 (28 now).. idk.\n\nthis is a bizarre condition we have.\n\nas always, my NF1 peeps...I hope your body is being kind to you, I hope the mental troubles do not feel like too much. \n\nabove all. I hope today is being kind to you. Yeah I suck at other languages too. I have been told I sound like a Brooklyn accent, or Spanish accent but never been to been to Brooklyn and do not know Spanish.  But I have been told other but cant remember what ones.\n\nEdit: I am Canadian btw, from Ontario. I did when I was younger I spoke fast do I had speech therapy. Depending on what the issues are you might be able to get speech therapy. Talk to your PCP and see if a referral can be made to get an evaluation. If you are still school age (preK\u201412) and in the US, you may also be eligible for an IEP. You (or your guardian if you are under 18) can request an evaluation through the school district. Good luck! Yep people tell me I am from NY...and I live in the Midwest. I still have problems with words as an adult. It is never going away, just cannot sound out words. I just give up and know it is not me, and I try not to be hard on myself. Yep I have a speech problem I do not know if I have a speech problem but sometimes I talk to fast and also, this is what they say in my country, I speak inside my mouth so when I speak some words you cannot hear. I had it when I was younger and then it was gone for a few years but now I get it back and what helped was that I am already aware of the fact I am speaking not clearly enough and my mom helps me too by saying it. She does understand me tho but some people do not and I understand that.   \n(Btw I am 20 years old) sometimes i talk really slow and other times I feel myself stuttering but friends and family do not notice they tell me. When I am trying to communicate a lot of information or thoughts I tend to skips words in the sentences. I also hate my voice so I am sure that does not help.", "Vaccine Anyone had their vaccine yet? Us lot are among the first whom were receiving it. Which one did you have and how were you afterwards? I have had the Astra Zeneca today and feel fine! I just got Moderna yesterday. I got it through my teaching, though, not my NF. My arm is incredibly sore, it hurts to lift it, and I am still groggy.  Very happy to have gotten it, though. I am due to get it tomorrow. Not sure which one. I will be happy with any if it is going to provide me with protection When you get the second, be sure to move your arm around a lot. Will do - thanks! I have had first dose of Moderna. My arm was sore that night and part of next day. Felt \u201con the verge of sick\u201d the second day. That feeling when you think you will be sick the next day. Took some ibuprofen and drank a hot toddy (not together) Felt better the third day. \nEdited for clarity. That is what someone told me and I think it helped. Maybe do the chicken dance in your living room or something? I am holding off. I might consider the Johnson and Johnson one, but until I see more research on it I want to wait it out. I have had bad reaction to the flu shot in the past, where it left a bump and never healed. \n\nI would recommend anyone with concerns to do what they feel is best for them and speak with their dotor I have had both doses of the Moderna, and I have been doing fine! I did have to take a day off work for the second dose because it made me so fatigued. I figured that whatever side effect I get is better than getting Covid-19! My mother got both of hers done not too long ago (She also has NF). I am not able to get it because my doctor does not recommend me getting it while I am going thru cancer treatment. I did not even think about NF allowing me to get the vaccine. That would be great. But at the same time I have a pretty mild case.  Other than some tumors that are more annoy to look at than any real concern and a yearly check up I am considered pretty healthy. I think I will hold off until it becomes more widely available and let people who need it more then me get it. I had my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine one week ago. My arm was sore for three days and I felt mildly sick for about 24 hours. I did not need to take time off from my part-time job, though I was not my most productive during that period. It was no worse than a few of the more noticeable flu shot reactions I have had. I am prepared for a bit more from the second shot based on what most people seem to experience.\n\nI am so grateful to be getting my vaccine. I will still be masking and isolating as much as I can. I am not afraid of dying from COVID - if it happens it happens (I do not intend to dismiss those who have died or lost loved ones - that is just how I personally feel). What terrifies me is long COVID. I have so many chronic illnesses already and barely keep my head above water; another one would be devastating.\n\nUnless your doctor advises against it for you specifically, the risk from any of the available vaccines is far less than the risk of COVID. Get the vaccine if you are lucky enough to be able to! My doctor told me it was not a risk factor so I am at the back of the line with the other non-obese middle aged people. Not complaining though, I am legitimately not facing much risk. The NHS recognises it as a neurological condition combined with asthma. Weight and fitness bared no relevance As in, you either have neurofibromatosis and asthma combined and suffer from these or do not have a combination of neurofibromatosis and asthma. Then again, you are in the USA where 4/5 people are morbidly obese which i guess makes you part of a minority with a generic illness. Maybe God just hates everyone else  (joke) I got the first dose of the Moderna. I do have other issues and the shot made me feel like crap for a few days. \n\nSecond dose is going to be great lmao. Wait what?\n\nI have not been told any of this, I am still waiting for the rest of the under 30s to get theirs  I felt fine at first, today I feel incredibly under the weather. Sore and tight muscle cramps, a very painful sore neck, intense headache, nausea, fatigue and so on. This is considered normal though and strangely the men are worse with the side effects than women are. I am already on strong medication and this pain was very noticeable even with my full dose of morphine If offered it, I personally would advice taking it. Many are not so lucky to be in a position to dictate when they have it That is you, but I take several medication including ones that have been mentioned to reduce the effects of the vaccine, I have had cancerous tumors and have a family history of bad reactions towards the flu vaccine, which include myself, my sister and our father. I am not comfortable with not knowing how this vaccine would react, which i why I am holding off and see how others react to the vaccine. Maybe down the line I will, but until then it is my decision. I have also have and had many serious tumours which cause a great deal of pain. It is also not only for oneself but the general public and others. Groups of incredibly intelligent, bright and forward thinking people have made this possible. I think you are being selfish but if you are cool with being a host and possibly passing it on to someone whom might die then crack on You do understand that not everyone is able to have the vaccine, due to allergies and other medical related conditions. Even my dad who has a serious condition, his own doctor and himself are in agreement that he is not getting the vaccine. And as I said I am waiting until more information come out, because I have genuine concerns about how the vaccine could effect me, especially because of how I know the flu vaccine effects me and my family. This vaccine was fast tracked, most vaccines take decades. I want more information. It is fine for you to do what you want, but understand that other people just are not able to. Fast tracked as it had every scientist,immunologist, researcher etc working on it. This is not like the flu vaccine. I did not want the vaccine either but did my bit for everyone else. Flu vaccines take years as they have mutation aspects and literally take years due to their nature. This is not the same. I was talking about other vaccines how they take decades, not the flu shot which seem to change every year. Either way it does not change the fact that not everyone is able to get this vaccine, the flu shot or other vaccines. Those who are able to should, but those who are unable to for allergies, medications they take or have medical conditions that have bad reactions should not be ridiculed for it. My dad for instance had a horrible reaction a few years ago to the flu shot, where he ended up in the hospital, it took months for him to recover. The last flu shot I had left a bump on my arm and years later that bump has never gone away. There are other people with their own stories about why they cannot have certain shots and their doctors would agree. I am 33 and had the Pfizer vaccination 10 days ago.(on a Saturday at 5pm) within three hours I felt like I had come down with mild flu like symptoms. I do not really remember the next 36 hours. I was vomiting shivering sweating aching headache and crying. On the Monday morning I woke up drenched in sweat I had a shower and had a nap, woke up 1.5 hours later and I was 100% better. I have heard that the second dose is suppose to have slightly worse side affects so I am worried about how I am going to react to that. But I am super grateful that I was offered it. so I am going to choose to just be appreciative and content :)\n\ngood luck to everyone else who is waiting for theirs At first I was perfectly fine and was only early this morning I took a turn. Aches all over and muscle cramps are the worst. I was under the impression the second would be less severe as your body had already had it introduced No I have not. To be honest I am scared to get the covid vaccine because how it will work with NF. NF will not make any difference to your vaccine side effects", "An update Not sure if anyone remembers but a while ago I posted asking for advice on how and when to tell a partner about having NF\n\nWell I waited until I felt the time was right (after we met in person and spent a couple of lovely days together exploring nice places and getting dinner together) And then told him through text when I got home. I was very scared and my hands were actually shaking a bit as I wrote the message lol. But he said it did not matter to him and that it did not change the way he felt about me. He said will be there to support me through whatever this condition throws at me and asked me to be his girlfriend.\n\nI am just so happy and wanted to share because I was so so worried about telling him and terrified of rejection\n\nThank you to everyone who gave me advice on my original post :) Congrats!  That is so nice I am happy he is accepting you have nf , and congrats  :-)  Aw that is wonderful \ud83d\udc97I am\nScared to tell others also.", "Treating neurofibromatosis in Japan. Hi,\nI moved to Japan earlier this year. And was wondering if anyone had experience treating NF in Japan? Thank you!", "NF1 and Pregnancy Anyone have any thoughts to share on having kids? I have NF1, and have always planned on having children, but I would hate for them to go through the same things I go through, and would feel responsible if they are in pain because of it.

Thank you.", "Struggling I have never used this before and have only made this account purely to get this off my chest. \n\nI am a 21 year old (22 in a couple of weeks) woman with nf1, so far I have been affected *somewhat* mildly (freckling, cafs, lich noudles and a couple of small visible bumps) never had any pain or surgeries like a lot of others seem to have had. I am one of the mutant ones, no other family members have it. \n\nbut God am I depressed at thought of the future. The ONLY thing I wanted in life was to get married and have children, but that cannot happen. How does everyone else cope with the prospect of remaining alone and likely deformed? I have never had a boyfriend or been intimate with anyone. I have been speaking with someone over the internet for about 8 months and I think he has started to develop feelings for me (could be wrong, but he talks to me differently now, not so much flirting just more personally I guess and he has told me private things too) and sometimes I want to disappear from the internet because I feel bad talking to him, he does not know I have anything wrong with me and I know his opinion would change on me if he did, even if it did not and he were able to look past it I would feel too guilty. \n\nI am so sorry if this came across as some sort of self pity party, that was not my intentions i assure you. Just needed to get it out, could have worded it and probably missed out a bunch of stuff I wanted to say but my brain is failing me rn! Hi There! \n\nI have never had any problem with dating and NF. I let them know right away and everyone has been accepting of it. I never worried about being alone because of it. \n\nI ended up meeting a wonderful man who married me because of who I am, fibromas and all. Of course he will jokingly call my Dobby as one of my fibromas is under my chin.  Hi! Thanks for the reply\n\nI think its great you found a man who was accepting. I cannot imagine myself being so lucky, feelings of worthlessness is something that hounds me every day. This curse of nf has made me feel subhuman in many ways so I have not tried to find a partner. That is why I am feeling guilty about talking to the man I mentioned in my original post, I think he likes me and it was not my intention for that to happen (as I planned to stay single for life, as tough as that may be) \n You have no reason to feel subhuman. Believe me, I have felt that way for the majority of my life. Sometimes I look in the mirror and I feel hideous. I have some fibroma pimples on my face and they are all over my torso. It makes me feel like a mess. I wonder why my husband even wants to be with someone who is not perfect. \n\nHow I always looked at it was that I would not go out of my way to look for someone to date. I am a mess even outside of my NF....I am 26 and have already had to have carpal tunnel surgery, hemorrhoids removed, and have arthritis in my back, jaw, and knees. Yet, for all of my problems, here he is. \n\nDo not ever feel like you are subhuman, you are not. I am not sure how bad your NF is, but there are always people out there with something worse, and they still have someone. If you feel like things could happen with this guy, take a chance. Be honest with him, but do not feel guilty over talking to him.....if he is a good person he will love you regardless, and if he does not, you do not need him in your life anyways......that was how I always looked at it. Thank you for your words. \n\nMy case is not terribly bad right now lots of freckles, quite a few cafs, and some small bumps (which appear to be under the skin, one on wrist and a some on lower back) other than headaches I am not in any pain, never had any surgeries so I guess I should be thankful that so far I have not suffered too much. It is just sometimes hard to accept this is my reality. Hopefully yours is not treating you too badly! I am female and will be 23 in early April. PM me if you would like to chat about body issues related to NF, or NF in general. I swear I have submitted a nearly identical post on this subreddit a year or so ago, my post history proves it!\n\nI have had similar anxieties and worries. I still do at times...BUT...I proved them wrong and found/have a boyfriend who loves me for who I am. He makes me feel like a goddess and has never seen my NF as an issue. I promise you are NOT an exception to this. You are valuable and worthy of love.\n\nLASTLY! And I struggle with this too -- having NF does NOT mean ending up \"deformed\" is inevitable. The worst case scenario you have in your head will not serve you in any way, shape, or form right now. Do not live today as if that is already your reality, or is confirmed to be. Even if the worst case scenario is your future reality, it will not happen overnight. I know it is scary and I know it is hard. NF can suck, but there is hope. There is always hope, we need to hold on to that.\n\nHere is a good quote I highlighted this last quarter in a required reading. It fits. Take care of yourself, okay? Please do not let NF dehumanize you, NOTHING should have that power over you. \n\n\u201cI did not tell you that it would be okay, because I have never believed it would be okay. What I told you is what your grandparents tried to tell me: that this is your country, that this is your world, that this is your body, and you must find some way to live within the all of it.\u201d \n\u2015 Ta-Nehisi Coates, Between the World and Me Thank you so much! The replies have made me feel a lot better, honestly. \n\nI have had a bad day which is why my posts have came across so negative, I usually try not to let NF get the better of me, of course it is always a worry though. \n\nI will have to remind myself to stop reading about the worst cases, it certainly does not help. \n\nThanks again, I appreciate the words of support!  Eh, I am about the same as you spot/fibroma wise. I have one on my palm/wrist and a lot on my back....I detest even looking at my back because of it.....Before my husband and I decided to get married I told him to look at my back because it may change his mind. He thought I was crazy. \n\nI had a tumour on my brain back in 2002 that I had surgery one with gamma knife one year later.....as soon as I get my health insurance from my new job I am getting an MRI to make sure that there are no more on my brain or spine. So I always have the fear of getting another in the back of my mind.  You can also find a support group. I have been looking for one for a long time just because I have always wanted to meet people who have it as well....Dependent on where you live there may be one close, or there may even be a walk....I am going to do the Orlando NF Walk in May and there is a meet up in October/November.  This may be long, but I hope it can help..\n\nI am 34 and I felt like you did for a very long time. I struggled through most of my 20s feeling inferior and like how no one could possibly love me. I had relationships with guys who were totally wrong for me....because I thought \"hey, I am lucky to get anyone\". So I accepted the poor treatment. \n\nLike you, my NF is not a bad as some other cases, however it can be so hard feeling different and just wanting to feel normal. I have wished so many times to not have bumps and spots, and to not feel cursed.\n\nThe difference finally came when I stopped focusing on what I hate about myself, and worked on being the best version of myself that I coule be. Focus on your hobbies, family, friends, school, work, your favorite tv shows, exercise, etc, or whatever it is that makes you happy and feel better. It is an everyday process, and it is not an instantaneous thing. I know it is hard, and everyday is a struggle.\n\nI have now been dating my boyfriend for two and half years. He is the first guy I have ever felt totally comfortable being myself around. My only regret is that I spent so much time feeling so insecure over something I cannot change.  I hate to talk like an old person, but trust me, the time will go so fast. \n It is comforting to know people have found love. \n\nI think the thing that bothers me the most about this horrible condition is that it is hereditary, if it were not I do not think I would be nearly as bothered by it as I am, if you know what I mean. I long for my own children, to experience being pregnant and giving birth, it hurts me immensely to know that it will not happen. I know I should accept it and find other things that make life worth living. \n\nSorry for this sounding like a sob story, I have kept all of my feelings to myself for so long all my worries just seem to be spilling out.  I have never considered a support group before, I guess because I have been in denial of having NF. It is something I will think about! I have never considered a support group before, I guess because I have been in denial of having NF. It is something I will think about! I have never considered a support group before, I guess because I have been in denial of having NF. It is something I will think about! I have never considered a support group before, I guess because I have been in denial of having NF. It is something I will think about! Sorry do not know why the reply decided to post multiple times.  There is someone out there that will completely fall head over heals in love with you. They will love you more than you could ever imagine. I have been where you are many times, and still feel that way sometimes. It took my soon to be husband many years to show me that my worth was much more than I ever thought. I have been through head surgeries, stomach surgeries, testing, infusion treatment, doctors at least once a month, which is always an hour or more away. I cannot hold a full time job, and he has never once complained about it. He works 55+ hours a week with no complaints, I do not force him to. Since he is been 16 he has supported him and I with a full time and even graduated high school while doing so.  I must say the replies I have received have given me more hope for the future. Thank you for that! \n\nIt sounds like you have found yourself a wonderful man!\n\nSorry to hear about all the surgeries you have had to endure, I guess I should consider myself lucky that I have not had to go through that. All the best and good luck with your wedding! I feel the same exact way! I cannot deal with this anymore  You can always adopt kids. There are a ton of kids out there who are in need of a loving home.\n\nI also may be one of the mutant one, niether of my parents have neurofibromatosis and none of my three younger siblings do either. It is possible that a distant relative on either side of my family may of had it but no one know for sure. I have two cousins on my moms side and two aunts, but none of them have it. And then on my dads side I have two aunts, an uncle, and six cousins and then four of my cousins have kids and together they have nine kids and none of them have neurofibromatosis. \n\nI have three surgeries regarding my Neurofibromatosis. The first one was in high school in 2001, then in 2007, another in 2014 and I will likely be having one in the next month of so. The one in 2014 was a cancerous tumor, a high grade, this next one is a low grade cancerous tumor. I get pain all throughout my body, I have balance issues now and some weakness in arms and legs.\n\nIt is no fun, but I do the best I can.  Hello there. I am a 31 year old male with NF1 and it haunts me everyday as well, I am a negative person though. I have found someone who loves me for me, weather I have lumps or not. I have a beautiful daughter who has NF1 as well. I want to tell you that you will find someone who loves you I am sure of it. I am afraid of these lumps growing and multiplying over time and it is scary. But I want to say that we all need to stay positive in this battle with NF1. I never thought I could actually talk to someone else with NF1 as it is such a rare disease. I do not personally know anyone else with it except my daughter. Keep your head up. :)  Hi! It is very nice to hear you have a family of your own. I hope this is not too personal of a question or come off as rude, but did you plan to have your daughter? I would love to have biological children more than anything but I am incredibly scared that they would inherit it. \n\nI do not know anyone in real life with this condition either, however it is not actually that rare, 1 in every 3000 births I believe, so perhaps one of the more common rare diseases? Very possible you have walked past someone who has it without realising. \n\nAnd thank you, I do try! All the best to you and your daughter.  Adoption is something I have thought about a lot! I am not sure how realistic it would be for me personally, but it is something to consider in the future. \n\nIn regards to nf (as far as I am aware) it can NOT skip generations, you either inherit it from a parent or it was caused by a mutation. \n\nSorry to hear about your surgeries, hopefully there will not be many more in the future.  Thank you Hi there. My daughter was planned yes, and there is a 50% chance any child born from a parent with NF will have NF. I am happily married (not with the mother if my child) she abandoned her daughter when she was 2 years old. That is when I found the love of my life. Which she has accepted my daughter to be her own. If you do plan on having children do not let NF stop you because if you think about it. Your child can grow up to cure NF. (At least that is how I look at it.) good luck with it all. :) I can also add dating is not a problem, even with my CAL spots the men and women I have been with do not seem to care but I also am extremely confident with my body despite the raises of the internal tumors, which does attract a lot of people, as far as children go... IVF and a surrogate is a possibility if you do not want to adopt even though apparently it is not supposed to happen my tumors are around my uterus, and a lot are in my \"trunk\". being \"deformed\" means little. a friend has facial tumors, her partner looks like a German male model, he is an amazing man people always want to get with her for relationships. dating, love but again she is eloquent in her actions and radiates joy and confidence. which just attracts people. with an ex, I thought his option of me would change,  he just became softer and was afraid he would hurt me and he would just take time off to talk to me during my infusions (for pain). you would be surprised about the kindness in most peoples hearts. Tbh dating or multiple relationships is not something I am interested in personally. For me it is either marriage or stay single and find something else to devote my life to. Which I think is why I find the prospect of the future so scary, finding a life partner is probably harder when you have a progressive condition and an uncertain future. \n\nIVF or surrogacy is out of the question on moral grounds. Staying childless and single or getting married and risking the 50% chance of passing it down (really not something I want to do) are personally the only options I have. For me, as hard as it is I will probably stay single, unless I can find a man who can completely overlook it and accept his children may inherit it. \n\nBut yes, you are right, most people do have kindness in their hearts.  ... IVF is to prevent it. at the NF conference, we talked about this as a means to keep the children from getting the disorder you can detect NF in the egg. using a surrogate is so your disorder will not get worse during pregnancy. passing it down means little as I am the only person in 4 known generations with the disorder. I am single as I do not have interest in short-term relationships as they are boring to me now, I did them because I wanted to experience such things, gain my confidence and learn the ins and outs of loving and love, and I did.. Finding a partner really is not difficult, everyone I know with NF is married or in a long-term relationship, and the people who are single like me just are not interested at the moment. you have a person who is interested in you but it seems you have a self-fulfilling prophecy of what he will think about you without even giving him the opportunity to decide for himself. he may be okay with it, he may not, if not, you can still find someone who is as you are young and he is one person out of millions. and if he does like you- your assumptions about what others feel and think will cause issues later on in life, the lack of confidence could quite possibly make thing very hard, but take that with a grain of salt as every person is different, I can only speak on what I have seen or experienced. and even though you want a long-term relationship; you still have no ability to tell the future you may enter something with the intent of it lasting forever but it just does not turn out that way that is why breakups happen, that is why divorce happens. If you enter something and you expect it to be ONE way I can promise you if disappointment comes it will come down hard, this black and white way of thinking is not healthy. and my final point I must say: it has nothing to do with having a pre-existing condition AT ALL, in fact, the people I have met who are with a person with some disability their relationships seem to be far stronger because they need to create a different form of intimacy, they have to go through battles that able-bodied people just do not experience. so I will say to you what I say to other with mental, and physical disabilities. you may be \"broken\" but those cracks are filled with gold. I am aware of PGD IVF as a doctor has discussed it with me. I however would not consider this as I do not agree with artificial insemination nor do I agree that the defective embryos should be destroyed. But that is just my beliefs no point going into it. \n\nI am also aware that I have obvious confidence problems, I have always had them. I am naturally a pessimistic person on top of that which multiplies problems, it is just a personality flaw. \n\nI will tell him when I feel the time is right, he deserves to know so he can decide if he wants to carry on talking with me. I guess I will just see what happens and go from there. And if we are being honest I have a lot of issues I should work on before getting into any form of relationship anyway.  Okay... the pessimism comment... I will give you a story. I do remember being somewhat pessimistic for my future there were multiple reasons why. 5 of my friends with NF, theirs turned to Cancer and they died, ages 11-35 so I did not expect to have one (a future). but the chemotherapy worked, (that is why I mentioned IVF chemo destroys your eggs so mine are... defective. I am sure one or 2 may still be viable but I doubt it, as do my doctors- so a lot will be \"destroyed\" in the grand search viable eggs as they already are) I had tumor left my right leg that rendered it 50% smaller than my left so I would drag it and soon I was bound to a wheelchair but after a successful operation (it was the 6th out of 7) and months in a physical rehab center I regained my ability to walk. I also Had a tumor pressing against my aortic artery so I could not stress my heart, and a massive one mear my stomach so I would vomit a lot but the chemo took care of that. I was not only able to eat but work out so I was able to become a size 4 from a size 0. so yes. I do understand pessimism I was in the quite litearal sense a mess. when you know 13 year old Kids getting bullied because of their NF you really hate people, when you have 6 year old asking to had behind you because they are afraid of what people will do to them you do not see the light.whne you have a friend who is raped because \"the wanted someone like her to have a chance\" and they will \"attack the monster\" with things from pens to bricks you really developed pessimism.I was extremely pessimistic but, I do not believe it is a personality flaw it is a habit gained as a result of your life experiences. that is my own personal view. I wish you the best though. That Is wonderful you found a partner. I have not been as lucky. How did you get your confidence? How did you get so confident? I feel ugly around other women. I am not going to lie, I am not always confident about it.....I look at my body and I think 'eww, why would anybody want this?'. Other days I am not bothered. I have had it my entire life, so NF is all I have ever known, and I have just accepted that this is my body. I cannot change it, so I may as well just take it for what it is.  It is a daily stuggle, which i am sure you understand. I do not know if I would say it is so much confidence as much as immersing myself in other things that make me happy so i am not focusing so much on my NF. It is not easy. If you need to talk, PM me. I am sorry you are going through all of this but never give up on love. I have NF1 and it covers the right side of my face and it sucks. I am 43 now and I am married to a wonderful woman who loves me for who I am. It has taken me a long time to find love and I always told myself I would never give up.", "Has anyone been misdiagnosed with NF or something else only to find out it was NF? Trying to find an answer to multiple neurofibromas but no confirmed NF diagnosis. A few years ago when I was almost 40 I noticed a few large bumps under my skin and multiple smaller bumps. The doctor assumed it could be hives at first as they were more noticeable during extraneous exercise or during heat exposure. Later a few of the larger ones were removed and tested and came back as fibromas. The doctors suggested that it was likely NF1 and I was sent to a neurologist and a geneticist. The neurologist could not find any further markers/indicators of NF aside from my ADHD and some memory issues. The geneticist could not prove it either and was further stumped by the fact that I have no fibromas below my waist. All of the growth appears to be upper torso. I do have a few caf\u00e9 au lait spots but I have got red headed genes (not a red head except for slightly red beard and have a red headed son).  Anyhow I went back to the dermatologist today for the removal of another Lima bean sized fibroma.  He is sending it off for testing. Most of my fibromas are not noticeable in certain lighting like you have got inside stores and offices. They are visible in sunlight. Especially if I get hot. Visible in the shade or more dimly natural light rooms.  Trying to figure out if what I was originally diagnosed with, the NF1, is wrong what could it be? Any clues not from a terrifying google search? Side note - the only thing I can think of that might have caused an adverse reaction is a brief period when I was going testosterone therapy at one the men\u2019s health clinics. Probably did not need it but as an active runner and OCR competitor I was tested and showed to have \u201clow available\u201d testosterone. Either way, quite odd \n\nThe only other possibility I could think of was a few summers in the 90s working on the farm. I would frequently have blue jeans and no shirt. Lots of sunshine and I spent a lot of time spraying chemicals and waving the marker flags for the crop dusters. Could it be mosaic NF1? I am not sure. I will have to mention that one. It came up so late in life and no other symptoms are prevalent that I can find. After reading a couple of the first studies I could find from St Jude\u2019s and Mayo Clinic it seems likely that could be it. I will call the doctors office tomorrow just to see if that is something they would considered Super late to this question, however, I thought I would chime in.   I have Schwannomatosis, where I only get growths on my nerve on my right leg.   \n\nThey are painful as fuck, but I did not have any of the other common symptoms of NF - no cafe AU lait spots, and no leisch nodules (spelling), etc.  \n\nI went to a few doctors before finding a proper NF specialist who was able to diagnose me.  \n\nWhile you may not have the same thing as me the best answer is try to find a true specialist in the field and get a proper checkup.", "Just found this! Hey I am 29 f living in Missouri. I have know about nf for a few years and was diagnosed about 2-3 years ago. I have had several specialists and gotten a MRI on brain, spine, neck, and from my thigh to top of knee. They found 3 tumors in each thigh and a protruding disk in my neck. I also have scolosis. I have the gene deletion as well. I am not risking having children since the gene deletion puts you at a high risk pregnancy. I am just looking for some friends around my age.

Oh thank the fucking goddess in the sky. I have to worry about my liver i just thought i was fucked What is JMML? I am on the registry. I did not realize I could not donate.  That bums me out.

How to improve writing skills? That has not been my experience. Aside from bad spelling. NF1 is associated with some learning disabilities but not NF2. I have nf type 1, I have sloppy writing skills and also was diagnosed with dyslexia when I was nine, Brain tumors can have all sorts of effects depending on where they are growing.  But there is nothing inherent to NF2 that causes issues with writing or any other mental capability. What do you mean by difficulties writing? the physical act of holding a pen/typing or the thought process?  Is is writing work for school/education or even chatting on a forum like this one? \n\nMany things affect the brain and its abilities. \n\nI remember your precedent posts and how withdrawn you son was becoming, isolating himself and spending more and more time on his devices. \n\nIsolation (even voluntary), lack of meaningful connections and interactions, can affect cognition. \n\nCould this be the reason?

I read online that about 7% of NF tumors can turn malignant. When you think about that, I feel like it is a rather high number and is scary. Question is for you, of those who either have had tumours turn malignant, or have had a family member with it. Did you have a biopsy first? Was it discovered after surgery?  What is your story if you do not mind sharing with me? The surgery I am having next month is to remove a tumor at C-6. It has grown since my last MRI, which was one year ago.  My neurosurgeon mention that there is a possibility it could be malignant, but it is something I am trying not to worry about. I have had tumors turns cancerous twice, in 2014 I had a cancerous tumors removed from my right upper leg. When they were removed and tested they found out they were a high grade cancerous tumor. I did not need a biopsy done before hand. They were able to tell from MRIs scans that it was cancerous.\n\nIn 2018, I had cancerous tumors removed from my upper right arm. I had. I had MRIs done first, but they were not able to tell if it was cancerous just by the scan. I did have to have a biopsy for this one. The results showed it was indeed cancerous, as suspected.\n\nIf you have any questions let me know. How often do you have MRIs and do you get a full body MRI?\n\nAlso what country are you in and I assume this is covered by your health insurance? I am in the United States and yes I am covered. I typically have MRI done every 1-2 years, sometimes full body scans, or just of areas that are concerns. My last MRIs were a couple months ago of my cervical spine, my doctor wanted to see how they compared to the ones from 2018. In 2007 I had tumors removed from my cervical spine and now they are growing back, so he wants to keep an eye on those. What type of tumors did you have? Schwannomas? Not sure about that, I know the cancerous ones were called Plexiform neurofibroma and peripheral nerve sheath Peripheral nerve sheath sounds like a tumor in the schwann cells - schwannoma.\n\nGlad you are doing well! Thank you For what I have been told, there is a couple of things: first is that NF can give rise to different types of tumor, which have different characteristics. As an example, i have NF2 and have schwannomas (one of which has already been partially removed and grew back) on my acoustic nerves, which i have been told are not super aggressive (i.e. not very likely to turn malignant a.k.a. cancer), so we are not super concerned with those as long as i do not begin loosing hearing at an unnatural rate. I also had a meningioma removed, and we had to act much faster with that because doctors thought that could turn malignant much faster. Actually the brain surgeon, after seeing all the RMIs thought it already had, but after the biopsy after the removal, it turned out it had not. Second thing is that determining wether a tumor is malignant or not is more of an art than hard science. Yeah, probably a biopsy is going to give you a definitive answer, but it is an invasive technique and really i have only used it for skin tumors. Mostly i used RMIs, evoked potential exams and various functional tests. I take one every 6-12 months, depending on my medical situation, if i did not live in a country with a decent public health care, i probably could not afford that without having to ask my family for money. What i have seen in my experience is that having someone experienced (not necessarily a surgeon) in NF following you with your RMIs and surgeries is going to get you the best results. Also i have the gut feeling that surgeons, especially those specialized in tumors, have a strong tendency to act as quickly as possible, while doctors specialized in NF use the strategy of keeping a close eye on the tumors by means of various exams, and then only act when it is most appropriate. I tend to favour this last approach, if i removed all my tumors when they were first spotted, i would have passed a big portion of my adult life in and out hospitals, or at home recovering. The good thing about tumors that grow around nervous tissue is that they grow slowly; but when they have to be actually removed it is a long recovery.   \n  \nNow all this was my personal experience with my NF, I am not a medical professional and probably you should ask one specialized in NF care if you want someone to back what they are saying. Do you have generally a lot of tumors? And are they more on your skin or do you have more tumors that are internal?\n\nI do not have any tumors on my skin but have a few internal ones, and I have been told not to worry because I do not have visible tumors. But I recently read in a research paper that people who have less external tumors and more internal ones tend to have an increased risk of them turning malignant, so I am a bit worried. The majority of tumors are all throughout my body internally. I have them on my head, neck, back, front p, arms, pelvis, butt, and legs. So pretty much everywhere.\n\nI have not heard anything from my doctor about have a more of a higher chance of tumors turning cancerous since the majority of my tumors are all inside my body. I have only had it happen twice, the first time it happened, I did not know it was cancerous, I just knew the pain in my leg had gotten worse, MRI scans would later show it was cancerous. Then four years later when I was having the same type of pain in my arm, I knew myself that it was cancerous, a biopsy would confirm it. According to our NF doc the tumors that are most likely to become malignant tend to be in the abdomen (deep in), pelvis and thighs.   She also said that when they get to 5 cm it is especially worrying because with the cells replicating so many times to get to that size there is a much higher chance of cell changes.  ie the greater the # replications (typically indicated by size) the greater the chances of malignancy.", "Hello! First time here! Wanting some insights for ppl who has NF! Hello! Just found this sub! And so glad I did. I never met or talked to anyone who has NF. But I have(26F) been having NF1 all my life. Sorry if this is a bit long, but like I said, I never talked to anyone who has NF and would like your insights ;___;\n\nAll the doctors I have met with could not give me a straight answer on NF or did not know about it. But I went to a genetics doctors yesterday. It is the first time I met with a doctor who specializes in NF. As they doing examinations on my body. They  want to do an MRI on my Spine. They told me I have some tumors and they want to look at. Which was not a shock to me because I already knew I did. But hearing it from a professional doctor made me want to cry. He also mentioned woman with NF has a higher risk of breast Cancer. I already worry about my health a lot and that made it worse. \n\nI know that NF is different for each person. But how do you deal with being confident and not worry about the future of getting worse. I am insecure to wear a swim suit or sometimes even a crop top due to my spots. I have it all over my body but most of my spots are on my back and on my tummy and they are more visible there than on my leg and arms. So it is been hard throughout my life.\n\nAs for the bumps. I am lucky enough not to have any visible bumps outside. But I know I have some tumors inside of that makes sense. \n\nI know I am all over the place I apologize! It is just finding this sub is kind of overwhelming since I never met, talked or knew there was a sub for this. \n\nSo For those who has NF how do you cope with it? And how do you stay confident? And do you get headaches a lot? I often get many headaches but I did an MRI scan on my head in 2007 for headaches and they did not see anything there. \n\nAny help will be appreciated! I was diagnosed in 1999 when I was 15, I just take it one day at a time. I see my specialist about 1-3 times a year. I will have yearly MRI scans. So far I have had four surgeries, the last two were to remove tumors that had turned cancerous. \n\nIf you have any questions feel free to ask Hey! Glad you found us. It sounds like that you are now getting better care than you were previously, so that is a positive thing! The MRI on the spine, (and I am guessing they will do brain while you are in there), is also a good thing because you already know about the tumors, and this will provide a good base image to compare for anything that may be questionable in the future. It will also show your doctors exactly what they are dealing with, and how to work with it. So this is also another positive thing. I totally understand that hearing it from them, even if you already know what is going on, can feel like a shock. It is different when it is confirmed by someone else. In the  studies that I read, women with NF can have an increased risk of breast cancer, but the risk is not that much greater, and it seems to show that it has a more early onset. That just means that if there is something questionable in your 30s they will do a scan right away, and your yearly exams will start in your 40s instead of your 50s. Nerve-raking, yeah. But, the early detection will help in cases that may be more aggressive, and more doctors are considering doing that for the general population anyway. I have been told the same thing that I am telling you by my doctors, so it matches the material that is out there.\n\nI always worry that my NF will get worse, even though I also know in the long run that becomes a waste of time. I think that is something that resides in the back of all of our minds. We all have CAL spots, we all have some or many visible bumps. I know many of us worry more about how the people around us will react, and how we will be treated, more than the actual spots themselves. Think of it this way though. If you see someone who is (to put it bluntly), rather unfortunate looking....would you recoil and consider not talking to them, or worse, go out of your way to be mean to them? Nope. You probably would hesitate, but treat them like any other human. Most people are going to do the same thing. I have a ton of CALs, and a few constellations of bumps on my body. I wear a bikini on the beach. I get embarrassed on my way there, I get shy when I take off my cover, but when I am having fun, I end up not worrying about it. I even wore one on my first date with my now husband. It ended up being a good thing. He surfed back in the day, and had many sun freckles that he was shy about. I pointed out all my CAL spots, and told him we were Freckle Twins, just to reassure him. Inside I was thinking the same thing he was, and it turned out that our insecurity was one more thing to bond over. So do not hide yourself. If you are really concerned about it to the point of not enjoying a wonderful day, then wear one of those fabulous one piece suits (shout out to this years Junior's section at Target, they hit it out of the park with some of their one pieces this year). Besides everyone is wearing that style now, so it works in your favor. Crop tops with a high rise jean is also pretty popular, so that also works! Do not hate your kiss spots and constellations. They are you, so you might as well work it. Hi there! I am 27M, we seem to be in similar boats I think. I do not have any visible bumps but I have the spots all over and am a bit self-conscious about them as well. I also have an optic glioma and because of it my eye has gotten lazy and has drifted all the way to the side. I have not had an MRI in 10+ years but I am really scared that they will find something; I just made a follow-up appointment with a neurosurgeon. \n\nAs for staying confident and not worrying about the future? I do not really know. I never really thought of my NF as something that would or could hold me back. I do not plan on having kids; NF is not really something I want to pass on. Confidence is something that I could work on. A couple of months ago I was ordering food at a restaurant and the girl at the counter was like \"I really like your freckles\" and all I could do was grin and smile. But growing up I had a rough time for looking different than everyone else and it pretty much killed my self-confidence and will to talk to anyone, it still can be difficult for me to open up to people.\n\nAs for the headaches... that is probably something you may want to discuss with your doctor.\n\nMy PMs are open if you want to talk more! It is kind of amazing to have people to talk to that also have NF, no one I went to school with had it or even knew about it. So it was kind of difficult to talk about. 26F with nf too. Heading to bed now. Will post comment tomorrow. This is my reminder. Lol", "NF and high sex drive I hope this topic is ok to be discussed here. I do not want to be breaking any rules on this subreddit. \n\nIs there any relation to NF and a high sex drive? I have NF1. I feel like I have a higher sex drive than a lot of other people. Now obviously there are multiple different reasons to having a high sex drive, but lately I have been starting to wonder how much exactly my NF affects me. I have never really delved too much into how much my NF affects me but ever since joining this subreddit I have really wanted to learn more. \n\nI have always had a very high sex drive ever since I can remember. I am 30 and my sex drive is still as high as it was when I was a teenager. I do not want to get too crude here so I will not go into specifics. Does anyone have answers for how NF affects the sex drive? I do not think it does. I have NF1 and almost no drive. I bethink not t doest.  I has't nf1 and almost nay drive\n\n***\n\n\n\n^(I am a bot and I swapp'd some of thy words with Shakespeare words.)\n\nCommands: `!ShakespeareInsult`, `!fordo`, `!optout` No relation. Have fun and be safe. No it has not increased my sex drives..DRATTS.. :( Have you ever gotten an MRI of your brain ? No. I have only ever had an mri on my leg. You should!\n\nWhere are you from ? No relation. I have NF and am asexual so zero drive whatsoever....every so often I will get hornier than normal but still lack any interest in actually having the sex. This is a shot in the dark and not NF1 specific, but it is common for people with NF1 to have ADHD/ASD/other learning disabilities. Do you happen to be symptomatic for ADHD? \n\nHyper sexuality is a commonly reported thing with ADHD because it is a relatively easy/convenient dopamine reward for your brain when you get off. \n\nObligatory I am not a doctor and do not know anything about you, just a NF1/ADHD woman married to a hypersexual ADHD man.", "Alcohol and nf1? Hi so I am 19 years olf and have nf1. Something weird that is has been happening to me is anytime i drink i get a pain in my leg; however, it is specifically my left leg near my calf area. I usually wake up to shooting pain and have to clutch my leg for a few seconds. Sometimes a lump appears too. I always drink lots of water so I do not think its dehydration and i never have more than four drinks over the course of a long night so it isnt heavy drinking either. On saturday I went to a party, had a couple drinks and danced a lot and on Sunday and today I can barely walk properly. I am limping and even sitting down I feel a deep pain in my left leg. I am wondering if alcohol + physical activity affects potential fibromas in legs. When I touch the area of my leg that hurts it feels very tender but i do not even know what to look for when it comes to fibromas cause i have never had one I have noticed. I might just be tripping myself out because nf1 has never been a big part of my life and so when something hurts I always want to make sure it does not have to do with that.  \n\n\nSorry if fibroma is not the correct word, although I have known I have had nf1 since I was little it has luckily never affected me so I am not sure if that term is correct as I do not see any visible bump. I hate to be the prick that says to go talk to your doctor, but I would mention it the next time you go. It can be any number of things, from something NF related, to something simple like an electrolyte imbalance that is triggered by drinking (which may be more likely). Leg cramps after alcohol consumption is pretty common due to your potassium and magnesium being thrown off. Try upping your magnesium/potassium by eating a banana with almond butter on toast before bedtime, in addition to your extra glass of water. I honestly would not worry about it too much, though I do notice a bit more inflammation in my own cutaneous neurofibromas after alcohol. Nocturnal leg cramps after alcohol consumption is a thing, and a fairly common one at that. Do not trip too much, unless it is for fun! I do not think your a prick! It is just been two days and it still hurts even while resting so I wa sujet concerned + health anxiety When you say \u201cfour drinks\u201d what exactly do you mean? Because I see that as 40 grams of alcohol. Oh, I understand the health anxiety. Neurofibromatosis with health anxiety is a shitty combination to have, huh?! At least we all understand that here! You should speak with your doctor about any changes and how alcohol affects you when you drink. In the mean time I would reframe from drinking. Yes I would say 4 drinks, think 4 beers at 8% abv over the course of 6+ hours.", "Is there any reason not to get a genetics test? Hi all. Looking for some advice. My 5 year old has several CALs and the doctor has signed us up to get genetic testing done. The doctor said that before the test we will go through a consultation and that some parents at that point decide not to get the test done. Do you know of any reason to not do the testing? I cannot think of any reason, but would like to be more mentally prepared going into this.  I am in the U.S. if that matters. Thank you so much for any advice you have. I jumped to get the testing done as soon as I could. I wanted to have a certain diagnosis, so we can figure out what the next step for us would be. I am from Romania, but we sent the samples to the US. even if the insurance does not cover it, it is quit accessible, I think we payed around 200$ and they sequenced around 40 genes. I see no reason why not to do it The commonly cited reason is this: you may find out about more than you wish to know. If you are going in for an NF2 test you may find out that you have that *and* something else; sometimes it is another genetic issue sometimes it is related to family genealogy, for example. All the same--do it. I did. I am glad I did. My wife and I are doing IVF and we are also having all embryos tested. Thank you! That makes sense. The most common reason to not do it is the cost associated with it. It could range from $300 to $3000 depending on your insurance. I think you should absolutely have it done if it is possible. Not only will you have a definite diagnosis but if there are any experimental treatments it is often related to specific gene deletion variants which are unknown unless you have the test. There is no reason not to get a test. If a doctor advises a test  there is reasonable possibility that your child may have NF. Let us know how things go. Every year we are able to predict slightly more about the course of a patients NF by their mutation type and/or location.  It depends if you want to know, I guess, which is a personal question.\n\nI am an obsessive researcher when it comes to my son's NF. knowing he has a nonsense mutation helps me narrow my focus a bit. I had the \"legal chat\" with my genetics team there were legal implications  linked to a positive result (not in USA, so not sure if it applies there). \n\n1) Some professions would be out, such as pilot, police, forces, ...\n\n2) Life insurance would likely be denied and as a consequence certain mortgages since some institutions require a life insurance as well\n\n3) Immigrations in certain countries\n\nThey concluded with this statement: If you are a mild case, you would suffer more from a positive result than from the NF1 itself, and if you are more severe case you would know anyway without the need of a genetic test. \n\nThis was the essence of the shocking legal chat I was given when asked if I wanted to go ahead and test my kids My daughter presented with a mark on her chest. Turns out it was a xantham granuloma, the dermatologist then asked about the caf\u00e9 au lait marks. Me and the wife said we know nothing about it. Was offered genetic testing for myself and our daughter because I have caf\u00e9 au laits as well. \nSo at 26 (nearly 3 years ago) myself and my daughter who was 1\u00bd at the time where diagnosed with NF1. In my opinion genetic testing is a good idea. \n(Sorry for spelling) You cannot be a police officer with NF? The pilot one makes sense with how common optic nerve tumors are but I am surprised about the rest My 5 month old daughter was just diagnosed via genetic testing.  We spoke with a genetic counselor AFTER the diagnosis was given.  We were not told about any legal implications a positive NF test would have for my daughter.  However, my husband and I were told that if we wanted to get tested, it would go on our permanent health record which may present some challenges.  No specifics were given other than issued with obtaining life insurance? The genetic specialist thought it was great that we had such an early diagnosis because it helps us know what to look out for in the development of our daughter and make early interventions as needed.  We are glad we did it.  \nHope this helps.\n\nPS - we are also in the U.S Hey do you mind telling what exon does the nonsense point mutation lie for your son? I cannot recall the exon but it is nucleotide 4537, codon 1513... Right in the middle of the GAP domain. I am just repeating what they said years ago. I think it has more to do with the fact that your medical expenses would have to be covered by the employer for these specific professions. As far as I know, it is no longer necessary to diagnose NF.\n\nMeaning, they do not need to test your genes to determine whether one has NF or not. Please can you share a link. I was always told there is no way to predict the course of patients NF.\nThanks I believe that I did not make myself clear. The medical community has developed guidelines for diagnosing neurofibromatosis. If a person has two or more of those signs then they have NF, and a genetic test is not required. \n\nIf I understood correctly, the person in question already meets the criteria, therefore a genetic test would not make any difference. \n\nYour daughter presented no signs, therefore a genetic test was essential to check whether she had NF or not.", "Koselugo for NF1 ", "military I am enlisting in the military currently, i already went to MEPs and passed everything, and sent a waiver but it got sent back down because they needed more info.

I know that neurofibron removal isnt simple and I would assume most plattic Surgeons will not take insurance.

I went to a derm and she has now checked me twice, she thinks 1-2 of them could be post-inflammatory pigmentation or damaged skin - yet I have never heard of that before. I have no other symptoms at all. Why do I have these birthmarks - should I let this go.

Been seeing this guy for quite a while, dating for as long as I ever have now, and just wondering if it is good to only brings it up in a committed relationship? I have a 'mild' case but still have a few pea-size lumps- major concerns are benign ones located in my spinal cord, brain, and jugular vein (yay). I get self-conscious about taking off my top.\n\nThe thing is I am very nervous about discussing this with him, he seems so direct in his life goals, he is a bit of a 'man' if you know what I mean- closed off. Then there is me, I am a mess- then there is that whole having kids thing. I guess what I mean is I do not have a clear direction of how to approach this with him without coming on too strong or scaring him away or getting hurt myself?\n\nFor context - He is actually also a type 1 diabetic and we have not had sex yet. He is also overtly cautious because I have made it known I am a virgin (due to mental illness/shitshow life experiences, but he doesnt know that yet) I cannot help answer the question. But a friend has a YouTube channels about dating with NF. (Also goes down the route of IVF with PGD, to ensure any children do not have NF.). I do know a few of the early ones and the Dating Dad/Gleen one might help.  )\n\nPaul When I felt the relationship is going to be possible serious I told them about it. At last at that point no of the guys had problem with it. However it never went further. Do you think that is because they see a future that will be too hardbasket so they run? Or just more so other factors? Or you ask yourself the same question? No, they were morons. I am glad they are out of my life, having family with them would be terrible idea. Be brave, I know it is hard, just let go and tell him the whole truth, I know it is hard. All the best I honestly do not remember how I told my husband. We have been together for 10 years and are expecting our first baby. He knows the chances of her inheriting NF and all that may come. \n\nJust bring it when you are comfortable and feel safe in the relationship My husband told me from the get go. He has a more noticeable case of it though. It is never been an issue for our relationship as the main thing that matters is how you treat each other. We have been together for 10 years now and I am so thankful that he is my husband. He is one of the kindest and most patient people I have ever met. I am too extremely scared and reluctant to date because I have no idea how or when to bring this up. I know this fear is very irrational and that no sane petson would judge another for something that is completely out of their control, but... Yeah. I tell people about Nf when they ask me about my scars I do not have the right answer or know what to say to make this all better. I am married and have two kids, did not learn much about NF1 until I have kids. While I live my two boys so so much, I feel bad and wish I could go back and undo all this. Whatever choice u make in life, I wish u all the best and no regrets. I have felt like a normal person until I hit 35, been in pain ever since, guess there is a tumor on my back/spine somewhere :( What do you mean go back and undo all of this? Because you passed NF1 to your kids? I hate myself for saying this. I am sorry. But yes :( my younger one has it so bad, he has NF1 with neurofibroma growing on his tongue. We have to feed him through g tube. He also has epilepsy and scoliosis. And his scoliosis needs a surgery, but can get complicated cuz as we all know, we can have tumors growing on our spine too. When my husband and I started dating, we got serious quick. I knew we were both falling hard, and so I told him early on. I think we were about one month in, but I told him that early in case it would be a deal breaker or something for him. Luckily it was not and he was very accepting about it and even started doing his own research about it. In a way, I feel like telling him only made us closer because I was able to share such a personal thing about myself.\nAnd for the record, I was a virgin, too, up until AFTER we got engaged. It was important to me to wait, which is something else he was understanding of.\nPoint being, I think it is worth telling him if you are becoming serious. I know it is nerve racking telling people about it, but remember too if he loves and cares about you, it will not change how he feels about you. I have a young daughter with NF1..she was a spontaneous mutation. When I first had my daughter I thought the same way as you.. but when you think about it.. having your son is better than not having him or knowing him at all.\n\nIf my daughter did not have NF1.. it would not be my daughter. If the sperm / egg did not create the gene defect, it would have been a different sperm / egg. It would not be your son. \n\nAfter I thought about it that way it changed my perspective. I bet your son is still glad he was born. \n\nDo not be too hard on yourself. \ud83d\ude42 Hey Girl, \n\nI was 24F in my first serious relationship (now 25). He was a 32M. It came up for me 3 months in or so. I was also a virgin when we started dating. I grew up very religious. \n\nMy NF came up with us when we had the conversation around kids and future goals. I am a hard no on biological kids. He respects me and love me for who I am. Our intimacy has grown. \n\nWe both have our fears. I am scarred though I am careful about birth control I will get pregnant, he is scarred my condition or quality of life will change.\n\nHe also met my family and saw more intense case. He understood my views of the disorder and suffering. Hopefully that helps? \n\nI started therapy as well which was a safe place for me to process my complex grief around NF. \u2764\ufe0f I am am happy to talk more if you want/need :) The problem is I think a lot of rational people might have a right not to want to have a relationship with someone with NF1 as most people want biological children. Oh, I definitely have those thoughts too and I certainly would not blame a woman who states that as the reason to stop dating. This is too why I feel it is best to just tell her from very early on in the dating process. \n\nI could not possibly live with myself if I was the reason a perfectly healthy woman who desires motherhood could not attain it. Even less so if I was the reason our child was born with- and suffered from NF.", "Tumour Symptoms. Has anyone had a tumour in their abdomen or spine? What symptoms did you have? \n\nI have slight scoliosis near my right shoulder blade, but it hurts way too much to feel normal so I am worried it may be a tumour. \n\nAlso, my abdomen/uterus has been hurting recently.

I was getting paralyzation symptoms. It did not hurt. Go get a mri-scan, or a ct-scan if you have a spine-implant for that scoliosis. It depends on so many factors. GO SEE A DOCTOR. DO NOT RELY ON REDDIT FOR MEDICAL ADVICE. I have a bunch all up and down my spine. The only real symptom I have is that my back and neck get really stiff. Spine: For me, it was a lot of pain, weakness on one side of my body (arms and legs), and slight pins and needles feeling in the arms.\n\n\nGet some scans done ASAP. I plan on it as soon as I get health insurance from my new job. Usually only get brain, but going to push for spine as well. Only downfall is that I live in FL and my doctor is in PA :/  I had tumors removed from my spine in 2007.

They cause pain, weakness, and sometimes a tingling or pins and needles feeling.  I was only diagnosed with these tumors recently and they are going to do a follow up MRI to track growth before making suggestions about what to do.  I was told that because of the location of these specific tumors, I could eventually experience loss of bowel and bladder control.  Of course, your tumors might be in a different location and have different symptoms.

Hi guys,\n\nWe have just had our second failed attempt of IVF with PGD.\n\nSo really looking at either paying for a third round or perhaps conceiving naturally.\n\nHas anyone made this rough decision?\n\nI understand that there is a 50/50 chance of a kid without NF1 if we tried it naturally. Hi mate! I am a  26 year old man from Denmark with Nf1.   \nI am the first person in my family that is has it, so i have made the  decision not to get kids, \n\nthe 50/50 risk is too risky in my opinion, but people might have a diffrent veiw on that depending on if they got NF1/2 from a parrent or mutation. I didnt make the decision, I fell pregnant unintentionally  and unaware that the father had NF1. I love my son but he has severe behavioral and learning difficulties and a growth in his brain that needs regular MRI scans. He has regular appointments with a neurologist, psychologist, and paediatrician. I lIve in UK so medical Bill's arent a worry, if you live in the US I would say make sure you are in a financial position to pay for whatever your child might need. Not sure where in the UK you live but the specialist NF1 clinic at Guys and St Thomas\u2019 Hospital is top notch.\n\nWe have moved to NZ since and there is not really the same level of expertise.\n\nCannot even get yearly checkups with neurologists as they are way too busy. Thanks for the info, I live in Northern Ireland but it is good to know there is a specialist clinic in the UK. Fingers crossed I wont ever need to contact them. Wow that is shocking about NZ. Wishing you the best of luck The wife loves NI and has very close friends in Downpatrick! \n\nShe worked near the Portstewart/Castlerock region for a year too! \n\nGrand! What a small world! I live close to Downpatrick and I was born and  raised close to Portstewart! My husband and I conceived naturally. My team of doctors are monitoring me and baby girl so very closely. So far she is looking great. We have a fetal echocardiogram at the end of this month to see if she has any heart conditions that could indicate she has NF. They also offered genetic testing (Both blood work and taking amniotic fluid) I denied the fluid test because there is a risk of loss. You can do a CVS (11-14 weeks) or amino (15-18 weeks) to test for NF1 in pregnancy so you do not pass it on that way. I have never heard of heart issues associated with NF When I was diagnosed they checked my for a heart murmur because they are associated with NF. Other heart problems too but I do not remember them all since I was pretty little I am the child of a parent with nf1 and I got it, my dad did not know he had it before I was born bc his is very minor, personally, I am never going to have kids bc I know the risk and I would not want to push that chance onto a child I have had a ton of health problems ( scoliosis, cancer, mental health problems, painful tumours ) all from nf1. it is not my choice but I would not risk it, adoption could be an option NF1 or 2? Nf1 Interesting. I have never read anything about that, even on CTF My NF specialist insisted on an Echocardiogram. I am NF type 1. I pregnant from donor IVF because in addition to NF, I have Polycystic Kidney Disease. I did not want to pass on either and I did not want endless IVF cycles with PGT.\n\nMy sister choose differently and her kids have had a myriad of issues even though we both have fairly mild cases. &gt; it is not my choice but I would not risk it, adoption could be an option\n\n\nYea theres kids whos parents do not want them, op wants kids seems like a win a win. Compared to (in my personal opinion, extremely selfishly) risking having a kid with NF1 I have got NF1 (M 36)im booked in for a vasectomy. Passing NF on to children would be horrible. But that is just me. I am sorry to hear that you had two failed attempts.\n\nDid you grow any tumors during each round?\n\nI hope you get your miracle one day. &lt;3", "Doctors said I do not need to be checked regularly?  I would just listen to your doctors. They are the experts after all. If you do not have any issues why would you want a yearly check up? I have tumors and even I do not go to yearly check ups because my doctors tell me I have nothing to worry about.  I am 31 with nf1, and i had my first mri scan since childhood in 2014, was told the exact same thing not to worry about. Nf affects everyone differently the people who get checked regularly have issues that need to be followed  For me puberty was a real shit show of getting giant tumors and problems. Since then not much has changed. Tumors are all basically the same size (growing really slowly technically) \n\nIf you made it through puberty without major issues, i would guess you were going to be ok. Sounds like that is what your doctors think too.", "Neurological issues and MRA/MRI scans I forgot I was subbed here and I wanted to ask anyone here who has had MRA/MRI scans if you got weird or concerning results back.\n\nI had a scan done in 2014 and two done a few days ago as a very, very belated follow-up to the old ones, and I am wondering if anyone has had something similar to me happen. With the one I had in 2014, they detected \" There is a 7 mm T2  hyperintensity in the white matter of the inferior right cerebellar hemisphere which is nonspecific.  There is a similar focus in the medial aspect of the left cerebral peduncle\" and \"asymmetric appearance of the proximal left middle cerebral artery which is smaller than the right\". For whatever reason, I was not notified to schedule a follow-up and I figured that since I was cleared with what they initially looked for that I was fine.\n\nHere is the rundown of what my labs I got back from my recent session:\n\n**Impression:**  Chronic left MCA trifurcation region stenosis/occlusion with collateralization, similar to prior MRI.  NF1 related vasculopathy is among differential considerations.  No other significant stenosis.   Attenuated right A1 and P1 segments consistent with congenital variant. \n\n* **Petrous and cavernous segments of ICAs:**  Unremarkable.\n* **Supraclinoid ICAs:**  Mild tortuosity proximal segments both ophthalmic arteries.\n* **Middle cerebral arteries:**  Chronic appearing left MCA flow signal attenuation.  Irregular contour and decreased caliber of left M1 segment with apparent distal occlusion.  Flow related enhancement of small caliber M2  and M3 segments apparently via collaterals.  Findings are grossly similar to MRI of 08/13/2014 and likely due to chronic occlusion rather than congenital variant.\n* **Anterior cerebral arteries:**  Markedly hypoplastic right A1 segment.  Paired A2 segments at the midline.\n* **Anterior communicating artery:**  Unremarkable.\n* **Posterior communicating artery:**  Fetal supplied right PCA.  Moderately hypoplastic left PCOM.\n* **Distal vertebral arteries:**  Unremarkable.  Bilateral PICA noted.\n* **Basilar artery and branches:**  Unremarkable.  Bilateral AICA and superior cerebellar arteries noted.\n* **Posterior cerebral arteries:**  Hypoplastic right P1 segment.  Fetal supply smaller caliber right PCA. \n\nI am not entirely sure what a good chunk of this means, but asymmetrical MCA is what got the person's attention when it came up again and wants me to get checked on because there is an increased risk of a stroke if it gets worse. I was wondering if anyone else has gotten results like this back and how you went about dealing with things. I am sure I will be fine, but it is just this air of mystery with wondering how long this has been going on for that bothers me. The hyperintensity is probably not a worry, people with NF to have areas of brightness in MRIs. They have not noticed anything bad from them, it is just a finding that goes along with NF. The rest I am not sure about sorry! I would message your doctor to ask for clarification. My primary doctor messaged me a few days ago to say everything looks alright. So, needless to say when I got a phone call at 8am for someone from the radiology/neurology team to talk to me to go over stuff was weird. It is looking like that the hyperintensity and probably another thing he saw is not something to be too worried about. So for the most part, I am not too worried. But the MCA narrowing does a bit. If I heard him correctly, he said there is an NF specialist in the department he wants me to see to get looked at.", "If I have surgery to remove a tumor from my neck/chin, will the tumor grow back bigger? Im worried that after getting them removed, somehow the cells will want to grow back bigger than before. Is there any top notch NF doctor around the Orange County/Los Angeles area I can go to to talk about this? Dr. Phioanh Nghiemphu at UCLA through Boywer Oncology Clinic is helping my case. There is always a chance. It is programmed in that gene. Neck and chin sounds risky. If it does not affect the quality of life then I would leave it.\nI was going to see that French doctor you mentioned for my buttock tumor but I got scared. I got my tumor removed that was on my neck/spinal coulmn, so far it has not grown back and it is been 8 years, but as others have said there maybe a chance it does. It is always a possibility at some point for the tumor to grow back unfortunately. I see Dr Nghiemphu, too! She is fantastic.\n\nBest NF doctor I have found out here since I outgrew CHLA. Possibly, yes, though I think each case is different and there is no one-size-fits-all answer. I had a tumor, originally around right ear canal. I had it removed back in the 90s, it promptly grew back and spread. 2 more surgeries through a much better surgeon and it is still growing, albeit slower. Good luck and hope you find the right NF specialist. I have been fortunate in my state to find specialists who have given my case a helpful assessment. It is so hard to find an NF doc!

Aww that is awesome! NF friends are the best friends :) Kudos to you! I am still a teenager and my parents encouraged me to be closed off for the longest time. I recently opened up to a few friends and they have been super supportive. I still have a way to go but getting it off my chest was one of the best decisions I made. Not very.

Freaked several doctors out when visiting a friend in hospital once.. They would not let me leave until I had a full ECG etch work up as I grabbed my chest.

I have tumors in my spine that are doing damage to the spinal cord itself. Avastin is the name of the drug.

It is a medically needed surgery, regardless of why, should not insurances cover that? Like is not that why we have it? But kudos for your doctor for putting it under the right reason so you do not have to pay :) Omg I am sure you will be strong through it! This is honestly one of my worst fear.

Yeah, I have been on Avastin since October they monitor the brain lesions but so far it has done great for me.  Good luck to OP. I am not familiar with that expression, what does it mean? It is slang for helping someone through a difficult situation. It seems scary at first, but it is tolerable at least in my experience. I was on it for 6 years until I lost my hearing to the acoustic neuromas in the brain due to NF2. There was no radiation involved so I did not get sick or have any hair fall out.\n\nThere were other effects though such as decrease in protein uptake from the kidneys. Not a problem with kidney function directly. They just do not like taking up the chemo. \n\nAlso some high blood pressure since the chemo is Anti-Vascular Growth Factor by nature.

I feel the same way, I am a terrible person. Our condition is real. Its shitty that people ignore the impact and strain a life long illness like NF because it is not a widely known condition. I have had doctors and people just ignore it and tell me to 'suck it up', so the wish to push it on other people is normal in my opinion and often makes me feel terrible but it is no more than the bad days where the chronic pain is unbearable and I just want to curl up and not exist. \n\nI do not think your terrible for wishing it on other people, I think other people are terrible for assuming they know or can understand what you are going through.

I have also had doctors say similar when I tell them I am in pain the majority of the time and that it affects my sleep etc, it feels like they think I am making it up or saying it is worse than it is Nah. Actually you do not wish it. Is a natural and \"rage\" thinking. Like someone say \"I wish you were death\". I do not have this thinking with my NF1, but sometimes I have with my Pure O (OCD) and I feel horrible. But actually... is not a real wish, is a emotional reaction. Sounds like you are in a bad environment. Having nf sucks,  but not being supported or understood is arguably just as bad. So you say you wish they could walk in your shoes because maybe then the people you should be able to lean on for emotional support would actually make you feel safe and supported. Hi,\nChanges in mood as well as many other things are associated with NF1. I hope you are getting support, at least someone to talk to honestly about what you are going through.\nOther people have stated what I think - that the wish other people had NF stems from a desire for more empathy/understanding of what it does to you. While NF1 can be \"mild\" for many people, there are many more who have significant physical and mental challenges from it.\nThere are many communities for support, like reddit, NF network, and Children's tumor foundation (CTF) \nBy the way (to anyone), May is NF awareness month. Consider using Amazon smile and picking CTF to help with research and awareness. \u2764\ud83d\udcaf Same! This is just something people do not understand and probably never will. We have to accept that. But no, you are not a bad person. It is just emotions getting the best of you. I would never wish anything negative on anyone, especially on a family member and friend. I would not even wish it on someone who I did not like. Wishing someone else bad things will not make you feel better about yourself, only you can make you feel better about yourself. I guess I am a terrible person then. Everyone is tired of me complaining because everyone else has it easy. Here I am stuck because I cannot have children like I please. I do not want to do IVF as that could make things worse. Again, NF is a negative thing and everyone thinks it is just like having something simple like I cannot even think of a normal disorder. I know that it is hard. I have pain on a daily basis, I have had tumors pressing against my cervical spine, cancerous tumors in my right leg and arm. It sucks, but I take each day, day by day. I do what I am able to do and know my limitations and I try not to complain, because I knew there are others out there who are in far worse situation and conditions that I am in. I try to look at the good things in my life, even if they may seem small to someone else, they are everything to me. Maybe you need to talk to someone about what you are dealing with, because all of these negative feelings are going to help you feel better. I wish you the very best.", "What do you wish your parents had done differently? Hello all,\n\nMy 8 month old has around 10+ CALs at this stage and her doctor has referred us to a specialist because she agrees we should move forward to look at getting a diagnosis.\n\nObviously we do not know for sure yet, but I would like to know in the meantime what you wish your parents had done differently when you were going up vis-a-vis your NF, or what they did that made things easier for you.\n\nIf she has this, I want to make sure that I am able to be there for her in a way that actually helps her navigate it with a sense of autonomy.\n\nThanks for reading! My parents instructed me not to talk about my diagnosis when I was younger but never really mentioned that \u201crule\u201d again. When I finally opened up to a friend, I was panicking that my parents would be angry. Thankfully they were not, but I wished they had geared me more in the direction of loving/accepting who I was, regardless of what others think. \n\nI am now a rising high school Junior, straight-A student, and have an overwhelming passion for medicine (for obvious reasons haha). So maybe everything happens for a reason \ud83d\ude09 \n\nRemember that anything is possible, and remind you child that they are a force to be reckoned with!\n\nSending lots of love, I can only imagine how stressed you are \u2764\ufe0f depending on the severity of your child's condition. I would advise do not overly protect them or put them in a protective bubble.\n\nI have a \"very mild\" case compared to what others do but I still have my difficulties in life. I have been able to live a fairly normal life apart from the tumours and all. My parents overly protected me when I was younger and put things I struggled with down to having NF. So in some aspects of my life when I was younger I did not learn the resistance of pushing though things and I had to learn them in my Mid to late 20's.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso apart from a trained medical professional, I do not think anyone can tell I am different apart from an unsymmetrical face. Yeah, that makes sense. I feel like I understand why people would think that keeping it a secret would be a form of protection but obviously if it is a lifelong thing you cannot keep it quiet forever.\n\nThat is great advice -- thank you very much!\n\nHonestly, I am trying not to get stressed yet. We had a pregnancy loss, then a long time to conceive, then an early water break and time in the NICU during a pandemic... it feels like we know how to get through things together, and our baby seems like a firecracker. We love her, and we are here for her no matter what. Yeah that makes a lot of sense -- not making them your \"baby\" forever or making their condition the source of all of their problems. I am glad to hear you are doing well, and thank you for the advice. Oh my goodness, I am so sorry for your pregnancy loss :( Thank you! It sucks, but you get up and move on eventually. Do not talk about finances with them at all or have conversations about costs of surgeries/drs apts/etc around them. My parents did and it really fucked me up because I stopped going to necessary appointments because I realized that it cost them money.\n\nIf the doctors talk about putting your kids on medication, have a real conversation with your kid about it. My parents said they did not want me to go on medication too young and so I went with what they said. I am 26 now and am still fearful of going on any pain meds because what they said to me stuck (even though I have unbearable pain now).\n\nDo not downplay the pain your kid is going through or tell them they are trying to get attention. Pain is your body trying to get attention because there is a problem (it is just often one that cannot be easily solved). I know my parents just wanted me to be tough but I would have rather had them educate me on why I was feeling the pain I was instead of dismissing it.\n\nI am not sure any of this is helpful because it really depends person to person, it is just my experience growing up. One thing I am glad about is that my partner and I made the decision to start going to counselling before having kids, so I feel like we are in a better spot to avoid major issues like \"parentification\" or guilt, but it is still good to be reminded of how much stuff like this can impact a kid and how it informs who they become as adults.\n\nI did not have any major issues growing up but my mom also treated my pain like I was attention seeking and I also have trouble even taking aspirin now.\n\nThank you very much for sharing that, and I am sorry you were made to feel like that when so much was out of your control.\n\nOne thing I have noticed so far in the parents' groups is a LOT of talk around \"my little fighter\" and it immediately gave me a bad taste, which was part of the reason for this post. In the end, a kid is a kid. The parent can fight and advocate for them, but I feel like labelling them a \"fighter\" also implies they have failed somehow if their condition gets worse.\n\nHopefully that made sense. In any event, thank you again and I wish you luck on your journey with this. I agree about the \"fighter\" label. I know my parents meant well and wanted me to be strong but at the same time, I felt that if I started taking medication that I would somehow be viewed as weak or that I was giving up. It also feels like the responsibility of the parent to fight for their kid is taken off their shoulders by saying that. Even now as an \"adult,\" my parents are always proud that I go to all of my drs appointments alone, pay for it all myself, and set up surgeries for myself. Even though my condition is severe enough at this point in my life that I am unemployed. They raised me to figure it out all on my own but do not realize how much I needed/need their support. Yeah, that was my read on it as well. Like, absolutely it is draining for the parent, but they are the parent -- it is their job to take on the fight or the burden. \n\nI know it is hollow to have a random internet person say that they are sorry you went through that but I feel like I had a similar level of parentification growing up so even though I cannot understand living with NF1 I do definitely understand part of that feeling. It is not hollow at all, I have severe social anxiety so I barely talk about stuff like this and only have one friend irl. Thank you for being understanding and empathetic, it means a lot :) Not at all. I can understand the anxiety (I am currently on some anti-anxiety medication myself) but I want to say that you have been really sweet and empathetic and patient with me and it is been very much appreciated. It is her body let her choose if she want to get surgeries or not. It feel weird having a doctor touch up all over you\u2026.and you barely knowing what is happening \n\n\nAnother thing is understand that mental health can almost deter so if she ask for a therapist try your best, and if it is too much money, do not feel bad, and be honest just let her know you care and you want to give her therapy  it helps, a lot. \n\nNot rlly NF related but be accepting for everything, just my parents not understanding why I like girls can push me to the edge just thinking abt it. I am really sorry your sexuality was not respected, or your bodily autonomy. We definitely want to strive to involve our child in decisions made about her own body once she is ready for those talks. Thank you very much for this advice.\n\nWe see her pediatrician tomorrow for next steps, and she is only 7 months right now so we are mostly just asking people to keep an eye on things but mental health will always be a really important part of this for us. I wish they did anything at all. Regular checkups with a neurologist. Physical and occupational therapy, talk therapy to deal with the mental health aspects. I am really sorry. We are big believers in mental health and that was one of the first things on our list, honestly.", "Is indentations on the skin common with NF1? I am 19, and have NF1. In the last months I have noticed that I am starting to get purple spots on my skin, and when I touch them the skin feels extremely soft. When I gently press on them it feels like there is an indentation in my skin. It hurts slightly when I do this.\n\nThere is a two or three on my arm, and then a lot on my chest/bellow my armpit. \n\nI am aware bumps are common, but when I asked my mom about this (she also has NF1) she said she never experienced something like this. I have them too. Lil purpley indents.  I have never gotten any explanation for them, but at least you are not alone in this! \n\nHopefully someone else has answers From what I know, those may be the very beginning of fibromas or little baby fibromas starting to form. Sometimes they start out more purple in color and indented. But they can grow bigger unfortunately, so keep an eye on them. I have a pretty big one of these on my calf though it does not hurt to touch. It is been there unchanged for my whole life. I have had a few of these removed as they were hurting, there is a small tumor just under the surface. Also a 19 year old with NF1 here! It sounds like it may be invagination? I dont know how common it is, but I have a few indented spots on my body. I dont recall them hurting, though. Same as others say, I got some too. Thanks! Glad to hear I am not on my own Ah, okay. Thanks so much! Thank you! I never heard of that term till now, I will have to look into it.  Thanks! I got them. They are basically flat fibromas. I think they could grow, but I got a bunch that have not and have just remained as they are.", "I hate my body I am a woman in my 30s and have always struggled with body image. I have tons of neurofibromas. It does not seem to matter how many I get removed. \n\nI hate the way my eyes look and pretty much everything else. I have tried hard for years to accept myself but it gets harder, not easier. It is a hard one. I think we have more trouble excepting ourselves than other people do. But dont let your own self image stop you from living your life, easier said than done I know, I am 26 and have a lot of lumps as well but I am slowly starting to thing \"fuck it\" and \"fuck what I and other people think of them\". They are always going to be part of your life. I have a slight squint in my eye which is worse when I am tired but I have a nice colour green and they allow me to see. Try and love yourself for who you are even if it is only a bit of love, give yourself that x 2nd this. I am almost 30 and I have always hated my bumps but I have come to the realization there are just somethings out of my control and just try to roll with it. They still get to me sometimes but I just try to accept it.\n\nAre squinty eyes an NF thing? I have one eye that quints hard when I smile, I thought that was a weird me thing. I feel you I am 27 and some days just want to cry. I have hundreds of them on my back and lots on my torso and chest. I always look tired and people frequently ask if I have had enough sleep. I want to say stay strong! It is not easy but fuck anyone who treats people badly or judges people. We are all beautiful in our own way. Not a female but I can totally relate now that the weather is warmer I am wearing less clothes and my NF is more visible. I got used to the stare now that I am older I learned to embraced and let it become part of me like a BFF. I know it can be hard at times when you see other people with their \u201cflawless\u201d skin but I do not let it bother me because their opinions do not matter. I have been wondering that too, one of my eyes is more squinty than the others as well I have been there at times in my life but I had a mother who was a blessing. My NF mainly covers the right side of my face and it has been there all my life. \n\nI have had over 16 surgeries and many times in my life I hated the way I looked. My mother took me out and made sure I had a good childhood for the most part and as I got older I started not to care what others thought and did what made me happy.\n\nI still get looks from people and I just keep going on in life and do my own thing. I feel for you and if you need to chat about it I am here. I am a guy and not only do I have NF but I also have vitiligo (which seemed to only form in adulthood) on parts of my face, neck and there seem to be new formations on other parts of my body but the NF sticks out the most.        \n\nI agree with the warm weather. I love it and I am also wearing less clothes but I am trying to get used to the stares but they keep growing. I am learning to embrace it. 28 and I feel you! Have sporting particularly around my groin and it is such a downer on my confidence. I literally hate myself What you need to realise is that none of that is in your control and that you are not to blame for it. I have struggled with negative emotions since I was 12 and the only way to deal with it, as I see it, is to really analyse these thoughts and separate assumptions from facts and only deal with the latter. \n\nI would suggesting keeping a journal in which you write down all your negative emotions and how you feel. Make a new entry every time you get them and also pen down when, where and from what they occur. This will help you detect patterns and to beter deal with the problems latter.\n\nI know that all I have shared is pretty much cliches, but they are things that have actually helped me. I feel for you. I am male late 20s and have always felt like I am not worth anything because of my skin condition. I have opened up about how I feel about myself to some friends and family. The 'just be positive + grateful' thing only works for a short time, and the whole 'everyone has their own lil thing' makes me feel dismissed and even though I am my own worst enemy I feel like people think and look at NF as something they would not want to be with. I struggle with my own body image and from about the age of 17-24 I was thinking of ways I could kill myself so I could stop the negative voice in my head for telling me I am not good enough. It is one thing to say 'rise above it' which is often easier said I am retrospect and another thing to follow through with it. \n\nOne thing that comes from having a skin condition like this is that it has increased my empathy for people who have body image challenges and makes me feel like I am more understanding of people's differences.", "Neurofibroma Growth after IV Okay, so this is kind of bizarre, but I am trying to figure out if there is a correlation.\nI am currently in paramedic school, and a few weeks ago we studied IVs and practiced inserting IVs on one another. Both of my arms were stuck, and the here is a vein down by my wrist that I as stuck. Well, now I am noticing red bumps what look to be like neurofibromas at the locations were classmates practiced IV insertion on me. Has anyone else who has ever had an IV notice this on themselves? I am just very concerned that this is what this is as we will be practicing skills on one another continuously throughout the program. Are you talking about cherry angiomas? I know I have them on my legs from shaving nicks. but I have not gotten them from IV's, blood draws, or vaccines. The connection between trauma, even repeated low-grade trauma, and neurofibromas has been established for quite a while now. The inflammation and mast cells surge to the site have been identified as possible cause. \n\nMaybe taking a mast cells stabiliser like ketotifen could limit the effects of repeated trauma and mitigate the wound healing immune response. Honestly I do not think it would be new neurofibromas. Were you guys using med tape to hold the IV in place? People with NF tend to have pretty sensitive skin (we have more mast cells), so it could be something as simple as contact dermatitis from the adhesive. If you guys were practicing IV placement with saline flushes, it can be a mild infection of some sort. I would assume something like staph would show up as painful red bumps after a few weeks, and because you do not mention pain I would place my bets on adhesive sensitivity, especially if you are taking on and off the tape repeatedly to adjust things. I have have Neurofibromatosis and I have had many iv and blood draws, this has never happened to me.", "Vaccine question/concerns Can any of you discuss advice you have received from your doctor concerning the vaccine? I have not seen any studies related to NF patients and the vaccine. I have got concerns that the proteins the RNA creates could adversely affect NF. Has anyone gotten the vaccine and had any unusual side effects? Or have you had Covid and experienced issues related to that? Very concerning to me. Completely fine to take. The only side effects I had were the ones everyone gets. Pfizer. No notable side effects. No concern, no issues. \n\nHad the two Pfizer doses. First one gave me a bit of sore arm on that evening, but low scale, no need to take pain killers, the second one, not even a sore arm. Pfizer. No side affects :) Took the J&amp;J vaccine and had no issues. Just some minor normal side effects. My son (also NF 1) took the Moderna and had the same experience. Thank you to everyone answering. I have been a nervous wreck about it. I did that testosterone therapy thing a few times a few years back when I was training all the time. Clinics all over the place here to help men feel like a kid again. BS cover for steroids basically. Well that system change I believe spurred a outbreak of sorts of the bumps and such. So I was worried that the RNA which triggers the protein enchancer would have an effect too I was concerned as well, I talked with my doctor and he told me that I  should get it, so I did. Did not have any side effects or ever felt ill from it what so ever.\n\nI would talk with your doctor about it and any concerns you have, especially if you have any other medical conditions. None of my parents have Neurofibromatosis, but my dad has a very rare autoimmune condition, where the flu shot made him extremely sick and since 2018 he is been told not to ever get another flu shot again to avoid another trigger. He was also very sick for pretty much the whole year of 2019, lost a ton of weight and had to learn to walk again and retain his strength. His doctor instructed him not to get the shot, every time my dad has has one of those episodes where his kidneys shot down, it is worse every time and his doctor is afraid if he ever has another episode again it will be it. \n\nUltimately it is your decision, do not feel pressured to do anything you are not comfortable with. But my advice would be to speak with your doctor about it. I had Pfzier, mild side effects. Im also on TRT, you noticed increase in bump and lumps whilst on T? Could you explain the \"help men feel like kids again?\" I do not understand the steroids connection. I had Pfizer. Shot 1 I had a bit of a heavy arm about 10 hours later.\nShot 2 I had a very sore spot where she stuck the needle in. Sore enough to be not able to sleep on it.\n\nAnnoying, but by morning next day it was gone. Have not had anything out of the ordinary since then. Moderna, no side effect beside pain in the place of shot and couple of hours fever after second shot. No need to worry. The best two side effects:\n* Not dying from covid19\n* Reduction in anxiety from fear of dying from covid19. Sure, I was thinking of one the local DJs or sports talk guys and what he says advertising the place. Those therapy clinics test a man\u2019s free testosterone or available levels etc. they use some chart that says an adult man should have X amount   Young men gave XX amount. With XX amount you recover quicker. Have more energy. More stamina. Build muscle faster. All the things you could do in your youth. I am older so I am at the annoying age where you call a 20 year old man a kid. So that is what I meant. Also the steroid connection. Testosterone therapy had an effect on my body chemistry that adversely affected my NF. I was worried that the RNA in the vaccine that creates the protein or whatever would have a negative effect similar to the testosterone Therapy It was more than slight. It was pretty extensive over my chest, arms, stomach, etc. it is more evident when I get hot and work out but there all the time since going through a few Months of that. wow, sorry to hear that. Ive been on T since '08, only positive results so far but ive always thought that i should be on the smallest dose possible, ill always consider this when i ever consider increasing the dose. I know T promotes the Mtor pathway, and I know the Ras pathway has mek and erk where neurofibromin downregulates it. I also see that these two pathways crosstalk with each other. therefore defective neurofibromin can  cause these pathways to be unregulated, in my opinion. Got that moderna..first shot had me feeling a little funky for about 2 days.\n\nsecond shot, felt totally fine...aside from a slightly sore arm.\n\nnothing noteworthy, get that shot! \n\nnothing to fear Can you help me understand that little better? \nT helps it? Promotes it? What is Ras Mek Erk?\nMaybe the T is not what spurned my outbreak of nuerofibromas  Thank you so much. I think there is an overwhelming about of peer pressure and societal pressure to get the vaccine.  People who are making an informed decision to not get it are being labeled as uneducated or careless for not getting it. Automatically lumped in with the conspiracy theorists. It is not like those that have not gotten it due to health concerns are not being careful and doing their best not to catch or spread it. 100% agree. There are people out there with real concern as well as those with medical reasons that prevent them from getting the shot. People need to stop going after those individuals, especially when they do not know their whole story. basically mek and erk are what researches are targeting now to treat NF1 neurofibromas etc. Neurofibromin (which is defective in Nf1 individuals )suppresses mek and erk (part of a cell growth/division pathway). Therefore NF1 may have this pathway pushed into the direction where we see all the symptoms that we know about.  \n\nstudies of neurofibromin structure, interacting partners, and functions  \nhave shown that it is involved in several cell signaling pathways, including the Ras/MAPK, Akt/mTOR, ROCK/LIMK/cofilin, and cAMP/PKA .\n\nEssentially I am thinking that our bodys adapt and a few workarounds to combat a broken pathway.  ie robust AMPK response to downregulate Ras pathway. \n\n  \nRecent studies have shown that AMPK signaling can also reversibly regulate hyperactive Ras signaling in cancer cells . \n\nampk and is target for diabetes (metformin) and there are some research looking into modified diet for NF1 individuals. Moderate Carbs, low in LCFA but supplemented with MCT and some l-carnitine. some even suggest NF1 are some what resistant to developing diabetes type 2 (lower associated not causation).   \n\n\nAs far as Testosterone  is concerned, it is well know to activate the Mtor pathway which is essential for growth but NOT good to be excessively activated if you want a long healthy life (david sinclairs work). which is what I believe you have concluded. \n\nAll these pathways have very new research being engaged and they all seem to overlap and relate to one-another, hence why they are research targets.\n\n(\n\n I got J&amp;J a while back ago, and I seem to be doing great so far!", "I want to feel beautiful I hate this. I hate feeling scared of finding new spots, I hate worrying over my looks and whether or not someone will notice my spots/fibromas.   \n\n\nI want to feel beautiful but it feels like I will never be beautiful for as long as I have got NF. I hate it. I want to be normal, I want to be able to live without worry of suddenly finding a life-threatening tumor. \n\nI am terrified that one day I am going to find a fibroma on my face or somewhere very noticable and that my already low self-esteem will absolutely plummet. \n\nHow do I cope with this? Not sure what to say other than you are not alone. Reach out to support groups, even r/neurofibromatosis. We all have those feelings at times. I have felt the same, all my life I have had a pretty nice body. A body that ladies generally like.... but my NF made it hard to keep my shirt off. I lived in Hawaii from age 13-20 its very normal for guys to not wear a shirt... probably more normal than wearing one depending on location and time. \n\nI have had some pretty girlfriends, really pretty ones. They just did not care, so that means no matter what, you will eventually meet someone who will not care. I cant exactly answer your question, but just stay mentally strong. Things will work out, i cannot count how many times I was made fun of, I actually started to understand why a person might shoot up a school.\n\nI have some on my face, my torso and back is the worst, a few under the skin.  My wife does not care, it doesnt bother her, we have a good looking toddler. You just have to stay strong and surround yourself with good people.\n\n If you want i can take a picture and send it or post it..... not sure if that will help you. My toddler has it, so far he is good. My sister who was 3 at the time had to go through chemo, she is 11 now and is doing pretty good. we all been there luckily i do not have any on my face but I have them all over my head but the hair style I like requires my hair to be short on the sides to wear they are visible and have them on my back and chest as well as a massive plexiform in my leg that would require massive invasive surgery.\n\nI guess I am some what blessed because I have an extremely beautiful woman (completely out of my league) who (although sort of insulting but IDC) says she likes them because it is kind of of a horror film lol, plus I have amazing eyes according to everyone.\n\nI personally just stopped caring about it because there is nothing I can do about it. I feel like a horrible person when I think about it because my Mom had NF1 and I got it too. My mom has it much worse than me and I just....  I do not want to look like she does. She is a beautiful person, but she is not what I think of as beautiful. It is one of the reasons I do not want to have kids because from what I have heard the fibromas grow more/get worse with hormonal shifts and that is the last thing I want. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCurrently I only have two on my face (one on the eyebrow and another on my temple) but they are not too noticeable.   \n\n\nBut I still get overly anxious over my looks despite my fiance telling me he loves me no matter how I look. I do not know if I am just being crazy or if I need to talk to my therapist or what. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just feel so crummy and I know I do not have it nearly as bad as most people but I just.... I feel so fucking bad and I do not know how to handle it. I only have two on my face right now but when I look at my family members who have NF it scares me because I never want to look like they do. I feel horrible for thinking the way I do, But I just do not find them pretty.   \n\n\nI am terrified of finding more or finding one has grown but I know I have to keep track of them at the same time so its like I am stuck in a never ending loop of terror and anxiety regarding these.   \n\n\nAnd I mean... I have been diagnosed since I was just six months old so I should be used to this but I cannot understand for the life of me why its just starting to bother me now. as we get older we see what we consider imperfections more than we did when younger, I honestly did not care and then for a while I was insecure about them because I thought they made me look bad, but I decided that it makes me.\n\nI was diagnosed as a baby due to a doctor who just happened to have done a study on it, they then looked at my dad and siblings to figure if it was spontaneous or genetic and my brother and dad were determined to both have it.\n\nIt will get better I Promise and you should not feel bad about how you feel about your other family members, you just need to make sure that you do what you can to not make them feel insecure about it.\n\nI would not worry to much about getting any new ones just live your best life, worrying about what ifs is no way to live. honestly in my experience most people do not care about it and the ones who do, that are nice will just be more concerned, there will be a few that are jerks (had a few in school) that will be a-holes but that says more about them than it does about you. Just got to remember that you have dealt with this your whole life, things we deal with a good portion of people have not, we are a stronger breed than most you can over come anything. You lost? All you can do it take one step at a time. I have small nf tumors on my face and little bigger than a ping pong ball on my neck sized tumor. Along with having been born with a lazy right eye. It sucks at time, but life is way too short to spend my time worry about my looks. I have to enjoy life while I have it, because tomorrow it could all be gone. Real beauty is what is on the inside. That is what is most important. The person we are on the inside, not the outside. I completely understand and sympathize with your feelings. There are days that I am also worried to near-death about how i will progress or whatnot. But I am getting better at handling the anxiety.  \n\n\nFirst off, if you have got a mild case (as most people with NF1 do), do not worry too much about a future scenario where it might go on overdrive and you will be covered noticeably. It might not happen. It would be a waste of time to not enjoy the body you have now in its current state. You do not want to look back and think of all the time you wasted being worried about something that might never even come to pass.  \n\n\nNot saying it will not progress. It will. That is just how NF1 rolls. But it might not progress to a degree that you imagine it to. You may remain mildly affected up into advanced age. This happens in many cases, and most of those people are not online moaning about their worries, which is why it seems like all the cases you read about are bad. It is estimated that 1 in 3000 or so people. That is actually common. You would think you would see visible cases more often if that is the case, but it is not. It basically proves what medical papers state: Most NF1 cases are mild, with only cosmetic issues that are very manageable.   \n\n\nLastly, I know this is cliche, but looks are not everything. No, f'real. The people in your life who love you do not love you for the way you look. People do not care. While I cannot say how you will feel about your own body (that is your own journey), I can say with confidence that the people around you who genuinely care for you probably do not mind the bumps.   \n\n\nIf you need someone to talk to, feel free to message me! I completely understand how you feel and it might help to talk to someone who is going through the same thing. I feel you. I struggled with my relationship with my body for years (most of my life, really) but primarily outside of NF (not thin enough, not strong enough, not fast enough, et cetera). I did a lot of therapy in my mid twenties and I felt like just as I finally stopped hating myself for all of that, the bumps started showing up. They are still small and only noticeable, but I hear of more and more people who say the bumps got bad in their 20s/30s (so much for only worrying during puberty, pregnancy, and menopause), so I worry it is the start of a trend and I am just... tired. I do not want to hate myself again. I already hate myself for my fears of looking like people who I have met and are lovely even though I do not think less of them I still do not want it for me. \n\nI also always worry that a routine whatever for something is going to turn up something else that even if it is not life threatening it is still something I have to deal with one way or another. That is where we are now lmao You cope by just living ya best life. Got To be confident with it ! Trust me I got a lot of reasons to feel ugly due to NF1 complications.", "Son recently diagnosed My 11yo was recently clinically diagnosed with NF1. He has several CALs and freckling in the groin. The genetic test came back negative but was told this is common. \n\nWe went to have his eyes checked for gliomas and everything looked good. He has no other indications as of yet. \n\nMy question is what happens next? His pediatrician seems unfazed, the geneticist did not schedule another appt and his derm has yet to say anything. \n\nIve seen where others get MRIs routinely, have yearly exams (with which doctor, im not sure). I just do not know where to go from here. \n\nAll in all, he seems perfectly healthy other than the freckling and CALs.  Any input is welcome! Set up an MRI through your pediatrician with an NF doctor. They can tell from a brain scan. Genetic test coming back negative is common? I thought that was a for sure indication.. A negative test is NOT common at all, and if this was the case, I would consider Legius syndrome which has all the skin characteristics of Nf1, and is also known as Nf1-like syndrome. Legius presents none of the tumours issues we have in Nf1.\n\nI would request the genetic test for Legius , so test for the SPRED1 gene. Up to 4% of children diagnosed with Nf1 do not have it, but have Legius.\n\nNf1 is a very complex syndrome with age-related manifestations. Optic glioma occur at a younger ager than 11 but I am not sure they can be ruled out by an eye exam. An ophthalmologist might detect a thinning of the optic nerve, but I believe it is advised that any child diagnosed should have a brain MRI at least once. Optic glioma can be asymptomatic .\n\nIf you cannot get a referral for the Legius test, if you have the mean, consider paying for it yourself, it will be around US$375 (250 for the test, 125 for the medical consultation) with Invitae.\n\n( Just make sure you get him regular checkups. Since puberty can be hell for a  young boy with NF (trust me, most boys who have NF start puberty young and it was good and also bad) be sure to ask questions since most of us have been through it. Thank you all. I feel a little lost with all of this and the doctors do not seem to provide much guidance so I figure who better to ask than those who have been through it. \nAs for the genetic test coming back negative,  I was told there are certain indicators that yet to show on these tests but that his CALs and freckling do indicate he has it. \nIt took almost 3 years to see the geneticist the first time so I would probably be better off using the link provided. \nAgain, thank you all for the input! When I was a kid I am 20 now, I got checks every few years and sometimes a MRI. You should ask the doctor or neurologist if a MRI is necessary. My doctors are experts in NF1 when I was younger no one knew what I had so my advise is be sure that they have enough experience :) I hope this helps a little bit", " Pain and Mental Health Management A warning. This is going to come off as really ranty. I am 20 years old, but pain is something I have been dealing with for as long as I can remember. But, in the past few months my pain had been getting a lot more intense. So, I went to the doctor. \n\nI have since received 4 MRIs, and still awaiting results of my latest visit. But as far as we know at this point, the nerve roots in my spine are being compressed. Likely by NF tumors. There is 3 I can feel for sure beneath the skin close to the spine. \n\nThe pain is getting unmanageable at this point. The pain keeps me up at night, and it leaves me exhausted and unmotivated throughout the day. I can feel it affecting my performance in school and that is only making me feel worse. \n\nI was mostly writing this to get some emotional support, but if any of you have any advice for pain management or even just keeping your mental health    in check, I would greatly appreciate it! \n\nThanks", "i made a petition for us because we need more awareness brought to Neurofibromatosis ", "My mom swears to Christ that valiums helps her with the pain ", "The next time someone calls NF the Elephant Man's disease I am going to punch them in the throat. Originally that is what they thought he had, but, in the 80's through genealogy it was confirmed that Merrik if fact suffered from Proteus disease and NOT NF. Still to this day I see articles getting it wrong and even doctors getting it wrong.  Why the hell cannot we get more information out there so more can be learned about it. It bothers me that even into days world, people are misinformed. I still hear the same comments and if I am in the mood to tell people I will. Why does it bother you to the point of violence?\n\nPeople are misinformed, so what? Politely correct them.\n\nThat you feel the need to \"punch them in the throat\" because of a misunderstanding gives the impression  you are deeply offended that someone might think you have Proteus Syndrome and not NF.  What, how dare someone think that you have such a hideous deformation? after all you might have problems but at least you are not that disgusting, right? \n\nDo you realize how belittling that is to people who do suffer from it? It is a rare condition most people have never heard of, if they do not get it I tell them oh the elephant man \n\nAnd then they get it and I inform them about it.\n\nDo not let it anger you to violence, it is unhealthy. I agree that there is too little info out there.  What is out there can be really frightening and focuses on the appearance of those who have been dramatically affected.  Almost no attention goes to all the other aspects of NF that are so challenging.  \nWe need a better PR team! Maybe I should be more specific.  I am referring to doctor's that do not know better and family members who do not know better.  It is got nothing to do whether or not it is Proteus syndrome or cookie Monster syndrome.  Back to my first point, people connected to the disorder need to be better informed. As far as my second point, I do not like the term \"Elephant Man's disease\" regardless even if it was NF.  It is extremely insulting. No one should use the term, especially a doctor. The term \"elephant man\" is horribly insulting no matter who or what it is referring to As someone who has NF and has growths - it is not a horrible insult.\n\nDo not live in anger There is no stereotype surrounding elephants being ugly or bad in any way, this is a narrative you yourself are spinning up. I would spend some time looking inward about why you are harboring so much anger in your heart. People with proteus disease are no better or worse than you, the comparison should not be causing such an intense reaction. My anger come from the ignorance of people not knowing what they are talking about.  Also Merrick was treated like a freak and a monster. Treating someone like that for any reason is wrong.  You do not call someone elephant man or frogman cause you think they look good. He was treated horrible.

As far as I can remember, I have always had a plexiform neurofibroma on my left side (although for a long time, I did not know what it was). It sort of wraps around from my stomach around my left hip and goes a little bit onto my back. Most of the time it just looks like fat and is not noticeable, especially under clothing, but it is quite big and probably weighs at least a pound.\n\nI am unsure right now whether to get it removed, so... if you guys can help me... what are the benefits to getting plexiforms removed? risks? reasons to get them removed?  ( Every surgery has risks, but do do tumors let alone cancer. I recognize this is not a fun decision to make but I would get it removed if I were you. Most doctors will generally only remove if it is causing severe pain and discomfort or if it has become cancerous or if it is in a location that could become problematic. This is mostly the case as the tumors are very difficult to remove because of how they are wrapped around the nerves and then because they can grow back.\n\nI was diagnosed when I was 15 and in twenty years I have only had four surgeries to remove tumors, two of which were in the last four years 2014 and 2018, these were to remove cancerous tumors that were causing a serious amount of pain. In my upper right leg and then my upper right arm.\n\nThe other surgeries I had were in 2007 to remove tumors that were pressing against my spine and then in 2001 to remove tumors on my lower right arm.

I have been poking around this subreddit and figured this was the best place to post.\n\nMy wife has NF1, when I met her, she was never \u201cthat girl that has NF1\u201d, to me she was just the girl I fell in love with. She told me about her condition early on and it really did not bother me, she has a very mild case that was caught early on when she was born. She is very away of her condition, she knows she had some learning difficulties growing up and has some bumps and latte spots, but other than that no surgeries or major issues yet. She was and always has been a quiet person. After we got married, we started talking about kids, the topic of her condition came up and we decided that even though she has a condition, it has not had any major negative impact on her life, so she would feel ok if our child ended up with NF1.

I feel like I might be hyper fixating on this because I am anxious of being a parent. Like if it was not NF1 I would be worried about other things that run in the family.\n\nWe have one of our first appointments coming up and we will be discussing it with the doctor, if they are not familiar with NF1 we will try to find one that is. \n\nIs there anyone that is in a similar situation or has kids with NF1?

Its a very similar pain to the confirmed by doctors pain I have had from other fibromas, I was told as a child that a doctor could feel a lump in my foot but now nothing the doctors do not care, they do not offer me anything but sending me to a CBT (talking therapist for chronic pain). \n\nNow I am at the point where I feel like I am going insane over this pain that is so very real, but doctors refuse to acknowledge it.

Have you have any X-rays or MRIs done? Yup, I have seen my neurologist numerous times had x-rays MRIs the works but the kicker is my old specialist (under the children's hospital) was the guy who originally said there was a fibroma  there I would try contacting that doctor and asking for your medical records regarding that. Then share it with your current neurologist or get a second opinion. They all looked at it and just say 'nah cannot find it you are fine go home' I would get a second opinion or if possible reach out to your former doctor and see if they can recommend someone if they are unable to see you. I think he might have retired sadly I was in my early teens when I last saw him and it was at a specialists children's hospital and as for second opinions I have had about three two neurologists and a foot specialist he actually said there was stuff he could do but retracted that statement at my next visit. So I am stuck with nobody listening and me not wanting to have to deal with it anymore it cause me to have a mild breakdown last year which was not fun, I just want to cut my foot off and be done with it all.

I just never cared about tomorrow the way I should. \nLike in a why bother sort of way. \nShould have cared more at 18 about where did I would be in my 40s I think it is that I have never had a girlfriend.

And insurance denied further surgeries until I was able to get to a much better specialist 6 years later. Even then it had become too complex.

As of right now (according to my neurosurgeon) C-6 is not an  emergency, but will have to come out eventually, it will only get worse from here. \n\nI spoke with my neurosurgeon for about an hour and he said he does have experience with NF and that as of right now there would be no great risk to remove tumor at C-6 which is putting pressure on the cord with some cord damage.  All this can be seen on the MRI films.  Of course, yes, there is a risk that in the worst case scenario, I could be paralyzed, but he told me, it is not something that he is too concerned about. \n\nI have had prior surgery at C-3 and that was a horrible recovery process. That was 13 years ago.  This surgeon now said that he would not go near C-2, C-3.  \n\nI have also had two other surgeries at L-4, L-5.  One in 2000 and again in 2008. After the last one I now have a dropped foot on the left and no reflexes in my knee.  The current issue is at L-3 where I have a fibroma that is 3cm \u00d7 1.7cm half inside the spinal column.  My pain management doctor said it cannot be removed and I cannot even get an epidural shot.  The oncologist and surgeon also agree that it is inoperable.  \n\nRegardless of C-6 I still need to start on one of the mentioned meds (or something similar) cause my entire lumbar spine is a nightmare.  I still have to talk to the neurosurgeon next month and see what he says, but I am probably going to avoid the surgery at C-6 and just start on one of the the meds. I am just a little concerned about this side effects, but I am not going to let that scare me away from the treatment. You need to talk with the surgeon, I have had three very successful surgeries all done in Chicago, one in either late 2006 or early 2007 to remove tumors crushing against my cervical spine and then in 2014 and 2018 to remove cancerous tumors, in my right upper leg and right upper arm.  I had my C2 intraspinal ependymoma and T7 layered meningiomas removed in Phoenix, AZ at Barrow Clinic. The one at C2 was supposed to kill/paralyze me. But the surgeon saved my life with only a minimal reduction in spinal function. Really, REALLY minimal.\n\nCome to Barrow. They are the best when it comes to tumors like this, even \"inoperable\" ones.", "Brigatinib I just got back from my NF2 routine appointment at Johns Hopkins and they suggested a new drug that is to be available relatively soon, it is in early testing on humans,that is designed for lung cancer. Does anyone know of this yet? Anyone know of its effectiveness? We are waiting for FDA approval of Selumitinib. My young daughter has NF2. It is expected to be approved as early as this fall. I will look into the drug you mentioned. Oh my gosh,if you are right, I am so excited!  It could be life changing! this is super exciting. I have had NF1 since birth (36 years.. fun times). This would be amazing. :D Is selumetinib actually indicated for NF2? I thought it was nf1 specific while Brigatinib was more specific to nf2.   In addition, I have read that there are 8 different MEK inhibitors being trialed for neurofibromas.  In the latest edition of CTF newsletter they also mentioned two researchers finally looking into CRISPR-based genetic therapies for NF1 as well.", "29 Y/O M plexiform neurofibroma removed from bladder on the 9th of November 2020. I was having trouble with frequent urination,\nSo I saw my GP and he ordered some scans as he would not prescribe any medication until he knew what the underlying problem was. \nThe ultrasound I got done, all the radiologist mentioned on their report was that I had a thickened bladder wall. \nSo my GP referred me to one of the best urologist/robotic surgeon in Melbourne who looked at the same ultrasound and noticed there was a large lump, say the size of a medium size coin in Australian currency. \n\nSo my Urologist order a CT scan also with contract dye on an empty bladder to get better pictures which he shared with several specialist surgeons at the royal Melbourne hospital who all had the same opinion, that the lump was most likely a benign tumour related to my neurofibromatosis type one diagnosis. (Which I was born with, multiple caf\u00e9 au la spots and small NF lumps.) \n\nI am fortunate enough to have private health insurance, so I was booked in for a cystoscopy to remove the tumour and cauterise the area. \nI had to stay overnight after having this surgery done because I had a Catheter which over the course of a 15 hour period flushed out and drained my bladder with 24 litres of saline solution. \n\nI was discharged the following morning and it was extremely painful to urinate for 2 days as I was mostly urinating blood and passing large scabs. \n\nI saw my Urologist today and he had the lab results back, it was a benign plexiform neurofibroma which was attached and pressing against the bladder wall. \n\nHe gave me a referral to a neurologist so I can keep an eye on my NF and get regular brain and full body MRIs.  \n\nOn the 26th of this month (November) I am seeing my plastic surgeon who is an elite surgeon with many years experience in practicing and teaching surgery around the world. He has worked with quite a few NF patients over the years, which is also covered under my private health Insurance. \nAnd around my body I am different places under my skin, he is removing a total of 8 neurofibromas, and the best part is I can go home when I wake up from the general anaesthetic, it is only a day surgery. \n\nI am just wondering what is the % rate of Neurofibromas grow back after they are removed. \nI am well aware that sometimes they do not grow back, but sometimes they do. I have been trying to do some research and cannot find a rough figure, does anyone know the % rate of regrowth after removal. \n\nAlso, now that I am going to be seeing a neurologist to get regular scans and check ups, probably once a year, \nWhat else do I need to be aware of? \n\nI am quite physically fit, I have very few symptoms that have not caused me any complications in my life (apart from the lump in my bladder which is extremely rare for them to grow there) \nMy two favourite things to do in life is to play music and travel to NZ to do quite advanced but amazing multi day hikes. \n\nMelbourne Australia is quite different to the states, Australia has a genetics clinic, but they do not have a specific clinic for NF, so they best I can do is see a neurologist.\n\nAny advise anyone can give me on how to look after myself and monitor my condition. \nI am not in a headspace where I am constantly worrying about it, if anything I have become too complacent. Just need to know how to look after myself properly while not worrying about all the potentials or worst case scenario.\n\nThanking everyone in advance and hope everyone is well. I am a 24Y old F( live in Belgium) Couple months ago they look away a plexiform neurofibroma in my leg. It starten to changing/hurtinh. Went to my deratologist. After an echo en MRI they discoverd it. Starting next year i will see a couple is specialist every year. \n\n- dermatologist\n- neurologist\n- internist\n-  ophthalmologist\n\nFor just once also the  geneticist to talk about future plans for kids . I will also see a gynecologist every year. But every women shouls do that.\n\nI have a number from someone Who coordinates  the care for People with NF. He will call me when its time for my apoitments. Maybe something  like that is in your hospital. Also if somethings changing or hurting , you should let it checked. In here we also do not have a specific clinic for NF Unfortunately, there really is no way to know the percentage of whether tumors will grow back. Generally even when removed these types of tumors can grow back and new ones can show up at anytime any old ones can grow bigger. I have had four surgeries related to my Neurofibromatosis and I have had some grow back over time. \n\nNeurofibromatosis can effect everyone differently, so it is hard to say how someone will be effected when it effects someone else differently. \n\nThe best advice i can give is take it all one day at a time. Be aware of any changes within your body, any pain that is new and different and keep in touch with your doctor.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask.", "Cupid's Undie Run I thought it might be fun to talk about something fun related to NF. We see so much doom and gloom...\n\nHas anyone taken part in the Cupid's Undie Run? I am in Australia, and it was brought over here a few years ago...my mum is now one of the race directors for NSW. Sadly, we cannot seem to get people excited about it like they do in the States.\n\nIf you have done it...were abouts in the world are you? Did you have fun? We are in Atlanta, and have gone all except for 1 year.  It is always an amazing event here.  A few years ago, they had to move to a bigger venue.  I think for me what makes it most amazing is that 95% of the people at the event are not affected.  The local (and national) race organizers are a great group.  They are the first ones to volunteer for any local NF event and are extremely close with many of the families.   That is awesome! \n\nSadly, in Australia, we struggle to get numbers. The events are always small, and it is also really hard to get venues willing to host it. They always ask, \"You will not really be in your underwear will you?\" and things like that...then lots of people do not want to run in their undies, so we try and make it costume themed.\n\nWhat sort of venues has it been held at over there? Is your run doing the open bar for a certain donation level?  Open bar always helps:) Ours was held for the first few years at an Irish pub, them moved to a bigger bar in Atlanta.  Perhaps some grass roots advertising would help you? I have seen people get on the local TV news, set up cupids promotion stands at running expo's, hand out cards at other runs, hand out cards at bars on the weekend, stand outside sports events handing out info.  Good luck! Many venues do not want to comply with that. The one we had last year said they would do a 'free drink voucher', but then on the day they said 'No, we never agreed to that. You have to buy your own, also, if you come inside, you need to cover up.\" Many venues do not want to host the run at all...or even have stuff posted about it. It is the whole 'undies thing', it is really sad. So, even though we have local newspapers writing about, maybe on commercial...mentions on the radio, people still are not interested. \n Never participated but know the guy that used to run the event, Chad. My mum knows him too, from one of the NF groups that she is a part of. He was the one that asked her if she thought we could get it going in Australia...my mum was a part of the NF Endurance Team in America I ran in Denver in 2016. I found out about it just a couple days before the event (from this subreddit!) and managed to pull together a lot of donations and it ended up being a lot of fun. I went at it totally alone but met some nice people (though it was a bit weird as they were all mostly there for the open bar and I just casually mentioned that I actually had nf). We also lucked out with an unusually warm day.  \nI was out of town for it in 2017 (I ended up flipflopping cities during consecutive weekends). This year I opted out in favor of a CTF 5k (was living in New York, so more concerned about cold and also feeling a little jaded reflecting on how much people would give a shit at the different runs). I think I might try to do both in 2019.  I have no idea where I am going to be living, so I am holding off registering for now.  That is awesome!\n\nIn Australia, it is summer in February, so it is normally rather warm when we do it. I think last year it may have been around 90. We played some videos of how the States do it, and people were just amazed. As I mentioned in previous replies, venues here just do not want to support it, and it is really hard to get people interested. \n\nHave you done other runs for CTF before? Did you meet anyone from the marathon team? If you did, you may have met people that my mum would know from when we lived in the States. Never did it but know the guy who co-founded charities ", "Anyone had COIVD-19 vaccine with NF1? Hello everyone, I thought I would ask if anyone has gotten the vaccine with NF1? Asking cause a bit worried about getting it, because do not know if it can react with the fibormas. IF you have had it, what were your experiences if you do not mind my asking?", "Facial tumors getting worse I was born with NF1 and have visible tumors. They are not *terrible* but they are there. Last week I went away to upstate NY and when I came back I notice that the tumors in my face were a lot more prominent. My dad noticed it as well. I am scared. I am only 25. I do not know what my future is going to look like but I know it is not bright  Have you seen a doctor about getting them removed? Or is it harder to remove tumors  on the facial region?  Best to see your neurofibromatosis doctor and get some scans of it to see what is going on. If it is growing in size within a short period of them that can be cause for concern. I also have a large mass on be neck/face in the right side that I and my doctors are keeping an eye on. Going To go see a dermatologist because I have also noticed a small mass on my arm internally. May be a nodule or cyst but want to be sure  I get the painful ones removed but the ones on my face are too many in quantity and too small to properly remove unfortunately. Considering lazer surgery at this point.  Yes get it checked out. I had one removed from my right upper arm in April. It had been causing a lot of pain since last summer in 2017. It turned out to be cancerous, but thankfully the surgeon was able to remove all of it just like he removed the one from my leg in 2014 that was also cancerous.  I am sorry to hear that. My dad and I both have NF, his condition looks a lot worst than mine. However my mom did tell me it was worse when he was younger. \nNF is not the same for everyone. I have the soft tissue ones mostly on my back. I do however have, a leaning disability, dyslexia, poor balance and coordination and memory problems, slight speech impediment, depression and such. \nI would try the laser if I were you. If it works it would be one less to thing you are thinking people are looking at when you are in public. \nI am sorry If this post comes off as being rude, I do not want to discourage self love. You should love your self and there are people that will love you regardless. \nI do think that some of us with NF have it pretty good compared to others. I try to be thankful(?) because it could always be worse.\nJust take things one step at a time.", "Online support groups I am a 17 year old with NF 1. I was wondering if there was an online support groups because I been look into it for several months now and there is none near me. I been dealing with NF since I was 2 years old and none of my family had NF. Theres groups on Facebook. I left them a couple years ago due to drama though. Ok. Thanks for the recommendation,I am just looking one that has no drama. It is been a few years so it might be better now. And it is really hard to avoid drama now a days Yeah. I been avoiding dram for the past 3 years. There are a few Discord servers as well. If that is something that interests you. Not nearly the drama of the Facebook groups. I hate the Facebook groups. Not just the drama, but everything there is people feeling sorry for themselves and complaining. I joined to feel better and have a connection, not feel bad. Can you give more information about the discord!? Please CFT \n\nAnd I cannot fund the one for the NF Community.  But I believe that someone has posted it before... Thanks t  Hey if you have the discord I would love to join I added links in another post thread. But I believe if you do a search in the sub they will both come up. Thanks! Hi there! I have sent you a pm :) Hey, I am 22 but I was diagnosed at 4 and no one in my family had it either. I am here if you need support!", "Going in for surgery on my foot on the 9th. As the title says, I am going in for surgery to reduce the tumor in my foot on April 9th. I wanted to wait as long as possible before doing this again, before it became a problem. The goal was to wait until it was advisable, by the doctor, to go under the knife again. That time has come. My right shoe barely fits anymore, and i am having more and more trouble walking back and forth to the grocery store every few days. But I am not scared of going under it. I just wanted to post to let anyone else know that if they are about to have to go through surgery as well, you are not alone. Just remember the doctors are there for you, and that life goes on. No matter what comes out of it, remember. You fought on. And that is what counts. Good luck on your surgery.  Thanks Giid luck Good luck!\n\nYou have got this.", "Fibromas and the way they look on scans So I have a large mass in my right ankle. It was originally believed to be a plexiform fibroma but on a more recent MRI the podiatrist I just moved to noticed that the mass has 'no definition', which she said Fibromas normally do.  She believes its one of three things\n\n1. A plexiform fibroma with a lot of fluid around it\n2. A mass that has become cancerous\n3. or a hemangioma due to some discoloration in the area.\n\nI just had a CT scan on Monday so I have to set up the follow up to that but I am wondering how many of you have had a fibroma turn into fibrosarcoma  ? I am wigging out a bit here . On scans of your plexiform Fibromas have the doctors ever mentioned a lack of definition of the mass? I have had two surgeries to remove plexiform fibroma in 2014 and 2018, they were both cancerous. The one in 2014 they knew right away from the mri scans that it was cancerous, it also require a fluid drain thing after surgery for about two days. With the more recent one that were fairly certain it was cancerous, but needed a biopsy to confirm. Both of my surgeries were a success. \n\nIs this doctor a specialist in Neurofibromatosis? The podiatrist I see is not a NF specialist but a family friend has worked in the OR with her for a long time and recommended her as she has removed many fibromi over the years. my actual NF doc is about 2.5 hours from me. Depending on what the podiatrist says about the scans I may go for a second opinion as well or at least have the scans sent down to philly. My Neurofibromatosis doctor is also about that far way. I wish you good luck.", "Turmeric capsules Hi all, I have NF1, and was wandering if turmeric with concumin or whatever they are called, actually work or not? Any positive stories? Err.... I do not believe in miracles. But... work for what? pain? Cyst? neurofybromes? Apparently tumour reduction Mmmm... I do not believe. And even if is true, it was an extract of that with a hard medical control... I do not want to be a grinch, but I listen the same story with another plants like \u00bfSoursoup seed? *( I am not english speaker so I use the Binomial name too: Annona muricata)* , for example\n\nFor the moment, there are a medicine that are testing (in kids):  selumetinib. I do not know why kids and not adults, but is in Phase III, Sadly we do not have licensing for selumtinib in the UK yet, fingers crossed Same in Spain, but this is because they are testing. Is not an official treatment yet. But EU declared it an orphan drug. Maybe UK are not a EU country now, but I think that your country will aprove soon too.\n\n( In 2017, an Italian clinical trial showed a reduction in both plexiform and cutaneous neurofibromas in participant who were following a Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) combined with a curcumin capsule. The 3 control groups, including one following the MedDiet without the curcumin or the typical Western diet with or without curcumin showed no improvement.  The study is called \" Synergistic Interplay between Curcumin and Polyphenol-Rich Foods in the Mediterranean Diet: Therapeutic Prospects for Neurofibromatosis 1 Patients\" but is often referred as the Italian study amongst the Nf1 community on Inspire or elsewhere.\n\nThis is the link. Please make sure to go an look at the pictures of skin and MRIs. \n\n(\n\nA small study, by all mean, but let us not forget that the importance of a study is not given by the numbers of its participants and a Dr called Marshall has received in the past a Nobel Prize of medicine for a study that had just one participant. \n\nThe volume of reduction , 28% for plexiform is similar to the reduction offered by Koselugo without the side effects and without its price tag (150.000$ per year) and most importantly risks for the heart. \n\nNow, before you all go on Amazon and buy curcumin you need to focus on the title of the study  and the words :polyphenols: and synergetic. \n\n\\*\\* Plants have hundreds if not thousands of compounds, polyphenols, flavonols, and phytochemicals,  that activate enzymes, cell receptors and genes playing a key role in DNA damage prevention/repair, anti-inflammation and so on. Often, when combined, their effect is exponentially higher. A recent study has also opened a very important prospective for the use of plants. We all know, Nf1 is a down regulator of the RAS pathways and ti is known that RAS is notoriously \"undruggable\" reason why we go downstream and try our luck on MEK and mTOR. However RAS can be down regulated by plants ( \n\n\\*\\* Curcumin has many effects, a recognised mTOR inhibitor ( (  and we all know that mTOR and MEK are the target of nf1 drugs. Curcumin is also an iron chelator (and this is important for all parents and those with sever iron deficiencies, be careful) meaning it removes iron from the cell and an old 2005 study hypothesised the use of iron in neurofibroma growth ( . \n\nThere are thousand of papers on how polyphenols are crucial in anti-growth signalling in several disorder ( and in Nf1 there is a problem with cell signalling . \n\nAnother word of caution. The liver  will block curcumin. Therefor, to bypass the very important filter function of the liver, most curcumin supplements include black pepper which inhibits the liver function. I am not comfortable with this and there have cases in the world of hepatitis caused by curcumin supplements, so I take a type of curcumin without pepper called MERIVA.\n\nIf you use fresh turmeric in a soup or smoothie, it is ok to add a bit of pepper and extra virgin olive to increase absorption. \n\nNow the diet part. The MedDiet is not pizza, pasta and gelato. \n\n\\*\\* It is a high plants diet, with some lean meat and fish, lentils, fruit, extra - virgin olive oil  WITHOUT processed food, processed grains (everything done with white flour from cheap breads to cookies), no processed oil, no fried food (crisps, fries, ....) . The variety is very important as well as the quantity of vegetables.  \n\nHere is the description from the Italian study: \n\n\" The traditional Mediterranean-style diet included the abundant use of olive oil for cooking and dressing dishes (extra-virgin olive oil\u201450 mL/day with &gt;2000 mg/kg total phenol concentration as determined by Folin-Ciocalteu\u2019s assay\u2014Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), the consumption of \u22652 daily servings of vegetables, \u22653 daily servings of fresh fruits, \u22653 weekly servings of legumes, \u22653 weekly servings of fish or seafood, white meats instead of red meats or processed meats (burgers, sausages), and avoiding the consumption of cream, butter, margarine, pate, duck, carbonated and/or sugared beverages, pastries, industrial bakery products and desserts, French fries or potato chips, and sweets. Curcumin was supplemented at a dose of 1200 mg to the third and fourth groups at lunchtime \\( Finally, all patients were invited to restrict foods known to contain curcumin. \" \n\nIn Italy, the NF1 clinics now include dietary guidelines in the care of their patients.\n\n\\---------------\n\n I put all those links and I have hundreds more to  it has nothing to dot with miracle but all to do with science. I am just putting another one, a bit off topic about another supplement we should all take, vitamin D  (  and I take mine with vitamin K2. \n\nFor too long, we have been told, there is nothing that can be done, wait for symptoms and we will deal with them. This reactive approach has no place in 2021 when we know so much more about gene activation silencing, and sadly also so much more about NF1 that if we wait for a problem to become symptomatic it can be too late. \n\nA preventative approach is encouraged for many genetic and neurological diseases as it has been proven  it can slow down the increase of manifestations and their severity, form ALS to MS to Huntington, diet is a key part of treatment. We on the other hand are forgotten. \n\nI changed my diet in March 2017, 4 months prior to the publication of the Italian study, and I saw a reduction/ reversal  in my newly formed (nascent and flat)  neurofibromas. \n\nTalk to your doctor if you are considering giving it a go. \n\nThe mantra we have all heard \" nothing can be done for the neurofibromas\" is not true. They can come and they can go. There have reports in the literature that they can away. This is one of them (  a woman was put on a drug for her arthritis and this drug accelerate the growth of neurofibromas. The drug was stopped, the neurofibromas disappeared as shown in the pictures. \n\nI am not saying eat a carrot, take a curcumin pill and you will be fine. NO. I am saying there has been a study that showed improvement with diet and supplement. Amazing, thank you so much for your post, and spending time to write that all, I will have a research into this over next few days Please do so. \n\nThe impact of food and natural products on epigenetics is so complex it is impossible to put all in 1 or even 100 Reddit posts and the science moves constantly. When I started trying to control the evolution of my Nf1 with diet, the microbiome was in its infancy for example, and now it is all the hype. This to say the science is dynamic, and we should not be complacent. \n\nNow for the non-vegetables palate, it might be easier to eat the vast amount of vegetables in a smoothie. Here are two videos of the almost same recipe which gives the explanation of micronutrients in the first and polyphenols in the second \n\n(  and ( \n\nI personally prefer soups as it allows me to add onion and garlic which I could never drink. I also drink green tea,  moringa tea and eat a bit of mushrooms every day. \n\nGiven our high risk of cancer, even if the plant-rich diet does not have an effect on our NF1, it will be chemopreventative. This was was prompted me to adopt an anti-cancer diet and the impact on skin neurofibromas was an unexpected and surprising side effect. I am confused how curcumin with black pepper carries the hepatitis risk, but the Meriva does not carry that same risk?\n\nAlso - the Meriva supplements i am looking at seem to have some kind of sunflower extract, is that the same as sunflower seed oil? I have been hearing how bad seed oils were, so i am not sure if it is the same thing. I should have made myself clearer. I am not comfortable with taking anything that interferes with the many functions of the liver. Full stop. Also, there have been cases of hepatitis with curcumin supplements , not saying it was caused by the pepper, but giving a warning about supplements. \n\nMeriva curcumin \u00ees usually of higher quality so with less risk of contamination. \n\nSeed oils in the amount present in a supplement compared to a bag of crips or industrial foods is something that does not worry me, because I eat a very high amount of vegetables, greens, fruits, loading on micronutrients and polyohenols. One should worry more about a folate (green vegetable) deficiency which causes DNA double-strand breaks in the same way as ionizing radiation  ( ( ) . I use this example to make the point that the few grams of seed oil is nothing compared to the damage a typical American diet causes. Damage can come both from what you eat but also from what you are missing eating. \n\nBut back to Curcumin. If you spend some time on Pubmed, there close to 17.000 articles on curcumin. \n\nI have no doubts nutrients play a role in the evolution of our disease and it is equally clear to me that the solution is not a pill but the synergy of all of them. I requires effort and motivation. \n\nI am not recommending a diet / supplement  to anyone, I am describing the only dietary intervention study that has ever been done for nf1 and giving my opinion on why it had the results presented. \n\nHopefully more studies will be done one day. Interesting, I appreciate the information!\n\nI am still in the diagnosis phase of NF1 after having a neurofibroma and other symptoms as well, but i am pretty sure I have it.\n\nI have been taking curcumin with black pepper the last few months and it has helped other inflammation pain issues, however, I noticed my AST &amp; ALT doubled from 20 to 40. Still in a healthy range, but somewhat concerning. Am contemplating switching to Meriva, wonder if that will lower the ALT &amp; AST while giving the curcumin benefits &amp; not inhibiting the liver function? The honest answer is \"I do not know\", sorry.  Maybe to stay on the safe side, stop taking it for a couple of months or buy fresh turmeric instead. Some years ago , Greger did a video on fresh vs supplement, and fresh came up better. ( \n\nWhen there were the cases of hepatitis in Italy, I stopped taking mine for a while and I did not notice any worsening. I however drink green tea and moringa which are both anti-tumour and extremely safe,  and people have been drinking those for thousands of years, so even if curcumin was missing, I was eating/drinking plenty of polyphenols rich food. \n\nIn the study however, those on the MedDiet without curcumin did not improve, so it is something to take into consideration. How to safely take it. A highly reputable brand is preferable. \n\nIf one decides to take a supplement, we should aim for the highest quality and most reliable brands. Cheap manufacturers might use fillers, heavy metals or contaminants. \n\nI hope your will get answers soon.

I (26F) just stopped using the progesterone-only IUD, and I have noticed more tiny ones popping up. They could have already been there, but I was wondering if anyone had a similar experience. Oh my gosh yes! And I am the same age as you but I am off of it completely for close to a year now and I have been noticing more than what I had before. I do not know if it is just that they were already there and now I am paying more attention and looking for them or if they have actually increased in number. You are not alone! I have never really noticed my NF1 until the past year when I started seeing more tiny ones, but I had attributed it to my Skyla IUD. Last month I had it removed, but I swear that I have noticed a few more tiny ones appear (like the kind that you can only notice in direct bright lighting). Perhaps it is just the change in hormones/aging? Mine got so much worse after I got off birth control like 10x worse not trying to scare you. I did not notice more when I had my mirena IUD removed but I have noticed quite a lot more, and some growth of old ones since becoming pregnant. What kind of birth control were you using (if you do not mind me asking). Not at all I had the depo implant in my arm actually it was a three year implant. Ahh gotcha. I hear that the progesterone-only options contribute the most to neurofibroma growth. While my growths are fairly mild, I definitely wish I had not gotten the IUD altogether. Can I ask what your fibromas are like and where they are? I am also 26F and have nf1. Most of mine are mostly on my torso and thighs, they look like bruises and are more internal than what I have seen in pictures (I do have some bumps though). My dad and brother both have NF1 and theirs look like all the pictures I have seen, so maybe the bruisey ones are from when I took BC? So mine vary, but the majority of mine are the tiny kind that resemble pimples. I have a few on my face, but they are in my smile lines and just look like dimples (not really noticeable to others). In the last year in which I have had a Skyla IUD, I have noticed more pimple-like ones on my stomach, shoulders, forearms, and smile-lines. I do have a few that are purple/bruise-colored, but those were the first ones that I ever developed those during puberty. That is interesting. I have a few of the pimple ones, but I mostly get the bruise ones on my boobs, sides, and thighs. Was not sure if it was related to BC, but then again I have been off it for a few years. \n\nMy case is fairly mild overall, here is hoping it stays that way!", "Head size for adults Does anyone know what is big head size for NF1 Adults?  Women or men?  My head is larger than average nut not unusually big.  It would be interesting to know a specific number. For people that NF1. Versus people that do not have NF1. I heard that skull size is bigger.  Bigger than most non adjustable hats... I have so much scalp to cover \ud83d\ude23 I just measured around where the rim of my hat would be... 60 cm\n\nAverage normal head is around 55 cm, so assuming I measured correctly, I got 5 cm of vacant space  Thanks so much..  You can find NF-1 specific growth charts ( although with all things NF-related, the sample size is small. Hey ya.. You are so smart... Are you in the health care field?  Nope... just good at Googling :-) Turns out it is about 58cm", "The importance of 2nd opinions I was told I had sub-dural spinal cord tumors that were inoperable and pain management was my only recourse. Partly due to the support of this sub I chose to get a second opinion. \n     My 2nd opinion has told me I have NF2 for sure. He said my largest tumor and two of it is close friends need to be removed urgently and admitted me to his hospital as fast as he could. I am typing this from my hospital bed. \n     My new doc is getting me a brain MRI as he suspects I have brain tumors bc NF2 and I have started having issues urinating which he fears is related to my tumors. He almost predicted it would happen. I am so glad I got that 2nd opinion. I am really being taken care of and I am finally getting my surgery! \n\nTLDR: If your 1st doc cannot help you get a 2nd opinion.\n\nThanks you all.  Wishing everything goes well. Please let us know how it went when you can! Your previous post was less than one week ago. The fact that your new doc had you admitted immediately shows how wrong your old idiot doctor was. They even managed to misdiagnose you...\n\nThat being said, go kick that tumors ass! Yes! My new doc said we need this now or I will lose bladder, bowel, and sexual function. I feel so lucky to have this great hospital. I just got my chest x-ray and a lumbar CT. If my brain MRI is clean I am getting the biggest spine tumor taken out and that should finally stop my pain! Wait so you have acoustic neuromas and were not diagnosed with NF2? I do not know if I have acoustic neuromas yet as I have only had spinal MRIs so far. My doctor thinks I might have acoustic neuromas because it is common with NF2 and I have tinnitus and hearing loss. I also have an eye that drifts off to the side which I never thought about so.....  he is getting me a brain MRI to check for tumors.  Nah this guy understands believe me. If anyone\u2019s confused it is me lol. He and the neuro he is teaching both checked me out looking for ways to diagnose me. They found a lesion in my eye and my eye drifts off to the side, also my hearing loss and tinnitus which made them think it is NF2. Also I have no CAL spots at all. Finally I have a tumor on my leg which he was able to feel all this along with the placement of my tumors is what made him say NF2. He said nf1 usually has evenly distributed tumors on the spine where as mine are all lumbar. \n     He ordered an mri of my brain and said he expects to find brain tumors. He deals with nf1 all the time, but said NF2 is much rarer one he only sees a few cases. He said if I have no fluid on the brain we can go ahead with the surgery and when the tumors out he can send it off to be analyzed and that will give the final distinction between NF2 and schwannomatosis but he said he is sure it is NF2.  Yeah I think I am in great hands now, but I know exactly what you mean. Since ive been in here my surgeon has visited me and his subordinates have visited me twice to check on me. Feels great. My last doctor was a neurosurgeon. Head of neurosurgery at my city\u2019s largest hospital. He told me nothing could be done. Made my wife cry and shattered my hope for the future. Now I have got hope again!  my question for your doctor- are there any MEK inhibitors that are recommended as part of your post-op care? What are mek inhibitors? ", "Great news!! Today the house passed a bill that includes directing 20 million dollars to NF research. Now the bill will go through the senate and then to the president\u2019s desk. \n\nThis bill includes funding for various medical issues as well as other non-medical related issues. \n\nHistorically this bill is passed by all necessary branches of the government. \n\n\nThis is great news because we typically only get 15 million for NF research. This is great news. This will put us one step closer to finding a cure. What is the bill called? HR 7617 What country is this for? House, Senate, and President - safe to say it is the USA This funding is for the USA, but the research done can have an impact on people with NF and related health issues across the globe there will not be a cure you might as well just accept that now, they will be able to treat it better, but most cases Chromosomal issues like NF are not curable as it is rooted directly into the DNA.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt will help them figure out when and why the mutation happens, but then still decades off finding a way to prevent that if possible I agree it will be tough to find a cure. Just have to be optimistic. Im definitly not trying to be pessimistic, just realizing that with it  being coded into our DNA just I realize it is not likely Yes, it is through the CDMRP which is a program in the DoD", "Facial palsy surgery \ud83d\ude06  I just thought I would share my post op face, an eyebrow lift, a weighted bar in my eye and a fat graft to my forehead and cheek for balance. I document my health journey via a blog if anybody is interested I will point you in the right direction. \n\nOver the next few months I will likely require a procedure for a growth on my hand. I will also be documenting all of the holistic health therapies I will be trying x x", "Nf2 &amp; progesterone questions  my awareness has always been that PR encourages growth. Just looking at some studies &amp; cannot decipher if that is correct or not. What are your experiences or knowledge?", "Is it possible I might have Legius? I am 16 and so far I have only ever had the spots and very mild macrocephaly, no other symptoms besides very few lipomas. I do very well in school. However, I inherited mild pectus excavatum from my dad and that is about it. I went to a dermatologist and she thought it was the dreaded NF1, but I want a sure diagnosis but I do not know where to get a genetic test where I live as I am not from the U.S.\n\nAlso I am still terrified unless I have a sure diagnosis that it is NOT NF. If it were Legius I would probably cry from all the relief. Legius is probably the least harmful of all the RASopathies out there, since it is mainly cosmetic and some mild mental problems in some people that can be fixed quite easily. Maybe talk to a specialist in neurology. But I only had spots outside of two very small tumors until i was around 18. Now 7 years later they are still growing in. How are you doing now? I have a problematic spinal tumor", "NF1 related anxiety Women with NF1 are at a higher risk of having breast cancer before the age of 50. This brings me a lot of anxiety. I am wondering if there are any women who are 50+ and have not gotten breast cancer? I am part of a NF1 page, and it seems like most of them have gotten it. That does not give me much hope. I have not heard that and I see a Neurofibromatosis specialist on a regular basis. I am 37, while I have had cancerous tumors removed from my upper right leg and upper right arm, I have no concern about this happening. Worrying about what if will drive you crazy and will not do you any good. You should be enjoying life and living in. No one knows what will happen tomorrow, for all I know I could be hit by a bus next week. If I were you I would take each day one day at a time and not spend another second worrying about the what if\u2019s. My mom is 60 and has not, and her mother had it reoccurring. My mom gets checked annually, of course, due to having a 1st degree separation. All 3 of us have/had NF1, grandma passed away maybe 25 years ago, though (I am 36). I have a referral from my PCP to go get mine checked as a precaution, but the touch-test seems good. I disagree that \"most\" have gotten it. \n\nMany people who post here are going through a significant issue when they post. \n\nI also imagine that since people with NF1 get MRIs at a FAR higher frequency, these cancers are found far more often.\n\nI respect the fact that your concerned about other issues that are a higher risk for us, but do you occasionally get MRIs to check up on your NF1 situation?", "anyone with these type of feelings? anyone jealous of their siblings because you are the only one who has it and they do not? they can go through live, la dee daah and have no fears of anything happening out of the blue? worrying about getting pregnant and then passing it on to your child as well? struggling with school and then not having a near successful job as they do? feeling like you are going to have to stop working because of complications? feeling like your spouse will leave you because bumps can appear anywhere, anytime? seriously, I am just this whole damn mess and I hate it. I do not have these type of feelings. However, it is common to feel worried about the future, especially if you have kids. I have had enough issues related to NF during my lifetime, I have undergone 27 brain surgeries, several of them being emergency. I have occasionally fell unresponsive and had to be rushed to the hospital. These issues have never stressed me out though. I like to maintain a positive attitude and not worry about the future. I know it is easier said that done for some people but that is the way I like to think. If you want to have another kid, you should go ahead and try. Hopefully you have a strong support cast that can help you in any way you need. I am confident that you will live a long, enjoyable life. thanks for those positive words of encouragement. what makes you so positive? I have always been negative and always wish I were one of my siblings. it is so difficult for me to accept myself of who I am. I hate the skin I am in. luckily, I never had to have any surgeries so I feel blessed regarding that but it does not mean I will not need them. Not really. I am the oldest and I have three younger siblings. I would never wish this upon them or anyone. I do not really worry about whether Neurofibromatosis will cut my life short, many people can live a long time to their 80s and that pretty good to me. I take each day one at a time, because yes life it short, whether you have Neurofibromatosis or not. Worry about all the what if with Neurofibromatosis is not going to make you feel better or change anything. No one knows what the future hold. Live your life to the fullest and be happy doing whatever makes you happy. I have always had the whatever happens, happens kind of mentality. I just do not let NF define who I am. Even though I have had a bunch of surgeries, I am actually considered to have a mild case of NF. I have not had a surgery since 2009. I do not really have a lot of neurofibromas and I am really comfortable within my own skin. I have had a very active social life for years and I get out and play a lot of golf. I get along with just about everyone. People even come up to me when I am out since I am recognized by being a regular at certain places. Everyone is dealt different cards from the day they are born. It is best just to live every day to the fullest. People should accept you for who you are. You should definitely try to get out as much as you can. You still have a lot of time left. Tbh I had have those feelings but keep them to my self. Yo To my knowledge, me or my husband do not have NF (we have not been tested yet), but I have a baby with it. I pretty much have the same fears, regarding to getting pregnant again. I fear the fact that my second baby might have a health issue too, or that it will be healthy, and my firstborn will feel the same way you do. I feel guilty about thinking to do anything else for myself (get another baby, go back to working full time and not be there 100%, every second that he needs me). I think anxiety comes with motherhood, no matter how healthy you are yeah, it is difficult. I have a low opinion of myself and always did even when I was younger. so here I am in my 30s still feeling the same way. I do not want people to feel sorry for me but it is just how I feel and people mistake it for that. I was raised in a loving environment with my awesome parents. so it was not a bad upbringing at all -- so that is not why I feel so blah about it. I am just a jealous person and I am very direct so I am not afraid to say anything and sometimes I should probably keep it to myself but if I leave it bottled up I feel like it will do more damage. \n\nsince I have NF, I have a 50/50 chance of bringing a child into the world with NF. soo that is on my mind. I really do not want one child but I feel like it may be the case. why risk it? but then I think of my child and I am certain that a sibling would be a nice thing to have since I get along with all my siblings. but again, I feel jealous of all of them because they have no serious health concern that can change at a drop of a dime. I try to remain positive I do, but then things happen (2 miscarriages in a year). \n\nI feel guilty that I am working but it has to be done to provide a brighter future. our public schools here are not good so I am working so we can support a private school fund for our child. it is okay not to be there 100% of time. pre-covid, daycare was a great option for me because of socialization. now due to covid- my child is home with me and it is difficult since attention craver my child is! For starters, I am sorry for your loss of your two children. Yes.  I am extremely jealous of my sibling who does not have NF. However, I would not wish this upon anyone.  Other people have their own issues and fears can come up for anyone at anytime. \n\nI have those same fears and thoughts regarding work and the bumps appearing at anytime.  \n\nMy wife and I decided not to have kids based on our lifestyle and expenses. NF did play a small roll. \n\nNF comes up in my mind a lot, sometimes it takes over my thoughts for days. I get sad about having it.   \n\nIt might sound silly to say this but it is okay not to be happy all the time. I personally would NEVER EVER think about bringing a child into the world. Knowing that I have NF1, as it gets worse as you age. You can always adopt. Or adopt an dog or cat. Plus with NF1, it does affect our brains in some way emotionally. It is just a given. You can have as much talk therapy as needed. It helps at times, other times you just forget and need reminders. As most of us look very normal. And, yes.. the MDs just do not get it.  Because not one MD has ever made to medical school with NF1. At least none that I have ever read about. And this is a very rare disease. Someone can do superficial reading about it, but it more than that to really know what it really is all about. How it affects people lives.  MDs do not have the time to listen. They just treat the medical symptoms. Maybe along the way they will learn a bit more.. But I think it is really hard for them understand non scientific aspects of people lives. I am a first time mom with an infant who was just diagnosed with NF1.  I can totally relate to your comment.  How do you deal with the worry and the anxiety?  I am in a state where I just want to cry each time I see or think of my little one. I went through this state, it gets better with time. I guess I relaxed a bit after we had all the medical exams, and found no tumors. My little one is one and a half now, and his development is on track, he is just a bit smaller then other kids. I guess we are lucky he is not having a hard time at the moment. I concentrate on how amazing he is, instead of worrying about what might happen (I went to medical school, I know exactly what might happen). If and when something happens, we will deal with that in that moment. My husband refuses to call NF an illness, it is just a condition that needs monitoring. On the plus side, I am a lot more patient with my baby, I am very careful to be there for him, to give him the environment for a normal development, and I am always there, in the moment, to celebrate every achievement that he has. He is a happy little kid, with a few spots on him. And whatever comes along, it will be normal for him, and we will always try to be there for him. Also, therapy helps :))) That is a really horrible thing to say. So people with NF do not deserve a child of their own? People with NF can live long lives as my doctor mentioned. I have not had any issues or surgeries and the doctor said it I made it out of my teenage years I should be on a good track and not have any bad issues later in life. Do you have any children of your own?  Thank you for your comment.  It is what I needed to hear. I love that your husband does not see NF as an illness but as a condition that needs to be monitored.  I definitely do not want my thoughts or feelings to limit my child\u2019s growth and development, and I most certainly do not want this condition to define her.  \nIt is exciting to hear that your little one is thriving and I genuinely hope that he continues to do so as he grows older.  May i ask if there was any concern regarding his motor skill development as an infant?  I know children develop at their own pace but, I cannot help but worry that my little one is not on track with her milestones.  Her doctors say she is doing fine and I guess I should trust that - I am just an excessive worrier by nature (yes, therapy will definitely help!)\nAnyhow - thanks again for your responses. I was worried because he would not turn from his tummy to his back and later on he would not crawl. He just did not want to and yelled at me to help him. And then when he was 10 mo, one day he just stood up all by himself. He did not need crawling and turning any more, and he is right on track with gross and fine motor skills, also the cognitive tasks. We all worry, because we are mothers. But we do have to trust the doctors, and also remember, these kids are all different and they all reach their milestones at different paces Yes, the worry is real! But hearing your lives experience helps tremendously so, thank you.  We spoke with a genetic specialist who was able to answer some of our questions and reassured us that we are already doing a great job with our daughter.  This helped put me at ease and even made me feel much more empowered.  These past few days I have not really been thinking about her NF1 but rather just enjoying my baby and her silliness. I agree with you. I could never even think about bringing a child into this world. Just the thought of me giving someone the anxiety and depression I have to my child is enough for me to make the decision. \n\nI am a 31 year old female, and I have a \"mild case\" but the tumors never stopped growing and they are getting worse. I saved up for a few years and got the electrodissection surgery for like 8k. That was a little more than a year ago and nearly all the tumors have grown back in addition to some more. No plastic surgeon in the area takes insurance so I cannot even afford to take the really big one off my forehead, chin, scalp, ankle, butt or throat. I see big ones growing under my neck that are non-operable. I went to go to one of those fancy plastic surgeons like the Kardashian's visit but she told me she could not help then charged me 500$ for the consultation. I would literally give up everything to not have NF.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is been a while since I have been in a relationship. Anytime I find someone I am attracted to, they cant handle the tumors or my depression. I am just going to be alone and I have to be ok with that.", "How many of you have reached the point where you yourself have said \"I accept it and I am just going to deal with it.  Tbh, I have been there since day one. There was no other option for me. You cannot pray it away, there is no magical pill to take, so I think for most of us it is just a \"take it one day, one tumor st a time\" kind of thing. It sucks, none of it is fun, but you just got to do it. I stopped playing the \"why me\" game. My priest told me that I am not being punished, that this is just my cross to bear. It took a long time but that is where I am at. I am definitely not there yet ;-; I super hate my body lmao but I hope I do get there one day Does strong positive thinking help anyone? I am talking about convincing yourself that you feel well and you can deal. You may not be able to win, but you may be able to deal. My issue is not with appearance but pain that I have been dealing with for 27 years, I think I am getting this soon I am. It is just a fact of life for me. I played sports, overcome alot of crap, and I am pretty happy. \n\nTo me the time off work and disruption to my life is not worth removing them. I am in the same boat, I am more or less unscathed appearance wise, i look normal in long pants and short sleeve shirt. And as I have gotten older i feel less weird about leg braces in shorts weather and being shirtless (all my skin stuff is on places that you dont see unless i am naked or shirtless) \n\nBut I was in a lot of pain for a long time. Then over time i think my nerves have started giving up. I have more numbness and less pain.\n\nI used to get random pain. Like sudden electrical type shocks that make my muscles spasm and it was agony. Now I get those once in a while but I am more numb and itchy than in severe pain. \n\nAs to what you said in another post about positive thinking. I dont think it ever helped me when I was younger and severely depressed and pissed off. If anything what helped me was getting angry and deciding fuck it if I die I die and I am going to do what I want until then. I honestly still believe that one day this shit is going to get so bad I kill myself. But I no longer fear that day I just sort of accept it as a likely possiblity. Though given that my pain has decreased compared to my early 20s (though i was prescribed lots of opiates back then so maybe that whole decade was just a waste of time and energy) maybe I will live long enough to die from smoking cigarettes and drinking too much beer. I am 26 and I am getting there. I have realised I am more bothered about what other people think than myself and well.. fuck other people tbh because this isnt their life this is mine. I am now confident enough to wear what I want. But I cant spend my life hiding and being unhappy when I have my children and for now good health God damn.\nIt is like you are reading my thoughts.\nI feel exactly the same, except I still experience a ridiculous amount of nerve pain.\nI know it is just going to get more complicated, and one day I will leaves this place. I am not scared, I just hate that it will hurt people I care about... Same. I do not have much pain but i just hate my body and face Sucks you are in a ridiculous amount of pain. I think if things do not get easier you will at least get harder It is been my entire life. I have grown up knowing nothing else. Sure, it sucks a lot (for me, pain is the worst aspect). But I think if it as, maybe I have it bad but I do not have it the worst. I am fairly stable for now. The one thing I am worried about is getting more fibromas on my skin as I get older. But I am just taking it one step at a time. I do not want to worry every day of my life over it. Plus, there are new advancements coming out. Drugs for tumors, electrodessication for fibromas on the skin. Even potentially drugs for those in the future. I get depressed sometimes but it is okay. You are allowed to feel the way you feel. I think I have after a long time and many emotions about 6 months ago it happened. I was due to have surgery next year. It is been cancer due to a small worldwide pandemic which you might of heard of (Covid 19). I am actually glad. Not told them yet but plenty of time. I have just recently been close. I am 43 and have been on disability since 2004 when my health got bad. What is getting me there is that even though I am suffering I do not tell my family about it cause they will only worry and stress over it. \n\nNext week I have to spend the day at the hospital for more blood tests cause of my hormone levels from my thyroid. Doc said levels can be a sign of ( I cannot remember the word he used ) cancer. I have not told my parents yet. I have accepted the biological parts. I am on disability. It is my physical appearance that I struggle with I also wear a knee brace and an ankle brace on my left leg. I just have ankle braces so that is nice for the symmetry I have accepted it for my entire life. I have had enough issues such as brain surgeries and a learning disability but believe it or not, NF has not stressed me out. I rarely even think about having NF. I enjoy life to the fullest and I am not afraid to go out and live life normally. I cannot believe you people have accepted it. I am still so grieved over it, not the diagnosis itself but knowing I will never be like my friends , always a hair different still hurts a lot. \n\nDx at 2 denied NF\u2019s existence until 18. Same! I was diagnosed at around 9 or 10, a long time ago.  When I graduate from college and get a job, my first few paychecks are going towards plastic surgery.  After that, I do not care if I have to live in a shack if it means I can pay to look normal. i do not think i will ever get to this point. but, if i do, the thought of it makes me mad lmao like i want to be mad about it my whole life. it is unfair i am not like anyone else. i constantly have to be reminded of this. i think i have a right to be upset about it still. i have not been tired of feeling this way yet though.", "Tattoos? Okay soo... I was wondering if it was safe to cover up spots with tattoos. I am scared if I cover any Of my spots With tattoos they will rise. Has anybody done it? Advice? I covered a small caf\u00e9 au lait spot on my hand last year and absolutely nothing has happened. I have some raised ones on my arm, which I will not ever consider covering. \n\nI believe as long as it is small and not raised to begin with you will be fine. I have got a few large tattoos over scars and fibromas without issues. I have large tattoos covering both fibromas and caf\u00e9 au lait spots,  with no issues. I have had them for years. You should speak with your doctor about this. i have multiple big tattoos to over my spots to help with my self confidence. never had any issues \u263a\ufe0f Caf\u00e9 au lait spots are simple pigmentation of the skin. It is not un uncommon phenomenon. You can cover them with as much ink as you want. About the Neurofibromes, there should not be also no problem but consult your doctor if you want to inject ink into them. Allergic reactions might be more likely", "Taking growth hormones ? So I was reading in one article how a lot of People with NF1 are very short and that we have a growth deficiency but it could be fixed with growth\nHormones. Has anyone done this? \n\nCould it be possible to fix my growth issue with growth hormones?\n\nI often feel like I have the body of a girl and not a woman. I may be just over reacting tbh but both my sisters and my mother have a curvier body, more fat and muscle but I am thin and short. My son is 15. He has not hit puberty yet\nI know NF feeds on hormones so I am waiting to hear from his endocrinologist \nI would definitely speak to a doctor because a lot of people on line may have experience but I would trust a doctor more. I also look like I am 14 maybe not 30. However any type of hormones puts you at a greater risk for making the nf worse. Or at least that is what my doctors told me. When I hit puberty, my period also came with three brain tumors, intracranial pressure requiring a lumbar puncture, and the start of my journey with chronic migraines. I may be 5\u20194\u201d and built like someone much taller than me, but I would hate to think of how it would turn out with hormone replacements/enhancers. Wear your height with a badge of pride, it is one of the many things that make you you and shows how strong and resilient you are. We are all NF strong. All the love to you. \ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc99 For me they talked about giving me growth hormones when I was young. They decided not to, thinking that instead it would make my tumor grow more, and not me. Now I am 28 years old, 4'1/2\" and definitely feel like I have the body of a girl, not a women.... It is rough but it is who I am, and there is nothing I can do to change it, so I try to just embrace it and live my best life Our doctors have suggested against it. Hcg is the hormone they give I believe which is also the hormone made during pregnancy. We know that pregnancy caused more tumors to grow for many people because of the hcg. Therefore doing growth hormone of hcg is likely to increase the number of tumors. So unfortunately, I do not think you will find a solution in that. \n\nMy best recommendation to seem more womanly is make sure you dress like an adult so maybe check out some of the fashion subreddits? They could probably give some great tips! And hair and makeup subreddits too. I had early puberty, but I never had a growth spurt. In fact I was put on puberty blockers. However, I am still very short, but my doctor advises that growth hormones will also come with increasing tumour growth I did not even know this is a thing for us. Is this only for females? Or males as well. I am 1m80 and if it were not for that bungling surgeon I would have been much taller. It is for both.  But this only works for people who have a growth spurt deficiency. If you do not have one, you will not grow and ur going to risk getting more tumors You cannot take growth hormones once you have finished growing. Your growth plates are fused. They would have worked when you were a child, but as others have said, hormones tend to make fibromas grow more. So not sure any doctor would recommend it. I meant the lack of a grow spurt, sorry should have been more clear.", "Insurance will not cover electrodessication I finally found a doctor who performs electrodessication on Neurofibromas and my insurance is saying it is \u2018cosmetic.\u2019 I am heartbroken. Utterly heartbroken. It would have been a LIFE CHANGING procedure and now it is completely off the table. The nfs cause me so much pain and so much itchiness it keeps me up at night. I am honestly so devastated. I cannot see myself living with this condition if the few treatments available are considered non essential. I really cannot go on like this for years and years without any help. Unfortunately if something is cosmetic most of the time insurance companies will not pay for it, unless the doctor goes to bat for you with the insurance company and tells them it is medically necessary, that would be the only shot to have insurance cover it. You and your doctor would have to appeal the insurance companies decision in order to start the process. \n\nI have never had electrodessication, I have been taking pain medication, which has worked well for me. I take hydrocodone and tramadol. I also when needed have used icy-hot patches/cream. You should 100% appeal. Insurance companies have 2 classifications for **cosmetic** surgery vs. **reconstructive** plastic surgery. The latter is for conditions such as NF that can lead to disfigurement. Just because both procedures are performed by a plastic surgeon does not make them the same. Appeal. Often a medical person does not review these cases. This is frustrating but do not give up. Call your insurance company and ask who You should send your appeal to. Thanks for the info! I definitely plan on appealing. It is ridiculous that this procedure is counted the same as a boob job or skin tuck when pain and discomfort is literally the reason I am having it done. Definitely going to do this. I am assuming they saw a request from a plastic surgeon and just assumed it was non-essential (which is bs, honestly.) If they deny a second time, I may get a disability lawyer on the case as that is 100xs cheaper than the procedure itself. I am going to look to appealing with my doc\u2019s help. When I first went there, he said that some insurances give him issues but they do their best to make it work out for the patient. If I appeal and lose, I may contact a disability lawyer or someone who knows more about the system. In addition to appealing, I would also make sure that the procedure is billed correctly. I had electrodesiccation in the fall, and my providers used specific codes that insurance companies are more likely to cover. That is a good start with the doctors and appealing. I am not sure if a disability lawyer would be able to help in this case, usually they help with getting SSI, disability payments, Medicare/Medicaid. But it cannot hurt to call.\n\nIn 2018, I did have issues with my insurance saying they would not cover my surgery to remove a cancerous tumor, because it was out of network. My surgeon was even on the phone with them the day my surgery was supposed to happen. They denied it, so I did not have my surgery that day. So we started an appeal process, there were actually three different appeals. One filed by me, one from the hospital where I was having the surgery and another through my primary care doctor back home. A couple of weeks later I was able to have my surgery done by the surgeon who had previously in 2014 preformed a surgery and it was covered by my insurance company.  Just thought I pass this information along so you were aware that more than one appeal could be processed.", "Diagnosed I was diagnosed with NF at age three. Both my girls were diagnosed earlier this week. Just found this subreddit. So happy to have it!  There are some great groups on Facebook too\nMe and my son have NF \nI have met some pretty cool people there  I am in some Facebook ones as well.  As a person with NF as well I was so happy to see this subreddit exist  I was diagnosed when I was 15 (20 years ago) it is likely I am the only one in my family that has it, as neither of my parents, sibling, grandparents, aunts, uncle or cousins have it. There is a small possibility that a distant relative in my mom side might of had it, but no one knows for sure.", "Any research on whether NF1 is more susceptible to COVID? Sorry if repost, I went back 5 months and could not find anything.  My son is 14 and has NF1.  He lacks coordination and is mostly inactive.  He is not overweight, but I worry about his lung capacity since he is mostly inactive.  With that, I am wondering if he would be more at risk to COVID than a normal inactive kid due to his NF1.\n\nAny research on this? I have heard nothing, and I have seen my specialist recently. I have Neurofibromatosis type 1, I am 37, not hugely active, but do go for a walk everyday with my dog. I work at a school a few times a week and have gone out to eat with the family and gone to the store and returned cans. I have not gotten sick. \n\nThere does not seem to by rhyme or reason when it comes to this virus. I have known people who live under the same roof, where only one of them got it and the one who should have probably gotten it did not and is doing fine.\n\nI would suggest you speak with your sons doctor with any concerns you might have. Inactivity is not caused by NF1. Depression, because of pain, yes. Hopefully you can get him involved in singing or music to help with his coordination. Even video games require coordination. I am a parent and my child did not know she was in pain for 15 years until she had an infusion for her pain. I accepted when she expressed herself but she did not ever give up (because of he condition).You may want to have him visit a psychologist or psychiatrist (who understands NF) just to talk. Hopefully Camp New Friends will be open next summer. I did not say it was. My son was on chemotherapy for optic glioma when the first wave was in Canada. His oncologist said that there were virtually no issues amongst any of his or any of his colleague's pediatric patients as far as COVID went... Seemed like there was no difference between NF1 oncology patients and the general population. Thanks for actually answering my question! Appreciate it! There was a live video chat with the Children's Tumor Foundation and Doctors back in March. I remember them saying there was no indication any of the NF's were more at risk for COVID (though at the time there was not much research), but obviously everyone should seek advice from their own doctors. Here is the link:  I had it and I am fine", "posting again my friend just informed me that her child has had a freckle on groin area since 9 months of age. not sure if that is normal? the child also has freckles elsewhere on body but not under armpit. It is hard to say at this point, but I do not think that is enough to raise alarm with a doctor who might diagnose it. Unfortunately that is not enough to go on. It would be best for your friend to speak you her child\u2019s doctor about this. Most doctors do not know much about it.. seek a specialist it is a bit difficult to say at this point but like what the others are saying you should tell your friend to ask a doctor", "Skin Flaking off I am not sure if this is NF linked, diet, both or not related at all.\n\nMy skin around my face been getting very iterated ends up with my skin falling off in flakes, and when I shave is starts to bleed (why I think it is maybe NF as it is around a plexiform). And drys out fast\n\nHas anyone else seen this? I have the same issue with the skin over where I have my plexiform. I had surgery to remove it but it grew back. The skin over the plexiform (and over the scar) gets itchy and flaky. I have no clue if it is because of the plexiform, because of the scar, or unrelated! After much testing I have but it down to diet. If I eat crisps (if American or Canadian. chips) it comes back", "Worried Parent Hello all,\nI have been lurking around on this subreddit off and on for the last two years and am hoping someone can answer a couple of questions. I have SCOURED the internet for NF information and still cannot seem to get closure on our following situation:\n-We have a daughter who is turning 7 in a couple days. Smart as a whip, no learning/behavior issues, only 1 CAL spot and some freckles near her groin. 2 years ago I took her to the dermatologist to look at a random mole I found between her toes. Mole was fine, derm asked to see the rest of her freckles. She immediately noticed the freckling and asked about NF. No family history, no other diagnostic factors so far. The dermatologist went on and on about the disease and even referred us for genetic testing even though she did not meet the criteria.\nTomorrow I am taking her to our regular pediatrician, who will take some photos of the freckles and send them to the genetics dept to see if they think she should be tested. Here are my questions:\n-I have read that the genetic testing, if negative, STILL is not a guarantee that she does not have it. I cannot imagine stressing about this for years and years. Is it common for someone to not meet the criteria until puberty?\n-I have googled the shit out of \"inguinal freckling\" and every single picture is of someone is armpits, which is actually axillary freckling, not inguinal. How common is it to have groin freckles but not armpit freckles in NF? She has about 30 freckles and they are not super close together. They kind of go from her groin to around her whole hip area, so not super clustered. Also, she does not seem to have gotten any more in the last 2 years.\nYou cannot even google inguinal freckling without NF coming up. Does anyone have freckles down there without NF?\n\nI hope this made sense, and whoever is willing to answer this mess of questions, I really appreciate it. \n\nEDIT: It was just freckles. Am very grateful.", "When did you start getting the bumps? I am 36, and while I have a few barely noticeable bumps here and there, mainly on my left leg and upper torso, my case has been extremely mild so far.  \n\n\nBut I am so scared it will just shift to overdrive one of these days, especially since i am getting new small ones as the years pass by. When did yours come about, and how have they progressed? Specifcially, when did it start coming in on the face (obviously I am a little scared of this because it is the most visible part of the body)? Or has your face been spared so far?  \n\n\nAre any of you with only a few tumors even in older age?  \n\n\nSorry if my questions seem shallow and maybe offensive to some, but I am wracked with anxiety. I have actually wondered the same. And bc each case is unique I definitely feel the anxiety and worry when things will worsen and how quickly. I had maybe 3 bumps during childhood but around 17-18 years old, I noticed a large increase in bumps (kinds and size vary). I am almost 25 now and have a few dozen all over. The biggest ones are about the size of a thumbpad with varying depth into/ out of the skin (and that is really only like 2 bumps). I am definitely younger, but I hope this still helps in terms of comparison to my experience.\n\nEdit: I have two on my face, one in my lip. It is small and barely noticeable visually. However I can feel it (different texture) and sometimes it is a little more visible in light. The other is on my nose and it just kind of looks like a bump, nothing to conspicuous about it. Both are small, like pinhead small. I only have a few and they are fairly small, I have had them since I was a baby\n Mainly on my chest and stomach and right arm.\n I have been getting more recently though in other areas. Oh. If i may ask, how old are you? I am 26 I feel you on the anxiety. My first ones popped up around when i was in high school, and I had them removed in college. They were internal. I have had a few very small ones that popped up in my late 20s, and they have stayed the same for a decade, so i did not pay attention to them.  \n\n\nI have been getting new ones tho, after a decade of \"inactivity\". Still very small barely noticeable except under certain light. I am not bothered by their appearance right now, per se, but more of the fact that it is starting to progress again. It makes me anxious about the future.  \n\n\nIt is the anxiety that can sometimes be crippling, although i did hear that many geneticists agree that most of it should appear around puberty and slows down in progression thereafter. That is usually, but not always, the  case with NF1, apparently. I have had a few ones appear around that age as well, and then stopped for a full decade before i noticed new growths just this month. They are not growing as much as they are multiplying. I guess I should be thankful most of them have stayed small and is just often mistaken for a light-colored mole. I think it is common for new ones to develop in your 20s (I feel like I read that somewhere) mine mainly get mistaken for bee stings. Honestly I do not know why.  I seemed to start getting tiny bumps when I was nine, but they were not able to give a full diagnosis until I was 15 which is when things started to take off. Now I am 36 and have many large bumps, especially on my right leg. I have a very large mass. I got my first bump when I was about 11 I asked my NF specialist this SAME QUESTION! I was freaking out about the same thing (29 F). He is one of the top NF doctors in the Washington DC region. He honestly said it depends upon case by case but he said a high number of cases do not get more bumps/more severe bumps as they age. It is normal to get a few minor ones time to time, but nothing major. In my specific case, he said there would be a 1% chance that would happen. This is really re-assuring. I am 36 now and My case is still very minor, but I have a few small bumps here and there. Most are not bothersome and just look like flesh-colored moles. But I am getting more tiny ones recently. Hopefully, it will not progress to anything dramatic.  \n\n\nI hope your case stays mild as well! I am 36. I have always been very fit. I do not flaunt it as I am hyper aware that my appearance can change in a moments notice. \n\nOver the years I have had 4-5 that are pea-sized. I had one grapesized that I had removed.  Over the past 4 years I developed more pea-shaped ones. In certain lights, however, I have a TON of these tiny ones. Like a quarter of a grain of rice.   \n\n\nI have this fear I am going to be covered in them and then I feel super shitty for feeling that fear. I saw a lady at Costco the other day and I am very sure she had NF. I started reflecting on what it would/could be like if I start looking like that. It is tough to confront my own vanity and shallowness.  \n\n\nWelp, if I am covered by these at least it will help me determine who the shitty people are and who the good people are. I think some geneticists think that for most people, NF1 does not progress rapidly unless there are massive hormonal changes. How old are you, if you do not mind me asking. And when did it start for you? 35 and it seems to have picked up in the last year or so. I think it is absolutely normal to feel anxiety over the possibility of being covered in tumors. No one wants to feel shitty about their own body. A certain level of vanity is normal (and healthy) and totally not a bad thing. To want to look \"normal\" and blend into society and not be teased or ridiculed is not \"shallow\".  \n\n\nThat being said, hopefully your case does not worsen too much. But even if it does, you sound like you have got the mindset in place to deal with it. I am 28 with NF, I have not gotten any bumps. I had severe anxiety that I would get them as I was growing up, but it never seemed to happen... I hope you stay mild! Do you have any other symptoms? (i.e. Cafe au Lait spots, and how widespread are they etc.) I have an optic pathway glioma, so I am blind in one eye. I have had it all my life so it does not really affect much of my day-to-day, I can drive and I have some form of depth perception. I have cafe au lait spots all over, a bunch on my forehead near my hairline and a bunch on my neck. Smaller ones on my torso and waist.", "International NF educational resources \n\nThis is a series of masterclasses put on my e children\u2019s tumour foundation Europe focused on NF. It is made for medical professionals but maybe people here would also find it interesting. I find them very interesting and would love to even only access the videos, but I do not think that they are open to the general public. \n\nDid you manage to register for them? Hm\u2026 I am sorry that you could not register. I did some research in NF1 previously and that how I knew of this. I just typed in my credentials and got an automatic email with the webinar link. I do not think they manually go through the registration information and only send links to medical professionals\u2026", "Cafe au lait Spots on 1 year old. Hi,\nI wanted to start of by saying thank you to anyone reading this and taking the time. I am a first time mom with extreme health anxiety that I actually take medication for and see a therapist bit weekly about, so any input is helpful for my worrying mind.\n\nMy son has had birthmarks since birth. Including a \u201cmagnolian\u201d spot on his butt. I never thought anything of his birth marks as I have some and so does his dad. He even has one on the same spot that I have my large one on my lower back. \n\nWell fast forward to 2 days ago when I noticed a new birthmark on his shoulder. I decided to google what kind these are and I came up to CALS spots which inevitably led me to NF1. Needless to say, I have friend and vomited from anxiety multiple times since. (This is what happens during my episodes) and I have taken him in to his doctor. The doctor did not seem too considered but took a look and he has about 9. Ranging from dot like ones to his biggest 3 being on his chest /side / back. She said we will just watch them and take note of any new ones.\n\nBut I cannot simple just do that. Needless to say I am so scared. I keep googling if this many CALS spots could be normal without any underlying issue and of course google says no. I have already made a dermatologist appointment but that is for a month  away because no sooner availability. \n\nMy son is on track developmentally. He is actually very tall for his age (99th percentile) and average for weight and head (56th-60th) and is standing and cruising on his own. And no other notable issues.\n\nSo here I am, making this post, to try to get some sort of idea of what is going on. I have not been able to eat or stop thinking about it all day (anxiety sucks) and I feel awful thinking my baby having birthmarks could mean something more serious. \n\nDo these spots always mean NH1? Does the appearance of them really matter? His are very light (we are a light tan complexion as we are Mexican) and some you have to really look for. Most of them except the two on his side and back are not ovals rather random shapes with jagged/squiggly edges. \n\nHow do I stop losing my mind and feeling guilty like I possibly passed this down to him? \n\nI know my reaction is an overactive one due to my mental health. So thank you for reading this! \n\nAlso, to my knowledge, no one in my family has been diagnosed with NH and we all have some form of birth mark. Just not share how many. If you are concerned you should take your son to a neurologist who specializes in NF. I can tell you that without family history, he will need 2  of the symptoms to make a diagnosis. Some, like the freckling can take a while to show up. They can also do genetic testing to either make a diagnosis now or to rule it out.   \n\n\nWhen my daughter's cafe au lait spots started to pop up I changed her pediatrician. They completely wrote me off even though my husband has NF1. The spots could be something else as well. You would need a genetic test to know for sure. As for whether it was passed down to him, you will not know for sure unless you take a test too. I am not sure if mine is genetic or just a mutation as my parents probably are not going to get tested (I was just diagnosed in December at 38 years old). It is very possible to live a full life without having any problems or keep them to minimum. You are already being proactive about his health and that will work in his favor. &gt;I know my reaction is an overactive one due to my mental health. \n\nYep! I think as long as you know that, you are golden.\n\nMillions of people with NF live wonderful lives, even the ones that end up needing a lot of surgeries and attention still have beautiful lives.\n\nWe are not fortune tellers, we do not know what will happen in the future. It is usually not worth the elevated blood pressure and discomfort of vomiting due to anxiety and stress. It certainly does not cure NF, and it will not change whether or not your child has NF1, and at this point there is not even a diagnosis. WebMD is probably the worst website ever created tbh. \n\nI hope it does not sound rude. I have anxiety, and took medication for it for years, and as someone who has had brain surgery and been dealing with NF1 all my life, I am constantly fighting with the inner voice that seems to think it can tell the future. Humans are resilient. You are resilient. Science is amazing. We can handle NF1, we can handle having a loved one with NF1, we can handle anxiety about the unknown. You got this! It can be anything from simple birthmarks, an other syndrome, or maybe NF. You worrying will not change the outcome of the final tests. I am telling you this because I went through this. My son is 1,7 and I saw the CAL spots when he was around 6 months old. Went to neurologists, dermatologists, and they all said they will just observe him, since he was developmentally normal. Finally, I found a geneticist and got him tested, it came back positive.\n\nNow I have a diagnosis, but that does not make me feel any less anxious, or him any less normal :). Apart from the spots, and the fact that he is a little shorter, there is nothing wrong with him (we even did an MRI). \n\nAs guilt goes, whoever passed it on is not to blame or to feel guilty. It is an autosomal dominant disease, he had 50% chances to get it from a parent that did not know he/she had a genetic issue. There is a good chance none of the parents have it and it is a de Novo mutation, as it is in our case, apparently. \n\nYour mental health is important, because your well-being means your son's wellbeing. It does not help anybody if you do not take care of yourself and burry yourself in guilt and anxiety, you will just be a little absent from his life and that is not what either of you needs. After a certain number of CALS, the suspicion for NF1 increases. How many CALS does he have that meet the diagnostic criteria for NF1 in prepubescent individuals (5mm+). It is completely normal for non-NF1 people to get CALS. I believe a study said 10% of the general population has a CALS. Things to look out for with younger children is a ill art freckling and the development of lisch nodules during eye exams. I would not assume anything based on what you Google. If you are concerned, see a dermatologist who is aware of NF1. Thank you for this reply! Really brought some positivity to my current state. I appreciate it! Thank you for sharing! Your son is 1 or 17? Do they monitor him all the time? The doctor counted 4. But I counted nearly 7. Some are very hard to see like you have to use a flash light so not sure if she just missed those. He has no freckling anywhere that I have seen. The doctor suggested to just watch him but I made an appointment with a dermatologist! I myself was not diagnosed until I was 15, it was mostly wait and see growing up. Doctors always thought I had it, but results were always inconclusive. You can have a genetic test done on him, but there really is not much you can do to treat Neurofibromatosis. There is a drug that has been approved by the fda that help shirk tumors, but aside from that there is nothing more available out there. The best thing you can do is stop looking things up on the internet. One year and seven months old. He has a yearly ophthalmologist exam, we see the neurologist every 6 months, cardiologist, every six months, dermatologist, yearly, and he had an MRI, I do not know how often that will be. Also, I should get an appointment to a pediatric psychiatrist, just to be sure everything is going well Did you chose to get him tested since they said to just watch him? How many CALS did he have? My son has quite a bit but most are small. And I just started noticing that my husband has a couple I just never noticed them as he is Portuguese and has a lot of moles and marks so not sure if this could mean just birthmarks or what. Got him tested on my expense. We do not have any, but he have not been tested yet. He has around 10-15 tiny CALs, about 2 have around 1 cm diameter, the others are just a few mm-s 1 cm is 0.39 inches", "Are there any psychs or therapists who specialize in NF?

I am just really looking for advice. \n\nI have nf2 and because of it have 4 tumors on my spine. Now for like the past month this one spot on my back has been hurting like there should be a bruise there. But there is not one. Anyone have this problem with spinal tumors? Is it something to be worried about?   Tumors in/on the spine will not leave external bruises when they hurt. it is most likely a nerve that is pinched or a muscle that is spasming as a result of the tumor and some kind of acute event (like \"pulling a muscle\" or \"pinching a nerve\"). I have had a few situations like the one that you described. I recently talked to my Doc about it and she said the best way to get rid of the pain is to stretch, move, and gently work that area. The worst thing you can do is lie in bed all day and wait it out. The old thinking was that leaving it alone would help it heal, turns out it aggravates the issue. Take some advil, get up, move around, stretch, etc. (And you probably want to reach out to your med team, maybe an MRI is in order as well). P.s. I have about a dozen spinal tumors at the moment. Only one is giving me severe pain and it is only once every year or two that I have a crazy inflammation (like you are describing that lasts for weeks and weeks).  In 2007 I had tumors that were crushing against my spine removed. I was not having any pain, but doctors said I could wake up on day and not be able to move. Then about two year ago I had a cancerous tumor removed from my right leg. That was causing a ton of pain, it hurt to sit, lay, stand. Once it was removed that pain was gone. Still have the every day type of pain though. ", "Reggie Bibbs: A powerful lesson in self-acceptance ", "Brain tumor symptoms? Anyone here ever had a neurofibroma in their brain? What are the symptoms?", "Indiana and Insurance I have NF1 and I am 42. I have been previously denied Medicaid and HIP (healthy indiana plan) does not cover specialists. I have not had a check up regarding my NF in 10 years. It is been over 20 since my last MRI, and  18 years since I last had any reconstructive surgery. \n\nI am currently unemployed and need in the near future see a specialist. Any recommendations on what to do? You can hire a lawyer to help you get SSI and Medicaid. I did that several years ago, when they denied me, after I got a lawyer and had my case I was approved. The lawyer will be paid only if you win your case and with any back pay you are owed from the state. &gt; You can hire a lawyer to help you get SSI and Medicaid.\n\nThere are currently only two lawyers in town that handle that. BOTH declined my case. I have a lawyer who wants me to get ssdi through my parents (both deceased) but he is not a ssdi lawyer and is currently having a hard time finding another lawyer who knows how to do that. I am sorry, you could try reaching out to neighboring towns throughout the state. It does not have to be someone from your town. I am from Michigan so unfortunately I cannot recommend anyone for Indiana. But it should be possible for you to at the very least get Medicaid, or as the lawyer said for your to apply under your parents. Last year I was able to get under my dads when he applied for retirement and was able to get Medicare. \n\nI am not sure if the same rules for Medicaid apply for Indiana as they do here in Michigan, but you do need to have limited assets. The more you have the more you will have count against you. If you have any stocks or bonds you should cash those out. And your bank account needs to be low, in order to keep Medicaid in Michigan you can have no more than $2000 in your account. Your allowed one vehicle and a home, any other properties count against you and can get you denied. \n\nIt does help a lot to have a doctor on your site, any medical files on your condition help a ton. I was lucky enough to still have the same specialist who diagnosed me when I was 15. He had records of files on me. So any medical records your doctor can provide will be a huge plus. &gt; It does help a lot to have a doctor on your site, any medical files on your condition help a ton. \n\nThat was my denial on medicaid. They wanted medical records no older than 5 years. I was diagnosed at around 3, confirmed at 7. But never saw a specialist until I was in my 20s. I went to the nf clinic in Indianapolis in 2010. But that doctor has since retired. That stinks. This might be able to help you find a specialist, the specialist does not have to be in your home state. The one I see is in Chicago.\n I would suggest moving to another state. Do some research and find a state that is more friendly toward people who have NF and disabilities. When I lost my benefits and lived in West Virginia I lost my case. I moved to NY had a public advocate speak on my behalf at my hearing and I was approved Go to the NIH website to see if there are any studies you can join. My adult offspring  is in a ten year study that does an annual  MRI, complete physical and very detailed bloodwork. NIH also will bring you to their test facility and provide housing/food. If you search for NF or NF1 or Neurofibromotosis studies, several may appear. Any internal medicine or family medicine doctor should be able to diagnose and manage NF1. There are 7 quite clear diagnostic criteria used. If the particular doctor you go to is uncomfortable managing NF1, once you get the diagnosis and better insurance, you can request a referral to a medical Geneticist or Neurologist.  Oh I for certain have NF1. I have a medical record at the NF clinic in Indianapolis. I need to seriously reconsider reconstructive surgery again. I am applying for medicaid again. My biggest concern is not having specialists/surgeons accept it for what I need done. Ah I misunderstood the issue. Sorry! I mentioned getting a diagnosis from a primary care doctor because that would give you more recent records and seemed like it could help you get better insurance coverage.\nI only deal with children, so if surgery is needed there is not much resistance. Good luck with getting adult providers to approve what you need. \nAre you still in Indiana? I do not know a lot about what is available in northern Indiana, but Cincinnati Children's Genetics has a provider who focuses on adults with NF. University of Louisville has one who is interested in seeing adults with NF. University of Kentucky has an NF clinic that sees adults.", "Am I the only one with freckles all over my chest, tummy, and back? I am ashamed of them. I also have some of the other of NF1's manifestations, which greatly impact my life. \n\nBut I was wondering: do any of you have this?\n\nI do have freckles in the groin and arm-pit region, as is typical.\n\nThe \"freckles\" (?) on my chest, tummy, and back are very numerous and they look like sun freckles.

The amount of people voting yes makes me worry about her even more.. The truth is that each individual has a unique experience and life with NF1.Some go though life mostly symptom free and struggle with concentration and social interactions. Others get worse as they age as it is a progressive condition. Whilst I have had troubles with pain and difficulties associated with adhd and ASD, I have also lived my life to the fullest. In my particular field of work I have had many successes and pushed myself and worked for major companies recognised world over. Are you connected on Facebook?

I learned a lot about it and people with any NF can do anything if they can put there mind to it.", "Question I have type 1 diagnosis\n\nCan they pop suddenly? It hurts to rub a certain spot on my head. I know it was there I was going to tell my neurologist about it but cannot find it anymore. No, but they can change in soze, growing borh larger and smaller. \n\nI have a few on my head as well, and they have changed shape and size over the years.  Pop? The tumors can increase size and number. In some cases the tumors can move around, but I do not know about popping. \u201cPop\u201d might not be the right term (thinking like a zit or balloon) but I have had them seem to disappear from time to time. They usually seem to hide when I am at the doctor\u2019s office, and flare when I am working out or otherwise feeling uncertain about the condition. \n\nThere is a subcutaneous one on my left side, just below my ribs, that seems to come and go, but no doctor has ever felt it. Nature of the beast, I think. The outer layer of skin can break over them, what happens is a white structure most likely fat can \u201cpop\u201d in and out.

I have 4 small tumors on my face and neck. They are a little smaller than a dime. I am looking for the best doctor in California to get them surgically removed. I am kind of scared the get surgery so I am just looking around and trying to get as much information possible on good NF doctors in CA. Thank you! I went to see Dr. Panossian a couple years ago in LA for electrodessication. I want to go back to him eventually! How do you feel the results have been so far? I was looking at some of his before and afters, and got the feeling that they might be 5-8 months out, but was curious to how people responded a year or so later. The ones on my back and arms responded better than the ones on my stomach and chest. However, when I discussed with him he did say sometimes certain ones can take a couple treatments to go away completely. I will say though, the bumps that were treated have not grown back, so that is a definite plus! Thank you so much for sharing! I am in Southern CA, and I have been curious about this particular doctor for a while. Dr. Aronowitz is a great doctor. I would call his office and ask if he does it. He is the best wound care doctor and plastic surgeon in LA, and I may goes as to say California.", "Chronic headaches - should I be worried?  I had the same problem and was on perscription migraine prevtative meds. Talk to your primary care provider. These zaps... Could you explain how you experience them please?

It is like a stabbing zap that lasts for &lt;5 seconds but the aftermath pain lasts for as much as 5-10 minutes. &gt; what do I do?\n\nGO SEE A DOCTOR. Do not seek medical advice on this sub.  I see. I have a different kind. I was hoping it would be similar so I could be certain it is nf related.", "Is it common? Is it common to have body dysmenorrhea with Neurofibromatosis? I have NF1 and have struggled with my body image, there is a ton to it that I rather not share yet. All I know is I think my body is disgusting and I see things others do not about my body image. \n\nI look in mirrors and see a complete mess. While everyone else's sees who I truly am. This is not something I have never been okay with sharing. I fear everyone will be tired of me and leave. They expect me to be happy, and full of inspiration. They think I am one of the strongest people they know, and underneath all of it, I am beyond petrified. I have been there.  I have to take my contacts off before I change clothes or shower because I cannot stand to see myself.  My husband and kids love me, though. Fairly common. You are not alone.  I highly recommend finding a therapist who specializes with body dysmorphia to talk to, you deserve to feel good about yourself. :) I feel the same. I did not know it was called I was thinking it was self esteem. I refuse to take photos. Same with me. Yep, extremely common. Mine are all over my trunk and when I look at myself, or feel the many fibromas on my back, I wonder how my husband could possibly love me. I hate the feeling and hate I feel like I need to wear stockings when I wear skirts because of my legs. \n\nTruly though, I feel like it is something that we see because it is us, that not a lot of other people notice. I have been asked about my fibromas from time to time, especially the one on my palm, but I just say it is a scar and nobody questions it.  we have all been there. just try to love life and be yourself", "Staying Strong Hey, I am a high school Junior living with NF1. And I am surfing this feed, I have come to realize how strong you all are.\n\nI have not had many complications: a few small neurofibromas, cafe au lait spots, and short stature. But I know I am not out of the woods - literally anything could happen.\n\nGiven my mild case, I have been able to hide it from everyone (aside from my parents and doctors). But I almost feel selfish. Here I am getting off easy while you all are facing societal judgment, battling cancer, etc. And I cannot even admit to a few close friends that I have a genetic disorder.\n\nI am sorry if it sounds like ranting, but this has been in the back of my mind for ages. My goal is to go to med school, and my doctors/teachers have always told me I have the brains to do it. But I have yet to confront my mental insecurities.\n\nI was just wondering, what experiences have you had with society and your diagnosis? I know that outside opinions do not really matter, but this is a place where I am really struggling right now and it would be nice to hear about some of your experiences and how you overcame them.\n\nThanks again if you read this, I really do appreciate it! I have nf1 I have a lot of fibromas even got surgery, but I look like your normal 20yo dude \n\nAlso, I am really open about it as I want to raise awareness around me and most of people are interested or seems to be, but they still sees you as a \u2018\u2019normal\u2019\u2019 human\n\nAs we can still fit in society, I for them it is just like eye problem or diabeties \n\n\nI do not really know if it makes sense I am really sleepy and English is not my first language but I hope I helped you Unfortunately given my physical limitations and pains, I am not able to have a regular full time job. I tried and even did one of those work programs where they teach you how to write a resume, job assessment tests and even be able to work a job at a business that allows the program to setup people with a sort of trial base to work a few days of the week for a few hours. Unfortunately some big heads shut down the programs and wanted to reboot it, and none of us who were selected for the existing one were able to partake in the rebooted one. The people who had been overseeing us were not real happy with the big heads decision, they even tried to just see if we could all finish out the last remaining, I think three weeks left of work we would have had, but it was a no go. \n\nBut while that did not work out, I did learn something I had already wondered and being on my feet even for a few short hours was painful on my legs. I have large masses on my right leg and my balance is not that great and then I ended up having a cancerous tumor grow in the leg, which was removed in 2014. They could not remove all of the mass, but they got the cancerous part out. \n\nI was able to get on SSI and while the money was not much and you had to keep a certain limit in my bank account, having Medicaid helped a lot with all my medical stuff. Then when my dad filed for retirement, I was able to apply off of him to receive a little more extra a month and then receive Medicare, which which really helps a lot, especially because my specialist who I have seen since I was a kid is out of state. With just Medicaid I needed special permission for anything, including in 2018 to remove another cancerous tumor, but this time in my arm. \n\nI do work a little bit though, about 2-3 hours a day, 2-3 days a week, at my old elementary school after school care. I help out, watching the kids, listening to them read. There is a nice bench out side on the playground, which is awesome during the warmer months. It may not be much, but it is something to do. I do wish things were different, but all I can do is take things day by day and make the most of what I am able to do.\n\nI wish you the best and a bright future. I have nf2 (diagnosed around a year ago), had surgery to remove one of my vestibular schwannomas last June. My friends and people know about it (well it is like like I can hide a decent size scar on the side of my head). Society is still normal for me I would say. Not much has changed because of me having nf2. The only thing that has really been the worst thing is not being able to go into my dream career industry for the medical reasons but oh well. Sometimes life does get hard but I just push on, there is nothing I can do to change what has happened but I still have control over my future (kind of). A I am so sorry to hear that. Hearing these stories always reminds me how lucky I am. I have always wanted to make something out of this, to help those who are less fortunate than myself. I wish you all the best in whatever life throws at you. (: Oh wow, you are newly diagnosed. I can only imagine how hard that must have been. I wish you all the best!\n\nAnd btw the formatting was fine Thanks for the insight! And your English actually is not too bad. I mean, English is kind of a wacky language to begin with ;) Thank you. I am sorta in the same boat as you. Mild symptoms, cafe au lait spots, and short stature. When I was younger I would get second glances from people at the beach or public pools. I guess people  were curious about the cafe au lait spots. I have been able to hide NF1 from most people. However I have opened up to some people about it. Most have been very curious, and intrigued by it. Admittedly I have not had any major symptoms since middle school. However the learning disabilities have been a nuisances ever since I can remember. Never let your fear of mental limitations keep you from achieving your goals and dreams! \n\nOne thing I always kept in mind whilst in school was that other people have overcome greater odds and obstacles in their lives. So why cannot I? I never wanted to let my limitations define me or hold me back. Keep working towards your goal, never give up despite how hard it may seem at time! I have a mild case of NF. I have had a bunch of brain surgeries and also have a learning disability. However, from a societal standpoint, it really has not affected my life. I am able to go out all the time and live life to the fullest. I am very good with people. I have not worked in a while, but should be starting up again soon. This has nothing to do with NF. I have a college degree so I will put it to use eventually. Thousands of people already know I have NF so I am not to talk about it. You will overcome your mental securities and do well in your medical career. The fact that you have had some health issues will probably make you even better at your job. In other words, you will be able to relate to patients even better. You have plenty of time work on your insecurities.. Aww thanks! My diagnosis has been a driving force in my passion for medicine. Given that I am lucky, I do not want to just sit back and enjoy myself - I want to make something out of it.\n\nAnd you guy\u2019s replies mean so much to me. I have never really communicated with others in the NF community, and remembering that I am not alone is definitely reassuring.\n\nAnd I wish you the best! That is the entire reason I want to do this, and you supportive comment truly means the world to me. Med school and college are hard - but if I remember the NF community I will have a drive and reason unlike many others.\n\nI know I am still young and have a lot of time. So I am just going to try and enjoy (virtual, ugh) high school while I still can.\n\nAnd thanks again for your support, I really do appreciate it! I absolutely hate my multiple and ever appearing neurofibromas and after my mom gave me info on it, I started wondering if my dad (who had it) got the cancer he had because of it... Yeah, I think people with NF are more susceptible to cancer. My mutation was spontaneous so I am the only one in my family to have it. But yeah, it is kind of scary because you never know if the ever-appearing neurofibromas will cause problems. Definitely makes me want to get more regular check ups! For sure. They are not fun but it has to happen.", "Early/Premature Menopause I am 36, and found out last year I am in permimenopause, based on symptoms and bloodwork. My endocrinologist anticipates I will be in full menopause within a few years. As going through this at an early age can cause issues later on (such as osteoporosis, heart disease), women are normally prescribed hormone replacement therapy as a treatment. Thanks to wonderful NF, this isnt an option obviously. I am currently taking daily doses of vitamin d and calcium.\n\nAny other women go through this at young age?", "Anyone experience what I am feeling right now? Hello, so i was diagnosed as a kid maybe 3-4 now I am 31.  So this past month I got this bitter/metallic taste in my mouth, fast forward to this past week I get that taste just lingering on my mouth and can always taste it and left side of my cheek is numb. I also get dizzy when i stand and try to walk and right now sitting at the computer I am getting blurry vision and its getting hard for me to see. So today I went to the demist and thought oh maybe I have gum disease or something but....no everything was fine in my x-ray's came back clean and she said the numbing part is worrying and she never hears that. \n\nSo today I tried calling my neurologist and they said it is been a few years since they seen me and I need to see a regular MD to get a referral to come back, so i called them and they said they cannot get me in till middle October and that was to long so I went to the ER and they did tests CT Scan/Blood and nothing showed up. The ER doctor somehow got a hold of my neurologist and he ordered a outpatient MRI which I was able to do right away and also got schedule to see my neurologist next Monday. Now I got to wait 2-3 days for the MRI results. \n\nSo has anyone that has NF ever had these problems or anything? I have lots of spots all over my body and like 3 brain tumors/scoliosis and I am hard of hearing suppose to be wearing hearing aids. I know I waited too long to get checked up but never had any problems to my day/day at all. So just sharing what is going on now, also never had surgery in my life., I have NF1 and have the dizzy feeling getting up. It is really hard for them to try to put a finger on the problem. For me nobody's been able to figure it out.  NF1 takes on such different forms.. really it is true. I know this is hard as there is no exact science for NF1, and how to treat it.  Because everybody's symptoms are a little bit different.  I do feel like you many times. And I really have not gotten any special type of treatment. Other than some medication. Which may help you. Hang in there.. keep posting things. You are not alone. And you have to keep trying different doctors. Different pain clinics until you find one that works for you. When I stand up too quickly my vision goes black and I feel faint, I always thought it was iron deficiency but never thought it could also be related to NF1 so idk I have felt dizzy before and have had my legs occasionally give out, but I have never had the taste in my mouth that you are describing. Hopefully the neurologist will be able to figure out what is going on. A very good friend started having a metallic taste and her body was just asking for salt.", "Scheduled electrodessication for my face! Been going to a surgeon for the fibromas and he thinks that I would benefit from electrodessication! Have one planned in early October for my face, then going to schedule ones for my back (the worst area by far) and my chest/abdomen. \n\nSuper super grateful that I have a chance to have this procedure. It is very expensive but I am on Medicaid  currently which is a huge help. \n\nI know I will be covered in scars as I am prone to them but scars are easier to explain and also easier to cover them up with makeup. \n\nAnyone have any experience with the procedure and are willing to share their experiences? Please share after the procedure. I would like to hear how it goes for you. I would love to see the before and after! I am going to have this procedure on Tuesday!  I am really excited and anxious.

So my left arm is covered from my wrist to my shoulder in bumps and stuff it is disgusting and ugly and i hate it so no end, anyway i was wondering if exercising would help with the flabby skin its really weird looking because im a very skinny person and my other arm does not look like that . Would gaining mussels make my arm less noticeable because it is becoming summer and i cant go outside without long sleeves : ( Have you discussed this with your doctor? Have you ever talked to a doctor about you arm? The fact that  compared to the other arm, it is different and \"flabby\" with bumps makes me think it might be a plexiform neurofibroma. \n\nTo \"cover\" your arm while you find out what it is and what can be done about it, would a fake tattoo sleeve be an option? Or less extreme but still very common is a sort of gym arm sleeve / sun protection cooling sleeve.  But do not buy a \"compression\" one, I am not sure it could cause harm if it was indeed a plexiform. \n\nArm sleeves come in trendy design and colour and would allow you for have more options of clothings while still covering the arm that is bothering you. They are quite common in Australia. \n\nExercising is still a good idea, because of its health benefits, but before you do anything , go and see a doctor. Yeah i have a doctor i see pretty often ( i have a ton of health problems lol ) i have an appointment with my cancer doctors coming up in a couple weeks so I will probably mention it to them, the tattoo sleeve thing sounds like a good idea ill check it out! Good, then your cancer doctor will probably be able to tell you if it is or not a plexiform. A MRI would also be a good imaging to suggest. \n\nI hope you will be given answers and options.", "Learning Delay in NF1? So, as the title says I am curious about if others\u2019 learning was impacted by NF1. My little brother (8yrs) has had NF1 since birth, although it took a long time to diagnose it. He could not walk until he was about 2/2.5, has what appears to be adhd, cannot talk very clearly, has a lesser vocabulary than my 6 year old sister, and just does not understand a lot of things that are explained to him. I am wondering if anyone else has/had a similar experience or could give me an estimate on when he will start catching up in his learning. I love him so much and it sucks to see him fall behind the rest of his classmates intellectually. He is not aware of it yet but middle school might make him aware of it. Those kids can be brutal. Yes there are absolutely delays associated with it. Sometimes they are physical delays or motor skills and others it is a mental delay. Much like any other symptom there is no blanket it does X or Y to everyone and each case is different but there are links with adhd , add, etc to NF. If you are seeking a diagnosis of one of those please see someone specialized in NF as many of the traits cross each other so it needs to be someone who can determine which things are NF related and which may be something else. It is possible. My mom said I had a little delay when it came to walking and potty training. I was also diagnosed with dyslexia when I was nine years old, but I was never held back through my K-12 years and I never took any special-ed classes, because those were not provided at my small private Catholic school.\n\nGrade school was hard at times, but I had a tutor for a few years that helped me with grammar stuff. Once I went to middle school and then high school, things were fine. I got mostly Cs and Bs, but I did receive a couple As depending on the class. I think it did help a lot going to a smaller school and having smaller class size. There were only about 55 kids in my graduating class. \n\nIf you ever have any questions let me know. Hi, yes I am also a little slower in understanding but I can understand it. Other kids can be really brutal but for me it helped that my parents were patient with me and they helped me understand things.", "SBSK did an episode on neurofibromatosis  It was helpful for me. I showed my boyfriend and told him I had this condition and one day could have that many tumors. He said he did not care but I know that could always change. It did make it easier for me to tell him though.", "Update midbrain tumor I posted a couple of weeks ago that my son had just had full body and brain/orbit MRIs.  I had seen the report prior to our appointment with our NF specialist.    It indicated an astrocytoma in the midbrain.  The day before seeing the NF, we were with his Neuro Opthamologist; he had seen the scan and seemed very concerned.   \nSo, our NF specialist was pretty chill about it.  I love and trust her, but I am still not comfortable with her advice on this one.  She wants to wait and do another scan in 6 months.  I realize that these gliomas are typically slow growing with NF, and this appears to be focal rather than diffuse, at least for now.  Still, this is the \u201cworst case\u201d scenario I was given when he was first diagnosed.  It was not visible on his scan 14 months ago, so that makes me feel it is maybe not so slow, though of course it has to start showing up out of \u2018nowhere\u2019 at some point.  He is not showing symptoms of a midbrain tumor, but the vision symptoms would be masked since he is blind in one eye.  \nHis history includes diagnosis at 3.5 years old.  At that time he had bilateral optic gliomas.  With 12 months of chemo the smaller glioma was no longer visualized.  The larger one stopped growing, but left him blind in that eye.   He also has a large diffuse PNF all the way across his low back that does not involve his spine (been there his whole life).  \nHis full body scan this time around showed lots of new subcutaneous fibromas.  The largest is in his thigh, which I understand needs to be watched especially carefully as the thigh apparently is a frequent location of fibromas becoming metastatic.   \nOne of you replied to describe your experience of a midbrain tumor that was successfully treated.  Thank you!!! Your reply was very encouraging.  Though I know that radiation would be a last resort at his age (12) because it can retard brain development up until about 16 years old, it is great to know about such a wonderful success story.  \nI am typically quite upbeat and optimistic, but this is hitting me hard and I am trying to decide if I need to push back and get more action rather than wait 6 months.  \nSo glad all of you are here!! Sending you good thoughts I have heard someone getting a scan every 3 month to watch astrocytoma. If your NF specialist thinks 6 month wait is okay, then it must not be \u2018worse case scenario\u2019. I do not know much, so my opinion is based on various Facebook forums, inspire etc. If a more frequent scan does not harm, then I would push for it. You are very strong and inspiring. I would be thinking about your family. It is not easy but as a that buddisht saying goes -To live is to suffer, we need to find meaning in life to make this suffering worthwhile. NF is our cause, let us stay positive. Is your NF specialist an oncologist? Our specialist is. A neurologist so we also see oncology and they work together. \n\nSending you hugs. She is a neurologist.  Head of the NF clinic at Hopkins.  I was thinking that my son\u2019s oncology team would probably be who I reach out to next at this point.  But of course will keep NF doc in the loop. Your post reminded me of an exchange I had years ago with a mother who posted on Inspire with the username ConnorM. Here is the link to the old conversation. (  scroll down till you find ConnorM. \n\nShe was more or less told as well to wait, and she did not and her son improved. \n\nMaybe you can try to send ConnorM a message on Inspire and see how, 3 years later, her son is doing and ask more details than what you would get from an internet post. Thank you very much.  It has been some time since I have been on Inspire.  Thanks for the boot to my behind....have logged in and am reading thru all I missed.  I recall being impressed with responses/posts from you, and I had noticed that you are here too being just as helpful!  \ud83e\udd17 Update to the update \ud83e\udd2a\nI did have my son\u2019s neuro-oncologist weigh in. It was discussed by the team in conference today and they agreed 6 months was a good timeframe to scan again.  They say there is not enough there yet to evaluate the likelihood of growth, and therefore not enough information to determine a course of action.  It has definitely helped relieve some of my anxiety.  Not all!  But some is better than none!", "20(F) how badly does it actually get from here? I have gotten MRI scans before, and my eyes checked. Nothing out of the ordinary. I do have a few neurofibromas and Spots around my body. What are my chances of something LIFE THREATENING occurring? Also, what about disfigurement? Can I still be disfigured when I am older? Is it something I should be worried about? Unfortunately there really is no way of knowing. If effects everyone differently. For me my Neurofibromatosis has gotten worse as I have gotten older, but that does not happen to everyone. I was diagnosed when I was 15, I will be 37 in July. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. 36F here. I have had a mostly mild case most of my life and have also known others with NF that have had a hard time of things. As I have gotten older, I have noticed more bumps pop up and have experienced issues related to aging earlier than women who do not have NF. I will be honest, I have days where I feel pretty depressed, and wish things were different, but it is what it is. While no one knows exactly what the future holds, I would suggest the following:\n\n1) Do your best to start taking care of yourself NOW. Exercise, eat healthy, minimize stress. \n\n2) Establish a relationship with a good doctor who understands your needs and issues and make sure you keep on top on checkups and followups. \n\n3) Birth control and pregnancy can affect our NF in a negative way. Pregnancy is very hard on a woman's body even when she does not have any medical issues. Strongly weigh your options and think about what is best for you. \n\n4) Save as much money as possible and stay out of debt - while this is a good general life tip, do what you can now so if the time comes where you need medical care or to be out of work, the financial burden is minimized. There is no way to tell. Wish I had better news. 25F (diagnosed at 18) I have had a lot of the same questions throughout the years.\n\nSo the good news is you are out of the window for most of the major complications (learning disability, optic gliomas, delayed puberty, etc.) that come up in childhood.\n\nTo address your questions about disfigurement and life threatening complications. I would say that disfigurement is unlikely if you have not had any at this point. For life threatening complications (if you have NF1), we have a 2-4 times greater risk of malignant tumors than the rest of the population. When you notice a change (pain, numbness, new/growing masses) see your doctor. \n\nI want to emphasize what u/lilone3317 says about taking care of yourself now. When I exercise regularly, eat healthy and most importantly REDUCE stress I notice less pain and my MRIs will show a slower change. \n\nBUT It is also all about balance, it is important to enjoy your life and not worry too much about what may happen since there is only so much you can control. Bad news: There is no way to tell. NF1 is highly unpredictable. It is a game of wait and see.  \n\n\nGood news: Most cases of NF1 take a mild course, and what you see on the web does not reflect what most NF1-ers will look like. I have the same exact worries as you, and I have found that many doctors believe that there are plenty of NF1 cases that never get diagnosed because they are mild and it is highly probable that some people do not even know they have it.  \n\n\nMany NF1 sufferers will have some sort of cosmetic issue, but in the majority of cases, this is very manageable with straightforward surgery. The very severe cases are not as common as it seems online.   \n\n\nI am 36/m, and my case has remained very very mild so far. All the bumps i have gotten in my 20s have basically remained the same size (pimple sized), and there are very few.  And although I get new ones, most of them are so small, no one ever notices unless I point them out. Unfortunately, I cannot say if it will stay mild or not, but chances are high that it will.  \n\n\nHormones might make NF1 worse, but not all the time. I have chatted with a few females who have it and have remained very mild throughout multiple pregnancies.   \n\n\nI understand the burden of the uncertainty of NF1 on your psychological health, but it is always just best to live your life now as best as you can and just deal with problems as they come (if they come at all). NF is progressive and affects everyone differently. I am in my 30\u2019s and have a pretty mild case of the disease. I have had 27 brain surgeries, but believe it or not, they never stressed me out. It is possible cases will worsen somewhere down the line but I do not worry one bit. I actually very rarely even think about NF on a daily basis. Just be positive and enjoy life as much as you can.", "Why are NF1 and NF2 both called \"neurofibromatosis\"? The more I learn about my condition (NF2), the more different it seems from type 1. What is the commonality that categorizes them both under the same name? From what I understand, with both conditions, tumors grow on your nerves: Neuro=nerve, fibromatosis=(benign) tumor growth. Before experts knew a lot about both (and schwannomatosis) they thought them to be the same (but different variations) because of the tumor growth. They later learned they are on different chromosomes, so are really actually different disorders. NF1 also used to be confused with Proteus Syndrome ('elephant man').  Thankfully there is a clear distinction now. They are still both Neurofibromatosis, just have different types. Sort of like how diabetes has different types. So does that mean I likely have both Schannomatosis if I have both Neurofibromas and Schannomatosis? I am not a doctor so I cannot say for sure. But have been involved in the community my entire life and work for an NF organization. What I can tell you is having NF and Schwannomatosis would be like having 2 totally different disorders, like having NF and cystic fibrosis. It is extremely rare and seems unlikely (but is not impossible I guess). There is the possibility of having schwannoma tumors with NF, however that itself is very rare too. Neurofibromas do not show up in Schwannomatosis however. If you really want to know, it is something you should talk to a NF expert about or possibly get a genetic test to be sure. NF1 is the most common though. I am going to ask for a genetic test.  How crazy would it be if Reddit solved my diagnosis?", "Anyone know if i can get Free pamphlets to bring awareness? My boyfriends mother died 2 weeks ago from neurofibromatosis. She was fine until about January when her memory started to go. In March they found a softball size tumor growing from her brainstem, and by April she had to be put into a nursing home. It happened so fast. \n\nThe thing I hate the most is that my daughter and future children will never remember her. She was so proud and excited about being a grandma and bragged about my daughter all the time. I was thinking of things I can do in her memory. I was thinking about getting a bunch of candy and giving it to people along with something explaining the disease to help raise awareness. I can type something out myself, but it would take a while so I was just wondering if someone knew where I could get pamphlets explaining it.", "What is Neurofibromatosis type 2  MISSION STATEMENT\n\nTo support individuals and families affected by NF, to educate ABNF members, professionals, and the public about NF, and to raise awareness of NF\u2019s research importance to humanity.\n\nTHE ABNF IS COMMITTED TO\n\nCommunicating quality information on Neurofibromatosis to individuals with NF, their families, physicians, and related professionals we can help.\n\nFacebookTwitterGoogle+Share", "I got ya homie!

I have a tumor on my nose and left cheek which I have been told that surgery would make things worse. I tried to get over it but it really is still something I do not want to deal with anymore. I just cannot look at my face or tumors without hating myself. The Koselugo medication seems like its my only option. I just worry not a lot of doctors truly know about my condition and having Koselugo covered is a whole another story. I just feel stuck that I cannot get the proper help I need or want. I feel frustrated and do not know what else to do. I do not know where to look or who to ask. Does anyone have any advice on how they were approved for Koselugo or what other medical advice I could look into to get help with my neurofibromatosis? Since the drug has only been fda approved for children, your doctor needs to get you special approval. It can take time for that to happen and would likely require a number of tests to be done before hand. That is how it was for me. It took about a year of getting the approval and all the tests I needed done, before I was able to start taking the medication.\n\nI have been on it since June 1st. The insurance I had at first did not approve it, so the hospital where my specialist works, their pharmacy was able to get me enrolled in the temporary drug program for Koselugo where I am totally covered and they shipped it to me. I was temporarily approved and then two months later I switched my insurance to one that would cover the medication. Which is awesome, because without it, it is very expensive, like a brand new car each month expensive. \n\nSince the medication was only approved for children there are not adult dosage, they only come in 10mg and 25mg. I need to take 45mg twice a day. The other challenge is this is a very specialized drug and not every pharmacy carries it, such as Walgreens, CVS and so on. The only way I am able to get the medication is directly from the pharmacy at the hospital in Chicago where my doctor is at. I am in Michigan. It not exactly convenient, but for now we have it setup for a three month supply and work it in so that when I have a doctors appointment I can easily pick up my medication too.\n\nIf you have questions, let me know. * I have been taking it for about 4 months now and the drug does have its ups and downs. My insurance did not approve it so my doctor wrote a letter to the people who make it and I started taking it. When I started, I was taking 50mg twice a day, and every side effect they said was possible I got. They had me take an MRI of my heart to make sure things were going well and they noticed something was wrong. A small heart problem that they said was not that big of a deal. They cut back my dose to 35 mg twice a day. \n\nHave your doctor write a letter to the people who make it and hope for the best. Be aware if you do start taking it, you will have to deal with a few side effects and but everyone is different. I wish you the best of luck Thank you. That is by other issue too the closest specialist I have is 2/3 hours away from where I live and not a lot of doctors in my area even know my condition. It was very devastating for me when I go to a scheduled dermatologist (waited 3 hrs) only for them to tell me they cannot do anything. I just want to be able to find doctors that will help and understand. How did you find them and start the process for their help? Thank you so much, I am worried about the side effects that I read on since I usually do get all or most with other medicines. For you personally were they mild or were there some that caused issues? You are welcome.\n\nI was lucky enough to have a really good pediatrician. She always believed I had Neurofibromatosis, but could never confirm it herself. \n\nWhen I was nine she referred me to go to the university of Michigan. I remember going and showing them the bumps on my head, but other than that do not recall much about the appointment. They were to able to say whether I had Neurofibromatosis or if I did not. So my pediatrician for the time being just kept an eye on things herself.\n\nThen when I was 15, pediatrician was noticing some things that were making her think even more that I had Neurofibromatosis. She wanted to send me to another place for Neurofibromatosis to be looked. So she first called the nf clinic in Grand Rapids and spoke with them. They told her that given that University of Chicago was the same distance for me and my parents to travel that I should go there, because the doctor there was one of the best and I have been going to him ever since.\n\nMaybe this would help to find a doctor \n They change from time to time. As of now, they are mild ( I have the rash, blurred vision, and constipation from time to time.) If you have a job I suggest you get a doctor's note just in case you have to miss work. Do this now so it saves the hassle of doing it later. I was approved in less than a month.  I am in my mid 40's.  Only been on it for a couple weeks now so I cannot comment much on the drug.  I was approved by my NF doctor, I am on medicare.  Drug cost would be over $12,000/mo without coverage!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs Wolflmg said you cannot have it filled locally.  Mine is filled by the hospital and shipped to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCTF is who I suggest in finding an NF expert.  My doctor is about an hour away at the University of Minnesota, but I also have ALL my doctors down at that campus, so they know what the others are doing and I am very confident in the staff I have for my case down there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have only had a few operations.  Brain twice, leg when I was just a kid, hand over 20 years ago (it grew back) and eyebrow and lid what, 8 years ago or so.  I have thousands of tumors, they do not cause pain so I do not do anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\--Travis Have you checked for an NF study? I have looked up on it. I was just unsure where specifically since I would only come across ones that were completed or not taking application. Do you know what sites I should check?

", "Odd symptoms with NF My son just turned 19. He was diagnosed with NF 1 in his first year. I also have NF 1. He had an unremarkable childhood. Met all his milestones on time, no learning disabilities, and no serious illness. I would say both our NF is on the less severe side. In February he started presenting with symptoms that are similar to Tourette's. He has involuntarily movements, twitches, hits himself, and grunts. Also has been experiencing confusion and slurred  speech. Additionally has localized pain in the back of the head. We saw the referred Neurologist on Friday. The doctor did a brief exam and diagnosed him with anxiety, said the symptoms were psychosomatic and  he needed CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy). No MRI, no CT, no EEG. Not that I want something seriously wrong but feel this is not correct. He has anxiety but the anxiety is not high at this time. The NF did not even seem concerning to the Dr. Has anyone had Tourette type symptoms or display random body movements from NF? The plan is to go get a second opinion. I am just seeing what others have experienced. Kia Ora!\n\nI am 37 years old and have NF1.\n\nFirst of all, get a second opinion. \n\nMy symptoms are fairly minor with birthmarks, some bumps here and there and controlled epilepsy.\n\nWith regards to your son\u2019s involuntary twitches - I seem to be getting leg twitches lately that is been bugging my wife a lot :) so it might be related.\n\nAnyway hope it all works out and let us know what the second opinion says l. I so sorry you have to be dealing with anything like this. I personally have never experienced Tourette like symptoms, or known anyone who has. But that does not mean it is not possibly NF related. I would absolutely get a second opinion. If nothing else an MRI. Good luck! 21 with NF1. I would 100% get a second opinion. A lot of doctors have little to no idea about Neurofibromatosis and I have struggled having some take it seriously. As I have come to learn, it never hurts to have a scan just in case. I second the second opinion.\n\nIf something changed in behavior or physical function I would settle for nothing less than an MRI.\n\nIf it shows nothing then maybe start talking about psychosomatic or other explanations,but there is no way I would accept that diagnosis without imaging. Hi again,\n\nFirst of all, get a second opinion. \n\nSo I asked my wife who is a clinical psychologist regarding your son.\n\nShe said that the symptoms would not be unexpected for someone with anxiety.\n\nDoctors also generally assume it is a mental issue if they cannot find a physiological issue. So that is why anxiety was assumed.\n\nAgain, she did not see this post and merely commented on what I spoke to her about.\n\nThis is not a medical advise and please get a second opinion if needed. 19F with NF! \n\nI personally have never experienced such symptoms, nor has my mom. I would definitely suggest getting a second opinion as this sounds really odd for NF. \n\nGood luck! I hope everything\u2019s well! Thank you. I have a degree in psychology, nothing clinical but knowledge non the less, and thought it was just a lazy diagnosis. I am 21 with NF1. I do get tics (I remember having them starting maybe when I was 10/11), but I have never had confusion or slurred speech from what I can remember. I would say maybe get a second opinion from another doc Definitely get a second opinion. If he has NF and this started suddenly, it could mean he developed a brain tumor. (Heck, if he did not have NF, this could still mean he got a brain tumor.) Or it could be something else, but considering everything, it is better to go through all the tests and have it turn out to be anxiety than to leave it and have it turn out to be something severe. \n\nBest of luck I would get another opinion I have Neurofibromatosis and I am on the more serve side, learning disabilities, tumors throughout my body, some have turned cancerous. While I do have some involuntary movement, I have never made any grunts and hit myself. \n\nI do get MRIs at least once a year if not more and see my Neurofibromatosis specialist who diagnosed me at least 1-3 times a year. \n\nIf you have any question, please ask.

Few little bumps here and there but nothing serious \n\nIs it likely that I will get worse when I get older ? I am 43 and cannot say I have had any dramatic changes. \nSome more small bumps, some aches and pains, and basic getting older stuff. \nIt does not always get worse but hormonally I do wonder about after menopause. \nI just live my best life. If someone wants to judge me it is on them anyway I think that unless you are taking medication, theoretically, it is impossible for it to get better - you can only either maintain your baseline or decline.\n\nThis is because many of the symptoms, and all of the tumor-related symptoms are subject to the ( - one copy of NF1 is mutated in every cell in your body; it is when the second, healthy copy gets mutated that a tumor forms.\n\nAs you age, you are only more likely to acquire new NF1 mutations in your healthy cells - hence the condition getting worse.\n\nHowever, there are many, many symptoms that, if they have not appeared by age 25, will not appear at all.  Things like autism, learning disabilities, bone dysplasias, optic glioma, and even plexiform neurofibromas to an extent *generally* only appear during childhood.\n\nI think at your age, the only thing you may see get substantially worse is cutaneous neurofibromas - and that is due to the second-hit hypothesis mentioned above. I am 36 and have definitely noticed more pop up over the years, however my case is still mild.\n\nThe best thing you can do for yourself is prioritize self care. Eat healthy, exercise, minimize stress. See your doctor regularly and keep on top of any issues that pop up.  If you are a female, strongly weigh the risks of getting pregnant, since this can cause a surge in new growths and exacerbate existing issues. It is different for every person. In my case it has gotten worse over time. I was not diagnosed until I was 15, doctors thought I had it even when I was born, but test results were always inconclusive I was tested when I was an infant and then again when I was nine. They could say whether I did or did not until I was 15. Once I hit puberty it likely was flipped the on switch for me.\n\nOver the last 20 years, tumors are grown in number and size. I have had four surgeries related to Neurofibromatosis. One in 2001, one in 2006,  one in 2014 and another in 2018. The two last ones were to remove tumors that had turned cancerous. I think its differnt for everyone. I have always had a horrible case. It is gotten worse as time has gone on. I have known people who only know they had it because a dr. Told them. No major bumps or symptoms. So it is really diffent from person to person. Differnt things can make it progress like hormones, but it doesnt always mean you will get it worse. \n\nI really hope your case stays mild. My gentic dr. Told me that once you hit 30 unless your a woman who has children or goes through menopause then it shouldnt get worse unless you develope other health issues.

They can appear at any age Thank you. Do you know if the spots become flaky when they are scratched? Not in my experience It sounds like you have an unrelated rash to me.  \n\nI have never had a cafe au lait spot randomly appear and the ones I have are just like the rest of my skin only a different color. Nothing weird happens when I scratch them and they do not itch so I am not scratching them anymore than any other random spot anyway. I have no personal experience with them becoming flaky. But I do get new ones every so often. Especially with lots of sun exposure. Were you born with them? I was born with large spots, and have developed smaller ones as I have aged.\n\nNone of them have ever been itchy or flakey. Mine are not itchy I just scratched them outta curiousity. It is usually a good idea for anyone not to scratch at all. Me and my twin brother were born with them mainly on our chest and armpit area. At 43 (as of Thursday) we both suffer from pain, weakness, and numbness/tingling. We have few cafe au lait spots. Neither one of us have ever had new ones appear after birth. Mine appeared when I was around 2 but mine do not flake at all. I was born with all of mine, the only thing that has appeared more as I have gotten older has been fibromas all over my body in various places. Little raised bumps. About the color of my skin, tho some appear a lil more red/pink or purple and they are definitely raised up, but small. \n\nAs for the cafe o leuit spots they have not multiplied as I have gotten older no, typically the spots are not flaky, they are just spots of a different color than your skin I developed them at about 6 months old. Do you also have neurofibromas? Of course. I have become disabled in 2004 cause of it and had 3 major surgeries on my spine to remove the tumors I was born with many cafe au lait spots, and new ones did appear from time to time, particularly during puberty. The same thing happened to my son. However, they are not typically itchy or flaky. This might be unrelated to NF.

Not sure what to expect at the appointment or what questions to even ask. Thanks  in advance for any advice.", "Vocal Cord Paresis (NF2) Hi folks. For about 2.5 years now I have been dealing with a paralyzed vocal cord. Docs say it is maybe due to an \"occult tumor,\" meaning, a tumor that is too small to identify on imaging (MRI) or a tumor that is acting in a covert way. The only intervention therapeutic they have offered is to inject the paralyzed side with botox to make it swell up and thus (in their view) make speech easier for me. The theory is that it would allow the two vocal folds to \"meet in the middle\" again (something they cannot do now). Currently, my non-paralyzed cord is overcompensating and trying to reach over the median to meet the paralyzed one (which, as luck would have it, is paralyzed just a bit farther over median; and yeah, it could be worse). I am not super wild on the idea of injecting my paralyzed vocal cord with another paralyzing agent, itself a neurotoxin. Seems counterintuitive. Dangerous. They disagree. They also asked that I do speech therapy. I did. It did not work. \n\nAnyone else dealing with this issue? Any therapeutics work for you? I have got NF-1 so cannot be super helpful regarding your specific issue. However as an SLP I can tell you that using Botox as a treatment for vocal fold (we call them cords but they are technically folds) paralysis is a treatment that is not unheard of (voice is not my specialty so I cannot comment on to how often it is used). You are correct in your explanation of why it is done/how it allows for compensation. I cannot (and would not) speak to your specific case as you are neither my client, nor is voice my specialty. However, you mentioned having worked with an SLP in the past. I would encourage you to reach out to them and discuss this proposed course of treatment. If you do not trust this specific SLP see if there is a specialty voice clinic (one that employees ENTs and SLPs) near you and get a second opinion. Thanks for the reply! I have NF2, and have one paralyzed vocal cord, also possibly from an \"occult tumor\". In addition to a botox treatment, I have also had a surgery that placed a more permanent implant in the vocal cords. Both helped a little bit. I also see an SLP regularly, because they can help with this exact issue by e.g. teaching you to use better breath support to be louder.\n\nI do not know where you are located, but Peak Woo is an expert in this field: ( If you cannot come see him, I am sure he would be glad to refer you to someone closer by. I have NF1 And I used to have a paralyzed vocal cord. It was during a surgery which left some nerve damage and overall paralysis to my leftside that caused it. (assuming, they were not very forthcoming with the truth).\n\nI found a speech therapist willing to give it a shot. The Idea was much like your explanation, trying to get the good one to overcompensate.\n\nAnd after a year or so I had volume, after year and a half I had my speech back to near normal. The overcompensation did not work however, the vocal cord went back to working on its own.\n\nStill get exhausted when talking to much, so it is not and will not be 100%. this was 15 years ago. Thank you, this is helpful. Prior to my experience I had no idea that this was an issue that NF2 folks encountered. I wonder how common it is. If you do not mind a follow up question--what was the surgery experience like for these treatments? It was a while ago, but it was pretty easy. They sedate you a little bit, but just minimally because the surgeon had me test it out during surgery. It was outpatient surgery, and aside from a sore throat, I was fine. How long did you have the effect for? I am not sure what you mean. Feel free to DM me with any questions. Sorry I was not clear--after the botox injection, per my understanding, you have \"x\" time in which the injection benefits you (presumably speech becomes clear, or at least clearer) then the effect fades away. I am wondering how long \"x\" was for you. Several months? Sorry, I really do not remember, and I assume it varies a lot from person to person. I would really encourage you to reach out to Dr. Woo (above) or a similar ENT. All good. And I will. Thank you! Have you done an mri of the vagus yet? More than likely it was done on a full body scan but you are correct in the sense that I need to inquire specifically about it.

I kind of get the basics, I have a shit ton of tumors in my hip/groin/legs.\n\nJust want a better understanding.\n\nLong story short I had a MRI just before the Memorial Day holiday and just got the results sent to my chart but my Niro doctor has not called yet. Best to just wait for your doctor to explain. I understand that. I do have to say I understand I have tons of tumors, I want to understand some of the medical terms. If I ever had a question that I wanted to know what a certain word meant and I did not want to wait for the doctor I would look the word up, but I would take it with a grain of salt, because it was better coming from my doctor was not something like WebMD, but it at least can I have you some idea. How did you find out about the tumors? We are you in pain? Based on my best friend's experience, it depends on where they are. Some provide zero pain whatsoever but you can feel then under her skin. Some are on important nerves or muscles and cause some serious issues.\n\nIf you feel a ball under your skin that did not used to be, it is probably a tumor Thank you Yes essentially, I also had one removed from my buttocks several years prior that has started to grow back and I have over that is semi visabale on my leg. What I did to understand them more is to search the web for the medical terms. But I did not get any smarter of it so I called the doctor myself because they had not called me yet (there was miscommunication) and then they told me what they had seen on the MRI I expect a call soon. I assume the holiday delayed the reading and results getting sent to my doctor. I have many tumours, but one, in particular, is in a tricky spot of my brain. I do not have any symptoms and over the last 4 years it has grown shrunk and stayed the same between 3 monthly MRIs doctors do not know what it is as it cant be biopsied due to its location. The uncertainty kills me so I understand your frustration.", "I might be way off base here but, I have a large tumor 3\" \u00d7 1\" at L3 and it cannot be removed. It was not the 5 years ago. Is that fast growth? Am I over reaching by asking if it might be malignant? Is there a way of testing without a biopsy?  Can I ask, why cannot it be removed? \n\nAs for will it need a biopsy to test for malignancy, I would say probably - I had a tumor removed, and the process was basically:\n\n\\- xray, which was on fence so that led to \n\n\\- a biospy, which showed it had potential to turn malignant so\n\n\\- it was removed They did not get too specific.  Just that the tumor is too big and inside the spinal column Ohh okay. Mine was not in the spine, it was in my arm.\n\nAnyway, you would be entitled to ask the professionals if it is malignant. Like I said, I needed a biopsy for them to be sure, but that said the xray was inconclusive, so maybe in your case it would not need to go that far. Last year I was having intense pain in my right arm, which you could see a large egg shaped tumor. I had MRI scans done on it, they thought it might be cancerous, but were not 100% sure, so a biopsy needed to be done in that case and it was found to be cancerous and needed to be removed, that happened last April. \n\nIn 2014 I had a large cancerous high grade tumor removed from my upper right leg. They knew just from the MRI that it was indeed cancerous and no biopsy was needed then.  I would get another opinion. In 2007 I had tumors crushing on both sides of my cervical spine that were removed.  The tumor at C6 can be removed.  L3 and the surrounding area is just riddled with tumors.  All you see on the MRI images are large white spots Okay, but either way it does not hurt to get a second opinion, I have had doctors here at my local hospital saying I needed to have my leg amputated many years ago, the doctor in Chicago who is an expert in neurofibromatosis took a look at my scans and said no it did not need to be amputated. It is up to you in the end if you decide to seek a second opinion. I wish you well I trust this guy, my neurosurgeon.  He said he is comfortable removing the tumor at C6. Him, my pain management doc, and the oncologist all said the tumors at L3 can not be operated on.  It was not even a maybe.  I have see the images myself and it is a nightmare down there Alright, I have had nightmare ones too and they were able to remove part of it. Perhaps your doctor will be able to get your into a trial, my doctor is looking into getting me into one this summer hopefully  My oncologist will be starting me on a med that has passed stage 1 trial and has helped patients with NF.  I will not be a part of the trial cause I can not travel but I will be on the med and of course monitored by the oncologist That is good. Good luck to you My last one was 5 years ago in a different state.  I do not even remember the name of the doctor anymore.

There is a smaller one arising from the right L2 nerve root sleeve, also extending into the posterior aspect of the right psoas muscle.  There is a large extradural fusiform mass arising within the central spinal canal on the left side.  I believe this is a exturdural based on its appearance.  It results in significant mass effect on the the call sac, with significant narrowing.  This also results in some some deformity of the nerve root sleeve within the spinal canal superior to this.

Hi everyone\n\nI was wondering whether there was any common self assessment checks I could do to identify any subcutabeous neurofibromas I have.\n\nI have NF1 but I do not have any recognizable neurofibromas on the skin. I did not know and still do not know much about how NF can manifest if not right on the skin / optic nerve etc, so I wanted to ask here in case you know anywhere I can perhaps feel?\nThis of course does not include any deeper ones I cannot identify this way!\n\nThanks", "NF1 with MoyaMoya Hi everyone. My daughter is 3 years old and was born with NF1. We also found out recently that she has MoyaMoya, which is suppose to be more common when you have NF1. Shes currently on blood thinners and we are told she will be on it for the rest of my life. \n\nI have been doing a lot of research on MoyaMoya online and almost every source I find tells me that surgery is required or a stroke is imminent. I brought this up to the stroke team at the NF1 clinic and they told me MoyaMoya disease and MoyaMoya condition with NF1 is different. In their findings MoyaMoya with NF1 does not usually progress so surgery is not usually required.\n\nI am just wondering if anyone with NF1 also has MoyaMoya and if they required surgery. Any info would he appreciated, thanks! Hello, so my youngest son has NF1 since birth. He was 21 months old when he had a focal Seizure on his right side of his body. It affected his right arm mostly. After many test we found out he had a stroke. He required surgery at 22 months. After months and joining a Moya Moya group on Facebook my wife felt that in many cases with NF1 and Moya Moya seemed to be on both sides. So we pushed for testing to find out what was going on and if his right side was affected as well. The dr we were seeing said it was only on one side. Well in July 2020, he actually had a TIA ( symptoms of a stroke) on the left side of his body which told us something was going on. Finally got testing sooner and confirmed he has Moya Moya on the right as well. There is an amazing Moya Moya dr at Stanford university in California. Thanks for the reply! They told me it was more common with children and NF1 but it is so hard to find others that have Moya Moya and NF1 was well! Is your son on blood thinners? Did they recommend surgery? Yes he is on blood thinners 40.5 every day since he was 21 months old. He is almost 5 years old. He did have surgery on the right side as well to help prevent a stronger stroke from happening. He is already speech delayed from his first stroke. We are waiting on further testing if he needs the left side redone. We had 2 surgeries at two different hospitals in California and Dr Steinberg at university of Stanford is amazing. I am working so I will respond in more detail later, but progression is inherent in moyamoya. If there is just vascular stenosis that maybe will not progress.\nHow was your child diagnosed with moyamoya? What is their Suzuki stage? They found it in her annual MRI scans for her NF1. I am not exactly sure about her Suzuki stage. She had her 2nd MRI and they told us it hasnt progressed at all so far. My son has nf1 and moyamoya he goes in July 14 for surgery at children\u2019s in cbus very nervous How old is your son? Did it progress since it was discovered? Prayers for your son! I am sure the surgery will go well! Everything about him is normal they say he has a high risk of stroke if not fixed besides that he is great no bumps yet just the spots Is there a reason why your child is getting annual MRI\u2019s for NF1?  Our neurologist stated that an MRI would not be given until there was a reason to suspect abnormalities in the brain. I believe it was to see if she develops any gliomas.. and now I guess it is also to monitor her moyamoya. I see.  I had never heard of MoyaMoya disease until I read your post.  My daughter is 9 months and we decided to forego an MRI after discussing it with her medical team.  But now I am worried - is it true that MoyaMoya disease does not present any physical symptoms prior to presenting itself through a stroke? Yeah its true. My daughter has no symptoms at all.. \n\nMoyaMoya is still very rare, even with NF1. I would not be worried.. especially not at 9 months. It is very unlikely that she will develop it. Hi I am a 34 yr old woman and I was diagnosed with MM a year after my mom was diagnosed (and had multiple strokes). It is just nice to find ppl to talk about it with since it is so rare. Yeah! I never heard of MM until my daughter was diagnosed with it. Did you have a by-pass surgery? No it is kind of crazy. My mom was diagnosed like 4 years ago, she was having TIAs and did not know what it was for a few months , I think bc she was not following up with the doctors properly bc they should have known it was a TIA. They wanted her to get an MRI but she said it cost too much. Eventually she had small stroke and was admitted to the hospital and had two or three more major strokes while in there for a month. She was 46. \n\nI got diagnosed randomly a year later when I had an mri bc of a small car accident and my doctor put in an old mri that I was supposed to do a year prior for headaches. They headache one that I did not realize they were checking actually saw I small old stroke that showed no symptoms. \n\nLong story short my mother is also mentally ill (bipolar disorder) and is not compliant so she has not been seeing doctors regularly other than the ER. She should really be in assistant living and should have the surgery. She also gets seizures bc of MM.  I need to get another angiogram this year to check my progression. A couple of years ago I was fine.  \n\nIt was crazy bc when my mom first got diagnosed she could not get any medical asssistance for at least 6 months bc she had to go thru the waiting process with Medicaid even tho she was literally disabled and suffered multiple strokes. so once I finally got her into a nursing home nearly a year later(which she got kicked out of), I got diagnosed literally that same week. Sorry to hear that! Are you and your mom on blood thinners? Sick kids has my daughter on half a pill of aspirin daily to prevent strokes. She has not had any symptoms of MM. She was diagnosed because she has regularly MRIs for her NF1. \n\nWe actually met with a neurosurgeon 3 days ago and he is going to look at her MRI diagrams more before making a decision. I have a feeling he will go the surgery route. \n\nSometimes things happen for a reason.. your car accident was a blessing since it resulted in an earlier diagnosis! Yes my car accident and my doctor did end up being a blessing! Yes I am on one baby aspirin a day and I should be taking Lipitor as well. Yes the dr may decide the surgery route for your child bc usually the age range for symptoms are either childhood or between like 30-50. Let me know what your doctor decides in your case! I am still researching this condition and you are right.. its hard to find others with MM. Keep in touch! I hope everything goes well with you and your mom :)\n\nAlso, not sure if you are on inspire.com but they have a lot of people on there with different types of rare conditions. Thank you! I need to get back on health insurance. Yes, the only ppl I have found with it are on social media. If you have Instagram you will also be able to find a network of ppl with it especially children.

I was diagnosed with NF2 yesterday, and I am so scared at the moment. I have had a hearing loss for a few years, and doctors assumed it was congenital, but after we moved I saw a different doctor because it was getting worse, and I had an MRI that showed bilateral vestibular schwannomas and a meningioma on my spine.\n\nMy hearing on the left has degenerated so much recently that I already had to deal with emotions about becoming deaf (before diagnosis). I feel like if I can hold on to *some* hearing for just another decade, perhaps ABIs and drug treatments will be advanced enough to help me retain basic hearing. I am currently an undergraduate student, and I wanted to go to medical school, but I just do not know anymore...\n\nI feel helpless. I am seeing the best doctor I can get to (he lists NF as a speciality) in a couple of weeks. I have an intense fear of the lowered life expectancies some people talk about online. I do not know how fast these tumours are growing. \n\nMy father had similar issues with hearing loss at my age (around 18). The sadly weird part is if he turns out to have NF2, that is good news for me (since people often develop like an affected parent in NF2). He is in his 50s and deals with his hearing loss using strong hearing aids. He has never had an MRI until now, but the doctors want to check if either of my parents has NF2.\n", "I am getting sick and tired of having tumours on my body that shock my and make me ache at random times.

Intense pain is a massive red flag in NF1 . A change in pain, a pain that wakes you up or keeps you up at night and for which common painkillers are not very effective, should make any doctor think of MPNST .  It is important to stress that while most MPNST arise from existing plexiform neurofibromas, they can arise from anywhere in the body because you might have an internal atypical neurofibroma you are not aware of . \n\nYou need an MRI on that arm. \n\nThis webinar is old (2013) but still very valid (  (around minute 10 ) insists on the importance of persistent pain as a warning for MPNST\n\nOn the NF Network channel there are many educational videos including  several dedicated to pain ( \n\nCTF also has a YouTube channel here ( \n\nIt might not be the case.

I also ended up needing to wear a back brace for scoliosis that developed in my lower back a couple years later. The tumors have not been a huge deal for me. I have them but not so many that I feel disfigured. I mostly ignore them. I have adhd and that is been a struggle but it is not super clear if that is related or hit because my mom has it too, though it presents super differently in her. \n\nThe biggest impact it is had on me as an adult is in having children. Long, painful story short, I am currently 34 weeks pregnant with a baby we conceived with IVF and genetic testing on the embryos. I feel incredibly fortunate the technology exists for me to be guaranteed a baby without this disease, and that I had textbook success with my IVF. Not everyone does sadly. Hi, for me my NF was discovered when my mom found a tumor in my bladder when I was 6. It is a benign tumor, that is still there. And unable to be removed due to it being on so many nerves and in my upper part of my vagina and bladder. \n\nI have many Cafe au lait spots on my body and fibromas on my skin surface. A few on my face and ribs and various other parts of my body. For me NF has impacted my life HUGELY. \n\nBecause of the tumor in my bladder I am unable to pee normally and when I was 9 had a surgery to get a urostomy bag which I had for 10 years until I was 18.  \n\nWhen I was 18, they gave me another surgery to make what is called a continent urinary diversion, or neo bladder, which is on the inside of my body and now I cath through my belly button to pee. This has since caused kidney issues, stones and damage, and infections. \n\nNow at 28, I am relitivily normal, well not really as I have to deal with it every day. But they have not looked at my NF in years as now they are more focused on my kidney health. I have never seen a NF specialist, and cannot seem to find one because every time I request onet doc refers me to genetics. \n\nNo one else in my family had NF, it was a flaw in my genes. It is been hard to deal with honestly, and I hate having to cath my self and be reminded of my condition every day. The fibromas and cafe au lait spots are the least of my worries... \n\nI wish I had someone to talk to about my condition, and I wish I had a better handing on the time when I had the bag.... Check the armpits and groin for freckles. I think this is another common sign of NF aside from CAL-spots. \n\nI was diagnosed at a young age and had to undergo cytotoxin-therapy in elementary school, but aside from that, I was able to live a more or less normal childhood with no learning disabilities or anything like that. Only thing that was a bit off was my coordination. Hello there. I\u00b4m a 18 year old boy with NF1. Childhood can be normal if you, as a parent treat your kids like normal. I wish you the best with your baby! I have a pretty average case. I have pseudarthrosis which is linked to NF. This did mean I had my leg amputated at 13, but not every NF case will have pseudarthrosis :) \nApart from that I have had a few tiny lumps on my spine but they do not effect me at all (too small) and one \"flat\" tumour in my right leg which was removed, part of it has grown back but I do not mind. My remaining leg just looks a bit chubby!\nThe other side is kids did say mean things sometimes and made weird comments, but I also made some friends who would defend me and are so kind.\nBecause of this, I have become such a strong and determined person. I am training to do a job everyone told me I would not be able to do. \nI am sure your son will be okay :) especially with your support. Obviously you cannot really talk to a one year old about it, but I definitely think it is important for parents to keep their child informed about it once they are old enough. \n\nMy parents did not really do that with me. After my chemo and portacath was removed, I had the impression I was cured and did not really find out about the name of my condition or its permanence by myself at 14-15 when I was \"messing around\" with Google and that really, really, really wrecked me. (  The Children's Tumor Foundation is a  great resource for information on NF. They even send out a monthly newsletter/magazine thing full of information. I am 27 and have NF1. Besides some minor health issues I had as a very young child I have lived a normal life besides the yearly dr visits to a genetics dr to monitor the bumps. Try not to worry I know it is easy for me to say this. A lot of people can life a normal life without any side affect while having NF.\n\nIf you are in the UK there is a great helpline by Nerve Tumour UK what is open Monday and Wednesday where you can reach out to them to ask questions they can also push things forward with care. I am not planning to keep secrets from him anyways. You cannot really fight against something you do not know about Thank you and I wish you all the best! Thank you. I will find out if it is available/approved in Romania also Congratulations! I wish you and your baby all the best! I am so sorry to hear that. The complications are the things that worry me also. I went to med school and of course all I remember from the NF lectures are the complications. But I was a young student and I never really understood back then how these persons were affected by it. I wish you all the best and all the strength to keep fighting this I think the freckles appear later in life, I am checking him often :). I am glad you are OK I think this is one of the bravest things I read :) Thank you, I hope the best for you and your young son as well. \ud83d\udc9c We live in Romania which has a pretty shitty healthcare system but luckily in a university center with pretty good teaching hospitals and well prepared doctors... Better then in other regions of the country. I hope to find the best care for him, if needed, anyways Thank you for all your answers and support, it seems a bit more manageable now Oh thank you! That is really kind of you. I bet your son will develop a similar attitude to life. Especially if you say he is witty! \nAre you in the UK? if so I can tell you a professor who works with NF patients! She is been amazing and super helpful  My son is half Bulgarian and his nf was missed by the pediatrician in the us. And noticed when he was in Sofia by a doctor. Good luck it will get better when you get some answers I was in the same situation. Do not stress out too much Thank you, you too No, not in the UK, unfortunately Ahh ok. Good luck with everything. \nIt will be okay :) it will be a journey, but a unique one. Your family will be strong as anything Thank you! I hope your little guy ends up having very mild symptoms. So I was diagnosed at nine months old with no prior history in my family....mainly due to the amount of large cafe-au-laits on my body. I was also much smaller than normal. Granted, in my direct family the tallest person is my dad at five-six and both of my grandmas never got north of five-feet, but it was another factor to get me checked. \n\nHonestly, I lived a pretty normal life. My case was relatively mild, so most kids at school did not even know I had anything wrong with me. I did have some cognitive issues, but none that we directly correlated with NF until I was older and realized that is what my inability to comprehend certain subject matter was. \n\nI did have to get MRIs ever couple of years on my brain to make sure I did not have any tumours. I loved those days because my parents let me take the entire day off of school and we would go into the city and go shopping. They always gave me a present after so the forty-minutes of the clackity-clack noises was worthwhile. I did develop a brain tumour at the age of ten and had to get it operated on, but everything was fine. \n\nNobody at school treated me any differently and the entire school knew about it. I went to a Catholic school at the time and the principal actually had a moment of silence when I was going into surgery..so yeah. I was treated worse for being a theatre geek and budding crazy cat lady than I ever was for having a titanium plate in my head. \n\nI know having a kid with a disease is not easy, but we have a great community. Look for your local NF organization and become a part of it. Find good doctors too who know what the disease is. It can cause eye problems as well, so having a doctor who is familiar can be an asset. It just so happened my old eye doctor did a case study on NF in university. \n\nWe are all here for you every step of the way! Hello! I am a 32 year old mom. I was diagnosed with NF type 1 when I was four after a tumor near my spinal cord was found accidentally. I was the first in my family to be diagnosed.  I am covered head to toe with fibromas, in all honesty probably over 300. I have had multiple surgeries to remove painful fibromas, have a pelvic bone deformity and hip dysplasia. I am not sure if it is NF related, but I have terrible dental issues despite always having good dental habits. I suffer from chronic migraines and moderate to severe depression and anxiety. BUT... I found someone who loves me unconditionally (who I love a lot too) and have been married for a long time, I have a steady career that has held up during covid-19 and that has a lot of opportunity for growth, I have a home and can drive. I am able to fully care for myself and have no restrictions.\n\n\nMy now 11 year old daughter was diagnosed at 4 months based on 1. family history, 2. cafe au lait spots and 3. 2 fibromas present at birth.\nShe was diagnosed with an **Optic Nerve Glioma** at age 5, lost all vision in 1 eye, and had to go thru a year of chemotherapy. She was diagnosed with precocious puberty at 8, and mild lordosis (lower spine curves inward). Looking at her, you would never ever know she has anything wrong with her. She is in advanced class for reading -  reading at a 9th grade level while just starting 6th, excels at comprehension and spelling but struggles with math. She is spending her summer teaching herself a second language. She is an extremely talented artist, is as beautiful as a sunrise and is extremely empathic, nurturing, loving, and caring.\n\n\nIt is unique for me because I was raised in the 80's &amp; 90's by small town people who had no internet access and had never heard of NF before. Very little was known - when I was a kid, they had just located what chromosome it is on. But I am raising a child after growing up knowing I had it, with so much more science and technologies.  My approach to raising a child with NF is unique. My husband takes a bit of a more conservative approach, but he had never heard of NF until he met me 18 years ago. \n\n\nI am completely honest about everything NF related. I may slightly sugar coat things, but I am open and honest.  She has always known she has NF. She has been seeing the same NF specialist since she was 4 months old, who has also been my NF specialist for almost 20 years. This Dr has devoted 40+ years of her life studying the neurological system, specializing in NF for over 25 years who now studies families with multi generational cases of NF.  If you live in the United States, I would very strongly suggest you look into a Children's Hospital that has a NF clinic. If it is a drive, do all you can to make it work. Our closest Children's Hospital that has a NF clinic is a bit over 2 hours one way and is worth very second of that drive.  At our peak, we were driving it every 2 weeks for chemo. But it was worth every cent. We also made those days a fun tradition - stopped at my daughter's favorite restaurant on the way home, same restaurant every time. It made it fun, now it is expected and wonderful family time.\n\nSomething else I am begging you to do is find an **ophthalmologist** - not an optometrist, preferably one recommended by or affiliated with the neurologist or NF clinic you attend.  Optic Nerve Gliomas are tumors that grow on optic nerves.  From what was told to us, the chances of developing an optic nerve glioma drops off significantly after age 5. My daughter began seeing an ophthalmologist when she was 2, had no indication of any issues at all.  We had eye exams every 6 months starting at age 2. The year she turned 5, we planned to do exams every year. She had an exam in August, we scheduled 12 months out, but by March, she had developed an optic nerve glioma the size of a cherry. She showed absolutely no symptoms of a tumor, no signs of vision loss, no tripping/falling, no headaches. Nothing. It was found by sheer luck/chance, chemo was started 3 days after finding it. Her optic nerve is dead and she is fully blind in one eye. She had chemo every 2 weeks for a year even though it was not cancerous - it was inoperable without taking her eye as well, so chemo is what killed the blood supply and shrunk the tumor.\nOur ophthalmologist works in a satellite office of our NF clinic.\n\n\nAs for him living his best life, having NF will be normal *for him.*  He will know no other way of living, so make it just as amazing as if he did not have it. Laugh just as much as you did before his diagnosis. Please do not treat him as physically weak - my parents did with me and now I have no athletic abilities. My kid plays sports, dances, and is extremely physically active. If you do not treat him differently, then he will never really feel too different.\n\n\nI want you to know for *you*...that it is OK to feel broken, scared, at fault, terrified, grief...to feel it all. It is OK to cry, to scream into a pillow, to break down. Give yourself as much time as you need as many times as you need it. But always stay positive in front of him because he will feel what you feel. My daughter never saw me or her dad cry during our NF journey, but when we were alone with ourselves or with each other, we crumbled. Around her we are laughing, positive and optimistic. Which is how she approaches it all too.\n\n\nI am so sorry for the wall of text, I got a bit carried away. I am sending you positive vibes and love. I am including a very resourceful website for NF info and research. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out.\n\n\n My son was just seen today by a great doctor, I feel we are in good hands. He does not have big spots, but has a lot of them, so it does not seem good. They took blood for genetics. I really hope he will have the same outcome as you did. And that I can be there for him to turn the bad memories into good ones, like your parents did I hope I will be able to do that for him. I want him to be as active and involved in his life as he can, not to live like a sick person. Thank you for your advice! Thank you for sharing this! You are a hero... I wish you and your family all the best. If you are already coming here I believe you will. So,  you got it from mother side. I did not knew it get triggered by pregnancy.  Got it as early as 16th year. Thank you for sharing. yep! i have always been told it is the hormones that really trigger it. I have 20+ cafe au lait spots, all on my right side, despite no detectable family history of NF. Growing up, I saw a pediatric neurologist who I loved. she would count my spots and ask me about school. I had to get MRI's done on my brain every 6 months until high school, then the frequency was reduced. My back and eyes were also carefully examined. The MRI's were scary for me at first, I did not take well to the anesthesia the doctors thought was necessary, but after a while we discovered that I was not claustrophobic and I was able to do the entire scan awake despite my young age. Now I am nearly 30 and I have no symptoms. I never did, other than the spots. I hope all the best for you and your kid whether they develop symptoms or not. Even though I did not enjoy the scans, it made me feel very well cared for more than anything else.", "Sunday :( Last night I had the worst nightmare last night of my arms been covered in hundreds of lumps I have none at the moment. and the plexiform on my face was itching and I could not get it to stop (does not itch at the moment maybe only for a few seconds a month. Had to get up to check just in case.\n\nWhen I went for a shower, take my shirt off and my plexi on my back which always bleeds every day and was almost healed opened up again and there was blood everywhere.\n\nSo far my Sunday is going great, and I keep asking why me? Sorry to hear you had a nightmare :(.... I always ask myself the same question :( ... So can really help you... Take Care and stay strong! Thanks. Not much can help it to be honest. Just sharing what happened. Told some people on twitter and there were shocked and asking why I never went to hospital. If I did I would be there every day with my own bed.", "Axillary freckling? Hello. I have been curious about NF1 since I heard about it some years back. I began developing very distinct freckles on my left underarm in my early teens, they have since multiplied and I now have a very noticeable, large cluster of them. They look a bit different to me than regular freckles, they are flat but they somehow look a little different. I know I have been diagnosed with ADHD but met regular milestones as a child, but I know I was told I have mild scoliosis as a child. I am now 30. It is my understanding that these things can be part of NF1, however I have never had any tumors to my knowledge. I am wondering whether everyone with NF1 has tumors. Should I get tested for NF1? It would be pretty uncommon to do actual genetic testing to look for NF largely because it is so rarely neccesary (and expensive)\n\nSeveral of the things you have mentioned can in fact be connected to Neurofibromatosis, however they are also fairly common in the general population also. The concern of having NF would generally not come up until a patient sees multiple of the primary symptoms/ signs.\n\nAlthough the fibromas (\"tumors\") are a hallmark of the disorder, and nearly everyone with it has them it is possible to have zero, or to have so few of them they are not noticed.\n\nBased on your description in this post I would have very little reason to suspect you have NF1. A doctor familiar with the disorder will use the following criteria to determine if you do have it, you need two or more items in this list (the caf\u00e9-au-lait spots, neurofibromas, and lisch nodules are present in almost all, but not all patients) \n\nSix or more caf\u00e9-au-lait spots or hyperpigmented macules greater than 5 mm in diameter in prepubertal children and greater than 15 mm postpubertal\nAxillary or inguinal freckles (&gt;2)\nTwo or more typical neurofibromas or one plexiform neurofibroma\nOptic nerve glioma\nTwo or more iris hamartomas (Lisch nodules), often identified only through slit-lamp examination by an ophthalmologist\nSphenoid dysplasia or typical long-bone abnormalities such as pseudarthrosis\nFirst-degree relative (eg, mother, father, sister, brother) with NF1 If you have concern about the freckles it would be best to speak with your primary care doctor about them, while freckling can be a trait of Neurofibromatosis, it can also just be plain old freckles or even something entirely different. There are cases of Neurofibromatosis of people who do t have the tumors, but have other traits of it like the birthmarks and freckling, as Neurofibromatosis can effect everyone differently to all sorts of different degrees. But I would go and get tested for it, at least not without discussing things over with your primary care doctor. It might me Legius syndrome. Symptoms of Legius are axillary freckling and ADHD. It is worth getting it checked out! I was diagnosed with NF1 when I was a kid, but have had no outright symptoms other than axillary freckling and cafe au lait spots. In fact, I am just waiting to hear back from a genetics test to determine if it is Legius or NF1 because of this. Make sure to advocate for yourself. When I saw the geneticist, I insisted on the testing as I feel it is important to know not only for peace of mind, but for family planning. I am not sure where you live, but the testing can be expensive. I live in Canada, and was initially looking at paying about $1800 US to get the testing done. Thankfully, my insurance ended up covering it. Good luck!", "Nf1 and covid question. Can anyone settle my mind a little please. My 9yr old son has nf1. He is tested positive for covid. Is there any risks that whilst his immune system is fighting this he could be prone to complications with nf1? I have not heard of anyone having any extra complications due to have NF1 with covid There is really no way of knowing how he will react to the virus. Everyone is different. It is best to speak to his doctor as most of us on here are not medical professionals. I have a feeling that he will be just fine. Unfortunately that is hard to say, as Neurofibromatosis effects everyone differently and the same can be said about Covid. Take my dad for instance who has a rare autoimmune condition, he was on deaths door back in 2019, lost a ton of weight, could not walk or take care of himself. He was away from home for months. Thankfully he recovered and was able to attend my little sisters wedding November 2019. \n\nThen jump forward to exactly a year later and he tested positive for Covid. While he felt very tired, had a cough and some aches and pains. Other than that he was fine. It took him about two weeks to fully recover.\n\nMy mom and I were in close contact with him, neither one of us got sick. And I have Neurofibromatosis and also have had cancerous tumors.\n\nIt would be best to keep in contact with your child\u2019s doctor and follow their recommendations. Maybe for the time being keep a sort of journal on any changes you and he notices just to help keep track of things. No complication due to NF1. Most are recovering, some with mild symptoms. I have heard only two cases:\n\none had kidney problem,  \n\nother had cancer, was under treatment. Hey OP, just wanted to say hope your son's doing ok", "UPDATE: How do I find a doctor? Well my long awaited appointed at the NF clinic was today. I went to a local doctor despite living outside of NYC and I honestly really liked her. She said she is not worried about my health at all, even through any pregnancies I will have. It is great news and I feel really relieved. She just wants to do a DNA test to get definitive gene confirmation even though I fit the NF1 diagnosis. And she wants me to have a brain and spine MRI  so we have a baseline to measure me off of for the future. The last MRI I had was 21 years ago at age 10 so it is been a long time. \n\nAs for trying to conceive we got slightly less happy news but still not bad news. She basically explained that the severity of NF1 is all across the board and evenly spread, even within families, so there is absolutely no way to determine if my offspring that carry the gene will be severely effected or not. So we will likely choose to do gene testing during pregnancy and terminate if the embryo is a carry. Not the most ideal outcome but it is okay.  Are you looking for a doctor who is very familiar with Neurofibromatosis? If so this link should help \n\nI was born with Neurofibromatosis and diagnosed at 15, I pretty much have been having full body MRI scans once a year. I have had four surgeries. In 2001 to remove a tumors in my lower right arms, then in 2007 to remove tumors pressing against my spine, then in 2014 to remove a cancerous tumors in my upper right leg and then this past April 2018 to remove a cancerous tumor in my upper right arm.\n\nNo one in my family has it, but it is possible a distant relative might have. I do know that if you do decide to have kids and you indeed have neurofibromatosis there is a 50% chance of passing the condition onto any children, there really is no way to know if it would be a light, mild or severe case as it effects everyone differently. There is also a risk for woman during pregnancy that the Neurofibromatosis can become worse during pregnancy. \n I just went to an NF Clinic/specialist today. That is the whole point of the post. It is an update to a previous post. \n\nShe did not think there were really any health risks for me during pregnancy because of how mild my presentation is and how puberty did not bring on more symptoms. I am going to have a few MRIs (maybe after having my first child since we are currently trying to conceive) but that is just for a baseline since I am not having any symptoms indicating any internal fibromas.  Okay, that is good. I just was giving a heads up on what I have been told. Great visit! Happy you found someone you like, it is so important to click with your doctor. Have you already conceived? PGD IVF is a more \"preventative\" and guaranteed method to ensure your children do not have NF1, though it is expensive.  We really cannot afford to spend tens of thousands of dollars on ivf.  I do not have hormonal or sensitive turners but we still cannot afford ivf so we are doing it the old fashioned way. Haha There are very few areas in which society has their priorities aligned. ", "Good things that have come from NF I am excited to know this sub exsists! Reading the posts, makes me feel better knowing I am not the only one..was wondering if anyone has had anything good that has come from nf..something you can laugh at. \n\nFor me, my left ear canal started to soften and deform at the age of 12 ( I am 28 now) this causes the ear canal to close/collapse if any pressure is put on it...I cannot wear cool headphones that cover my ears and if I lay on my right side my left ear canal becomes closed, sounds are muffled. I have used this to my advantage by sleeping on my right side to cancel out noise (annoying roommates, construction outside my window) \n\nAlso my favorite CAL is in the shape of a heart..\n\nIf you look on the bright side, what has come of it all?  It made me a stronger person, emotionally at least.  When I was 12 and spent three weeks in the hospital with an astrocytoma (and then had to go back several times that summer for follow ups) really toughened me up. I mean, when I was younger I got to miss school a lot for neurologist appointments and MRIs. That was pretty cool Empathy. Resilience. Fortitude.  Knowing that you are unique among your peers.  Yup then school says all your missed days  is affecting  your education,  when schools did not honor your IEP or IDEA , section 504 accommodation.      Oh man, do not even get me started on 504 plans and IEPs. I was supposed to get speech therapy and occupational therapy from my school since I had small motor skills and a slight speech problem. With my shitty school district, I received maybe 4 sessions a year for like 2 years when it was supposed to be like once a week. Totally agree. . I think 3rd grade was only tune they followed  it, every grade after when ever they felt like it.  Knowing which friends will always come through for you My younger sister has NF1 which has made the left side of her brain bigger. She is very artistically gifted and it could be because it is the left side which controls creativity and art.  My favorite CAL is shaped like a potato and is on my right but cheek. ", "Confirmed... I think So my 13 month old son has cafe au lait spots and I went to check him out. The genetic testing came back with a mutation on the NF1 gene. So, yeah... I was expecting it but I was hoping it is not because he is so well developed. I was wondering... Any of you have only the mutation and the spots, but no other or very few symptoms? Is that possible? I am trying to have a mental picture of a better life for him then what comes out on simple Google searches. I,m a mild case. very few issues.  If you need anything. I am here My son is 15 months and he is had the cafe au lait spots since he was maybe 3 mo. He has like 22 spots all over him. We did the genetic test and it came back the same as yours. He is also kind of short, he is still in the 3rd percentile for height. But other than that I swear he seems fine so far.. he is smart and strong. I do not have much advice for you but I want you to know you are not alone! The unpredictability is definitely very scary. For now we just take each day as it comes. If you ever need anything, I am here. I am 32. I am technically still waiting on my test results, but am 95% sure I am positive. (I have a bunch of the spots, and a sibling who was fairly recently diagnosed.)\n\nI do not have any other symptoms (at least, that I am aware of\u2014for sure nothing that has impacted my life so far) I have spots, I am very short and have lots of freckles. Other then that I have had no other problems. I have my masters in nursing. I am 31. i only have spots and a thing in my eye. uh, and trying to see if i have any learning disabilities later in life (26). also, maybe some social issues?? but yeah, not too many physical complications. i hope your son's life goes well!! I have dealt with this all my life, with having nf1. At times its tough but I still am happy and have a good time. You will have some tough times but, you will make it through it. Luckily  I have not had and tumors found since I was i think between the age of 3 and .. Same here. My daughter was born with 6 birth markers, she was monitored for 4 years before nothing else showed up and we decided to pay out of pocket for the test (insurance would not cover) and it was positive. I had convinced myself it would be negative since she had no other symptoms, I was devastated. She is almost 7 and the only other thing that is come up is anxiety and it is hard to tell if that is even related to the NF. My diagnosis came after hers, I was 34. I still would not know I had it if I never had kids. I just have the CALs and migraines. Try not to Google, it gives the worst case scenarios. CTF.org is a great resource. My adult daughter was born with CAL spots. I vaguely understood she might have a genetic condition but I did not allow it to adjust how she lived. I had her in everything her siblings participated in and unless she expressed pain she lived, when younger, as if there was no NF1. Even after she had her first removal of plexiforms from her skull she just was careful how she fell in martial arts classes. As an afterthought I could see how some things were attributed to her NF but I did not want her accomplishments (or lack there of) defined by NF1. In her late teens the tumors grew rapidly but she was able to graduate from high school, with her class, and she has been able to receive her B.A.\nAs a new Mom, I can only encourage you to find the best care for your child but to not allow the condition to frame who your child can become. I am going through the exact same thing. We noticed numerous CALS on my 5 week old son. The genetic test came back positive last week when he turned 3 months old. He has a frame shift mutation. The people with mild nf1 stories definitely calm me down but there seem to be so few stories on the web :( you are definitely not alone.\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f I got it through mutation when I was young, I have a very mild case compared to the ones you see on google (barely noticeable unless you see my stomach). I would be prepared for social issues and anxiety disorders, NF can stunt growth and cause problems if they grow in a bad spot. I have had a couple surgeries to remove some, one was a very invasive and I was stuck in a hospital bed for 3 days. that is the worst of it and the surgeries I had the 3 day stay one is Very Uncommon. I would also highly recommend they do not put a vaccine through a tumor, that will hurt like hell (happened to me once).  Your son will still be your son, I would not expect anything too hard to handle, he will have a normal childhood. You got this!If you EVER need help I am also going into Nursing School! Best of luck! (I do not like googling NF because it only shows the severe cases) I am 30 and in the process of just discovering I, and by extension likely my brother and father, have NF1. Until 3 weeks ago I had no idea. I had lived a symptom free normal life. And still right now no one could tell I have this genetic disorder.\n\nMy father, brother and I all have spots and they were tracked when we were young. Back then genetic testing was quite expensive so we never got tested. We had no other signs and none of us really had any issues other than My brother has a relatively mild case of ADHD. (Which is incredibly common) \n\nAnd I am just now experiencing some issues with a plexiform Neurofribroma that is been growing in me likely my entire life. Had I known at a young age about this issue my treatment would have likely started long ago. \n\nNF1 has a large spectrum of how it can manifest. This is not an immediate sentence to a rough life. \n\nAlso realize that a lot of the cases on Google are the more extreme and visible cases. Cases with lots of bumps covering the skin are quite extreme and more rare. And there are a lot of us who have no visible signs and may have fibroma(s) somewhere inside us. \n\nAnd as I am sure you have seen there is a brand new drug out to help stop the growing of inoperable fibromas. This is a big steop in the NF1 world. Hopefully this breaks the ground for some other treatments to come.\n\nSo like I said there are lots of people out there who are NF1 and are symptom free, some have no idea. This could be your son. There are also those who have more extreme cases. We cannot know what his situation will be. \n\nThe only thing I can tell you for sure about your sons future is he will probably have a few more doctors visits just to track of things.. but it is good you are aware now And know to keep track of it. Do not panic, talk with your doctors and see where things go.\n\nHot tip. If your son goes into an MRI, they can be a bit unnerving, even for an adult. (Long time in a small space, needing to hold very still with lots of weird noises and banging) As he gets a bit older he will likely occasionally get a few scans performed. If they do not give you some kind of eye covering, (they make special TV goggles now that are pretty cool) ask for atleast a cloth to cover your face. It truly made the experience far better. \n\nGood luck to you and your son! Once your results come back, if youre positive, it does open some doors to get some further testing done and have it far more easily covered by insurance. I am talking MRIs. CT Scans, meeting with ophthalmologists ect. It can be a bit expensive still but just an FWI.\n\nI suggest getting a scan done if possible. Not to freak you out but I just turned 30 and I had no idea I had NF1 until I started experiencing some fairly extreme pain. turns out I have a Plexiform Neurofribroma that is been growing in me my entire life. \n\nIt may be good to just get checked out and make sure nothings hiding and get on top of issues before they become a real problem. \n\nAgain I am basically sprinting through this process. So if you are positive feel free to reach out and ask. Stop googling for heaven\u2019s sake!  Some damn scary stuff that you will see when you do that.\nI recommend doing any research here:\n \n\nAnd check the comments here that are responding to others with very little kiddos who are newly diagnosed or suspected.  I posted on 2 of them yesterday.   \n\nNo matter what it will be ok.  You are going to give your son all the love and opportunities that you would have under any circumstances.   My son has had more than his share of NF challenges but he is a happy well adjusted 12 yr old living a normal life, and yours will be too. It is possible, as it effects everyone differently, but it is also possible that as he gets old and goes through puberty that things could then take off from there. That is what happened with me. Unfortunately there really is no way to know how Neurofibromatosis will effect someone. All you can do is take it one day at a time. I would advise to stop looking on google and looking that picture of Neurofibromatosis as well. \n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask I have an appointment with my geneticist next month to discuss my test results (which he has but I cannot see). I am sure they are going to refer me for scans, and I will do whatever of those they recommend. The nice thing about the medical insurance I have is that they have the ability to do all of the tests that they decide I need, so the referral process is pretty easy. And if they decide that it is \u201cpreventative care\u201d, the cost goes down considerably. I am guessing people who post about it on the internet are the most likely to complain, but yeah it does not stop you from worrying. My doctor is pretty sure I have it and I am really worried about my daughter having it.\n\nHe tried to calm me by saying \"I am not an expert but,In most cases I have seen, yours included, it is mostly just bumps on the skin. You want to keep an eye on it, but try not to worry too much\"  and referred me to a neurologist I only really have the spots and short stature caused by it, also ADHD. Did have a tumor on my back but it did not effect me much at all thankfully. i am 19 now so i do not know if it will effect me more in my future, but I have had a normal live in terms of NF1. Apart from reduced vision and caf\u00e9 au lait spots, I do not really have any other symptoms, so it is indeed possible to have \"unnoticeble\" NF without any visible or severe disfigurations. \n\nI do understand why you are worried and wish you and your son the best of luck and all the strength  You will get through this. \n\nTry to stay away from Google if it starts to make you uncomfortable. Every case of NF is unique and the best source of information for you would be to talk to your sons neurologist because only (s)he can know about the specifics about your son's individual case. \n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that NF - sadly - can be very unpredictable, but as far as \"living a normal life\" goes, it is indeed possible. \n\nMy biggest problem growing up as a boy was that I was not as coordinated and athletic as other boys and this made me feel really insecure and incomplete. Does NF really cause social issues? I can see how NF could cause insecurities that in turn could cause \"social issues\", but is there really an established cause-and-effect between the two conditions? of you google \"nf1 social problems\" you will get a lot of research on it!! Thank you! I am not going to do that since I am pretty sure it might completely wreck me. I try to stay away from reading about my condition as much as possible and do not like being locked into a box of determinism. \n\nI have struggled with \"social problems\", but that has been because I have identiified too much with my NF which made insecure and that, in turn, gave me anxiety. Today I do not really have such problems. At least not as severe as they used to be and as a child I was always super extraverted and outgoing. so was i... but that did not help me make friends. i was not very well liked. i never really id'ed with nf1. i was born with it, but did not think it affected me too much. but, then i found out about all these things and it made me realize it was not me. it was my nf1. it helped me make sense of a lot more things and make me feel validated. i do not think i am in a box, but more so i need more help than i have been getting. and i have never gotten help. Glad to hear it helped you overcome those negative experiences of the past.\n\nAlthough it is good to realise and tell yoruself that it is not your fault, I personally believe that the problem with such strategy is that it may leave you in a situation of helplessness - \"I cannot ever change because I have NF\" is an equally toxic thing to convince yourself of because that allows the label that is out of your control (NF) to define the entirety of You and allows it to limit your development. But, you can get help- with therapists and other outside sources. nf1 helped me get access to accessibility services at my school because it can cause learning disabilities too. i have no formal diagnosis of a learning disability, but it is still enough to help get me access. i am past the point of trying to feel good about my body. i never felt like i could improve it anyways. but, learning more about your condition can help you recognize problems and get help. you do not have to be helpless. how can you develop if you will not allow yourself to know more about nf1. you do not know how much more it can affect you if you do not know about the social problems that can come along with nf1. navigating your life blissfully unaware of what you are dealing with can hinder your development because you are not giving yourself a chance and you would always be selling yourself short because you are not helping yourself. \n\nalso, you can change. your nf1 cannot but you can. so, nothing really is \"toxic\" with knowing. i think you identified with nf1 in a different way than i recently did. it is not something bad you cannot give in to. it is something you have that you need help with and there are people that are willing to. \n\nnothing will ever define the \"entirety\" of you. that may be how the world sees you, but the world would have to change. I agree with you and am happy to have found out I misinterpreted what you said earlier. i was not trying to attack you or anything. we identify with this annoying thing differently and our experiences are different. a little google search can go a long way though. it was shocked at how many other well known things nf1 connects to. Like all the previous have said, there are many chances, he will be able to go through life minimally affected. \n\nI would recommend you educate yourself because most guidance and even the website of the Children Tumour foundation still have information based on old studies. We know a lot more today and we know that taking a preventative approach is better than the old reactive one in which you wait for problems to occur. \n\nAn issue many children have with Nf is hypotonia, weakness and fatigue, and this is due to a fat storage dysfunction with droplets of fat being stored in muscles. Now in 2020, we know that simply by supplementing with L-Carnitine, (  muscular function is rescued. \n\nThis example is just to show that you will need to know which issues can occur and new research is constantly happening. This video from  Dr. Kaleb Yohay, Associate Professor of Neurology and Pediatrics and Director of the Comprehensive NF Center at NYU Langone Health, is called Lifehack Your NF and explains how to navigate the medical system and manage your nf.  There are good tips on how to twist the system to obtain a whole body MRI for example . IT is long 1h20 min, but worth it. \n\n( \n\nI have NF1, and by looking at me in a bikini, you would not know. I speak several languages and blitzed through school and uni. So do not be scared . \n\nWhen it comes to genetic disorders, Nf1 is not so bad.", "resentment does anyone resent their parent who has NF and passed it along to you? my mother gave it to me and i have so much resentment towards her because of it. i try not to let it consume me but the older i get and more noticeable my NF becomes the stronger that resentment becomes.  That is a tough one. Without her you would not exist but because of her you exist with NF. I am one that developed NF randomly so I cannot speak from experience in your situation.  \n\nHowever I have seen someone professionally about my frustrations of NF and they helped me put lots of things in perspective. I have been trying to teach myself how to live my life to the best of my ability despite my disease. NF sucks but it is far from the worst thing you can end up with in the genetic lottery. I do not know your mom but I would imagine my heart would break if I ever had a kid and found out they resented me because I passed on something to them. \n\nI am curious as to what others might say in response to your post. Good luck. I hope you find a way to forgive her.  I must live a vastly different life than many of you and for that I am grateful it affects my life in a day to day basis almost zero  most of my fibromas you can only see when in certain lighting, i know there is no way if knowing how nf is going to effect you in the future but anytime i see my mom and see how she is covered in them makes me really upset thinking that i could look like that \n there are times i did not exist because of my nf. like i do not want kids, unless i adopt or do IVF. i feel like being a mom was taken from me because of my NF. i would never risk passing it along to one of my kids, i would hate myself forever if i did  oddly enough my mother carries it but has ZERO Symptoms I have had several surgeries to have Subcutaneous Neurofibromas removed, but other than that have Zero symptoms I guess I am just lucky  happy for you &lt;3 i had a small one on my face removed and i am getting surgery in a few months to get the other 4 that are visible. most of my cal spots are covered by tattoos i just hope my symptoms stay where they are at and do not get worse :(  I have quite a few of the spots .. I guess I never really pay attention to them  Im the only one with in my massive family. No one ever mentions it though. I wish someone would talk to me about it. But no :(  i am always here to talk if you want &lt;3 i know we are strangers but we can get through this together  Yes, very much so. Especially since she is dismissive about it and acts like I should just \"get over\" it.  same. my entire life i was told it was not a big deal and it was practically normal. never saw a specialist, got an MRI once in my life for it, and was never fully educated on it. i am more so resentful in the fact that i want kids so bad but i would never be selfish enough to risk passing it along to them not to mention pregnancy can worsen it and right now it is so mild you would not even know i have it just by looking at me. most/almost all of my spots are covered with tattoos, the bumps i had that were noticeable i got removed. it just sucks.  My mother always just acted like I was wrong and vain for being worried about it, and she would dismiss it as \"no big deal\". Her bumps did not get bad until she was pregnant with me (in her late 20s), and she just could not wrap her head around the idea that a teenage girl who was raised at the beach would want to have normal skin like all the kids she knew. \n\nI do not think most people could tell I have NF either. Most of my spots are covered under a t-shirt and are just flat spots.  The few along my jawline that are lumpy, people seem to think it is acne. If one gets big, I get it excised. \n\nI am sorry that you are in that predicament in regards to having kids. :( I would personally want to avoid passing this condition on too, I do not want anyone else to have to suffer through it.  that would upset me too. :( like who would not want to have normal and smooth skin. i have some on my face like your jawline that just look like pimples. \n\n\nand that is why i would not have kids unless i decided to do IVF (which is expensive) or adopt. i would never forgive myself if i has kids and passed it along to them.  Although I do not know your boyfriend, I do not think your boyfriend would leave you if he met your mom. If he is done his own research on NF, he is most likely seen the most extreme cases that google images has to offer. \nMy boyfriend and I have been together for almost 8 years, and mine has definitely grown in number since then. He acts like he does not even notice them, and I think he honestly does not. It amazes me, but he is a very honest person, so I believe him. \n\nI am thinking about getting more tattoos to cover the spots on my back. How was did the process of getting tattoos over them go? I would feel nervous being exposed to the tattoo artist. I love tattoos, and if I had my entire back covered, that would be a lot more skin I would feel comfortable showing!  that is so sweet, i am happy you have someone like him. :) \n\n\ni do not think he would either, but it is one of my biggest fears. i never was scared of that with my ex (who was the biggest piece of shit ever) idk i have it with him. \n\nthe process was just like any other tattoo :) i was not too nervous about it being exposed, i told my artist i wanted a birth mark covered up on my thigh and he did his thing. you cannot even see it now :) though i still need to go back and finish the piece but the spot itself is gone.  \n\na lot of my spots faded, idk how or why, but i felt like i had more/they were more noticeable when i was little.  Aww thank you, I am happy that you have a good boyfriend too!\nI know how you feel, when my boyfriend and I first met that was a thought I had sometimes too. I feel much more relaxed and confident about that now though.\n\nI have a bunch of tattoos too, I got some on my lower stomach for the purpose of hiding spots. I think that more tattoos would increase my confidence in the same way. ", "I was diagnosed with NF2 at in 2016. I have had 13 surgeries, 3 tumor debulks, 3 vp shunts, an abi and cochlear implants. I am totally deaf, and I am finally in the 'watch and see' rest zone. I am the healthiest I have been in years and happy. ", "Glas to have found this sub out of desparation! Ive been taking care of my mom who has been diagnosed with NF2 for six years. I have no idea how to help her, and her medicaid doctors dont know how to also. So they pump her full of pain meds and send her away. Sometimes i cant tell what is worse, the illness or the addiction to pain meds! Her tumors are on her spine. Now they are on her chest walls,boobs,and on her head. Johns hopkins wants a gene test taken bf they help. I would really appreciate it if you have suggestions on where i can have that tested without costing me a fortune (again she is on medicaid). I plan on taking out a loan just for helping her with these tests that she needs. I refuse to allow these pain management doctors just to pushing her away and increasing her meds bc they do not understand the illness.Any suggestions and words of wisdom would be a blessing to me in this time of need and confusion.", "Well surgery it is then Just got back from my appointment at Mass General and it looks like I need spine surgery x 2. Has to be said that the NF clinic there is awesome though. Good luck. I hope the procedure is excellent. Thanks I feel like Mass General should be decent....I have done my brain surgery and gamma knife at UPMC in Pittsburgh which is supposed to be another good place for NF related stuff I am a Pittsburgh native living in Dallas now. I go to UT Southwestern and they also have a great NF team there. Good to know....I considered moving to Plano a couple years ago so if I ever make the leap I will keep UT in mind Ha then you will be my neighbor! Best of luck. Back in 2006 I had surgery on my cervical spine to remove tumors that could have caused me to wake up one day unable to get up out of bed. Can you describe the intended procedure more I have not met with the neurosurgeon yet, but from what I understand it involves cutting me open, remove the vertebra, de-bulking as much of the tumor as they can do safely, then screw the vertebra back in place. \ud83d\ude2f It sucks that you are going through this and I hope you are getting good care. One thing I wish I knew going in to spine surgery is that you have to lie flat for 24hrs to recover spinal fluid. It was panic inducing to lie there for that long. I did not want you to be blindsided by that like I was. I never knew about laying flat, meeting with the neurosurgeon in  a coupe of weeks though. I am actually pretty cool about it, I have been stuck WFH since March due to COVID so I am going to consider this as a vacation ;-). How long were you in hospital for? One week or until I could urinate on my own which took a week lol. I did not have any screws so your stay may be longer? I am not sure. Yikes!!! Awaiting mine as well gl! Good luck to you too Thanks! So they removed both tumors in the same procedure then? I have one on my lumbar spine and one on my cervical spine. That is a question I have for the surgeon if they would do both at the same time? Yes, it was one surgery. I stayed in the hospital about a week and then about two weeks resting at home. Good luck!!  I hope you will have a successful surgery and a speedy low-pain recovery!", "Is this real? Hello fellas. It seems like something interesting happend in the NF community and i would like to know your opinion if this is real or not. I will link this video about a lady who talks about what is seems like a medication for the NF1 type. It seems like it will \"cute\" 20 - 50% of it. (My english is not the best and i\u00b4m nervous)\n\n ( \n\nThe video is in spanish. Someone can confirm if this is legit? I do think it is... but i\u00b4m not sure.  Man. Medicine is advancing at such a rate.  I have been following rare genetic disorder treatments for years and the once incurable Anglemans syndrome also has a treatment that just hit clinical trials a few months ago.  It seems like a there are many instances where we are making huge strides in helping treat genetic disorders. Wow. I had not heard about the Anglemans clinical trial. My nephew has it. Do you have a link?  Googled it and could not find it. \n\nHere you go! Thanks", "Passing on NF Gene Has anyone had a CVS or amniocentesis and decided to terminate if the NF gene was present? I am currently 9.5 weeks and have my cvs scheduled for 2 weeks from now. Before we started trying we decided not to pass on the gene because of how much suffering severe symptoms can cause. I just feel really alone right now. I just joined a Facebook NF support group but I am too afraid to ask this there for fear that I will become the target of \u201cpro-life\u201d harassment.  There is pro life harassment here too, but usually from cowardly downvoting jerks. Although I have decided to not have children because of the nf and had a vasectomy, I cannot pretend to know what you are going through. Do know however, that I support any decision you make. You may DM me anytime as well.  Thank you. That means a lot. It is a very hard choice considering I have fairly mild symptoms but I know that means nothing for my offspring and when I read about people with severe symptoms, it just breaks my heart to think about knowingly bringing more suffering like that into the world. It seems like most people on the Facebook group just have sick kids. Like oh well I want kids so I am gunna have as many as I want and too bad if they are sick. Here it seems most people choose not to have kids. But there is got to be others who have made the same choice as me. Right!?\n\nAs for the \u201cpro-life\u201d harassers, this is a throwaway at least so if worse comes to worse I can make a new one. It would suck since I do all pregnancy related subs from here but I would not be outing myself via my one and only personal Facebook account that says who I really am.  Have you ever had a genetic test? There are some mutations known to cause mild symptoms. I have right before we started trying to conceive. But the NF geneticist never mentioned some variants being mild. She told us symptom severity is completely variable even amongst families. I would be really upset if what your saying is true. My genetic report says I have variant, c.4537C&gt;T (p.Arg1513*). I have no idea what that means and have not been back since the gene testing. Do you know where I might be able to find information on specific variants? See that is where I feel stuck\nOn one hand, I want children of my own (for unknown reasons) but on the other hand, I do not my children to have NF. I got off seriously lucky with the mild case that I have but I am not too sure my hypothetical children will fair the same. That is why we are going the route we are going. Termination is not exactly something anyone wants to have to even maybe do but for us it is worth it vs having sick kids or having no children at all. There is also IVF with PGD (pre-implantation genetic diagnosis) but the price in our area is way out of our budget.  \"I do not want to have kids because I do not want to give them what I had as a kid...a disappointed father\"\n-drew lynch\n\nno but really it is a risk but I would not want to find out til their born. we can do whatever it takes if it is bad but I think it will likely be a benign case if I pass it at all. Whose life are you risking?  I have NF and passed it on to my son. That being said, my NF caused me zero issues growing up aside from some spots and bumps. \nI was not overly concerned from my own experience it was pretty easy to deal with. \nI am in a few NF Facebook groups and when it is topic is brought up people are vile. \nIt is a personal choice and whatever you do choose is right for you. \nLife is hard sometimes NF or not.  Can you further explain IVF with PGD and how much is it? I was never told this either and I had my nf Gene mapped as well. \n\n\nOn a side note my husband and I plan to terminate if the gene is found.So if you ever need someone to talk to you can message me  lmao, that is literally my son's exact mutation.  I can tell you from experience you are not guaranteed to have a mild case.  He is 2 and a half years old and already has sphenoid wing dysplasia and two optic gliomas. I was not fucking asking for you to tell me that you are not doing what I am choosing to do. And you *thinking* it will likely be benign is just a fairy tale you are telling yourself. There is no way to predict that.  They take a couple cells from the fertilizer embryo and do a single gene test in it. Price varies by clinic and I think regionally A LOT because on subs I have asked in some people seem to pay about 15-20k and we were quoted 45-48k with the pgd partnobly adding 6k to it.  Well I have fairly mild symptoms but not none. Severe scoliosis that required spinal fusion at 7 and a back brace all through middle school. Mostly small and flat cutaneous fibromas, and one subcutaneous that I know of and it causes some pain. So relatively mild, but the surgery especially majorly impacted my life. Anyway I guess re-confirming that I am *not* guaranteed to have a child with a mild case reaffirms my decision.  It is like a huge sigh of relief to know we are not the only couple going this route for parenting. Thank you for sharing that. Are you actively trying to conceive yet? I hope you are son gets lucky like you! I cannot imagine what it is like as a parent to have to wait throughout all of childhood to see see if symptoms will emerge during puberty. My poor parents had to wait like 10 years.  Despite the suffering and all I have lost (heating etc) I am glad my mom gave me a chance. I know everyone thinks diff and is afraid to bring a child to suffer. While that true I also think \"why not?\" Having NF2 already make me someone who understand because I have lived it and maybe that would make me a better father.  the price you were quoted for IVF is very discouraging, this is coming from someone who has NF and only wants to conceive through IVF to prevent passing the gene on. I am sending you all the positive vibes that your test comes back negative and that gene has not been passed. if it has i can fully understand why you would terminate and fully support your decision :)  I am 100% here for you. I am a woman with NF1 and would do the same thing. Best of luck to you.  I would not risk it. Ignore prolife harassers. The fact that you have mild symptoms does not guarantee your kid would have. Better safe than sorry. I am glad I was born too (I am a random mutation so my parents had no way of knowing even if the technology was there back then). But that does not mean I do not want to give my kids the best shot at a happy childhood and life. Anyway, I am really *NOT* looking for people to tell me they are doing it differently. I think I made it pretty clear in my original post that I am looking for support for the decision I have already made.  Tell me about it. I was floored considering the internet says the average cost is 15-20k for IVF and 6k for pgd (I am in the United States, btw). So when they said 42k for ivf and 6k for Pgd I was like, \u201cI am sorry but what the fuck???\u201d Some insurance companies will cover some or all of IVF, and some states require it for infertility. But all my insurance covers is intrauterine insemination which does is no good. We had no issues conceiving (1 miscarriage).  It is a nonsense mutation, which account for 20% of all NF cases.  There are a number of nonsense mutations, but in all the literature review I have done I have seen this specific one pop up quite a bit so it definitely seems to be one of the more common.\n\nNonsense mutations seem to maintain a pretty consistent phenotype irrespective of where the truncation actually occurs, though you can correct me if I am wrong.  i am not an expert by any means. So sorry about your miscarriage \u2764\ufe0f I live in the united states as well. Do you just call to see if your insurance covers it? I am not trying to have a baby anytime soon, but i am 29 and would love to have the information i need when i want to have one.  I have got NF2. Trying to conceive now with IVF and PGD. I strongly suggest looking into the Livestrong and Compassionate Care groups. My wife and I are doing this exact thing right now and out IVF sticker shock was the same as yours. At present we are anticipating paying about 1/8th of the initial quoted price. Primarily because of Livestrong. I am still, today, floored at how much assistance they provided us. It is not a quick process but for us at least it is definitely, definitely worth it. \n I was not trying to tell you people do it diff. Honestly, I cannot imagine what a parent of a child with NF goes thru. I am not a parent alone a woman. I have had friends who terminate their pregnancy for whatever choice they did. No one should go thru that alone. Whatever road you choose I hope you will not have to cross it alone. Take care.  We did not get a second opinion since that was the office that we were referred to and they have an incredible reputation but I also think it is regional. We live in a high cost of living area and I think the lower prices are in lower cost of living areas.  Thank you, i do have a big support system, thankfully.  So they basically give you money towards your IVF? Not a loan, but straight cash? Do you have a link to their grant program? I think I am having trouble finding the correct thing. \n\nThe IVF clinic says it is useless to try to fight insurance. They will not cover it period. \n\nHoping for a very successful ivf process for you! Thank you. I do not know how I would live with myself knowing it was my fault my kid was sick and suffering.  My father had Schwannomatosis (although,then it was still classified as NF2) and passed it on to me and my sister.  There was not genetic testing widely available back then, so my parents just took a chance.  I have  never wanted children, but not because I have Schwannomatosis.  I was not even diagnosed until I was 45, and my sister was diagnosed at 42 after she had both of her children.  I have the LZRT1 mutation, which is supposed to be the more painful of the bunch.  Even with all of that, I have lived a very full life, and while I would love not to have my condition, I would also love not to have the type of anemia that I have.  I am absolutely NOT pro-life, and in fact, have gone from calling myself pro-choice to pro-abortion because I think that abortion is a regular part of health care and is something that is between a patient and their doctor.  Whatever you decide will be best for you and your family.  But I encourage you to think not about the negative aspects of possibly passing NF to your child, but the wonderful life that you could give that child whether or not they get the NF gene.   Not straight cash but a deep discount and free drugs. If your IVF clinic is not willing to work with you maybe find a new one in a local city. Ours have been with us since go to reduce costs and keep us happy.  and \n\nI hope you have a successful IVF process as well.  Thanks. I do not think the clinic \u201cwas not willing to work with us\u201d but their cost is their cost. They told us about a couple outside programs that does packages for slightly reduced costs but not reduced enough really. So we are just trying naturally and hoping we get lucky and do not have any terminations. I will look into this though if we end up terminating this pregnancy (currently almost 10 weeks so getting close to when they can test).  I fully understand. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou might also write an appeal letter to your insurance company. I did before treatment started.  The clinic said that never works. Like they do not cover it period. Not for infertility. Not for PGD. Never. We would really need them to cover most of it for it to be possible for us. Hopefully we got lucky this time and we can re-assess for our second child.  Do what you like, your circumstances are different from mine, but ... if there is a chance that it will help I say do it, even if the clinic tells you the opposite. If there is one thing i have learned about IVF so far is that the left and right hand have no idea what the other is doing. You got to do the legwork yourself. We tired literally everything, even stuff with little chance of success, and things really came together at the end. Hope that happens for you too. Best of luck.  Thank you! If we need to switch paths I will definitely try! Best of luck to you too! I hate having been born with it, but I would not give up my life. It is my life, I am a person, someone with a heart beat, despite having this condition my life matters, just as much as anyone else\u2019s life matters. Life matters and we should not take it for granted. I could tell you a number of stories of things parents were told by their doctors about your child will not do this or that and you should terminate, parents did not listen went through the pregnancy and it turned out the doctors were wrong. I cannot tell you what to do as it is your child, but I do not know how anyone could ever give up on their child. I do not know maybe it is because I work with kids, but that is how I feel. I wish you and your family the best. Fuck right off.  No need for language, either way I will pray for good results for you and that the gene was not passed. Also you may not be aware but they are making strides with a treatment, there are 4-5 different drug trials going on right now showing 20-40% shirkage. Hopeful in our lifetime they will have treatment to help us. No need to shame me when I SPECIFICALLY said I did not want to interact with anyone who is pro-life and SPECIFICALLY asked for only people who have done what I have done to share their stories. Instead you come in and shame me and guilt me and try to change my mind. Disgusting. I would never be able to forgive myself if I chose to have a child with the gene that ended up having severe symptoms. *Never forgive myself.* I would *hate* myself with the deepest hate for choosing to do that to my child. So thanks for saying you hope the gene was not passed on, but seriously, FUCK RIGHT OFF with your shaming.  I have serve systems, neurofibromatosis is not a death sentence. That is why I responded, to tell you that I am okay. Yes I have limitations, I live with chronic pain, I have had two cancerous tumors removed, but I am okay, I am happy to be alive. \n\nWe do not know how neurofibromatosis will effect one person. It effects everyone differently, but we all give live a full life. I am not shaming you, I am sharing with you that someone even with serve symptoms can live life. I am sorry if I upset you, but seeing as how I have one of the more sevre sides of neurofibromatosis, I felt that maybe it fo help with your decision to know how someone is life is who has one of the more sevre forms.  But I did not ask for help with my defusing and you DID shame me. \u201cI do not know how anyone could give up on their child.\u201d Seriously. Just STOP.  I did not ask for help making a decision. I did not ask for advice. I asked for support from people who have made the same decision I have already made.  Either way, I still wish you the best and hope all turns out well at the appointment. I am sorry I upset you, all I wanted was to share with you how it is for me who has a more serve form of neurofibromatosis, to give some insight of what my daily life is like. My husband and I are pretty sure we are going to be child free, but have talked that if we do decide to have children, we would terminate if the test was positive for  NF (or a host of other things).\n\nNo one can tell you what is right or wrong and there will always be people that will yell - some people may condemn  for bringing a child into the world with NF, someone may condemn for terminating.  All that matters if what **you** decide to do.  Everyone has their own reasons for the choices they make and those reasons are as valid as the next. Thank you for your support  I know this is from a few days ago, but I wanted to share some inside of severe symptoms. This will be kind of long, but I wanted to get one part out of the way first. I support you completely. \nWhen you talked about severe symptoms I completely understand why you would be afraid of that outcome. It is a fear of mine that a kid would have the same problems I have. I am not in a relationship or pregnant, but I understand your position because I do not want to have my child go through what I am going through now. The reason why I am choosing not to have children is because of my NF. I have a pretty severe case of NF with over 500 tumors spread head to toe inside my body.  I am about a 6 on a good day and over 10 on bad days. I have been firm in my stance on not passing NF to any future children of mine.  I could not watch child suffer through the agony I face daily. I would be guilt ridden for the rest of my life knowing that because of me my child will suffer for the rest of their life . A child may not get NF, or it could get a mild case, but I cannot live my life on what ifs. Anyway like someone else says better safe than sorry.  Again sorry for the long post.  If you ever want to talk just DM me.  Thank you for this. It brings me some comfort to hear from people with severe symptoms that I am doing that right thing. I just do not know how I could live with myself if we chose to risk it and had a child who suffered for their whole life. I would be ruined with guilt. My husband too. Obviously the possibility of terminating, and maybe having to do so several times, is horrible and causing a lot of stress. But at least at some point, that part will be behind us and we will have our babies.  I have NF and my daughter is not affected. :)  She is now two years old.  However, we did terminate a pregnancy with a baby that was affected.  I do not talk about it often, if at all, but I think about my baby every single day.  Unfortunately, we had to wait until 17 weeks.  The way the baby was positioned was not feasble for CVS, so we had to wait additional time for amnio.  Nobody really knew I was pregnant aside from our parents.  I also lived in the fear of \"pro-life\" harassment.  I can now say I am \"glad\" I made the decision.  Last August, I was diagnosed with a JPA (brain tumor) that is most likely related to my NF.  Luckily, it is a grade I and the doctors say if you \"were to get a brain tumor this is the kind you want.\"  Growing up, I never had many complications aside from multiple birthmarks.  It is a hard decision, I am here if you want to talk.  Thank you so much for sharing. I really needed to hear your story, that others have chosen to terminate for NF. Hopefully we never have to but it is so helpful to hear that if we do, I am not alone.  You are not alone!!!!! This is all I wanted to to hear when we went thru our decision.  The hospital was able to \"save\" the footprints which they put in a box, but we have never opened.  I do not even know the gender of the baby.  Maybe one day we will open it, but maybe not.  I wish you all the best (or wish you whatever you want to hear). ***internet hugs*** Thank you so much! We made it very clear to the genetic counselor that we do not want to know the sex. One of the two of my OBGYNs will do the termination (under full anesthesia, thank goodness) if I need one. I do not blame you for not looking at the box. I would not want that either. Thank you so much! You are so so sweet! \u2764\ufe0f Thank you so much for sharing your story. I just went through a termination of an affected child a couple of months ago. We didnt tell anybody about our pregnancy and just told our parents we had a miscarriage as we our Christian and I was not sure how they would react. It is been so hard and we have had no support as we did not feel like we could share this decision with anyone else. I feel comforted knowing we are not the only couple to go through this My husband and I have just gone through this. We decided to not do PGD because of the cost and to first try naturally. We decided we would terminate for the same reasons as you. Although it goes against our religious beliefs, we are both doctors and knowing the endless possibilities of what could go wrong with NF, we could not live with knowingly passing on that disease.\n\nWe had the termination at 15.5 weeks. Unfortunately even with all the logical reasons for doing it, it did not make it any easier. I would be lying if I said it was easy. The termination was in January and I still cry everyday. My husband has no regrets though. We both feel we will never know if we made the right decision. If it was something where I knew the outcome of severity I think it would be much better and I would be more confident of my decision. Honestly I know that if I had kept the baby I would have just been delaying/prolonging the misery watching a ticking time bomb.  I feel like there is no winning both decisions are shitty. \n\nIt felt even worse having to go to a clinic and pay for the termination as if this is not a much wanted pregnancy.  I had a D&amp;E and I highly recommend it as it was the quickest and least painful way to be done. It sounds terrible but I threw away all the ultrasound pics as I did not want any reminders. I want to pretend like this whole thing never happened.\n\nIt was pretty traumatizing to do this as it was my first pregnancy. We did not tell anybody we were pregnant because we knew we might terminate. We just told our parents we had a miscarriage. It is been so hard going through this with no support. I am so sorry you are going through this. It brought me comfort knowing I am not alone and I hope my story will help you.\n\n\nWe are going to try to conceive and start the ball rolling on PGD at the same time. I want to be pregnant again ASAP and at all costs. I am willing to take whatever loans I need. I do not know if i could go through another termination but at this point I do not care.  I just want to be pregnant again at all costs.\n\nIf you have any other questions about my experience feel free to message me Thank you for sharing your story. I am so sorry for your loss. This is such a hard boat we are in. I am going to send you a PM.  We did not tell my husband's parents for a while also due to religion.  It was tough. &lt;3 Ok, stay with me for a second here: I am the first in my bloodline to have NF2 (random mutation at conception: 1 in 40,000). And it has most definitely not been a fun ride. What is crazy is that I have always been pro-life, but after all I have/will have to go through for however long I comfortably have, and even though I have always wanted kids so, so much... I cannot justify having a child. Every time I think about it, it just does not seem ethically or morally right to knowingly risk the life, comfort, and happiness of another human, especially my child. It is not something that can be managed with meds (yet), or fixed (yet; we will come back to that), or a one time surgery; it is a life long thing that affects every bit of a person, physically, psychologically, emotionally... It is not fair to that person.\n\nIn short: As a pro-lifer, if I had a child (intentionally or accidentally) and discovered they had NF, I would most likely choose to terminate. \n\nIt breaks my heart for all of us because I know I am not the only one that lays awake at night thinking of the rest of my life and knowing having kids would be a risk that carries a life sentence for another human. I am so sorry for saying that. But I am a staunch realist.\n\nOn a POSITIVE note: in-utero and in-vitro genetic manipulation has taken leaps and bounds recently! In just a few years, they can fix any genetic issues a conceived zygote or fetus may have in-utero.\n\nHowever, I have heard that they can select healthy sperm and egg cell, and implant those through IVF. That means we could be the last couple generations to ever have or carry NF.\n\nJust a bit of positivity \u2665\ufe0f\n\nI will be thinking of you, and if you need someone to talk to, or have any medical questions, please do not hesitate to contact me. Really. I am here for you.\n\nAnd I want to say, as a pro-life individual, I would NEVER judge you or anyone for whatever decision you make. Truth is, as callous as this may sound, things like this we may not agree with or feel comfortable with, but it will save thousands of individuals from going through the same struggles as us.\n\nPro-life does not always imply saving all life at any cost. Sometimes life comes into this world, but it really is not living. Life is about living as a human being. Life is only living if you are capable of embracing and experiencing life.\n\nHopefully that all makes sense and I am not coming off as cold or cruel; I am totally on your side. I am just offering another view that I hope may help you through this. I will be thinking of you \u2665\ufe0f We looked into IVF with PGD (where they extract a couple cells from each fertilized egg and test it for the genetic disorder) but we were quoted $48,000. The price of IVF varies widely depending on the area you live in and I live in a very expensive area. Even half that cost would be a majorly difficult thing for us to pay for so unfortunately conceiving naturally and terminating is the only option we really have for healthy offspring. \n\nAnyway I appreciate the support. I did want to ask you a question:\n\nIs your sons NF worse than yours was? No. Both ours is very mild\nLittle bumps and spots\nHe is on the smaller side but so could many non NF people", "Is my neck stronger or weaker after two fusion procedures? In the last 9 months I have had two spinal surgeries on my cervical spine. The first one was removing it to me and doing a spinal bone fusion from C5 to T1.  My question is with so much metal on my neck is it actually stronger or weaker?. I also had a similar procedure, my neck feels weaker to me. I cannot even handle being on a swing most days. I am 44.  I am still a Metal Head and love head banging.  I could do it a little bit right now but not that hard. I showed videos to my surgeon, physical therapist and everybody. I said this is why I what I want to get back to.  It was a crazy video.  One girl and two guys with long hair just going crazy. \n\nAll the doctor's told me I will not be able to do it. I told him give me one year since the first surgery and I will be able to do it.  That is about 3 months away. I have tried it in a really slow place and I can feel the limitations of my movement.  I can still do it enough with my hair flies around without moving my neck too much.  I try to move from my shoulders or further down", "Things have not been getting better I was born with NF1 and mine caused a tumor behind my right eye so it appears swollen and as a kid other kids use to see me and get scared so making friends was hard. They did not even let me approach them and introduce myself. A lot of times we ended up becoming friends I mean hey we were just kids right. That Is what i thought. Now im 20 work at a grocery store and i hear entire families making fun of me with the dad cracking jokes. The people around just smile like dang that is messed up but its funny tho. When i was a kid older folks were all like aww poor kid and everyone wanted to hug me. But now i got older and everyone looks at me like a creature not to mention people underestimate my abilities for some reason especially in sports. Its just that i somehow managed to give zero fucks about how my face looks most of my life. But now its on my mind everyday because im in college , i work so im more out there in the world and face a lot. I think more and its not doing me no good. I am sorry people treat you like that; I cannot imagine how stressful and draining it is to deal with. I am not sure if this will help, though I hope it does, but please do what you can to ignore them and push their toxicity out of your mind. I know that is easier said then done, but people like that do not have your best interests in mind nor do they want to make you the best you that you can be, so their opinion means jackshit. It took me a while to get into that mindset and I am not able to stay there 100% of the time, but it certainly has helped. I hope that it, or some other positive outlet, can do the same for you. I am truly sorry that you have to deal with such horrible people. I am proud of you though for not caring what others think and moving on in life. I am twice your age and go through the same thing. I know it is hard sometimes but having a positive attitude does help and we are here for you if you need to chat I am so sorry people treat you like that. I had a large tumor behind my right eye as well and it made me very self conscious. I actually was able to have it removed because my eye was bulging. Surgery was not great (they went through my hairline so no visible scars) and it is possible it will come back but that would likely be years down the road. Not sure your situation or country but my insurance paid for it (it also caused headaches, not sure if that made a difference). If you have any questions or just want someone to talk to feel free to message me! I have a lazy right eye, that I was born with. My parents tried to have it corrected when I was a baby, but it never took, likely because of me having Neurofibromatosis. I did not have so much of an issue at school, kids knew it was a lazy eye and did not give me an issue with it. I was not until I turned 18 and started going to college that people who I did not go to school with would call my crack head, crack baby, pothead and druggie. I have never smoked or done a single drug in my entire life. \n\nHang in there, not everyone out there are jerks. I am sorry people are assholes and are making you feel this way. I have a tumor near my eye making it smaller and puffy. What I do because I too faced people saying terrible shit was bluntly say, it is a tumor I have a generic disorder I have no control over it, but you are an asshole what is you are excuse ?  I change it up every now and depending on where I am. Obviously I would not curse at a customer. But please know you are worth so much more than they make you feel. There is nothing wrong with you, people like them are the ones with an issue..they are the worst kind of ugly . Ugly on the inside. I am sorry to hear that. I have also something with my right eye and it is very obvious so people see that and I also work at a store but people are not making fun of me maybe because I do not notice it or they do not do it. I had to deal with it and just accept yourself like you know what you are capable of and just show others that people should not judge a book by it is cover. I know it is easy said because I have still moments that I think uhh I am just like others just that I look different does not mean I am different. A tip talk to someone you really can talk to like one of your parents or friends or siblings. Btw I am 19 :)\n\nOh and I hope it is correct English because it is not my first language so I hope nothing comes out rude because I only want to help and let you know that you are beautiful the way you are no matter what people say. Yeah i sometimes let it out and tell them what an asshole they are depending on where i am too That is how some people are. Some assume i got beat up or something and say damn he got his ass beat Thanks for the support Thank you Im in the U.S where was your surgery done ive had 6 so far Nice knowing im not alone and have people who can understand me. Thanks Unfortunately some people seem to lack common sense. I much rather someone ask me, rather than come up with their own conclusion and say it within ear shot or snicker and whisper pointing at me and looking in my direction.

Appearently my appointment was never set! :( I called the place back and they told me I could not go in because it was a children's hospital...I tried calling John Hopkins Uni hospital because that is the closest place I can think of other than going down South to like Fairfax and such (I live in VA). But I got transferred to a wrong person and did not get any help...\n\nSucks and I am starting to think I will never get the hello I need because I do not even know what type of NF I have but more bumps are starting to grow all over my body and the ones I already have are getting bigger!  Complete Understand your frustration. \n\nIn general, you do not need to go to a specialist to find out which in NF you have a General Praticitonor would be able to order the test and find out for you. \n\nBut if that is what you are looking for to be really sure then here is some info below. \n\nThis site ( gives you links to a Doctors Specific to NF- and in VA it looks like You have to go all the way down to Charlettslvile.\n\nJohn Hopkins in MD maybe a better fit for you if you do not mind going North and is a very Great place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHopefully, You Can Get an appointment and find out which NF you have and can go from there with Doctor on what to do next.   I DID NOT KNOW THIS WAS A THING THANK YOU VERY MUCH OHMYGLOB Welcome I hope you find a doctor and are able to find out what type you have. I was diagnosed when I was 15 back in 1999 and still continue to see the doctor who diagnosed me. I live in Michigan, but I go to Chicago to see my specialist. He sees both kids and adults, one of the few in the state of Illinois. ", "Scar tissue is starting to ache Im in my 20s and have nf1, and a couple of years back I had a rather large neurofibroma removed from my arm. It left a keloid scar (which was to be expected), and once recovered it was. But recently it is started to ache - is that just \"something that happens\" or should I have it looked at if it continues? Yes, keloids can sometimes start to itch or ache for no other reason that it wants to. You should not be alarmed. But if it comes to a point that it bothers you, there are some silicone based gels and patches that might alleviate the problem.", "Is it possible to only get a small amount of neurofibromas on your body throughout you life  Yes. I have a vary mild case of NF..... I have a thing in my right optic nerve so I cant really see out of it. Not completely blind but its extra blurry and a lot darker. They found it when I was 5 because my eye used to get stuck down. So it is not like I even know the difference. And my other eye is fineish (still need glasses. But for normal reasons) .... I have a ton of freackles so all the skin discolorations dont really stand out. Other then they are bigger.. I only have a handle full of the fibromas mostly on my back, sides, inner thighs, and under arms.   Got one on the back hair line... and a bump by my ear. It is possible, it effects everyone differently, but there unfortunately is no way of knowing how it will effect someone i do not have an exact diagnosis yet because we are having trouble getting my tissue samples to a specialist, but I had 5 schwannomas in my knee and that was it. the doctor suggests a mosaic case that only is affecting that area for whatever reason Yes. There many mild cases out there, most of which are probably undiagnosed. Although nf1 is progressive and most people who have it will see an increase in bumps as we age, many stay within the \"mild\" range well into advanced age, with only a few minor bumps.  \n\n\nIt is very unpredictable and there is really no way of telling how it will progress in a person, but according to most studies, 60% of cases are considered mild. Yes very much so, I am grateful that I only had 2 or 3 times when.

So on Friday I am getting an eye test to see if I have lisch nodules, which about 95% of people with NF have. If so, then I should have all the clinical diagnostic criteria for NF. Not only do I have a family history (my grandmother has severe NF but no one ever bothered to get her children tested), but I have had a tumor in my jaw removed when I was in high school (which also resulted in me losing my right jaw and having to get a metal plate). I also have a number of cafe au lait spots around my body. \n\nWhat do I do if it turns out I have NF? What happens next? I would obviously tell my primary care doctor but then what? What kinds of tests or procedures would I have to get? I have had pretty consistent lower abdominal pain-is that connected to NF? I am not as much scared as much as I am apprehensive. I am in grad school so I am already stressed enough as it is. \n\nI am just not sure what the 'next steps' are if I have it, so a little information would really be helpful. Thank you! If you have NF, then you have had it your entire life. In which case, you will be no different on Friday than you have been for the past two decades.\n\nMy son (just turned 3) was officially diagnosed on Wednesday. He would had lots of cafe au laits since birth, so it was not a surprise, but they found a few neurofibroma on him so that sealed it.\n\nBe cognizant of the risks and common attributes and be vigilant about your own health and any unexpected changes, but do not freak out. Nothing is different. The only real difference is that you will tell your doctor at your annual physical and they will have to look it up in a medical textbook. You will need to be aware of some of the symptoms of nf and may have to take a little extra caution if you plan on having children. The symptoms may be minor to severe depending on each individual case. Both of my nephews have it and have the more severe symptoms. As such, I chose to have a vasectomy because I can see the pain they are in on a daily basis. Both have severe learning disabilities. I would not wish that on anyone, so I have chosen not to have children.  Read about it. See a doctor who knows what it is, even if you only do that once. Whether and how you have kids is significant. But that is not a worry for tomorrow. If you have it, you always have had it, so nothing changes. If you hurt somewhere or have symptoms that are a big problem, see what can be done about it. If you do not, then there is not much to worry about, at least as far as NF goes. (It is possible to have more than one issue at the same time. If you hurt and can afford it, talk to a doctor. ) . I have NF 1. I had a facial tumor growing up which was hard personally and I have had surgeries to see better but mostly my NF is not medically significant and I have not seen an NF doctor in years. Others need to pay more attention, but it is all about how it affects you personally. It is not like being diagnosed with a degenerative disease or a cancer. My understanding is there is no reason to expect anything to change, for the better or for the worse. But it is useful to know what to watch for in case it does.  where did you get that \"95% of people with NF have lisch nodules stat\", its probably more like 95% of people with lisch nodules have NF but even then I doubt the # is that high.  my son is 5 just recently diagnosed with NF1 through genetic testing.  his clinicals were caf\u00e9 au laits, big head and low muscle tone.  so far that is all we see.  pretty sure most of the major issues manifest as a child/adolescent, since youre in grad school it sounds like you are already out of the woods, so to speak.

The surgeon that helped me this is all he does. It is amazing what a difference a 2nd opinion can make. \n     Right now I am still in the hospital trying to recover. I had five tumors removed T-12 to L-3 laminectome. Even with this huge incision on my back my pain is less than it was with the tumors. \n     Recovering is VERY hard. My left leg is completely numb, I can hardly walk, and I cannot urinate at all. The doctor said these things will take time to heal as the nerves heal.  It will be 3 months at least before I can hold my children and I do not know if I will ever be able to go back to my old job. But this surgery had to be done as I was in pure agony. \n    I just wanted to update you all and let everyone know how much I appreciate all the support this sub has to offer. Thank you all. \n      Thanks for sharing. My daughter has spinal tumors. She is 5. I pray that they do not cause her the pain that you have had to experience, but to me you are a hero for enduring what you have gone through and helping others along the way! Thank you so much for saying that. This has been the hardest week of my life. I have been nauseous for 5 days and very weak. Not even able to urinate on my own yet. I can not even imagine a child going through this. I hope her tumors never grow.   If you do not mind me asking, where in ATL did you go? I am in that region and desperately looking for a new NF doctor.\n\nAlso, congrats on receiving your surgery, I am so glad you are not in that same agony!

I am so glad to hear that you got your surgery.  I hope your recovery gets better over time.  ", "I am really tired, I wish I could have a break. I am 33 this disease has taken everything from me from a very young age, and has been the cause of so much pain (I am okay I guess I just need a break, I need this treatment to work). Last year the tumors that have been encasing my spine spread to my eyes. The spine tumors have been growing, and spreading since 2017 you know that pain that you feel only when these tumors are growing? it is very distinct I am sure you know what I am talking about. I am really worried about these ocular tumors.  The doctors are telling me conflicting things meanwhile my health continues to seemingly spiral.  \n\n\nI finally found a doctor who is willing and giving me honest information about the tumors in my eyes. He does not think they are neurofibroma but is not completely sure what they are. ( I am supposed to go to Arizona, or Canada here soon to try and treat these tumors in my eyes. I am gutted about the potential of loosing my vision. It is bad enough that the fucking disease took my young adult hood.  I graduated in 2008, that summer is when I had to have emergency surgery to remove my lower digestive tract.  I have 6-8 inches of small intestine left they took the rest of it. I literally spent my 20s in the hospital every 2-3 months from 20-28 with infections stemming from the removal of my digestive tract.  The doctor fucked up the surgery and did not clean all of the stool from the wound.  As you all should know shit and open wounds do not mix.  It is like throwing gas on a fire.  I nearly died from sepsis when I contracted MRSA in the blood stream along with MRSA. After that I lost my spleen, and pancreas, then my gallbladder last year.  My liver has permanent damage from 7 years of TPN. My Esophagus is dangerously thin. I often wonder that the reason is I survived all of this. Again I need to vent a little in a place where people get what is going on, and hopefully be able to talk to someone who is maybe going through some of the same things. Getting back to the tumors in my eyes I am petrified because right around the time I found out about the tumors in my eyes I crashed a motorcycle, as they were doing scans to make sure I did not break any bones.  They found a number of growths on my lungs. The doctor said they were nothing to worry about unless I am at high risk for lung cancer. From what I have read tumors of the eye spread to the lungs and liver next. If that happens then I am a goner. I am okay with that I really am.  I keep having worrying symptoms I am worried that I am going to wake up one morning and be blind or I will go blind while driving down the road. Has anyone had tumors in the eyes that looked the same and what was the outcome , how kind of time frame it in? Please be advised that your image contains personal information; you may want to censor that. I cannot say about the eye tumors but I did want to send you love strength and hope that you can find an effective treatment and get some rest. Living with crisis after health crisis is so draining. It sounds like you have a good doctor pulling together a team for you. It is definitely the most draining part. I read somewhere that in Japanese, neurofibromatosis translates to \"they who converse with the gods.\" When I am having hard days I try to remember that. I am sorry for your struggle. Genuinely curious and honest question. \n\n \nCan they give you pigs intestines?\n\nI ask this for 2 reasons. \n1. My best friend has to have a colostomy bag and I know the complications he had prior to getting it when his intestine length was dramatically reduced. \n2. My mother had mitral valve failure and they were going to use a pigs valve\n (she ended up with other health complications that prevented her from being healthy enough for the surgery though so it was not actually done) They do intestine transplants but tbh after almost 14 years never sitting on a toilet, I do not care to nor would the lifetime of anti-rejection meds be worth it I completely understand. I hope things work out well for you! Sending good thoughts and vibes! Thanks they should I got word today I should have a settlement check from a crash and be debt free before too long.", "Anyone else have neurofibromas like these? I always see the ones that are more like bumps but these are as if they are inverted and have a completely different texture &amp; color than the rest of my skin and \"sink in\" when I run my finger across them. ", "Has anyone had a neurofibroma near their heart? Had an MRI that vaguely showed a tumor near my heart was recommended that I have a chest CT scan. Results are below. Has anyone had something even remotely similar did they leave it alone, surgery, another form of treatment? \n\n\nLungs/Airways/Pleura : The lungs are clear. The airways are patent. No pleural effusions. Right lower posterior soft tissue attenuation 1.4 cm lesion in subpleural location on image 98 of series 3 is consistent with a neurofibroma.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMediastinum/Lymph nodes: There is a low attenuating mass extending from the anterior superior mediastinum along the great vessels to the level of the left main pulmonary artery which measures 2.4 x 1.9 x 6.7 cm (anteroposterior x transverse x craniocaudal) . It demonstrates mass effect along the adjacent internal jugular vein, however there is a preservation of fat planes between it and the great vessels. There is no associated calcification or cystic component. \n\n\u00a0\n\nNo thoracic adenopathy is noted. Soft tissue density in anterior mediastinum which likely represents residual thymus in a patient this age and appears separate from the mass.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHeart and Vessels: The cardiac chambers appear normal in size. No pericardial effusion. Normal course and caliber of the aorta. \n\n\u00a0\n\nUpper Abdomen: Patient status post cholecystectomy. A VP shunt catheter is partially visualized in the right neck soft tissues extending along the right chest to the abdomen.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOsseous structures and Soft Tissues: No aggressive bone lesions. A few soft tissue nodules are noted, for example at the midline of the chest on image 221 series 3 measuring 0.7 cm, and to the left of midline measuring 0.5 cm there are multiple other left-sided and posterior nodules are noted likely related to patient's history of neurofibromatosis. I have one hugging my pulmonary artery, and one hugging my spinal cord. It is being left alone with MRIs and CTs every 6mo. So far they have stayed the same size, thank God. I am so sorry, that is really rough but I am glad that have not grown and they are watching them closely. I had one on my spinal cord too which was removed because it started giving me a lot of back pain and grew to be about baseball size but that was several years ago.  The radiologist actually picked this one up and pointed out that it had been on a scan before and was smaller prior to my neuro- oncologist. I hope those two tumors continue to give you no trouble and do not grow. that is good, thanks man.hopefully they do not grow This is going to sound silly, but I really like how you phrased this...they are \u2018hugging\u2019 you!   Totally different feeling than having them invade you.  Thank you for that!!  Hope those hugs continue to stay the same size! lol, thanks. Just repeating what the docs said. lol Did not really think of it that way.", "Segmental NF1- blood test at UAB My 4-month-old daughter got blood drawn 2 months ago for genetic testing for NF1 and SPRED 1 at UAB. Today the geneticist said, they need more blood for further testing as she may be a mosaic for NF1 deletion in some blood cells, other cells look okay. Has anyone heard of this before? Also, if you have segmental NF1, what lead to your diagnosis and how has it affected your life so far? I am in my late thirties. Since my early twenties I have had small nodules growing around my ear, side of my head, and neck on the left side. I have asked every doctor I have seen about them, but none of them ever looked into them at all until I saw a specialist early this year for something unrelated. She did research, did imaging, had me come back, and referred me to a surgeon for a biopsy. The surgeon guessed that they were peripheral nerve sheath tumors. (I do not have any other symptoms of NF, which is why I am being evaluated and diagnosed so late in life.)\n\nCOVID stopped me from having the general surgeon do a biopsy on the nodules (my local hospital postponed elective procedures), but a neurosurgeon in a nearby city was able to do it in May. I had three nodules taken out, and the Mayo clinic said they were all neurofibromas.\n\nSince then, I have been working with my neurologist and the local genetic center. A month ago I had brain surgery for an unrelated neurological condition. Because that condition and the neurofibromas affect the same area, I traveled out of town to a specialist neurosurgeon who happened to be an expert in NF as well as my other thing. He gave me a clinical diagnosis of segmental NF1.\n\nA blood test was negative for NF, as expected. During my brain surgery, they took samples of more suspected neurofibromas, and those are pending genetic sequencing right now. Pathologically, they were consistent with neurofibromas.\n\nSo I am very recently clinically diagnosed, and waiting on genetic confirmation.\n\nI am sorry you are facing this with your little girl. Best of luck. My child has mosaic NF1. He is 8. Lots of freckling and CAL spots but that is it so far. When he is older we will sequence his sperm to see if he can pass on his NF1. He sees specialist every year and has been totally fine. My daughter was diagnosed with NF1 microdeletion syndrome at 2 years old. She is now 3 years old. She has the freckling &amp; cafe olait spots, one small superficial nodule on her thigh &amp; she is clumsy as can be. Otherwise, she is very athletic, extremely intelligent-advanced for her age, 100% fearless &amp; the happiest little girl I know! I was terrified when I found out...I am at peace with where things are right now, but I am always a little extra paranoid &amp; over protective. We see a neuro yearly, but he has already stated he believes her case will be mild. Try &amp; hang in there, Momma! No one wants to hear something is \u201cwrong\u201d with their children, but you can handle this! Hugs\ud83d\udc9c\n\nETA: not sure if this is helpful, but she has a twin brother who does not have NF1, so it can be an isolated occurrence. Thank you so much for your words. I try not to think too much, but it has been very difficult to accept. I am trying to stay focused on living a good life now and not to live with fear of what future beholds. I am so happy to hear that your daughter is doing well. I wish her good health and a fantastic life! Thank you for sharing your story. It is so rare what you have which seems to be segmental mosaicism in NF1. I am curious to know if the tissue obtained from your surgery biopsy is also positive for NF1. I hope you stay in good health! \n\nMy daughter must be a generalized mosaic because her blood seems to have a low level deletion between exon 17 and 27, and her CAL spots are spread out all throughout her body.  I will know the exact diagnosis by April 2021. I will update my post when I have more information. I am so happy to hear that your kid is doing well! Was your son diagnosed as a mosaic after a genetic test on his blood sample at UAB like my daughter did? I am asking because some people with mosaic mutation have negative blood test results. Was your kids blood positive or negative for NF1 mutation? Positive on a blood test. I know no two cases are alike but this gives me hope. Hi! Your case sounds very similar to my wife\u2019s. She has neurofibromas along the nerves in one of her calfs and single CALS on that foot. The blood test came back negative and genetic testing on a few of the excised neurofibromas had different \u201csecond-hit\u201d mutations for NF1. We are being told there is a very advance RNA test to further ID the \u201cfirst-hit\u201d mutation in order to know if she can pass it along to children. Have you had any discussions about the potential to pass it along to children at all? The genetic counselor believes our chances are small, but not impossible. I am not having kids, so thankfully that will not be an issue for me. My genetic counselors felt the same about it as your wife's, though - given where my NF presents, it would be extremely unlikely to pass it on if I did have children. I am sorry to hear about your daughter. I am in my early 30s and had some bumps biopsied at a routine dermatologist appointment in November. Biopsy showed neurofibromas, but they are confined to my lower back. Derm said it might be Segmental NF1, but could not say for sure.  She referred me to a genetic counselor who ordered a blood test- which will not necessarily rule it out (still waiting on results). I have not received a clear answer from any doctor on how to confirm the diagnosis. My husband and I are concerned about transmission to offspring. \n\nTo answer your questions- I had never heard of it until last month. It has presented as cosmetically unattractive bumps only visible when I am in a bathing suit. Sometimes they are sensitive to the touch, but that is really it. Now, however, it has had a major impact on family planning. Until we learn more, my husband and I are waiting to conceive. \n\nMy next move is to meet with a dermatologist who specializes in NF. I am hoping he will be able to confirm/ deny the diagnosis. I will look into the test markurl mentioned. It sounds like I am in a similar situation. Do you know the name of the RNA test your wife is getting? I am also worried about the small chance of transmission to children. Thank you! Not positive we are going to do it yet, but UAB recommended this test because the regular test on tumor tissue was a bust.\n\n This is so helpful. I am seeing a specialist at UTSouthwestern tomorrow and am going to ask about this test. I am not sure if insurance will cover any of it, but we will see. A word of caution. The neurologist told us that UAB is not offering this test during Covid. It is such a lucky coincidence that you found out before getting pregnant. I have heard so many stories of parents learning about their NF1 after their first or second child was diagnosed. You could use the medical science to your advantage, PGD will ensure your child will be NF1 free.", "What is my condition ? Hey , I am 20 and I have numerous subcutaneous tumors . Not a single one which is above skin , only the ones below my skin . None of them are bigger than an inch , and I had them starting from maybe the age of 12-13 . I do not have any other medical conditions like the eye nodules or the cafe spots , or optical tumors or any family history or any body dis alignment.\n\nNothing from the birth too I was pretty normal . Plus , I have no learning disability . On the contrary , I have a good academic career and I am going to a med school .\n\nI had an FNAC done some years ago which said that they were neurofibroma , but I do not have any other symptoms . Plus my doc said that it is risky to remove subcutaneous neurofibroma or to do a biopsy . Can you guys share some insights please? I have had plenty of subcutaneous removed. No issues whatsoever. I would recommend a second opinion. Seeing how you are planning to go to med-school you will have plenty of chances :). Yes thanks for answering :) My dad also suggested me that when I go to med school I would have better understanding and all , can I know more about your condition ? How many of those do you have and your age when they first appeared . And if any of it caused a lot of problems in day to day life . Also , when you removed the subcutaneous ones , did They cause any numbness or nerve damage ? Thanks Nf1 or nf2  can have a variety of presentations in the first decades of life. The fact that you have multiple subcutaneous neurofibromas warrants a genetic test for both the neurofibromin and the merlin gene . \n\nEspecially in spontaneous mutations, diagnosis can be delayed when waiting for the second criteria to appear. In addition to that, some mutations are peculiar and only present with a few specific manifestations. Last, mosaic mutations could mean again a peculiar pattern, like the case of mosaic Nf1 subtype 2 which present with neurofibromas only that follows the lines of Blaschko.   \n\n\nHave the two tests and  if you are met with resistance and the argument that there is little point, you could point out that you might want to prevent any worsening and that even a mosaic form seems to carry a similar risk for non-cutaneous complications. \n\nFor both cases, nf1 or Nf2, there are things one might try to slow down progression. \n\nWhen did you have your eyes checked for Lisch nodules and by whom? While waiting for genetic test, one day I could not bear it and went to an optometrist and asked her to check for them. She could not see any. When my test came back positive, I had to see an ophthalmologist and he found them, but because my eye are a mix of light brown with a bit of green , they are harder to identify. \n\nI do not have learning or social difficulties. Breezed through school and uni. I do not have a single caf\u00e9 au lait. \n\nAn isolated neurofibroma means nothing. Several of them justify a test. I got my eyes checked by my ophthalmologist and my eyes are brown so They were easy to spot if there would be any , but my eyes are perfectly normal , I just have myopia due to excess screen time , nothing else . I will get an fnac , would you prefer a biopsy ? Plus can you tell me more about your condition, age , no of tumors or other problems . You already had a FNAC, why get another one?  How many subcutaneous neurofibromas do you have?  Are they all an inch in size? An inch is big for a subcutaneous neurofibroma, that would be on the bigger end of their normal size 1-2 cm\n\nI am 30 years older than you. I had kyphosis as an adolescent, big dark hyperpigmentation marks in my teens on my back, more appeared on my neck in my 40s. My first subcutaneous neurofibromas appeared on my torso when I was 13 or so, before I got the brace for my back. The brace was crushing them causing pain, so I consulted a doctor who told me I would not feel them if I was not so skinny, and just dismissed me. I only have subcutaneous ones on my torso and I had one on my forehead. \n\nMy first cutaneous ones appeared around the age of 20, and I consulted again and again, and over the course of decades, not a single dermatologist got it right. They were diagnosed as cysts, skin tags, lipoma, and one on my thumb as a wart, I was told they were caused normal ageing, pregnancies, hormones, .... Had several removed, frozen, laser scalpel, ... until I had the subcutaneous neurofibroma removed  removed surgically from my forehead because it had suddenly started growing to a very noticeable size. This one was  was sent to pathology, it came back as neurofibroma, but the surgeon did not comment on that when he removed the stitches  and again I was send away. I had however my annual skin cancer check booked with a new dermatologist the following week and as she was taking history, I mentioned the neurofibroma and that had a ton of them. She went into panic mode and sent me to genetics. Visit. Test. Positive. \n\nI have today less tumours than I had when diagnosed. I live in Sydney, in a bikini, 6 months a year, by talking to me on a beach, you would not know. \n\nSo to sum it up my manifestations are: \n\n1) Skin hyperpigmentation\n\n2) Kyphosis \n\n3) Cutaneous and subcutaneous neurofibromas \n\n4) Lisch nodules \n\nI also have suboptimal bone density. \n\nI had a whole body MRI so I know I do not have internal/atypical neurofibromas nor plexiform neurofibroma\n\nNo learning/ social difficulties, like you quite the opposite, but in my case, it was probably because I became bookish as I spent my high school breaks/lunches  in a toilet cubicle with a book to avoid those who bullied me because of my back brace. \n\nI took a preventative approach to my nf1 and it has served me well. This is why I was suggesting the genetic test for both nf1 and nf2 in the presence of subcutaneous neurofibromas.  You already had a fine needle aspiration coming back as neurofibroma.  A second identical report would warrant a test. Might be easier, cheaper and less painful to go straight for the test. I believe Invitae does it for $250 (plus $125 if you do not have a referral and need a consult with one of their doctor.) \n\nWe tend to focus on the skin tumours because they affect our appearance and impact our quality of  life. However we have bigger threats, both in Nf1 and Nf2, and if you have one of them, you want to know, and act very soon. \n\nTalk to your doctor about your options. I do not agree (but I am not a doctor) that a subcutaneous neurofibroma is complex or dangerous to remove. I had one removed from my forehead. If we are talking about a plexiform, yes they are very difficult, but a classic nodular or polypoid neurofibroma, not at all. \n\nIf you have one that is bothering you, you can have it removed and sent to pathology. I went to a plastic surgeon for mine. You cannot even see the scar. Thanks for such an elaborate answer , You do not know how much it means :)  Yes that is true that I had an fnac done , but it was like 5 years ago . I have around 10-15 of those who are around 2 cm and those are the ones I want to get removed \u2026 I have a ton of small ones which are less than a cm or close to it which do not seem to be in view until I touch my skin and feel them \u2026 my tumors are close to my hands , which were prone to injuries when I was a kid , I used to get a lot of injuries on my arms and the first one popped out on the same spot where I got the injury , it is still there after 7 years , same size no feel . I want it to be removed so that my hand does not seem bad , because I have one cluster where 2-3 are real close so they look big collectively :( \n\nI am planning to remove them and get a genetic test done too , what do you suggest, should I go to a general surgeon or a dermatologist or a neurosurgeon ?\n\nPlus , what preventive measures did you take when you got diagnosed ? \nThanks . Inflammation and more precisely tissue repair is linked to neurofibromas (nFs) . It is common for them to appear at the site of an injury. Mast cells in particular take part in the process of neurofibromagenesis. This is why I now take Ketotifen, a mast cells stabiliser. It is a paediatric anti allergy drug . I started taking it as a preventative tool as we get worse as we age due - in my opinion - to a weakening in our repair mechanisms in the body. \n\nI also took a dietary approach. In 2016, the tone of the medical literature on nf1 took a sharp turn and it was all about cancer:  how we are very prone to it (59.6% lifetime)  with a bad prognosis. So I started reading about lifestyle intervention for cancer prevention for other cancer inducing genetic disorders or mutations, mainly BRCA1, and after 9 months or so of research, a review by a dietician, I adopter a high polyphenols, high vegetables, low protein diet with the addition of curcumin, green tea, moringa, ... and surprise,  my neurofibromas went down. A few months later , an Italian study was published that showed a reduction in number and size of Neurofibromas including plexiform . ( \n\nWhat I did not know at that time and I do know now is that moringa has similar properties as ketotifen and that in trials, it works better ( \n\n\\--- Back to you --- \n\nI think that the first step would be an MRI on your hands, especially where you have  a cluster of theses growths/ masses and differentiate them from ganglion cysts.  There are cases in the literature of patients  to you, with subcutaneous nFs only  ( \n\nWhich surgeons is trickier. Personally, given that NF1 is so full of surprises and that most doctors have no clue about it, and more importantly given that we are talking about nerves and the hands, I would go for a neurosurgeon or a hand surgeon. Some subcutaneous nFs are like a pea, movable, painless, and here , yeah , maybe a surgeon. I would let a dermatologist deal with growth on the surface of the skin, but beneath, not sure. \n\nA neurofibroma is a tumour of the nerve sheath. Think about the cable charging your phone. The nerve sheath is the plastic surrounding the wires or in my analogy the nerve. Depending how big or intricate the tumour is, sometimes, a piece of nerve is affected. You want someone who knows what they are doing when you have nFs the size you are describing or clustered together. It would be different for an isolated pea size, movable, soft.. \n\nIn your shoes, I would\n\n1) find an NF doctor and you can find  a list here  ( and herew (\n\n2) if this is not an option, have an MRI \n\n3) neurosurgeon or nf surgeon or hand surgeon\n\n4) and yes, I would throw the genetic test as well if pathology comes back with neurofibroma again. I am really obliged that you took your time to answer me Madam ! I cannot express it in words \u2764\ufe0f\n\nI think I will keep on a strict diet from now , following all the things you said . Btw can I know which vegetables to target more , plus why do you point less protein in diet ? I am a constant gym guy so I take my protein too . Would it be an issue ? \n\nI live in a town so I have to constantly travel to get the things done , I am starting with a biopsy and maybe a genetic test . I will talk to my doctor about the MRI . And yea , I found pills of moringa , should I take them or take the veggie ? \nAgain really thanks a lot First of all, a warning. I am not a doctor, and one should not jump and make changes that affect personal health based on the words of a stranger on the internet, no matter how knowledgeable that stranger sounds. \n\nDo you research, talk to your doctor, and you are not even sure you have nf, so take it slow. \n\nNow that this is out of the way, a couple of words about dietary intervention. It took me 9 months on pubmed and oncology books to design a favourable diet. \n\nMy diet is different than the one in the Italian study, so as a base, follow their guidelines more than mine. Since 2017, when I changed my diet and saw a reverse I have been trying to understand the what , why, and how. I have theories, and new ones come to my mind based on ongoing research. I do not think it is 1 thing, but the synergy of many of them. Flavonoids found in fruit and legumes have anti-inflammatory properties \u2013 and inflammation is linked to neurofibroma progression in terms of interaction between -/- glial cells and +/- fibroblasts signals (\n\nI was not targeting nFs, I did not even know it was possible, I was aiming at reducing my cancer risk and increasing my lifespan. I had nothing to compare it with but the programs for the BRCA1 women or p53. \n\nThe first book I bought was Servan Schreiber Anti cancer way of life, and I followed the food list in chapter 8. These I eat every day, blueberries, tomatoes, garlic, onion, cruciform vegetables, curcumin, green tea, ... I follow the recommendations of Dr Richard B\u00e9liveau again plenty of books , many available for free on libgen.  Every vegetable, polyphenol will act on a specific metabolic action, pathway, cellular process, DNA repair, sirtuins, ... I cannot tell you which, \n\nColourful food, cruciferous vegetables, ... Apart from curcumin supplement, everything is whole food. Even the Moringa, I make Moringa tea not pills. \n\nWhen it comes to protein, again, I was following the recommendations for people at high risk of cancer from Valter Longo, (   He goes low,  very low on protein. Same Luigi Fontana, and his book Path to longevity goes into long details on the why.  \n\nProtein will boost mTOR, a growth signal amongst other things. What is the connection between mTOR and nf1? Macrophages account for almost half of neurofibroma cells and it is believed that nerve macrophages are inflammatory effectors in neurofibroma development and/or growth. (   and what stimulates macrophage? High protein diet via mTOR. ( \n\nBefore you jump and bin your protein, in the same way, I do not believe it is not a single food that can help, I do not think it is a single food or macro (protein) that can harm, so focus more on removing the harmful from diet , regardless of having nf1, we know sugary drinks, processed meats, fried food, salty snacks, ... are not great and compensate with a high volume of vegetables. \n\nNf1 is tremendously complicated. Every question would warrant pages and pages of explanations. \n\nBefore looking at the cellular level, you need to understand what NF1 is and is not, and this will take a lot of time. Right now your priority are the nFs or masses in your hands. Understanding what they are and what to do about them is a good plan. Thanks ! I will just stop my access consumption of drinks and chips , as a precaution anyway . I mean I think this diet thing works because I belong from India and my diet has curcumin as a day to day product . Maybe that could be in account with the less expression in my case , meh just a shot in the air . But I will keep a track and go slow too , to get in the perfect balance ! Keeps us updated on how things are going. \n\nBest wishes !! My memory is bad, you can thank the NF for that.\nI do not remember when I got my first bump.  I never really counted them. To give you an example. I started counting all the tumors on my back. I stopped at 400. I was halfway.    \nI have several on my right hand and wrist. You know that giant nerve running on the backside of your wrist? I have 4 big subs there. In an almost perfect square. Pretty funny to see.  \n\nI cannot say I remember any numbness or problems after removing them.  They mostly do not give me any problems. I used to only remove those if they bothered me esthetically. Now that I have grown a bit older I do not bother anymore (unless it grows really big, it physically bothers me or of it is in a very noticable spot). Also, I have so many now I could keep going forever.", "Are you embarrassed by a brace, cane, or walker? Do you wear a brace anywhere on your body?  Do you use a cane?  Do you use a walker.  Do you use any other assistive device?  Does it bother you, do you feel embarrassed by it?\n\nI asked this question because November 17th I had major neck surgery.  I had a tumor removed from C6 and a spinal fusion from C5 through T1.  I am still wearing a neck collar two and a half months later and I got two more weeks to go.  I was using a walker up until last week.  Now I am using a cane.  I wear a full length leg brace on my left leg because my knee gives out on me.  I am not embarrassed by this at all.  I even wear the brace on the outside of my jeans because I like the way it looks.  I had no problem using the walker and I have no problem using the cane. In my opinion using the cane actually gives you a little bit of swag but that is just my opinion.  I try and be positive about everything.\n\nDoes any of this embarrass you?  Do you feel like you being looked at in a negative way?   Does this not bother you at all?\n\nThanks for your feedback I used a cane a few years ago for a few months when the pain from the plexiform in my left leg was at it is worst (between the debulking at the hip in December and at the knee in June.) I was a little embarrassed by it, but the pain was so much that I did not really care. Have never had to use any of those. You should definitely not be embarrassed my using a walker or cane. They just make it easier to complete your day to day activities. Things happen in life that are beyond our control. It is a great thing that your surgery to remove the tumor went well.   I your happy to be alive after what you went through. Your positivity is what is getting you through all of this. I did have a CAT scan last night to follow up from the surgery the surgeon wanted to see the results right away last week when he looked at the x-rays he said they were not a good quality but one of the screws looked out of place so worst case scenario I am going to find out if I have to go on to the knife again or not I do not know if it will be right away or once I am finished healing it is been two and a half months since the surgery I am almost fully healed now and it would really suck to have to start all over again. The only good thing is this surgery would be a lot less serious but I still think my neck is going to be hurting bad because he has a lot of scar tissue to cut through I lost my leg due to pseudarthrosis caused by NF when I was seven and have worn a prosthesis ever since.   I have never really been embarrassed. When I was little my friends thought my leg was cool and now I am at the age where I do not really care what others think about my appearance.  There is nothing I can do to change it so I try not to stress it.\n\nEdit: spelling My brother used to wear an orthosis around his entire torso and an orthosis on each of his legs reaching up to his hip. He was nearly completely wheelchair bound during his last years.\nBut he was never ashamed of any of them. Neither was he of his posture, nor the large tumors, nor any deformation.\nAnd everyone loved him, everyone always described him as a happy and jolly sunshine.\n\nBe confident about yourself, keep a positive aura and you are going to see everyone around you change their frown into a smile. Live your own life, do as you please, who cares what others think about you, who cares if they find your walker or your cane or your brace a bit weird, they do not know how awesome these things are! Without all of them a lot of things would have never been possible for him, for you, for everyone who needs them. \n\nI see them as glasses: a tool that helps you see because you cannot see well.\nThe leg brace and walker help you walk because you cannot walk well, the cane helps you hold your head straight because you cannot do it well yourself. No need to be ashamed of that and I am glad you are not!\n\nBut I also know that a lot of people are. To everyone who is reading this and is feeling uncomfortable with their body, their looks, their \"friendly little helpers\", remember, people look and stare out of curiosity, because it is different than what they are used to. Most of them do not have any bad intentions at all. And if somebody does say anything bad they are just a-holes and would also judge a person whose haircut they do not like.\nJust be yourself, no matter what you are and how you are, show off your strength and your life, your won battles and your own, unique beauty.\nA day spent laughing and smiling is worth so much more than a day spent in fear of what some stranger on the street might think about you.

My doctor still has no idea why I have sudden pain from Time to time in my fingers. This seems to also be triggered by the cold such as when I get in the frozen section at the grocery store.

I have tumors on my fingers, but they do not really bother me; I tried to burn one off one time, but had to stop the process because my finger doubled in size and I could not move the finger.\n\nI have a tumor they are going to remove in two weeks under my fingernail - I forget the exact type it is ... it is NF, but it is a specific type of tumor. It is fleshy so it does not show up on x-rays. I avoided it because a few years ago my doctor said my nail is perfect and it may not grow back properly, but this thing can wake me up from a dead sleep, throbbing in pain. Even throughout the day I pop ibuprofen like candy. I will have a pain in my fingers that I describe as a straight pin being pushed through my fingernail and through the pad of my finger. It usually happens on my ring and middle fingers. Yes! I have a dark-colored spot along the edge of my left thumb that is especially sensitive to cold and hurts when it bumps against something else.

Thanks for the laugh.", "NF specialist asking my daughter to be part of research Hi all - my daughter has just been diagnosed with optic gliomas and they are apparently particularly interesting.  Her NF specialist is asking that she be part of a research project (funded by children\u2019s tumor foundation &amp; NF Network, so legit).  Has anyone here been a part of research for NF? Is it important?  My daughter is 3 so we are still new to all of this.\n\n2nd part of my question - does anyone have experience with optic gliomas? I am trying really hard not to freak out at her needing chemo &amp; possibly still losing her sight.   Thanks  I have done several studies at this point and just enrolled in another. CTF is legit but keep your wits about you. They do want to help for sure but in the process of finding out what works (and what does not) there are always bumps along the way. That however is how we get closer to a cure. So yes, it is important. \n\nSorry, do not know much about OGs.  I am currently part of a research project for NF through CTF.  They say what I am part of is important, but really all NF research is.\n\n\nI do not have any experience with optic gliomas, but I think I have seen other people on this sub have. I have been a part of studies in the past. Just make sure to read the whole agreement. For example, some studies of tumor samples will not let you send samples to other doctors. I had an optic glioma when I was 9 and had chemo for it. My sight only suffered a little bit as I lost some peripheral vision in my right eye. I had regular tests and was always called in for when they had new residents etc... But I do not remember being in any studies (my diagnosis and treatment was around 20years ago) Thank you so much for sharing - I really appreciate your insight and you have helped me feel a bit better about this. Thank you :) I am glad I could help in some way Thank you so much. I have just been reading through the study parameters and I have got some questions before we participate.  Thanks - I am starting to understand the importance of research since this is pretty rare, correct? Good point - I will ask her doc about this. Thanks!  Is the clinical trial looking at MEK inhibitors? Trametinib or selumetinib?  I am really not sure, so that tells me I need to ask a lot more questions OK. Were you given a clinical trial ID, name, etc?  Hi! My son has NF1 and he had optic gliomas. We were told that they were considered functional because they did not affect his vision. He got his eyes checked every 3-4 months to ensure that there were no vision changes. Thankfully, at his last MRI in Feb his optic gliomas had shrunken and now there is nothing pathological about his optic nerves. He was diagnosed with NF1 when he was 4 and he just turned 6 last month. \n Correct.\n\nHave your daughter join the and Registry. They will reach out to you when an opportunity to join a study comes up. That is awesome! I am so glad to hear that it is possible for them to shrink  Out of curiosity what university is this study a part of? I have optic gliomas and might join if the university is nearby.  I am in the middle of a clinical trial and it is been winderful Please note that any tests they do on her (totally for their benefit) will be charged to you. To not give out family history or details I just want to say: please make sure you are with her for all the tests and know every single thing happening to her. There are some doctors who will take advantage of NF patents.\n\nBecause she has optic gliomas eyecare will be covered under general health insurance if you have not been told that yet. :) I do have experience with them as I have them in both my eyes. Everyone is different, but I have not had much issue with them.", "What is it like to have NF as a teen? Hi all,\nMy name's Chris and I do not have NF, but I am a volunteer for a UK based charity called The Neuro Foundation, that aims to support those who do. Recently, I have been asked to write something about what is it like to grow up with the condition, particularly as a teen/young person. I cannot know what it is like to grow up with NF, so I am trying to speak to people who do. \n\nI think it is important for people to know about the unique challenges that NF patients face, but also to see that teens with NF are experiencing the same old problems that every other teenager goes through. Can you relate to this?\n\nIf you have NF and are happy to share something about your experience of growing up, then I would be hugely grateful. You can go into as much, or as little detail as you want and it does not matter if you are no longer a teenager.\n\nYou can send your response in a PM to me, or leave it as a comment down below. Thank you for your time You are probably not going to get a lot of public answers here. A lot of the major changes with NF come with hormonal changes such as puberty and menopause. These changes can be emotionally scarring. You could plausibly deny your differences until those first few visible tumors hit. Your first surgery is always something you remember.  It is not easy. People stare and judge. I always got looked at different and get passed up by people as friends and relationships  It is different for everyone, some have a real mild case others have it much worse. I have Neurofibromatosis, but did not find out until I was 15 which was basicly when the on switch got flipped for me. Some will have problems early on. Mine did not start until my teen year. I started having a lot of pain in my legs, we thought at first it was jut growing pains, but it was not unfortunately. \n\nIt sucked haviging it and needing to go to the doctors a lot. And then as time goes on it just get worse. It is not that way for everyone, but for me it was. If you have questions let me know. Im from the UK. \n\nNo one knows I have it. Apart from my family. \n\nIts still effects me. Im smaller than all my friends, have a large head, have spots on my body. I just got two bumps on my chest. I also have small lump on my cheek. I just seen loads of tiny lumps around my eye area - not sure what they are. :( \n\nNo one even knows about it, it bothers me quite a bit.  Yes, I actually expected most people to respond in PMs (if they wanted to respond at all), but I have been severely impressed by the honesty and courage of folks coming out with their experiences. Thank you for your response, it sounds like a very hard experience. Did it get any easier for you over time?    Thank you for your reply. I know words do not really mean much, but I am very sorry that people treated you that way. I remember being extremely self conscious as a teenager, so I cannot imagine how much more difficult it would have been to go through those years with something like NF. I hope that you eventually found the friendships and bonds that everyone deserves Thank you for sharing. I remember teenage years being hard enough without having to deal with a diagnosis of NF. \nYou say that it was like a switch got flipped on you, how much would you say that NF changed things? Other than the frequent trips to the doctors, how did the discovery impact your everyday life, were you still able to do the same things as before: hang out with friends, etc?  Hey there, thank you for being open about your situation. It sounds really difficult dealing with something like that, especially if you feel like you cannot tell others. \n\nI am not trying to advertise the charity that I am writing for, but I just felt like I should mention them in case they could be of any value to you. Have you heard of The Neuro Foundation? It is just that you say that you live in the UK and you mention not knowing what those tiny lumps around your eye are. I am not heavily involved with the charity so I cannot tell you everything that they offer, but I know that they have a helpline that is open for whatever your need. They can help connect you to an NF specialist, or they can just hear you out and provide a friendly and encouraging voice when you might want one.  (Their website is:  )\n\nBut hey, that is only a suggestion and whatever you choose to do, I am rooting for you. Hang in there, friend :) I had a lot more pain, tumors just started growing. I had started taking Tae Kwon Do and I was always a little slower then the others in the class. \n\nI did not really have that many friends, but the couple I did have I still hung out with. When I said a switch got flipped it is basicly what can happen to people who are born with neurofibromatosis it can be dormant for a number of years and then when you start going through prubirty that can cause neurofibromatosis to start spreading and stuff.  Oh, okay. I did not know that NF did that, but it does match up with what someone else said about hormonal changes causing symptoms to occur. Good to know. \nRegarding your pain and other symptoms, have things gotten any easier as you have grown older?   No, it is gotten worse. And at least on of my tumors turned cancerous. That was removed in 2014 from my right leg. I may have another cancerous tumor, my doctor had looked over some MRI scans I had done on m6 right arm in October and he is requested that I have a full body PET scan now.  Jeez, that really sucks. Sorry that you have to go through that, buddy. \nThanks for all your time anyway, it really does help me so much. Stay strong mate and take care. Thank you, I just take it one day at a time.  Oh yes. it got much easier for me. I have had a few issues here and there like the typical lumps and bumps and some body image issues, but overall it gets better if you choose it too from a psychological point of view. I took up bodybuilding (natural btw ) and try to dress a little nicer. As I get older, I realize I am still just as impacted by NF as I was when I was a teenager, but you get to the point where your circle of friends and social influences narrow and you start to develop better relationships that you did when you had that one friend who liked what you liked in homeroom. I have had a lot of experience relationship wise and most women have been very understanding. I like me. I am not perfect and I never will be. I focus on what I can control, which is mostly my diet and exercise. In my experience it is true what they say about being healthy making illnesses less severe. I rarely get colds or the flu and when I do, it is usually for a day or two. \n\nMy doctor is wonderful. He  does not know too much about NF, but like all doctors, he has heard of it. I actually need to go in for my annual physical and cannot wait to see him. I genuinely enjoy seeing him each year. I have a small lump on my forehead right now, beneath the skin that is sensitive to touch and I would like it excised. I have had procedures like this before and I do not foresee it being any issue. \n\nFor me, the best advice I can give to people with NF is for them to get up off the couch, work out, eat right, meet people, and keep yourself informed.  It kind of sucked alot. I have a fibroma on my tounge causing me to lisp. Because of this I was often made fun off for it and out casted. It took me my whole childhood to teen years that NF did not define who I was. It was also really hard to learn that I would pass the gene onto my kids if I had any. So I decided not to pretty young despite knowing I wanted kids that where biologicaly mine when i got older. Though the worst thing I encounter are the people who pity me. I absolutely hate it with a passion. Those people often where much worse then the people who bullied me. They would treat me as if I was someone to be catered to because I was \"special\". Ah, that is awesome, man. Really glad to hear you are doing so well. I think your advice is very sound, for people both with and without NF (I know I could learn from it). I will definitely have to mention it.\nYou seem like you have a great attitude, pal. Thanks a lot for your reply.   Damn, that cannot have been fun. It is good to know your feelings about those people pitying you, because to be honest, that is the kind of thing I can imagine doing accidentally. I hope I would not 'pity' someone with something like NF, but I might try overly hard to be sensitive which is possibly just as bad? I do not know, but it is good to hear so that I can try and watch myself in future. \n\nKudos to you for being so considerate on the issue of children, it cannot have been an easy decision. Did things ultimately improve for you once you got older and away from high school, etc?  Hello, first time talking about it online. Honestly, it is somewhat unknown and most teachers treat me like it is nothing when I tell them I have it, because they have no clue about it. It was so bad to they point where a teacher was even brave enough to doubt my word on it and mock me ( a physical education one). \nLuckly for me, i just have spots around my body, but i remember when i was about 12(?) having what looked like a little \"mole\" that i cut off with a pair of scissors because I hated it.\nAdding to the fact that i have scoliosis too, everyday is painful. I am constantly in pain. Again, physical education is awful because teacher doubt my condition and do not understand that I do not have the coordenation that other kids have (it got a lot better as I did karate).\nI am constantly scared of my condition ( I have almost a phobia about anything that involves  diseases). But yes that is my everyday life.\n It was hard. You knew people were talking about you...for example, people would look at me, whisper to each other, point at one of the visual bumps (like one just below my lip) then start laughing. In the change room, I had people ask if I had \u2018x\u2019 disease and laugh.     \nThe people that tell me \u201cyou just have to not care\u201d are usually the ones with very fair skin (which is good advice but it is definitley hard when you are in your 30s and people are still laughing or staring at you).    Even coworkers at my previous job were wondering if I was taking drugs because of the bumps on my arm.    \nIt was tough in my teens and I have started to get used to it and not care as much (but I still do to an extent) but I still want to remove most of them but I think my dermatologist is trying to rip me off and squeeze out all my money, but that is a story for another day)", "DISCORD ", "Is having kids knowing you have a 50% chance of passing NF down to them a selfish decision?  (admin shut down commenting) Having kids is a selfish decision to being with. I am not having kids for this reason.   Yes. You are rolling the dice on their quality of life.  I am definitely leaning towards not having kids because of it. I figure if I really want to be a dad I can easily find a single mom or adopt. What about advancing technology in which removing the NF gene from the embryo?\nWhat is the success rate for that?\n\nSincerely,\nCurious young adult IVF.  I feel the same I am probably going to go through in vitro or adoption.  I do not think we can do that yet but i believe it is possible to screen sperm or eggs for the mutation and then implant a clear one through IVF. So would it still be the males original sperm or would it be someone else\u2019s?\nIs not that also ridiculously expensive? Still the original sperm and egg it is just been checked for having NF before the foetus develops.  Sounds fair enough. Might look into that when I am at that bridge in my life. I have nf1 but never had  any problems besides my spots I had kids  then I got older and started to have problems all four of my kids have spots and I am praying they do not end up like i am now PGD IVF is the way to go in this scenario.  It removes the chance of passing it along. I think it is very selfish. I deal with resentment issues towards my mother for having me because I got my NF from her. I want babies so bad, but I would never take that risk of passing it onto my kids, I will either do IVF or adopt if I decide I want kids  To me it is not a selfish decision plus it is 50% that they get it or not if you want kids you are selfie and if anyone else thinks you are they are just a**holes because if you really want a kid then have a kid and if they have nf so what is not like your going to love them less than  if they did not have it  I come from a long line of nf1, my great great grandmother, grandmother, mother countless aunties and uncles. I do not think it is selfish to have children if you have it. I do not regret having my two beautiful girls, I do not resent my mom having me even though I got it from her, it makes me who I am. It makes me sad when I hear people say they sent their own mother/father for even having them, that is selfish and your parents deserve a better child for even thinking or saying that.  100% agree Thank you I read that and I could help but get mad  When I attend the NF conference they talked about IVF. also having children can make your NF get even worse. I am not going to do it either. Between the NF and having a bilateral uterus a pregnancy would probably be the death of me.  I would not say it is necessarily selfish, but it is not something I would do. If you want kids there is nothing to stop you, but just think there is the potential that you are going to have to watch them suffer from it. \n\nI know I would blame myself for everything. I mean, what if my kid has it worse than me? If they would need surgery or have to get MRIs I would be a mess.....of course there is the potential that they will not have it, but you are a woman, it could make your NF worse.  Even if you do not have it a child can still be born with it. Neither one of my parents have it, but I their first born was born with it. Neither of my three younger siblings have it. None of my grands parents, aunts, uncle or cousins have it either.\n\nI personally would not want to pass this condition on to anyone, especially if I can help it. That does not mean you cannot have kids. There are a ton of kids out there who need homes waiting to be adopted.  and only because you want biological kids You could make a kid so happy if you adopted!! you cannot remove the NF gene because it is a genetic condition where a gene is missing... you can, choose to abort the embreo where NF is present and try again, or not try to have kids all together and just adopt I was born with a spontaneous mutation and I would absolutely adopt if I wanted kids   I heard that after puberty it will not get much worse, but that they should also abstain from having kids if they do not want to make it worse That is great!  I am the last in my family so if I do not have kids my name dies with me. I would love to have kids of my own but my wife is not up to it so I am ok with it for the most part Well it is a good thing your parents were so selfish! not so sure about it. Nope IDK it is' a huge gamble. Especially where I am from. I am from a country where it is super, super expensive to have kids. And if you have a kid with NF that is even more expensive. \n\nI live in the United States. For those of you in other countries and are not aware of what is going on here things are getting......... VERY interesting over here. I try and stay positive but I have a feeling that things are going to go very downhill very fast if they keep going the way they are going. I do not want to bring a kid into that. Much less with my current economic standing.  How? Have you read a newspaper lately? We live in a terrible world, putting a child in this world means dooming it to a life of pain and torture. If you add a genetic disease with the potential to cripple and disfigure you, you are really setting your child up for a terribly miserable life. PLEASE, think twice before procreating. If you really want a kid adopt. Thank you for sharing this.  When did your bumps appear? I am 24 (f) have a five year old without NF and I still have no bumps.. but I think I know of three that may be forming.   Yes. I would never wish this shit on anyone.  I am a spontaneous mutation as well! That is no fun. While neither of my parents have it, it is possibe realative on both sides of my family may or have it.

What about the other recommendations including having a high carbohydrate diet supplemented with MCT and avoiding C-16 to c-18 fats? Ummm it is not a lipid storage disorder. That there may be a side effect of lipid storage problems is possible. But uhhh neurofibromin is not a lipid.\n\nEdit the article is pre-registered. So it is not even approved yet. Junk science. I would differentiate here. \n\n1) High carbohydrates : I am not sure, but based on previous paper, I believe the authors are describes the \"standard\" chow food given to mice\n\n \"The modified dietary formulation was based on standard laboratory rodent chow, and was designed to contain equal amounts digestible energy (15.7 MJ/kg), carbohydrates (65.6%), protein (13.8%), and total fat (4%). However, in contrast to standard chow where all lipids contain LCFAs (\u2265C16: 0), the modified formulation contained 70% MCFAs (chiefly C8: 0). L-carnitine was also added to the MCFA enriched diet to support endogenous LCFA trafficking, at a calculated daily dose of 300mg/kg/mouse/day.\"  \n\nand the difference was in the type of fat used in the standard chow. MCFA instead of LCFA. \n\n( \n\nI am **not** reading this as a high carb recommendation, but as this is what we gave the mice to eat. \n\n2) A/Prof Schindeler is the expert here.

RAS is notoriously undruggable, reason why we go to MEK and mTOR, however, several natural compounds indirectly affecting Ras oncoproteins activity. \n\n(\n\nI think a study on all-things-nutrition-in-NF1 is long overdue, instead of trying to take a piece here on fats, a piece on the Italian study on polyphenols, another piece on iron there... Great articles, thanks for sharing. Believe that there is so much more research coming out about NF1 in last few years that did not remotely exist when I was growing up.\n\nI am studying Diabetes ed and have been fascinated by AMPK. David Sinclair book then introduced me to mtor. And then I remember NF1 as a Rasopathy with neurofibromin and its role in negatively regulating this pathway.\n\nTruly fascinating how all these pathways are interwoven with each other and some can potentially counter-regulate each other. ....diabetes .... this is a very intriguing feature in our disease. I was talking to someone involved in research and he said that at least NF1 had a silver lining, and that we seldom get diabetes, nor become very overweight because we have a high insulin sensitivity. And I disagreed, because I believe it is a risk factor, not a silver lining.\n\nOur horrendous dietary habits were reported in one of the few papers on Nf1 and diet. We eat  the worse diet ever and lack every nutrient under the sun (\n\nWhy? Because we can, as we do not face any of the main consequences of the bad diet, diabetes and excess weight. One of the main reason for people to eat healthy, plenty of vegetables, less processed food, is to control weight gain and avoid diabetes. We do not have this drive, we are slimmer than the normal population. We can get away with  ~~burger and fries~~  murder.\n\nThis is where I bring Bruce Ames in. I do not know if you are familiar with him, if not, check him out and his Triage Therory. Every nutrient, be it a mineral or a vitamin, influences hundreds of genes for optimal functioning. If we are lacking a nutrient, the body will divert the little it has  to the most urgent and critical function, leaving the genes depleted. IT is very long, I am not even going to try to paraphrase him. Watch his interview with Rhonda Patrick and some his lectures . Spoiler, he is 96!\n\nSo, our shitty diet aggravates our Nf1.\n\nA paper was published a few weeks/ months ago about how repetitive strenuous exercise was a risk factor for ALS in genetically predisposed people.\n\nSimilarly ,  a bad diet void of nutrients is a risk factor for complications in Nf1 people.  By complications, I mean increased severity of manifestations, increased cancer, dementia, shortened lifespan/healthspan.\n\nI am convinced a nutrients , polyphenols, anti inflammatory diet benefits us on so many fronts, from the onset of new neurofibromas, to DNA repairs, ...\n\nHowever, you are the expert on diabetes here, so I would love to hear your thoughts. Triacylglycerols ). I find it very interesting and am familiar with that paper.  My endocrinologist was unaware of this link when I asked her. \n\nI have to agree with you that a poly-phenol rich diet should help and am not too sure about macronutrients and NF1.  I also believe that an individuals diet should be sustainable\n\nAs far as a silver lining: I still believe exercise is extremely beneficial for NF1 individuals (we have typically lower muscle mass). I really dont know the impact of dietary choices on NF1, as most people in general (regardless of NF1 diagnosis) have fairly poor diets.  I particularly like \"Inadequate nutrient intake was noted for vitamin D, B6, magnesium, and calcium\" in that paper. appears to be a good start to target said nutrients.\n\nI really like Rhonda's work and will have to search Rhonda and Bruce Ames\n\nSome anecdote include (n=1) from my experience.\n\nTrying a modified keto style diet resulted in rapid weight loss (5kg in 2 weeks) and a rapid decrease in exercise tolerance and an increase in perceived muscle soreness (probably normal  response and due to glycogen depletion) . restoring CHO intake results in improvements in exercise tolerance. \n\nEven though Nf1 is viewed as fairly common (1in3000) its seems fairly difficult to gather enough NF1 patient data. Ive only actually personally met 3or 4 people with Nf1. Many studies started as the result of anecdotes reported to their doctor.\n\nWhen the tone and focus of literature changed in 2016 and it became evident we had this significant risk of cancer, I started reading about cancer prevention in genetic tumour inducing syndromes. Nada for Nf1, but OMG, so much for BRCA1. There was a multi countries program called LIBRE (Lifestyle Intervention BREast cancer. and it also means free in French) and another one from Italy main Cancer Hospital (Istituto dei tumour) called DIANA and they had 5 editions of it.  Canada had already a program for those women since 2006ish about variety and quantity fo vegetables. \n\nThe original papers' theory was that 85% and/or 60% of the woman had these cancers, what about the 15% and 40%. Why did they **not**  get cancer?  The mutation gave a strong predisposition but lifestyle would  push them down the cliff. \n\nMany authors, including Valter Longo, Luigi Fontana, argued that in those worth genetical predisposition to cancer, a low protein diet was to be preferred (which makes sense since proteins activate mTOR)  (  and avoid animal protein to just a bit of fish.  Franco Berrino - only published in Italian AFAIK , he worked for 40 years at the Instituto dei Tumori and was the director of the prediction  and prevention department   - was strongly against animal and sugar.\n\nThe Canadian page was great but no longer there but Richard B\u00e9liveau has published extensively and has been working on cancer and food for decades. \n\nAt the beginning of 2017, I saw a sudden increase in my neurofibromas and my fear was that whatever had triggered signals on the skin would do so for internal tumours so in March 2017 , I applied all I had read on tumours and foods and changed the way I ate.  The new tiny neurofibromas went away and since then, I have been trying to understand the what, the why and the how . \n\nThe more I read, the less I know but one thing I am 100% convinced : nutrition matters. \n\nIt is not only the size of participants that makes it difficult to design a nutritional intervention study, you need participants who will commit to only eat what they are told to eat for 3-6 months , no fries, no burgers, ice-cream, cake, ... and six months is an awfully long time. In addition to that , there are many challenges to do nutrition studies. I love Christopher Gardner, this is not an NF1 or even cancer video, but about their hurdles to approval, funding, .... (  \n\nI could go on forever, so I will stop now, Reddit garbled my above comment. But thanks. One other point I find interesting in regard to mtor: Nf1 flareups appear more likely in periods of growth (pregnancy, puperty) and I would like to see if one can increase  SHBG in NF1 as a protective mechanism. mildly elevated SHBG is associated with fairly good metabolic outcomes and usually increases in periods of fasting and low insulin levels. \n\n I need to reflect on this one, because the flareup in pregnancy has recently been debunked ( conclusion are that yes, pregnant Nf1 women do see an increase in numbers in neurofibromas, but non pregnant women experience a similar increase. The worst increase is certainly after the age of 50, so I would rather look towards Sinclair for why it might happen. \n\nThe most important moment of growth in a human is between birth and the age of 1, the baby will triple its weight, every organ grows at max rate and no neurofibromas . \n\nWhy and what triggers the neurofibromas ...why two identical twins with the exact same mutation will have dramatically different outcome... so many questions! No", "NF1 and Transgender Hey!\nAnyone know of the links for NF1 and testosterone? Any new information? Yeah, I could not find anything new. would like to know too. It would likely be best to discuss this with your Neurofibromatosis specialist. \n This is a Facebook group for trans people with NF.  It is pretty quiet, but people are there Yeah I am seeing a neurologist tomorrow because I am hopefully starting testosterone in august. I will try to remember to post an update on what he says Yep in that group too haha", "Hard to physically move Hello, new here, I was wondering if anyone else has difficulty to move, Ever since 2017 my condition has been getting way worst. It hurts to move and I have to put in a lot of effort, im not dehydrated or exhausted. Does anyone else have something similar or can help me out? I have little to offer from my own experience, but I am curious of the extent of your physical symptoms. Could you go into more depth? I have it with good and bad days. I also have only one lung due to NF infesting 50% of each lung. I find I have to find how much I can do and sometimes life with the fact I cannot get everything some how I would of years ago.  \n\nI have taken cocodomol and ibuprofen for a few years while this helps it is not perfect now I use it as and when I need it. I am also on Amitriptyline for chronic pain.this drug has changed my life. Just over a year ago I really could not see the points in a lot of things in life. Went to a conference, talk on pain and I ticked every box. The next day I was at the doctors and had new pain meds a week later and they started to work and I have not looked back. Yes, recently I started to notice the my body, just felt worn out. it just feels like I am an elderly person even though I am 16.\n\nI know that my body has felt a little \"sore\" for years but this is worst. The pain is not excruciating but it is not easy to ignore.\n\nSorry that the best way I know to explain it I have pain throughout my body and can have issue being on my feet for long periods of time. I also have some weakness.\n\nWhen was the last time you have seen your Neurofibromatosis specialist and had any MRI scans done? One thing I would start is a \u201cpain diary\u201d. The type of pain, where and when. And level from 0 being nothing to 10 the worst. This might really help with any appointment your have with a medical team How is your diet?\n\nHave these fatigue symptoms become much stronger recently or gradually over time? Are they consistent in location?\n\nLastly, how is your sleep? My diet is good, u eat proper proportions.\n\nYes, since two weeks ago it seemed to gradually worsen by the week. And it is consistent in location.\n\nI usually get 6-8 hours of sleep\n\nSorry for the late reply how do you think these symptoms correlate with your neurofibromitosis? the symptoms seem quite burdensome and progressive if you are correct in your recollection of the past few weeks. Do you have a specialist that you see?   \n\n\nIs this episodic, meaning, has this happened before? I got to start doing that! Great idea. For the first, kind of. Both, lately\n\nAnd for the 2nd part, I have had one and there are multiple non-cancerous tumors on it. I am going for a next one in a few months to see if they have grown.\n\nI have been taking gabapentin but it is starting to do more harm then good for me now", "Scoliosis Does anyone else have scoliosis? I am 24 and I have only just had it picked up and diagnosed. So it is not that bad. Yet. \n\nThe doc says I have 12\u00b0 of twist (normal is 5).\n\nWhat treatments have you done for it? How bad can it get?  I have it. Got diagnosed at pretty young age. I went to an orthopedic, he suggested I go to a physical therapist. He also gave me special leg braces to wear at night. With wearing the braces and doing the special exercises the physical therapist recommended my scoliosis improved. Now I no longer need to see either of the two.  If you have NF you are almost guaranteed to have scoliosis to some degree. In your case I do not think there is much to do, just avoid lifting too heavy things (lower back tendinitis fucking suck).\n\nI have seen some use corsets. In really bad cases you would operate in a metal rod to stabilise. There are also rods where you can use magnets to slowly extend them, straightening the scoliosis over time.\n\nAnd then there is Halo Gravity Traction. You get a clamp screwed into your skull, hook up a wire with weights on the other end and put that on a pulley. Walk around with that for a few months and the weights will pull your spine straight.  Owch that all sounds pretty intense. Fortunately mine is mild enough that we have only just picked up in it by chance. So hopefully it will not get any worse.\nI have been going to the gym quite a bit lately and my job involves a lot of heavy lifting. Yay. Fingers crossed my back is already strong enough.  So you have 'cured' it? You just do the exercises and etc?  I think so it definitely improves it for sure  Scoliosis treatment has really come along in recent years. I believe that rods are no longer necessary, they have more effective treatments that are also less invasive. It is been a few months since I really researched so I cannot remember exactly.  That is good to hear. Hope i do not have to go that far anyway. I had an MRI done today to determine the full extent of the damage. Just waiting to hear back now.  Yep! Had fusion surgery for it too! I have it near my right shoulder blade, and it is an absolute killer! My right shoulder blade is almost always in pain. Have not had any treatments beyond a chiropractor which did help with my back pains and monthly massages. ", "I am trying to see if it is linked here too. ", "Senior Project on NF2 Hello! My name is Imani McCalla and I am a senior journalism major at Purchase College. I am currently doing a senior project on a friend who has NF2, which I need to complete before I graduate May 13. He will be undergoing intravenous therapy (IV) through the use of Avastin soon to shrink his tumors or reduce tumor volume on his brain, lower spine and right elbow nerves and improve hearing in his right ear. My project will focus on how he copes with this illness, how it effects his family and what effect the therapy will have on him. If anyone has NF2 and would like to be a source for my project, I would greatly appreciate it. Similarly, I would like to know how you cope with NF2, how it effects your family and if you have undergone the same therapy or taking other treatments. My senior project adviser will be returning the edits to the last paper I had submitted, which I should get in the next week or two. Once I get it back, I would like to add your information if are willing to help me with this assignment. I know that this is such short notice, but I was advised that finding another person with NF2 would be the biggest part of my project. Thank you!", "Gabapentin vs Lyrica For those of you that take Lyrica instead of gabapentin, does not make you tired. I just started Lyrica 2 days ago, and I am absolutely exhausted. I have been getting tired with my gabapentin but I have uped my dosage to two pills in the morning and two at night. Please do not spread misinformation \nMeds are different for everyone Gabapentin was the devil\u2019s drug. I took it and got the worst vertigo I have pretty much ever had. I was so tired and just wanted to lay around and die. Lyrica was okay...but to be honest none of those worked for me. My personal experience with lyrica was awful.... it made me soooo sick. But i thought it was just the disease progressing... stopped taking it because I could not afford it and got so much better. God bless the broken American health system? Lyrica made me blackout.  And Gabapentin made me a zombie ansld gain alot of weight. I dislike them both heavily. Sucks those are the only 2 real \"nerve pain\" meds", "I might have it So I went to the opticians a year ago and they found lynch nodules in my iris. They referred me and have found a glaucoma on my optic nerve. What happens next for diagnoses Nf is diagnosed officially through genetic testing. Optic nerve gliomas effect about 25% of people with nf. Of that percentage, 10-15% will need treatment for it. If you are an adult and your glioma is stable they will likely not need to treat it. \n\nThere are clinics that are specifically for nf, if you search nf clinics you may find one and your doctor can refer you. Or your regular Dr can keep an eye on you if there is nothing concerning. Check out the children's tumor foundation ctf.org for good info and the basics!  Mostly MRI and PETs scans to see where tumors are located and to see if any are causing problems or could become cancerous. I have full MRIs done at least once a year if not more. I will be have a full body PET scan on the 30th of this month.\n\nI have had three surgeries, one was to remove tumors from my arm that was done I believe in 2001. Then in 2007 I had tumors removed from my spinal cord. And then in 2014 I had a cancerous tumors removed from my right leg. And depending on what the PET scan shows I will likely need surgery again. I have been having a lot of pain in my right arm and my balance has been off a lot.", "Plexiform Removal Decision I have been thinking about this for a long time and I plan to ask about the removal of a large plexiform from my face (maybe even the ones from my chest and back). I said I would never have it done again. But never is a long time and will only do it if the medical team is confident in doing it. I do not have an appointment in late September so it not going to be any time soon, I would expect about 12 months before any possible operation.\n\nI last had it done around 2002/4 and it was very painful and I needed a full blood transfusion as I lost that much.  But I am going to ask the question and see if anything can be done.\n\nSince I am in the UK and do not have private health care it will be via the NHS.  \n\nNot told my family and friends about this yet I want to start asking the questions before I worry them. What are your questions? Recovery time, process? I have have two different surgeries to remove tumors that had turned cancerous in both 2014 and 2018, they were both successful surgeries. I am however in the United States. I have a lot to ask the medical team. Since I have NF on my lungs and only got the capacity of one I need to make sure. Also I hate been in hospital and not been able to look after myself so could only do 4/5 days in hospital. \n\nWork will not be an issue I have that sorted all ready (I work for myself and know techs who can cover for me)", "How has NF1 affected your life? Hey,\n\nIm curious how NF1 has affected your life and do you see it in your everyday life somehow?\n\nI have not ever really noticed anything or suffered from anything, had one \u201dgood\u201d tumor which was removed when I was 6. Also I suffer from poor motorical skills. Other than that nothing.\n\nI am thinking that surely not everyone does have so little or next to nothing \u201dsymptoms\u201d. I have legit have like no bad symptoms, I just was not allowed to play football cause I have some on my spine. I find myself severely blessed. Yeah, I really had not realized that many people have much/difficult symptoms.\n\nGuess im lucky too, that the \u201dworse\u201d thing was that \u201dgood\u201d tumor, which was removed asap, so I dont even consider that as a bad thing really. My severe scoliosis needing surgical intervention is probably connected with NF1. I have multiple neurofibromas on torso. \n\nThe scoliosis and the surgery surely affected my life. But it is more inconvenience, when I was on Uni I did competitive dancing without much problems. It has affected my life, as  I have spinal tumors. It is painful, tumors all over deep in my muscles. It has caused CRPS II in my legs. I had a doctor tell me my pain was all in my head as a teenager because he did not believe the tumors could be painful. He was not a specialist and I ended up on so many antidepressants that I felt like a zombie. It really made me distrustful of new doctors for a very long time. Although I have dozens of tumors all over, more than anything, it has affected my self-esteem and mental health. Some of the tumors are very visible, which makes it a challenge every day. A tumor is in my ear, so some hearing is lost, and I get tinnitus sometimes. I am grateful not to have too much pain and no physical limitations. In short, It has ruined my life. I went from a lively fairly independent young adult who was in the honors society at college. I had hobbies, a job at a local library, &amp; friends. Every weekend I would go to the city ob my own to see some friends and do something fun. I went to museums, restaurants, plays, etc. I was able to accomplish all this even though I had 40+ surgical procedures by age 19. I was never able to play sports and had to live with my parents when I started college, but other than that I was never held back in school and excelled in classes and was able to do more than most people my age. It all went down hill in the summer of 2018. I developed terrible pain throughout my entire body. I suddenly had crippling fatigue , neuropathy, and countless other issues. Three years later my doctors still have no clue why my health suddenly took a turn for the worse. My health has gotten even worse since 2018. Im trying a third experiment treatment for NF since the first two experimental treatments failed to shrink any of my neurofibromas. I dropped out of college, quit my job, lost most of my friends, and now spend most of my time in bed. \n\nIn the past two years I have changed my entire diet in the hopes that eating better would help, but no. I take wheatgrass, ketotifen, bee propolis, Manuka honey, turmeric, tons of fruit and veggies daily\u2026 all these things have shown to possibly help with neurofibromatosis (specifically turmeric, bee propolis, &amp; ketotifen). But despite all the evidence that this stuff help it has done nothing for me. \n\nI am current on a ton of opiods which barely do anything for my pain and just bring a host of terrible side effects. I feel like my life was stolen from me. I am on another experimental medication for NF called cabometyx (aka cabozantinib), but it has done nothing for me. I am at a dead end. In December 2019 I went to a top doctor at the Mayo clinic to see if he could help. He basically said I would not live past 2020. Well, I am still alive, but, tbh, I feel half dead physically and mentally. I think most will agree, bumping into it. I have had 27 brain surgeries. Most were for a shunt relating to hydrocephalus. The other was for a brain tumor, which ironically had nothing to do with NF. Also have a learning disability, which lead to a longer than normal college career. I get scanned every year for tumors, motor skills are good as I drive also have a forklift licence with reach. Though I do need corrective lenses but fairly weak script. I do not know if I can guarantee my life would be super amazing and perfect if I never had it, but it ruined my life I would say. I feel like a total failure because of all of my surgeries that just stop be from living up to my potential. I was also kind of diagnosed in 2018. I have neurofibromas but my genetic testing was normal and have seen several specialist at mayo. They think i have a super rare mutation but nobody knows. My health fell apart in 2018 and i was terrible pain for 3 years but im actually getting better now. Im hopeful i can continue to improve. Things looked really bad for a long time so i kind of understand where your coming from. Dont lose hope it can get better. Aside from terribly insecure days where I cannot stand to look at myself. Nothing else is majorly wrong. I cannot say how blessed I feel to have no cognitive or motor skill issues. No pain either. Nothing like what I come across people complain about here. My hesr goes out to all of you! If I could find a geni lamp I would only ask for one thing. To rid the world of NF! (maybe world peace too and other important stuff.... But nf firdt tho... Cannot forget to free the geni!) Fuck doctors! I have not had a good experience yet. So many of them say no there is no issue here. I had a tumor growing in my ear. Say 6 doctors that all played off of each other's diagnosis of allergies. I had one symptom. Leaking from the ear and I guess 2 my hearing was starting to be affected. One doctor even said \"your ear canal is more narrow almost like there is something on the inside compressing it, but I cannot see anything so it is probably allergies\". What the actual Fuck! I had to demand a specialist and an mri. Finally had the sucker removed.\n\nBut it is not even with NF. Doctors suck in general. My dentists assistants spread sensitivity to 3 different teeth because they did not listen to me complain that my new filling caused problems when I flossed. Demanded to see my proper dentist. Turns out a tiny fragment of filling was caught between teeth. 10 second fix. All issues went away. Those other dentists were filing my teeth and putting anti sensitivity cream in and wanting to do more fillings, almost did a root canal. I am like hell no! Listen to the words I am saying.\n\nAnd these are the doctors we trust that say an experimental vax is good for us. And that lockdowns work. Or that breathing your own dirty air under a mask that was taken off a bunch and touched 10 different surfaces all day is good for you. \n\nThere is more but I will stop. Sorry for the rant. Feeling esspecially insecure and frusturated by my NF today. Do not trust doctors one but. Tough to find a proper one.", "Why does NF1 cause scoliosis? I noticed there is no cure to nf scoliosis, so I want to make a robotic back brace or prosthetic spine to help prevent children born with nf from getting spinal deformities. I do not know much about nf, so I am curious what it is exactly about the condition that cause the bones in the spin to deform? Are prosthetics and braces even a possible solution? I have severe scoliosis. I am no specialist, and I do not know the pathology or background of NF. All I know is that NF tends to cause all kinds of skeletal deformities (i.e. scoliosis). I have a more than 70 degree curvature in my spine, severe spinal scalloping, spinal stenosis, spinal degradation. I had a serious of back braces when I was really young. I would not say that it cured my scoliosis since I have a very severe case, but the brace were definitely necessary and likely helped me. \nThat being said, I dont believe that scoliosis caused by Neurofibromatosis is any different than scoliosis caused by some other disease/illness or due to injury.  Reddit will not let me make a new comment so I am posting here\n\nI read a research article about this awhile back and recall it has something to do with the connections of the spinal neurons. I do not remember exactly though so I will look for the article and get back to you.\n\nEdit: I do not know if this is the same one but if you scroll down there should be info on musculoskeletal deformities in NF.\n\n The short answer to you question is we have crappy bone quality. \n\nThe long answer is: the nfi gene, neurofibromin,  is expressed in the bone mesenchymal and hematopoietic lineages and its loss of function can therefore affect bone remodeling and repair through a number of non-mutually exclusive mechanisms. Neurofibromin is expressed in osteoprogenitor cells, chondrocytes, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts, and the loss of one or both copies of Nf1 triggers continuous RAS and ERK1/2 activation in these cells . \n\nTo start with we are not osteopenic under normal conditions but lose more bone mineral with time. This is caused, at least in part, by an increase in osteoclast-mediated bone resorption,  increased proliferation and impaired differentiation . We also secrete  increased amount of osteopontin, a matrix protein known to promote osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast migration.\n\nIn English (A very gross simplification) :  the loss of NF1 in us causes poor bone quality because the turnover between osteoclast (old bone removed) /  osteoblast  (new bone formed) cells is dysfunctioning, and the mineral content is not optimal.  \n\nYou also seem to miss the majority of our skeletal manifestations. 50% of the people with NF1 will have skeletal abonormalities. Of these 50 %,divided over several manifestations, by far not only scoliosis: \n\nShort stature 12%; macrocephaly 29%; craniofacial dysplasia 12%; vertebral dysplasia 11%; scoliosis -25%; lumbar scalloping 10%; pseudarthrosis/tibial 3%; pectus excavatum 31%. \n\nThen of course, there is also the osteopenia and osteoporosis with again less treatment option for us. \n\nYou cannot prevent scoliosis and it would be an horrible plan to put a child in a preventative brace . I had to wear a brace for NF kyphosis at high school, one of those atrocious year 80's brace, made of metal and heavy plastic, and I was bullied to death, and spent my high school year breaks and lunches hidden in a toilet cubicle reading to avoid my bullies. \n\nNot to mention that it would be undoable because kids grow too quickly. \n\nA brace will fix the end result, the scoliosis or kyphosis. We need to tackle the molecular mechanism of bone formation to really prevent it. \n\nActually, we need to prevent all our manifestations, including cancer and dementia, and we need to be proactive from as early as possible. We are told, wait for a problem , and we will fix it, but these statements from our NF1 doctors, seems to ignore the research saying that we do not respond well to cancer treatment, osteopenia treatment and now it seems our rate of dementia is very high, so we need to adopt a very aggressive regime to avoid the cancers, avoid osteopenia, avoid dementia and so on. \n\nI cannot see how your idea could help us. Maybe you can come up for an aide for the tibial dysplasia, another terrible manifestation. ty for sharing your background with me. im sorry that you went through that as a child and an adult. Was there ever a successful remedy or anything close? ty ty ty! i really appreciate the research! you are v educated ty for the response. you mentioned, \"We need to tackle the molecular mechanism of bone formation to really prevent it.\" would that fix all the other \"skeletal manifestations\" ? (i use quote cause this is my first time using these term and idk if im using them right). is this something that could be removed in a humans genome before birth using CRISPR? Yeah of course! I am a high school science nerd so I lowkey enjoy digging into these things. More than 50% of the NF1 are spontaneous mutations, meaning, neither the  mum or dad had and it just happened. So nobody can know before birth and often for a long time after birth that a child has it. \n\nNf1 has also a very high number a novel mutations in addition to the exisiting mutations we know about, so far we are well above 3500 different mutations. This makes the use of CRISPR almost impossible (for now, let us talk again in 10 years time) . There are however other types of gene manipulation. We have two copies of the nf1 but in our case, one the copy is mutated and does not produce the amount of neurofibromin we need. So there is a company who is looking at manipulating the good copy we have to increase the circulating neurofibromin. That company is here if you want to have a look at it. ( \n\nNF1 is a gene that regulates the cell cycle over several pathways . In many ways. On many fronts. In different organs. The abnormal cycle in bones is different than the abnormal cycle in the heart. So in the bone, one of the many phases that is dysregulated is the apoptosis and senescence part, the end part if you prefer. In the heart, on the other hand, it is the hyper proliferation of the cells that cause the problem and more specifically the types of cell that comprise the vascular wall, mainly the endothelial cells but also the vascular smooth muscle cells and the pericytes. This will affect the vascular flow and is also true for other major arteries. So for the endothelial cells it is the grow grow phase that is wrong. \n\nTrying to explain the molecular function of NF1 would take a book or two. Compared to genetics,  molecular and microcellular  biology is sooooooo complicated and the more I read about NF1, the more I realise how misunderstood this disease is by the majority of doctors, and that it is crucial that we are seen by specialist or at the very least , we need to educate ourselves and then educate our primary doctor. \n\nWhen one takes a deep look at the cell, it is impossible not to look at what drives a cell, and that is food or lack of food. Depending on whether  certain nutrients are present or absent, the cellular function will completely change. From cell cycle to repair, from emergency function to long term management, all the nutrient sensing protein such as - the hugely important for NF1- mTOR are activated by insulin, nutrients and growth factors. \n\nI believe diet matters tremendously in NF1. High polyphenols protecting from mutation and second hit, preventing cancer (we have a 59.6% lifetime risk ) , calcium metabolism, regulating our high inflammation which plays key role in so many of our issues . \n\nEven forgetting all the prevention front, controlling inflammation is critical in NF1.  T-Cells are needs for neurofibromas tumorigenesis. Control inflammation , control neurofibroma growth. How to control inflammation: diet is a big player. \n\nWe have an abnormal glucose metabolism as well, the opposite of diabetes, we have an abnormal insulin sensitivity. So we do not get diabetes (insulin resistance) and not as fat at normal population. This mean we can get away with murder or a burger, and fries and a milkshake on top. Horrible food that will shoot up inflammation. Insulin is a door keeper for excessive glucose in cells, a bouncer if you want that will shut the cell door to glucose. We do not have that , we have an open door policy. Glucose will drive cell proliferation. Maybe we should control our glucose intake ourself given that the body controls are not doing their job. \n\nWe also have abnormal lipid metabolism . We store fat in our muscle . It is called fat storage myopathy and we are weaker. There is  a supplement, L-Carnitine, that will help with that, but it comes with the implications of TMAO which increases heart risk . Or an alternative is to eat less fat, greasy food, fried food. \n\nIf the metabolism of certain nutrients downstream is wrong, controlling the intake of those nutrients  upstream, how many you put in your mouth, can help. \n\nWe also - are not we blessed  - have higher oxidation than normal. Again anti-oxidants in fruit and veg will help put levels in balance. \n\nWhen you look at the cell, there are several angles and so many players, and this mean, we can mitigate the lack of circulation neurofibromin in several other ways. I cannot fix the gene, but I can go and act where the gene is supposed to regulate something. \n\nAnd one last thing. A lack of nf1 is not compatible with life. We do not want to **remove** the NF1 gene when doing gene editing. \n\nNormal population, Nf1 +/+ two copies. Us Nf1 +/- one good one bad. When we are hit (the famous second hit) with a new mutation and a specific cell turns nf1 -/- that is when shit happens. So again, one more reason to look at diet, because the body is really good at removing errors. Thousands of mutations occur every single day and nothing happens. But then , we become older, we have more mutations, and our repair mechanism that include sirituins  become less efficient , so we can eat food that benefit the sirtuins or boost the excision repair mechanisms and just increase the nutrient that protect our chromosome . A folate deficiency will break a chromosome . Green leafy vegetables every day will prevent a folate deficiency ; that is an example of diet as a manipulative tool . If that leafy green happens to be Kale, bonus point as its indole-3-carbinol (I3C) content will increase tumour suppressor gene activities, even these are under-performing . Kale will also boost the osteotrophic (bone formation and strengthening) activity of bone cells. and so much more. \n\nI have deviated enough. I would better stop! The answer to your question is in the cell, not in the gene! I was diagnosed with kyphosis a long time ago but it does not affect my life at all. I am pretty lucky to have a mild case of NF. Wow so much info here! Especially the diet stuff. Would love it if doctors talked about that before trying to shove selumetinib down your throat even when you have been stable. I have also read that curcumin along with Mediterranean diet has been shown to help. Do you have any insight on that?\n\nETA: do you have any sources I can read? Selumetinib has been life changing and life saving for many kids. \n\nIn my books, in my view about Nf1, plexiform should be removed when they are tiny in young children, even when they are not causing problem  because when they grow they can become life altering and there is also the life-time risk of a plexi becoming an MPNST and this is devastating .  This preventative approach is not the norm and not always doable, some people have dozens of plexiform neurofibromas, so this would not be an option. \n\nNow links \n\n( \n\n(\n\n( \n\nthen of course, look at the pathways and protein which cause problem so RAS, MEK, mTOR, and which polyphenol can act on those, or induce autophagy. \n\nI changed my diet in March 2017 to an anticancer diet and noticed a reduction of my neurofibromas. If you look at the details of the Italian trial diet , there were two components, foods you had tot eat, and food you had to avoid. It was not just swallow curcumin . \n\nI am on Inspire, and talked so much about diet, with so many links and details you might want to check me there . Same username, Booksandcoffee. Research my old discussions and I write a lot (too much) about a nutritional management of Nf1 , in addition to whichever drug there is. It is not about declining treatment or imaging. \n\nFor example, we talk about ketotifen ( another preventative drug most doctors will not mention. Thank you for these sources and information. Diet is something that has been severely overlooked which is disappointing considering we visit some of the most prominent doctors.\n\nPs. I do not deny that the drug has helped children. I just do not believe it is necessary for a stable adult right now in our particular case. I get your stance on Selumetinib. I share it. I am hyper critical of all the hype it is getting. Yes at last, after years of crying and begging, we have a drug approved for us. There are however many problems that come with it. \n\nThe first is that it is a drug for life because when you stop take it, tumours will grow back and some more, reaching the point the  projection of growth had predicted. Second, toxicity for the heart and side effects that are for some too severe and they quit. Third , shall we talk about the price tag. 12.500 per month or 150.000 per year. \n\nDespite all the above, this is not why I am unhappy. Lots of drugs are expensive and have side effects. The reason I do not share the hype about MEK inhibitors (MEKi) is that is has funnelled all the research power in the same pool. Now everyone and their dog is testing one MEKi or the other. Present a research grant for a MEKi , it will be approved, so it is the easy path. Research in NF1 is redundant and repetitive . We have a myriad of issues and all the research is focused on a few of them  **.** ( \n\nI believe the hype has slowed down research in NF1 because it does not really bring anything new. \n\nWe have known since 2001 that MEKi work. Great, we have 1 option . Now let us move to something else for those who do not respond to MEKi . \n\nI insist, I believe the drug is right for many, and it has transformed the life of many children . There are mothers out there that go to sleep with a smile and not tears because of Koselugo . It is also bringing hope for some of us with a very high number of neurofibromas. We just need to move on and not stagnate in the MEKi pool . \n\nIt does not have to be diet. I get it. Diet is tough. Diet is hard . The diet is very strict and it is extremely complicated to design a study and get funding. Completely unrelated to NF1, but I love Prof Christopher Gardner  and if you have two hours to waste (while peeling carrots, chopping kale  or roasting a pumpkin for example) , in his webinar on the science of nutrition, he explains the hurdles in the design and interpretation of clinical trials for diet/food ( \n\nTake the Italian MEdDiet and curcumin study. For six months , the participants in the intervention group had to stick to severe rules. No birthday cake, no fried food , no this , no that, but you have to eat this many legumes, this many veggies. Compliance in clinical trial is hard, and on a dietary one , crazy hard. \n\nPeople want simple. They do not want to make an effort. Give me a pill but let me have my ice-cream. The new study that will start at the university of Minnesota is very aware of the difficulties  of enforcing a diet and so they are doing a \"light\" version of the Italian trial, with only Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)  and curcumin , but no change in diet. They have purchased  bottles of a high polyphenol content EVOO, higher that you average supermarket one, even fancy  brands, and they will combine it to participants with curcumin, again a  stronger version called longvida curcumin. I will be very curious to see the results. I just hope that if unsuccessful, they will not be used to prove the diet does not work, given they have technically, not done the diet, but just the supplement part , forgetting maybe that supplement means \"a thing added to something else in order to complete or enhance it. \" . \n\nI know that diet is not for everyone and it is necessary to have optionS (plural) for them. So I hope the Minnesota trial will bring one more option.  \n\nPolyphenols are a fascinating topic. A very kind user in Scholar has unlooked this paper ( that goes a bit deeper into the ones cited in the papers I linked above . You can follow the link they posted here (  . \n\nI believe targeted polyphenols have potential for Nf1 . \n\nIf you want to have to dig deeper, this database  ( gives you the content of polyphenols in food. You can download it in excel for easier use. The content is per 100g, so of course, it needs to be adapted to serving size. I can easily eat 100 gr of Adzuki beans, but 100gr of cloves? no way. Just for the fun, measure your daily polyphenol intake and see if there is room for improvement.", "(RANT) I am so sick and tired of this My life has been terrible because of NF1. I have literally lost every chance I ever had because whenever I feel even a slight sense of security and happiness a stupid tumor sneaks up on me and I need surgery and then face a long and painful recovery. I have had so many operations on my spine and soon I will not be insured and I have no chance at getting a good job at this rate. I would say I am a total failure but I never even had a chance to try at life, I am just going to be miserable and in pain forever, I HATE THIS SO MUCH!!! I no longer look forward to anything, everyday is just me trying to get through pain and do physical therapy so I can get functionality back knowing fully well that just around the corner I will lose it all again because this disorder SUCKS.\n\n\nWhy did God make me this way?

There is honestly way too much pain in the world for me to believe a God chooses various paths for people. Like why do we have NF? Why are some people born into poverty and experience racism?  Why are some women born in countries like Afghanistan where they do not even get to go to school and are not allowed to go out of the house without a male relative? Cannot work. I am in pain and often have spasms where I scream. I do not think people want to hear that and it is hard to even just sit and be at a computer for a while. \n\n\n\nTalk to your county and get connected with a case worker who can help you with applications and getting resources.

NF1/Schwannomatosis Hi everyone. Today at an appointment with a brain and spine specialist the doctor handed me a printout on NF1 and said he thinks I have it and to think about if my symptoms match the description. After I got home and had a chance to do more reading and research, it started to seem like maybe it does not line up?\n\nOne website said 95% of the time it is diagnosed before age 10. I am nearly 30 and have not had any symptoms until about two years ago.\n\nI noticed a small lump at the base of my spine about two years ago. MRIs showed three small lesions. I have had ringing in my ears for a month now, but I assumed it was from my teething baby loudly voicing his displeasure in my ears daily. I do have some scoliosis that is been around for years and is minor. The doctor I saw today also thinks a lump in my thigh (noticed ~3 years ago and was told it is a lipoma) is also a likely neuroma.\n\nNow I feel like I am lost because I do not know how much the doctor I am seeing knows about neurofibromatosis. When I read about it, I feel like schwannomatosis sounds more like what I am experiencing, but I know that is way more uncommon. I have freckles and one small birthmark but not what I would call cafe au lait spots - I do not think any of them are more than 1.5cm. No learning disabilities, no optic gliomas, or anything else that I know of. I am pretty short (5'1), but so is everyone in my immediate family.\n\nI have surgery in December to remove the mass in my psoas muscle and I should get confirmation of what exactly it is then. I know I am lucky because I have had only mild pain. But I just had my first baby. I am sick with worry about what might happen with my ten month old if I have passed on something to him. I know it manifests differently in everybody and I am terrified for him.\n\nIf anyone has any insight I would appreciate it so deeply. I feel like I am googling myself into a really scary place. Was anyone else here diagnosed this late in life? Anyone with schwannomatosis here?\n\nThanks in advance. You guys have an awesome community here. Wishing you all peace I recommend seeing a geneticist since NF can be traced that way. A genetic test may be in order. A lot of people still have mild symptoms and get diagnosed later in life, some do not find out until their kid is diagnosed. If you do have it, your kiddo should probably see a specialist (if you have an NF ones in your area I *highly* reccomend starting there), or a geneticist if not. \n\nDo not be beating yourself up! NF can be hard and challenging, but the community of NFer's are some of the most amazing people I have ever met. I know they will rally around you and your kid if that ends up being the case. I was not diagnosed until my 30s either, after a genetic test. I initially was seeing a dr who knew nothing about NF and basically told me to take OTC pain meds and stop complaining. I switched to an NF specialist and now get MUCH better care, so definitely recommend that if it is an option for you. NF2 sometimes presents with peripheral nerve tumors. \nThere is also MNF1:\n Thank you. That really helps to have a place to start This is so encouraging to hear. I am in Ohio, so it looks like I am fortunate to have several options nearby. Thanks :) Yikes. Glad you were able to make the switch. Sorry for asking a personal question and feel free to not answer \u2014 did you also lack the CAL spots and freckling? Thanks for the link. Getting my first cranial MRI this evening and I have my fingers crossed that they will not find vestibular schwannomas Ask away! I have CALs that I had always assumed were just weird bigger freckles or birthmarks, and also have the freckling patterns. I am the first one in my family with NF so knew nothing about it until I was diagnosed.  My genetic testing and other evals were triggered based on a few lumps I found and my primary care dr could not figure out either - they ended up being plexiform neurofibromas.  I did not have learning disabilities, optic gliomas, or cutaneous neurofibromas either. \n\nFeel free to PM if you have more questions from a late diagnosis perspective! I was super overwhelmed to start and am still learning too. Good luck. &gt;One website said 95% of the time it is diagnosed before age 10. I am nearly 30 and have not had any symptoms until about two years ago.\n\nI had no knowledge of my NF1 diagnosis until July when I suddenly started experiencing pain. Turns out I have a plexiform neurofibroma growing on my spine that is been there for most of my life unnoticed growing in-between my colon and spine.  I am 29. Do not let this rule out NF1. It does happen. Many of my Family members have CALS. But none of us had a fibroma. My siblings and I were all closely tracked at a young age, But NF was dismissed as we had no other issues and genetic testing was not as available as it is now.\n\nYou might consider getting genetic testing. I got mine done through Ambry. It was pretty cheap all things considered. (~$100 with insurance and $200 without). This can give you a pretty definitive answer. If this test comes back negative, it could mean these tumors are something else, or they could still be fibromas. It is also possible to have segmented or mosaic NF. Which means during your development, you had a spontaneous mutation that impacted part of your body. (this is what happened with me). This can mean a lot of different things and complicates your case. But might push you to some more specialized doctors. Right now I am seeing Dr. Slopis at MD Anderson in Houston Texas. My experience with the Doctor has been very good. Their office can be hard to get in contact with if you have questions though. \n\nBut even if you have NF1 that does not automatically mean you gave it to your child. AND even if you did, that is not the end of the world. It is something to be aware of and to track and be on top of. And often, the sooner you catch these issues the faster they can be addressed.", "Methods to slow Fibroma growths? I know it is a long shot and I know there is no cure. But does anyone managed to slow down the rate of neurofibroma growths, no matter how miniscule the effects are? Essential oils, diet, sleep patterns, stress reduction, exercise? Anything at all. Aspirin twice a day thins out the blood and makes it harder for the bumps to grow and as much sleep as you can and vitamin C.... This is what IV found out Ah... You take aspirins? Sounds dangerous in terms of bleeding and rupture though. I think too much aspirin is REALLY bad for the body. Unfortunately there is nothing you can take on your own that can slow the growth. There are a number of drug trials going on that are showing 20-40% in tumor shrinkage. If you are looking for data backed clinical results, then waiting for MEK inhibitors is your only option.\n\nThere was a tiny study involving a Mediterranean diet and curcumin supplement that showed promise, but the sample size was so small that I would not put much stock in it. Turmeric is supposed to slow down the tumor growth.  At least it will not hurt you if you do not take too much. Consumption, or applying it externally? The \"active ingredient\" in turmeric is curcumin, which you can buy supplements for. There was a tiny study involving curcumin supplementation plus a very strict diet that showed shrinkage in a cohort of 3 people.  The groups that were diet only and supplement only showed no improvement.\n\n\n Consumption.  There are several brands, including generic, of capsules filled with ground turmeric. They believe things like pregnancy, and menopause make them grow quicker It is very hard to get into the MEK studies too Have you or someone you know tried? What was the process like? Ive tried to get into over 6 of them. You basically fill out a form, then They interview, they see your records and your MRIs, and ask your doctor.\n\nI was denied for various reason from age, my gender, my birth control, my cancer history, too many tumors, etc. That is rough. Thanks for sharing your experience.  From what I have read it looks like selumetinib should be approved for plexiforms by end of summer.", "Struggle in school Does anybody else experience setbacks in education possibly due to learning disabilities from NF1? I am about to be 5th year senior in university, and really struggle with exams. I can study topics and homework for HOURS and just not retain information. I even experience extreme test anxiety (on top of my high levels of social anxiety) when it comes to test time. I will thi k I knew the information but freeze up when I am taking the test. In all my 22 years of life I do not remember getting an A on a test. I feel as if I am not adequate enough.\n\nDoes anyone else have similar situations? My NF has shown little physical evidence but I feel alot is expressed in cognitive abilities. Should I go get an MRI on my brain possibly? My younger sister is unfortunate enough to be among one's with NF1 that has expressed with several large brain tumors and some on her optic nerve leading to her vision impairment. Last time I had an MRI was at age 11 when she was diagnosed in 2007 (she was 4) .\n\nWhat are your thoughts, I would like to hear. For one, you are adequate. \nI have learned differently my whole life. Even now in my 40s certain things take more time than average. \nI did ok in school. If I tried harder I would have done better most likely but at the time there were not teachers interested in anything but cookie cutter education. \nI wish I had more of a focus and direction and I am sure it would have changed my course. \nLearning disability is a pretty common thread with NF but as you can see with your sister no NF person has the same issues I as diagnosed with ADD in 8th grade and received disability accommodations in 8th grade through college. In college I took all tests in a private room with extra time, and all written tests I took on a computer. You do not have a learning disability caused by NF. You are just not good at taking tests. It happens. \n\nHow are you studying? Are you just reading the same info over and over again? Are you rewriting the important parts? You might have to change that in order to learn how to retain information. I was diagnosed with ADD at a young age and it was explained to be  linked with NF so I feel it is sort of due to NF. I was explaining part of my issue was test taking and information retaining.\nI have taking a semester class to teach me better skills and follow those. Been to seminars and what not to do better. I follow good note taking strategies and what not. So yeah I know how to student. One hell of an assumption you are making there.\n\nMany studies have shown that nf1 is linked with learning difficulties. I have NF as well as a learning disability. I did quite well in school. During college, I have accommodations such as extra time on tests and took them in another location. I was pretty good at memorizing and retaining information. Hello!\n\nI totally understand where you are coming from. I was told that the cognitive challenges are most likely due to my NF1. A majority of the symptoms  I experience are mostly cognitive and psychological issues.\n\nSo, short and sweet there is most likely nothing wrong with you, you just have not discovered the best way to learn. This is a long and difficult path for everyone, but can especially hard for individuals with learning disabilities, even more, difficult when the reason you have a disability is steemed from a disorder nobody knows about.\n\nReally pay attention to when you feel you are absorbing the most information possible while in lecture, studying or doing assignments. Is it when you make flash cards or when you record the lectures and listen back to them at a later date? \n\nI think the most important thing you can do for yourself is becoming your own best advocate. I am not sure what the support services are where you are going to school, but really advocate to your professors and the disability services office what you are struggling with. I know it is annoying and you have probably heard this a million times but the people working on your campus are truly there to help. However, you need to express that you are struggling for the help to be offered. When having your conversations explain what you are struggling with and why it is the case, you do not need to give a full run through if you are not comfortable, remember they are not a doctor so they do not legally need to know. Something I was offered is a Live Scribe pen, give it a google and see if it would help.\n\nA conversation with your neurologist/doctor about your frustrations would not be a bad idea either. They should know how you are feeling so they can help! They may suggest an MRI (which is not always a bad idea to make sure no new growths have appeared), but really they should be able to point you in a better direction on who you need to talk to in order to get the support you need in school. They could suggest some mental health services as well for the social anxiety, ADD, etc or working with them alone could be sufficient. A note from a medical professional can open a number of doors because then legally something has to be done by the school since you have a legitimate neurological condition. \n\nSorry if you were not looking for advice and I just wasted your time! I was in your shoes recently, and until I learned to really focus on myself, what I needed and the importance of self-advocacy in this situation, I was not able to succeed.  Good on you for realizing you have a problem, and want to make a change. I am in your corner and there are definitely A's in your future...Good luck! I have mild NF1. My IQ is in the Top 1% and I have a graduate degree in engineering. Obviously I always did well in school. This disease is such a crap shoot that it is impossible to say if it is the NF or not. Neurofibromatosis has effected me more physically, but I was diagnosed with dyslexia when I was nine years old, I was diagnosed with neurofibromatosis until I was 15. School was not easy for me, but I went to Catholic school, which did not offer a special ed, so I had to learn to go with the flow. I just had to work a little hard. I would get A, B, and C. I did get a D once. Just do the best you can. daddy NF ova here", "Can mosaic nf1 be passed down? The various info I have read on this is not clear. \n\nI know it is almost never inherited when it occurs in this form, but can a person who has it pass down nf in general? I am pretty sure mosaic nf is somatic, not germ-line (for reference, germ-line is a mutation on a reproductive cell and is passed down. Somatic is a mutation on a single or few cells in the body, such as a patch of skin cells, or in your case, mosaic nf).\n\nWith that in mind, I do not think it can be passed down. But you should ask a doctor, I am just a nerdy high school kid who is obsessed with the biology behind nf. So mosaic is never inherited because it is a post zygotic mutation , meaning the mutation on the nf1 gene occurred not in the first cell but shortly after. \n\nOne can pass the mutated nf1 gene even if at a lower rate than non-mosaic nf1 but when passed, it will be the general form of NF1 and not the mosaic one. The rate is about 1 in 20 chances vs 1 in 2 for normal Nf1. \n\nSome more detailed info here\n\n( What if the mosaicism occurs in the testes, for example? Not trying to be snarky, but would not that raise the chances to 50%? I know this is a bit old, but that is a different kind of mosaicism. In that case, the germ cells have the mutation, but the somatic cells do not. This is much more rare than somatic mosaicism.\n\n That is a wild case study", "joint pain? little bit about me.27M (nf has been a bitch to me lol) \n\nright off the bat at 4 days old, my left leg broke thanks to a tumor in the bone.\n\nat 2 years old bone transplant, at 6 years amputation, at 9 revision amputation..25 more surgeries lol.\n\nanywhooooo, in my youth I never really experienced nerve pain, but within the last 6 years I have been experiencing random electric stabbing pains here and there.

But I seem to run out quicker than the refill comes, so that is kind of lame. I am sorry to hear about what you are going through. Stay positive friend I have been having severe pain since May 2018. Went to drs and found out it is a mix of fibromyalgia and NF, so fun there. I have tried the big 3 pain drugs, Gabapentin, pregabalin, and duolexetine but nadda! Gabapentin was the devil\u2019s drug for me. Another dr just put me on Celebrex so we will see how that one goes. I take two different pain medication prescribed by my doctor that help with the joint pain. If I did not take it I would be able to function throughout the day. \n\nIn both 2014 and 2018, I was having severe nerve pain that was shooting up and down my right leg(2014) and in my right arm(2018). In both years it was like a burning pain that would last for several minutes and come and go throughout the day, it would even wake me up in the middle of the night. This was caused by cancerous tumors, once the cancerous part of the tumors was removed the pain was gone.\n\nIf you have any questions like me know. I have sever pain like this on my head and neck since I have been 2-3yrs old. It is NF related and caused from the tumors and past surgeries as a child. I take Gabapentin, and Nortriptyline. While it does help, it does not get rid of the pain altogether. So it is always present but I can manage the level of pain I am in. (Which is usually 5 on the pain scale)", "Hi! This is little bit stupid.. M(20) here. (Sorry for my bad english!)\nI have NF1 and im so stressed about it. \nWhen I was 4 I got an epileptic seizure, since then I have never had a seizure. I received epileptic medication at the time but now i dont take it because doctor said that i can try to life without  it if i wanted. The last time I went to a  MRI was 2016 and nothing abnormal was detected. There is nothing wrong with my eyesight. All I have are small lumps and caf\u00e9-Au-Lait spots  here and there and  I do not even feel pain in the lumps  anywhere\nSo everything  seems to be okay but still I am so stessed. I feel anxious\noften.. i overthink almost everything. I feel so stupid  writing this. For many of you, things are way worse.. i read so many post here that made me little bit sad. Some of you cant life normal life, some of you feel pain every day. And im worried about nothing?  could I have similar symptoms later in life? Could i have tumor that i dont even now about?  I dont know what to do about this.\nI wanted to write this so i could calm down and it worked a little. \nBut i really hope thinks get better with you guys. With having Neurofibromatosis it is good to keep up with your doctor appointments and have regular MRI scans. You should discuss this with your doctor on how often you should have them and anytime you notices in changes with yourself that you believe to be related to your Neurofibromatosis you should inform your doctor right away\n\nThe thing about Neurofibromatosis it effects everyone differently. Unfortunately there really is no way of knowing if your conditions would progress to be worse later in life. It is okay to worry. Worrying about something like Neurofibromatosis is perfectly normal, especially since there is no certainty of the outcome. When you find yourself worrying too much, try to step back a bit from reading any NF stories or forums. People post their experiences with NF, and hardly anyone posts stories about how they have it more mildly. Try to remember there is a lot of research coming out about NF, especially within the last 5-8 years. There is hope. If you can, try to have a \"when it happens I will worry\" approach to things, because the things you read about, or pictures you see, may never happen to you. *If you worry about it, you suffer twice.* I think it is completely normal to feel how you feel, and I know that I can feel that way too, but I try to remember all the things that I wrote out above, and that helps me come back to the present moment. I hope it can for you too. Wow, we have similar history. I had febrile seizures as a child and got one at kindergarten at about age 4. I was sent to the hospital and there, they discovered caf\u00e9 au lait spots and I was later diagnosed with NF1. \n\nMine is rather mild too, but I do have problems with my vision and underwent cytostatic theraphy at about age 7. Last year I also had optic nerve decompression surgery. My last visit to the ophthamologist showed slight improvements in my field of vision on both eyes. Not sure if due to the surgery, but probably it is. Yes, regular check-ups are very  important as changes can occure \"out of the blue\". In 2018, I had not  had any check-up for about two years and I thought things were under  control. Then I went to the optometrist to get new glasses and they  noticed a rapid decline in my vision so they wrote to my hospital and I  was called in to the ophthamologist who in turn sent me to MRI. Turned  out I needed surgery.\u00a0  \nApparently, my  neurologist had past away suddenly and I kind of \"fell out of the  system\" and since no one likes to go to the doctor, I did not really  care to contact them myself despite knowing I need annual check-ups and  it had been more than a year since last.\u00a0 Bro, never feel bad about how you feel, never compare the issues you suffer with to the ones others suffer with, yes  some are different conditions what I deal with is different than what you do, I do not have anxiety and honestly would not handle it well, just because you do not have severe pain does not mean you do not suffer in other ways This is not stupid at all. My 11 year old son just got diagnosed and although he only has the cafe au lait spots, it is tremendously worrisome. Yes he could have had it worse and others do, but the uncertainty for his future can be very overwhelming. My husband and I are trying to practice and encouraging our son to practice not worrying until we need to while still staying informed and attempting to be prepared for whatever may come. Reaching out to others when you feel the anxiety is exactly what you should do so I applaud you for sharing your feelings. Your post certainly touched my heart and there is a comfort in knowing others feel like me. So thank you for sharing. Thanks dude I have just been diagnosed from a small lump in my arm, I am 30 male and work construction and I am so scared and worried for my future. I am sorry you are going through that, especially during this time! Did they tell you which type of NF, or was it a lone neurofibroma (which can happen). Sometimes writing out your story is not only therapeutic to you, but also helps out others on this subreddit. If you ever want to talk you can always DM me. At the moment just a lone neurofibroma, going for genetic tests and mri scans. I am just worried about my future I guess. I have read alot of people on here who have had it since birth or have really severe cases. Which makes me feel blessed but also worried.\n\nThanks for your reply dude I think you are so lucky that your doctors are sending you in for genetic tests and scans! There are many of us who struggle to even get that referral! It will help to ease your mind too once you get your results. I think one of the worst things about going through a health scare is the unknown, because then you have no plan. It is hard to go with the flow in this situation, especially when the world right now is uncertain about everything, but really try not to worry too much, or give yourself a hard time for worrying in the first place. Whatever you are feeling is natural for what you are experiencing. \n\nThere are a lot of people who do not have Neurofibromatosis that have lone neurofibromas. NF is genetic, and there are common clinical markers that show up before you hit the age you are. Those clinical features are so common with NF, that they can be used to diagnose the condition without a genetic test (and the test is more to confirm diagnosis). If you do not have those other clinical markers, it is likely that you do not have it, and if even if you did, your case would be so mild that you might end up worrying about things that never come to fruition. Yes, you may have read that the progression with NF is unpredictable, but if you have stayed so mild up until this point, it is more likely that you will continue on that path. Whatever the outcome, remember that you made it this far. Hey I read this at the exact right time. I have been freaking out and just told my gf about how I am feeling regarding my lump. \n\nThen I read your reply and made me feel alot better about everything. You are a legend, thanks for this well written and thought out response..\n\nYou pretty much listed all of the emotions I have been going through. I have been seeking professional help to calm me down to avail. You have given me hope..\n\nThanks order66 survivor Glad I can help!

I am getting a flushing feeling in and around  tumor I have on my neck (12.7 cm in diameter and about 7.62 cm deep) does I am also pretty sure it is growing.

Definitely dont brush it off.. better be safe than sorry.. Ctf.org I think has a list of nf friendly doctors. Make sure you are seeing a neurologist or oncologist familiar with nf. I agree it is time for a doctor visit. Best to contact your doctor with anything that is our of ordinary for you. Anytime I have a new  issue I inform my nf doctor.

No, not every ailment you have is because of NF. Does not mean you do not have NF. I did used to get migraines all the time and do not now that I am older. Ohh wow I never thought about that!!

More than likely just easier to see, but any concerns you have you should share with your Neurofibromatosis specialist, Not during my cycle but when I work out hard or get hot... Fibromas often sprout during puberty, so it could be more related to hormones than weight? that is a good point, I got my first ones when puberty really kicked into high gear (a bit of a late bloomer) and I was on birth control. yes this is true, it is directly connotative to hormones. so this is why you may be noticing them and also during pregnancy\u2019s or any meds that can affect your hormone levels!", "Bleeding tumors on back?

I had one in my mouth that I have bitten half off, needed stitches to get the bleeding to stop that one. Several on my back that I have scratched open.  They do not bleed spontaneously, it is always because of some sort of trauma caused by me. \n\n\n\n Of course, I recommend seeing an NF specialist or dermatologist, but I understand the no insurance/cost issue.  In the mean time, I would try to keep the bleeders clean with rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide and maybe put a little Vaseline/petroleum jelly on it to prevent getting blood on your shirts and sheets, or to keep it from crusting to fabrics.

Plus some more questions. Hey so I have been with my girlfriend for 7 years.  I am almost done with an IT program at our local community college and she is just changed hers to social work.  With me finishing we will be able to get our own place and starting to plan for a family ~7 years down the road.  We have both been worried about pregnancy and NF.  She is more worried about passing the gene and I am more scared about her own health.  We have read that the gene can be removed from a child before they are born, it would cost a lot but we would not mind and would plan around that.  I am more worried about the flood of hormones during pregnancy.  Any personal experience would help.  My gf is making appointments to her OB/GYN and neuro soon to talk about this but we want to know first hand experiences or discussion before they come up.\n  \nThe next question is about working.  My mom and grandma both have MS so I have seen the toll work can do to people with neurological conditions.  My girlfriend currently works 17 hours a week at an aftercare for K-8.   She can do this right now but some days she is worn down.  She worked worked summer camps the last few years during vacation and comes home tired and in pain for the last 2 years.  Me and my mom are also worried about her immune system around young kids who are not the cleanest and do not know how to sneeze in their elbows.  Would a part time office job be ok in the long run?  My aunt is a social worker who said she could help my gf find an assistant job, but my gf also is offered a preschool 25-30 hour a week job once she finishes her degree.\n  \nAny input is awesome. Thanks in advance Meant to say NF and Pregnancy. Cannot repost with correct title Let me preface this by saying I do not exactly have an answer to your question, but I am in the same boat with my partner at the moment. We live in a country where healthcare is affordable and I qualify for the type of pre-genetic that you mentioned. Passing on the gene has thus become less of a worry.\n\nWe had a meeting with a genetic counselor and a neurologist a few months ago (their area of expertise is NF1), and they did mention that we basically have four options.\n\n1) pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) - this requires significant pre-hormonal treatment, I would have to inject myself with hormones to get the cells fertile and moving basically, I am sure there is a more eloquent way of putting it. They do not know how my (or anyone else\u2019s) body will react to it. It could aggravate the NF1 and tumor growth, it could be insignificant. \n\n2) use a donor-cell. Still would require hormonal treatment.\n\n3) surrogacy \n\n4) become pregnant naturally, get a pre-genetic test done at week 8. If the cells are healthy, we are good to go. If not, then we have the option to abort (while emotionally the worst option of the bunch, physically it is apparently the least invasive)\n\nApart from the above, where some of the options can also influence tumor-growth, the thing that frightens me the most are the hormonal changes during the pregnancy. Especially because you do not know what is going to happen. If it would be clear  (i.e. you will get x-amount increase), it would be an easier choice to make. But what if the tumor-growth is so expansive that it grows in certain places that will limit the way I can interact with my child? What if it puts me in a wheelchair? I do not know. It seems like such a gamble.\n\nI am not sure if this helps you at all. Maybe there is someone here who is gone through a pregnancy and can better attest to the changes. So my immune system is completely awful, and its  differnt for everyone but I was in the same boat as you both. I went to school for social work and did for a little work in a day care back while in school. My man is finishing up school for IT. I had to stop completely because I could not handle it. I cannot work at all because my nf, however if shes still able to work I would say do it. Maybe not with super young children so she doesnt get too run down.\n\nAs for the kids we also decided to go the route of finding the nf gene and removing it. However because of the toll nf would have on my body we are hoping to do a surrogate. The hormones for the shots for the ivf and egg removal we were told by my nf dr that it is less on the body than an actual pregnancy. \n\nI know it is all stressful but I feel your doing all the right things. Neurofibromatosis can effect everyone differently, some are only effected a little, while others are effected a lot by it. I have tumors all through out my body and have daily pain. I can only stand and sit for so long until I need to get up move around and sit down and rest my legs. I am only able to drive short distances and have limits to how much I am able to lift. I also work at an after school care at my old elementary school. I typically work three times a week for three hours. \n\nIt is unfortunately true that woman with Neurofibromatosis during pregnancy can have their condition get worse, it does not happen with everyone. I have NF1. Did not affect my pregnancy but I did pass the gene to my son unfortunately. I cannot speak to the 2nd question, because only I, the male, have NF2. My wife does not.\n\nA lot of the advice below is really good. The one thing I will add is that insurance coverage will depend not only on your particular insurance, but also the state you live in. I can only personally attest to Illinois. I have pretty good insurance, and the state's policies allow almost all of it to be covered.\n\nHonestly, I had no idea about this before, and just got lucky. But since it can be so expensive in other states, it is probably worth it to research this, so you can possibly move to a state with good coverage. I am in the same boat. My three pregnancies were normal with no complications. My son also has NF. My two daughters do not. I have NF1, relatively mild symptoms. I have always worked full time in child care. I have a fantastic immune system. I have only been sick once in the last 1.5 years. A short lived (12 hr) stomach bug while I was pregnant and thus my immune system was down a bit. I have not even had a cold in close to 2 years. \n\nAs for passing on the NF gene, it is a 50:50 chance. My husband and I also do not want to pass it on so we had terminated that pregnancy at 15 weeks after testing doing a genetic test on the fetus called a CVS and it had NF. If you want to be sure to avoid it, you have to do IVF, which we are about to start. They collect her eggs and fertilize them with your sperm in the lab. After letting them grow for 5 days they take a few cells out of each embryo, and then freeze them. They test each embryo for the gene and then only put back the ones without NF (one at a time). We will also be paying for them to check for chromosomal abnormalities too. \n\nMy doctors do not think pregnancy will make my NF much worse. During my last pregnancy I had a couple small fibromas grow a very small amount but that was it. I was pregnant for 15 weeks (and had a 7 week miscarriage just prior to that) so I think that gives me a pretty good sense of what to expect for me in a full term pregnancy. But everyone is NF is different and NF is unpredictable so it is hard to say. She should definitely speak with an NF specialist prior to getting pregnant. You are a bit misinformed about a few facts. \n\nTo test before pregnancy requires IVF (in-vitro fertilization).\n\nWhen getting pregnant naturally, you cannot test as early as 8 weeks. You need to be a MINIMUM of 10 weeks, and then it takes a couple weeks to get results. \n\nNaturally is not really the least invasive. You still have to be pregnant for 12-15+ weeks. Then you have to have a D&amp;E, which is safe, but still comes with risk. And too many of them can compromise a woman\u2019s ability to carry future pregnancies. Getting pregnant naturally is certainly the least expensive way to go if you do not have health insurance that will cover IVF. NF2 Advice below.....\n\n\"Flood of Hormones\" is exactly right and not only during childbirth but for years afterward. You are 100% to be worried. My advice.....\n\n1. Do not believe any doctors or counselors - simply because they will only talk about proven and written science. They will NOT be able to tell you about something which has not been studied among a large population.\n2. IMHO, and this is a very informed opinion, your GF/Wife will effectively be taking a number of years off her life and health. That may sound like fear-mongering, but it is not. Childbirth is a serious risk in so many ways - even for healthy women. \n\nNo one can make the decision for you and it is good that you have already considered some of the situation. But the reality is much different and much harder than the thinking...or planning. Without going into detail we had a family member who did not ask for my advice (given above) and I was kept from offering it by other family members and pressures. The results were devastating. We will be dealing with them until the end. \n\nI can only say that if I were your GF I would desire to live as long and as best I can and not make that sacrifice. The price is too high and no one \"asks\" to be born, especially with a parent that is unlikely to see them through. \n\nI know that is a lot of information but take it for what it is worth. I am telling you what others will not....and apologies in advance if it is more then you want to hear. This is the best advice I have seen for this topic. That is the reason why I do not want to have children. I am the first person in my family to have the gene (that we know of) and definitely do not want to pass it on to my children. The extra flood of hormones CAN make matters worse and cause more fibromas and even tumours to grow. On top of my NF I also have fibromyalgia so I get the constant tiredness and pain. I do not think I would be able to handle the kid situation because of that, I am in too much pain and fatigued....which is another thing that you do have to consider especially with a young child. \n\nIf I wanted kids, I would have either had somebody else carry my child so that I did not have to worry about the issues with having it....or I would have adopted and therefore not had to have the stress of babyhood. I know it is not the same as having your own flesh and blood, but still an alternative. Did you find your spots or tumors increased? Did you realize you were pregnant early? Did you respond to the hormones fast? People usually do not believe me but I knew immediately knew before I knew for sure. It is impodsible to explain because it does not make real sense. But I felt something amazing happening within me. I tested 5 days after my missed period and it was positive.  Reponded fast ,  yes.", "Is this a tumor or hemorrhoid?

Because this is in the area of my body where I have my bums I want to know if any of you think this is a hemorrhoid or tumor.  I have had if for about 8 years and it is just not going away that is why I am curious. My primary doctor has been telling me, for years (or lack of, I do not really see the doctor that to often, unless I have a bad cold) that it is just a hemorrhoid. But it does not seem to be going away. Thoughts? \n\n* (\n\n* (", "Genetics Tomorrow I have a genetics appointment tomorrow to see my NF nurse it is the first time I am slightly scared of going (silly I know) I have  been to many of these but I have had lots of issues in the last few months and a lot I have bottled up over the year. And when they ask if there is anything else I normally say no but I feel this time I have to ask yes I have been hiding a few issues for years and have admitted it is time to try and get help. I have been writing notes for months. But have a 4 page document of everything which I really need to take about from new issues to some mental health issues I think I have or think I have and now know I need help. They are there to help you! Bring all your questions. Good luck!! \ud83d\ude0a Good for you for writing things down and take them with you. A lot of people ignore a lot of issues. \n\nGood luck! I will be sending some good juju your way! Well I have done it. But now need to make another appointment with my doctor as generics cannot help. Tried to get a doctors appointment and failed they need to know why and I cannot physically say it. Why do the reception need to know I found that talking to someone and talking about my NF with my therapist for my mama has helped me a lot!", "Parent with a question I hope it is OK that I am coming here to ask this, but I have scoured the internet and cannot find anything definitive, so please bear with me:\n\nWhen my daughter was 4 I took her to the dermatologist to take a look at a random mole in between her toes. That turned out to be fine, so the doctor recommended a look at her whole body to check all of her skin. When my daughter disrobed, the dermatologist noticed freckling in her groin area. I would like to add that this was 2 months after we lost our son in an accident. The dermatologist brings up neurofibromatosis and goes into all the complications it can cause. My daughter, who is already wigged out at the doctor's office after losing her brother, becomes very anxious about the diagnosis, as do I. \n\nMy daughter is now 6 years old. Still has the freckles and a total of only 1 cafe au lait spot. She is normal height, regular head size, at the top of her class academically and with all other normal physical/emotional attributes. She is also biracial (Indian and white).\n\nWas the doctor a little ahead of herself calling out NF with just the presence of groin freckles, or is it really a significant symptom? I know only time will tell ultimately, but I am just wondering how much I should even be concerned. If more cafe au lait spots show up that are the right size, I would certainly take her in. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read.", "There might be some help Saw pain management yesterday for first time.  I was prepared with my past MRI's.  The doctor was not surprised about my pain.  He is very concerned about the tumor C-6.  It is rather large and growing into my spinal column and putting pressure on my cord.  He was surprised I was not complaining more about the pain. He doubled my Gabapentin from 600mg 3X daily up to 1,200 3X daily, but over the course of 3 weeks slowly.  He knows my neurosurgeon and wants to talk with him cause he might be able to help with an injection into C-7/T-1, I am going to keep my fingers crossed \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e.", "Craniotomy I am going into the hospital for my first craniotomy to remove the cluster of schwannoma on my right side that is pushing against the pons. I was wondering if anyone can give me some insight and experience as to what i should expect? I am a bit frightened. Is this due to NF2 or NF1? NF2 First of all, it is going to be ok.  It is going to hurt like a bitch for a while, and you will be out of commission until you are done healing, but the doctors have studied for years to prepare them for this situation.  They know what they are doing, and they will do a good job.  You will go in, they will knock you out, and you will not even feel it until you come out.  And that is when it will all hit you at once.  Realize that your brain will be all sorts of scrambled because of the pain and drugs, so you will not be thinking straight.  You will probably think of many dumb things while you are awake waiting for the painkillers to kick in, but always always always be thinking that your brain is being stupid, and you are going to be ok.  Do not trust your brain, trust your family and doctors.  Fall back on your family/friends, give yourself time to heal, and sleep and eat as much as you can.\n\nYou will need help moving around and doing things.  Make sure to discuss with your family about accommodations you might need at home.  Organize your living area so that you and whoever is helping you can easily move around and maneuver.  The bathroom in particular is a dangerous room, so it would be a good idea to have someone there with you and help you until you get your bearings.  The kitchen is also a dangerous room, so make sure you have someone assist you with cooking and such.  Any bills, payments, chores, etc that you have are officially part of the family duties.  Make a list of everything you need handled and give them to whoever you trust so that they can handle them.  You will be too busy trying to heal to care about shit like that.\n\nIt might be frustrating, but you are going to have to rely on people for a while.  Try not to rush into things, or you might risk injury, and that is the last thing you need.  Take your time, and let your body be your guide.  If you are too tired or hurt too much, STOP.  That is your body telling you that you have had enough.  If you hurt yourself, your recovery will take that much longer, so try to avoid it.\n\nThey will probably prescribe some kind of opioids for the pain.  Follow your doctor's advice on how to take them, always with the mentality that they are highly addictive.  They are a godsend to helping manage the pain, but do not be careless and let them overwhelm your life.\n\nEat nutritiously, sleep as much as you can, and focus entirely on your health and recovery.  Anything else that comes up will be for future you to deal with.  Your priority is you now.\n\nEverything will be ok.  It might seem daunting and it is rational to be concerned, but stress is bad for healing.  Have faith that everything will be ok, it will make recovery easier.  Try to focus on your hobbies and responsibilities right now to keep yourself busy until your surgery day comes, and know that you will be ok :) NF2. I am 30 and was diagnosed at 26 with no complications until a few months ago when the hearing dropped to 10% word recognition in my right ear. Almost so suddenly i expect it was psychosomatic Specifically how will i recover as far as sleeping or lying down, i will have to sit up a lot or learn to on my belly? I am 26 and I was diagnosed at 17. I had one acoustic neuroma mostly removed already roughly one year ago so I have had the translabyrinthine skull base procedure before. I am about to have it done on the opposite side as the first surgery in a week. The procedure, for me, went very well. Part of the success probably had to do with me already being deaf (I lost my ability to hear when I was almost 24). The auditory nerve was beyond saving before the surgery so all focus was placed on avoiding damaging the facial nerve. After the surgery, I did experience temporary facial weakness, but I fully recovered. My ability to balance was already shot before surgery as well, but that did not change or worsen after surgery. I will have bilateral ABIs after my second surgery.\n\nWhen my hearing started to really decline, it was very rapid. It was still there and then all of a sudden it was not. Steroids could not bring it back.\n\nIf you have any specific questions for me I can do my best to answer them. I wish you well! They will ask you to be in a sort of half sit up position until you are done healing, so that anything in your sinuses flows out instead of choking you.  So get plenty of pillows and make you a nest.  Do not try to blow your nose please!  Your sinuses are kind of sort of near the injury site, and any pressure there could potentially damage the injury.\n\nYou will not want to sleep on your injury side.  It will hurt and could potentially lead to infection.  As far as sleeping on your belly, you probably want to avoid that, because it will hurt to move at first, and you are going to have to wake up fairly regularly for your pain meds.  The less you have to move around in the beginning, the better, so do the half sit up position until you can move around fairly painlessly. I just had a craniotomy two weeks ago because of a killer epidural hematoma. I have a 12 inch scar on my head and no hair from my first ever seizure at 22. This was a great write up. Thanks I am glad it helped you!  And take care!  You are already past the worst of it, but you are still recovering so do not overdo things!\n\nIts weird to say this, but I was not entirely myself until several months after surgery.  I thought I felt fine at the time, but I truly was not for quite a while.  The brain apparently needs some time to actually catch up! I am so confused. You said it best. I do not feel like myself and I have not for a while. I am a relatively active person and i feel almost myself physically but mentally I am a mess. \n\nToday I am actually three weeks out from my procedure now that I look at a calendar. So my memory is fucked. Last night I could not sleep and kept hearing a faint popping in my right head. I ended up scratching my head and opening my scar in a very small area. Doc wants to look at it on Monday. Just trying to keep it clean and open. \n\nI actually had my accident because I OD\u2019d so none of my pain meds had any affect on my recovery. Which continues to be miserable. The only thing that has relieved my nerve or skull pain is THC. One of the weird things about my surgery, now that I am past it for five years now, is that thinking back on my memories it feels like they are not mine.  I am cognizant that I experienced the surgery and the next few months of recovery, I have my massive scar to prove it, but it is as if that happened to someone else.  Like, my brain does not recall those memories as if they are something I experienced, but instead as if they were injected into my brain somehow.  Those memories are not really mine, even though my body experienced them.\n\nHonestly, I was so out of it that I did not know where my head was half the time. Yes! Anytime anyone tells me how I was acting or my family says what I was saying I tell them they are lying or that is not true. Honestly, I get fucking mad! I am so mad I cannot remember anything. Because before my accident I took prices in being mentally sharp at work and University. \n\nHow did you take care of your scar? It is been 3 weeks and I wash it everyday with dial gold soap gently in shower but it is become very dry. The area between the larger scarred circle is dry and dead skin. I have so much dead skin on my head! It bothers me. I want to have clean skin Haha yeah I went through the same.  I somehow decided to go back to school, transferred to another university, and filled  all the applications, and I hardly remember a single thing about the whole process.  And that is a really major thing you would expect to remember.\n\nAs far as taking care of my scar, I do not remember doing anything special about it.  I washed very gently with a mild shampoo by lightly rubbing with the tips of my fingers, then patted dry.  I avoided the sun as much as possible, and I let the skin breathe as much as I could.  No hair products, lotions, or creams at all.\n\nMaybe you are having an allergic reaction to the soap.  The skin at the scalp is particularly sensitive, and it does not have all the hair around it to kind of protect it, so maybe there is something in that soap that your scalp is not tolerating.  Try changing it to something else, like a mild shampoo. Okay thank you very much. Do you have any links or posts I should check out for more information? Google is shit and barely helps I can only read Johns Hopkins so much What kind of information?  Maybe I could find something.\n\nI did have a whole lot of information back in the day, but I have lost track of it through the years.", "Advise on cafe au lait spots. Are these them?

Thank you", "For almost a year now I have been have really bad back pain to where I cannot go to work or go to college I am talking and have talk to many doctors and finally have some other suggestions that I hope will work. I am tired of just laying around and doing nothing  Have you had a spinal MRI to rule out tumors causing the back pain? I hope you get it figured out and feel better. Keep trying new things!  Yes multiple  I have back pain that can be unrelenting at times. \nEither I have to stand and cannot sit, or I have to sit and cannot stand. \nI do go to the gym 5 days a week and find some targeted stretches help a lot. \nMy MRI shows mild to moderate disc degeneration. \nHeat helps. My TENS helps. Meloxicam helps. But it never goes away.  I feel you. Damn my back has been KILLING me. I am at a loss of what to do.  My doctor gave me hydrocodone I take it twice a day, I have been taking it since 2007 and because of it I was able to go to college and get a general studies degree. Now I work three days a week for three hours at a after school care at my old elementary school. It is not much, but the pain medication does help me do a little and make some money. I do live at home and pay rent to my parents.  Aside from taking various medications for pain, I have also found acupuncture and rolfing to be very helpful.  Massage can be beneficial, but rolfing gets deeper into the tissue and also manipulates the fascia which can be even better for treating pain.  However, because it IS deep tissue work, it can be a bit intense.  Most rolfers will work with your comfort levels, though.  I hope you find some relief. even though I am in my 20's I go to children national. what they do with me at their pain clinic is give my a 7 hour session of IV ketmine (an infusion) and it rids my back pain for about a month some people it takes care of the pain for 3 months. then they gave me a nasal spray for break through pain. a bonus of the ketamine infusion is they it also temporarily helps with depression.\n Yes they were all 7 of them  Yeah I have done pain management it did not really do anything for me and I have done physical therapy ", "NF Sippers and other NF Groups I have posted about this before, but I would like to invite anyone in Australia, who lives in the Illawarra area to come to NF Sippers this Friday at Lettuce B Frank in Wollongong.

Why am I the only one with NF1. Spontaneous mutation, I was diagnosed when I was 15 (though doctors suspected I had it when I was a baby, but test results were inconclusive). No one in my family has it, not my parents, none of my grandparents, my three younger siblings, aunts, uncles cousins or even my cousin kids have it. Ok. I was diagnosed when I was a baby. Thanks This happens sometimes. I was diagnosed in my 20s, and no one in my family has it. About 50% of cases are from spontaneous mutations. I am only one that we know of and diagnosed at 9 months...hate that it had to be me, but definitely know I do not want kids to pass it on to Same. Was born with it. First one in the family tree. Some luck eh ..neways was told I have got 50% chance of passing it on and now my two kids have it. :( Ok. I got told at a young age,that your kids have a 50% chance of getting it. But NF dose not say anything about you. And you have a choice to tell your friends you have it and if they judge you then do not be there friends,but.  they say ok and ask what is it then be there friend. My son has it. Spontaneous. Nobody else in the family has it. I am the same 1/2 of all case occur at random. First in family to get it. I have many symptoms but I have never been confirmed by a test. Exactly! Thankfully mine is mild so you do not know I am any different unless you really look...good way to get out suitors This is a major reason why I am form Genetic engineering. I might want kids one day but if they have a 50% chance to get NF1 Sucks that it is a dominate gene Same here was diagnosed when I was a wee lad My case was a spontaneous mutation as well and I just would never forgive myself if I decided to have children and they ended up being born with NF. \n\nKnowing it is my fault would kill me. I also avoid dating specifically for this reason; I would never let myself ruin a fully healthy woman's dreams of having fully healthy children.", "Relationships? How are relationships/dating/sex when it comes to NF? Do you or a partner have it and how is it going for you? Nope, never have I have NF1 and I am married. Our relationship is fine. He just does not understand the emotional toll NF causes. He tries and he is supportive and really tries to be reassuring, but because I also have depression and anxiety, it does not really help but it is nice. Our daughter also has NF and I feel really guilty sometimes. He does a really good job of making sure I know that HE does not blame me and tells me it is not my fault when I say it is.\nSo far, NF has not really affected the relationship other than things I create in my head, and my husband is good at trying to dispel those thoughts. I just had my first one, in my late 20's.  Had to break up with her yesterday. I am sorry. Thanks. Even though I was the one who did the breaking up, I am pretty shaken up over it. May I ask why you broke up? We just were always fighting. I felt she was not treating me well. I hope you find a better match soon. You dated her, so that means you are far from bad in the looks department. I am married, but told every guy I dated that I had it....none of them seemed to care. Of course everyone else had issues of their own, one was paraplegic and the other had severe ADHD so who were they to judge. \n\nMy husband does not really understand it. He is from another country where medical things are kind of considered a stigma. We do not really discuss it too much to be quite honest. I was definitely a bit of a late bloomer (so I do not have a lot of experience to go on), which is not directly related to NF, but medical things consuming a lot of my spare time during undergrad did prevent me from having a typical social experience. Plus the depression/anxiety. I recently got out of my first/only relationship and honestly we had bigger issues than anything the NF could have brought up and the things that did were symptoms of those bigger issues (lack of understanding/compassion, mostly). I am not totally ready to start dating again, but I am not really sure how I will approach it in the future. Figure I will just play it by ear. I have NF1. I had a couple boyfriends in college and met my husband when I was 25. We have been together 7 years and married 3. I could not possibly imagine a better partner to spend my life with. He is the most loving person I have ever known. We do have a few things in common medically like we both had back surgeries as children (he has spina bifida). But I have fairly mild symptoms of NF so it does not really impact my life at all anymore, with one caveat. This past year has been very tough for us as we have tried to start a family without passing NF on. Will not go into details beyond that. But I feel the struggles have made us closer and stronger. I have found that being the breaker-upper can sometimes be just as difficult as being broken up with. Hang in there, friend Just married! She is totally aware of the problems it causes and is understanding of my hesitancy to have children because they might have nf as well, but she loves me and does not judge my bumpy body and knows that sometimes I am sensitive to touch or self conscious but supports me in every way. Confidence goes a long way and having a deeper connection than looks is a serious part of it. Be yourself and dont let nf make you try less or be less than you want to! I am glad that we have a little community here even if its digital. We all understand and we all can relate. Make sure you take care of yourself above everything. Almost same situation. I have NF1 too and with my partner for 10 years and we plan to have kids. He has known from the beginning of my diagnosis and that I would have to go down a more \u201ccomplicated\u201d road of getting conceiving. Are just trying to buy our first home so not starting just yet. I imagine there will be struggles and stress like anyone who has to go down that road NF or not. Nope nerve tried it. Just no confidence in myself. Would rather just hide away from the world Hi, can i ask if you really see you have nf1 or is it rather a mild version of nf1? Because i see some say they have it, but you really do not see it... So then it is more easy i think to start a relationship?! I do have NF1. The only physical indication RIGHT NOW that I have is a bone deformity of my right arm. I have been seeing a few \u201cbumps\u201d pop up but seems like they end up being pimples or cysts. \nI imagine it is easier to start a relationship with no physical indications or at least before they start. Hi, to the persons that have An relationship, can i ask if you really see you have nf1 or is it rather a mild version of nf1? Because i see on fb 'faces of nf' some say they have it, but you really do not see it... So then it is more easy i think to start a relationship?! Not in a relationship, but do remember that MOST people with NF have a mild version of it, so you do not really notice it. Some are so mild that they do not even know they have it. It can vary in severity, and thankfully, severe cases are rare. Most people with mild cases have mainly just the spots and a few lumps. So I do not see why they are going to end up single, since people with more severe cases or other disorders get married. But if you are the one suffering, no matter how mild, the fear can control you and make you think you are undesirable. I admit that is hypocritical of me to say, since I also have issues dealing with my self-esteem due to NF. I think that you can kind of tell one may have NF if they have a slightly larger head. But it does not cause harm, as far as I know. I have had a few girlfriends, however, I am \"lucky\" that I have a mild case of NF. I have not told any of them blatantly about NF and when they ask about the spots or bumps, I just say I was born with them.", "I feel lonely Hello, I am new here.

It started in my toe about a year ago then it moved all the way up to below my knee, now it is moving past my knee to my lower thigh. It is not nerve pain like I said, but it feels like its asleep and it is heavy. I take Gabapentin and that does nothing to help my leg, it helps with my arm, because it is not pain in my leg. I am most likely having surgery in January at C-6 on my neck because of the weakness and pain in my left arm. There is a tumor pushing on my spinal cord with cord damage. The sad thing is, I know that it has nothing to do with my leg. My leg cannot be addressed until I have my neck surgery. When my leg can be addressed, first step would be an MRI of my lower lumbar spine. I already had surgery L-2, L-3 and L-4, L-5 on 2 separate occasions, I really do not want to have a third surgery on my lower back. \nI am sorry if I am here crying about my problems, but you guys are the only ones that can relate to, what I am going through. I tried to explain it to other people but they do not understand.  It sounds like you may have to wait for the MRI to see what is going on with the leg. I know it sucks that you have had so many surgeries and you really do not want another deal with another issue; it can at times seem endless. \n\nHave you ask your doctor if they are any exercises you could do or something to help address your leg issue. \n\nEspecially if your leg feels like it is falling,  asleep that very much sounds like a poor circulation problem, which can lead to other issues if that is the case. Exercises have been known to alleviate the issues with poor circulation. \n\nI know it may seem hard right now, but hopefully, this latest surgery will address all of your issues.  Just try to hang in there and come here or the Facebook NF Groups and talk to people who do understand to help you through these moments. Good Luck! Thank you kindly. I have been having similar issues recently and actually had them back in 2007. Tumors were pressing against my cervical spine and needed to be removed. According to my recent MRI scans it seems those tumors have grown back, I am just waiting to hear back from my doctor in Chicago who diagnosed me when I was 15. How many surgeries have you had?  I have had four related to my Neurofibromatosis, in the last four years two of those were tumors that had turned cancerous.  I am so sorry to hear that i have had 10 surgeries related to mine neurofibermitosis. Two major on my lumbar spine in 2000 and 2008 and one of my cervical spine in 2006, \nI just realized I said that already in my original post my bed.  No problem. I am sorry to hear about yours. It is no fun having this condition. It is miserable.  I have been on disability since 04' I have been on SSI for over five years, but we are trying to get me on disability, I have a hearing in March finally setup we have been trying for over a year. Mostly so that I can be on Medicare off my dad, because my Medicaid does not like me needing to go to Chicago for my doctors appointments. I have been going to Chicago since 1999. Back in April when I needed surgery to move a cancerous tumor in my arm, they denied it and I had to go through an appeal for them to approve it. And unfortunately this is not the first time they have done that.  Your leg issue sounds like it is a sciatic nerve problem in the lower back. I was having the same problem with my left leg, numbness and tingling like it was asleep. It was like that non stop for well over a year. MRI showed degenerative disc at L5-S1 that left the vertebrae pinch the nerve. I had a hemilaminectomy done in May that made a huge difference in my back pain and nerve issues, but now I am having pain in the area that thought was SI joint disease. Shots in the joint made no difference, now I am scheduled for another MRI. They think it is the disc itself that is causing the problem and if that is the case I am looking at a fusion. I feel for you and all the back problems you have had. I wish you a strong recovery going forward. Good luck. ", "Vaccine Side-Effects Hi you all. I do not know if it is my mind playing tricks on me, but I feel like I have gotten more plexiforms since I got the shot.

The only side effects I felt were the ones everyone else got.\n\nCTF put out several statements saying that the vaccine has no negative effects on people with NF. That is good to know. Thank you I have not gotten any new ones as far as I know, but if you feel you are getting new tumors you should speak with your doctor and see about getting an MRI done. The only side effects were that after my second shot I was ill for a few days. I did not notice any other side effects. I had moderna The vaccine will not cause any plexiforms to grow. I have pfizer too. None of my bumps got bigger. As someone else pointed out, CTF has said some things about this. But personal experience: sore arm, was tired for a day after my second shot. No other effects to my NF or anything else I had both AstraZeneca &amp; seen no changes in any of my NFs I think its just your mind playing tricks, they could have even been there before and you only noticed now?

After doing different tests and scans the reason of my faint was still unknown. \n\nPart of my family members also have these spots but none of them fainted before. I am also shorter than normal and I also have 4 degree of scoliosis, which are some symptoms of nf1 when I search online for it. I have no learning problems and other symptoms. So I am not quite sure if I have nf1. There are specific genetic tests they can do to test specifically for NF1. Have you talked to your doctor about this? I would talk with your doctor. I dont have any learning disabilities but I do have 90% of the other symptoms/signs of nf.  It does not hurt to get checked out. I hope your feeling better! You need to speak with your primary care doctor. They will be able to help you with next steps in terms of testing, and finding a neurologist who is aware and educated on NF.

I was diagnosed with Schwannomatosis in 2015, and had a schwannoma removed from my brachial plexus in April of 2016.  The surgery went very smoothly, and my recovery was good, albeit slower than I preferred.\n\nI was later diagnosed with 1 small and 2 tiny schwannomas in the L1-2 region of my spine.  We were monitoring them for growth and taking a \"wait and see\" approach until I started losing bladder control.  This made surgery more urgent, and I now have surgery scheduled for December 19th.  It will be a laminectomy of L1-2 and a resection of the larger of the tumors.  My neurosurgeon says that it is very likely that he will not even be able to see the others.\n\nI have a lot of confidence in my neurosurgeon's skills and I know that there are risks, but am cautiously optimistic.  However, I have never had this type of surgery before, and would love to hear about some personal experiences.  What are some things to know about recovery that I might not have thought of?  Someone told me to get one of those grabber things, as bending or reaching will be difficult for a while, and that is great advice.  Anything else?  Did you find that a special type of pillow or whatever helpful?  Help a girl out, pretty please?\n\nThanks! I have neurofibromatosis and in 2007 I had surgery to remove tumors from my spine that were pressing against it. I was told if they were not removed I could have woken up one day unable to use my legs.\n\nIt took about three weeks for me to recover to where I could sit up without feeling dizzy. The type of pillow I used and continue to use is the SleepBetter The Perfect Pillow Standard, this pillow can typically be found at Carson\u2019s, Bon-Ton and any store related to them. And it is always on sale during this week.\n Hello! I also have schwannomatosis. I had a laminectome done 3 months ago to remove spinal tumors. My surgeon told me he removed 2 half bones and 3 full bones as well as 5 tumors. \n-\nThe Good: suicide inducing agony gone. \n-\nThe bad: I had to lay flat for 24 hrs post-op and had my first ever panic attack &amp; developed my only phobia. I have constant low back pain now. Dont think I can ever work again. \nI have large numb patches in both of my legs. (Thighs) I have reduced sensation to my penis. I have trouble urinating now. \n-\nThat being said, these are my experiences and could easily be different/less severe in your case, however I believe these are all common symptoms of laminectome. All considered I would still get the surgery.  Thanks.  My surgeon did tell me that I would have to be flat on my back for 24 hours to replenish the cerebral-spinal fluid, so I was expecting that.  \n\nI am sorry to hear about the numb patches and reduced sensation.  I had numbness after having my previous schwannoma removed, but regained sensation gradually over the course of the following year.  I hope this is the case for you.  Also, if you cannot work anymore, I hope you can get on disability. Thanks!  I will look for that pillow.  And it is good to know that it can take 3 weeks to be able to sit up without dizziness.  I will adjust my expectations accordingly. You are welcome. Also for me the back of my head did feel numb for at least 4-6 months, this can vary depending upon person. ", "I was referred to be evaluated for NF1 - what can I expect? I am in my late twenties and am currently pregnant with my second child. At my prenatal appointment yesterday, the NP doing my appointment took great interest in a birthmark on my stomach and asked me if I had others like it. I knew I had quite a few but had never thought it was a big deal so I could not even tell her how many or where they all are. She said it could indicate NF and sent me a referral to the dermatology department, and dermatology immediately set me up with an appointment later this month.\n\nAfter I got home I read up on NF and studied all over my body to count my cafe au lait spots. I found seven that meet the 1.5 cm size, several others that are very close to that size, and numerous ones that are smaller. I also have a growth that looks a lot like pictures of plexiform neurofibromas (it is been there since way before puberty but is in an inconspicuous location and small enough to not cause trouble, and has not ever changed significantly enough for me to worry about it) as well as three tiny possible neurofibromas, and I do have small brown spots on my eyes that are potentially lisch nodules. So it is looking likely that I will meet the basic diagnostic criteria.\n\nWhat can I expect next for the full diagnosis, monitoring, and management? What tests might my doctor want to do?\n\nObviously, assuming I do have it, I have a mild case since I am well into adulthood without having noteworthy problems. We will have to see about getting my daughter and the new baby evaluated for it as well, and I will notify my family since I am not the only one with the numerous birthmarks. Hey fellow NF redditor. \nI also have never been \u201cdiagnosed\u201d properly, my father has it, and a long line of family and I just am aware of the symptoms. So I am in the process of meeting with a geneticist.   I was diagnosed when I was 15. For me they ran some blood test, full body MRI, PET Scan, EKG and ultrascan. I spent about a week in the hospital of them running tests on me, I missed the last week of my Freshman year in highschool.\n\nIn the twenty years since I was diagnosed, I have had four surgeries. I am on two pain medications. I first started taking medication for it in 2007 and then was also proscribe a second medication in 2014. It helps take away most of my pain, I still have the every day pain I have grown to live with. I do have poor balance because of my condition, my right leg is weaker than my left and does give out every now and then. I have weakness also in my right arm. On top of having Neurofibromatosis, I also have a lazy right eye which I was born with, I have high blood pressure (family history of that) and when I was nine I was diagnosed with a learning disability.\n\nNo one in my family has Neurofibromatosis, ay least not my parents, siblings, grandparents. \n\nIf you are diagnosed, doctors if they have not already will tell you there is a 50% chance of your children being born with the condition.\n\n2001 - lower right arm to remove tumors\n\n2007 - tumors that were pressing against my spine \n\n2014 - high grade cancerous tumor from my upper right leg\n\n2018 - low grade cancerous tumor from my upper right leg\n\nI typically have full body MRI scans every year and see my Neurofibromatosis specialist also once a year. \n\nIf you have any question, feel free to ask. Why did they send you to a dermatologist?  They should have sent you to geneticist or a NF clinic. Probably just to confirm the presence of sufficient cafe au lait spots, I am guessing. That is still a waste of time and money.  Go straight to the top.  The dermatologist is going to look at the CAL spots, say, \"Yes, they are CAL, and you probably have NF.  I am going to send you to a specialist.\"    Yep. This. At the very lease see a neurologist, or a geneticist. \n\nCTF, Childrens Tumor Foundation (I know name sounds odd for a disorder that affects all ages... it was a branding move made a decade back and has pr9ven to be effective driving more funds) the leading NF research organization has doc directory. I am not sure how the referrals for an NF specialist would work since my insurance is with Kaiser - I think they usually do everything internally.  At least then it will not cost you anything but time.  But I would ask about a neurologist visit. I am 31 and was just diagnosed this year, first one in my family as well. Started with a series of MRIs, then got genetic testing, and then went to meet with an NF specialist who also ordered a PET-CT and biopsy on two large plexiform neurofibromas and really explained everything to me. I went on to have those two neurofibromas removed (confirmed benign though!) and am scheduled for another round of MRIs in the spring to monitor if anything has progressed. \n\nI definitely recommend getting into an NF clinic or otherwise meeting with a dr who is very familiar with the condition - I started with a clueless surgical oncologist who basically told me \u201cit is probably not cancer so do not worry\u201d, and am now thrilled with the actual treatment I am getting from my specialist.   When I was in highschool, I think it was my junior year so I was 17. I had already been diagnosed by a doctor in Chicago who is well known in the Neurofibromatosis community when I was 15. Anyways I had this tumor growing on my arm that was starting to concern my doctor. He really wanted the surgery to be done in Chicago, but my parents really wanted it to be done at home. Chicago is like two plus hours away.\n\nSo they did find a neuro surgeon, who told us he was very familiar with Neurofibromatosis, but turns out he flat out lied. When he opened up my arm he saw how difficult it actually was. He was able to remove it, but he told my parents he would never preform surgery on me again. For about six months my arm turned a shade of green and would go numb. From that day on all my other surgeries have been done in Chicago. \n\nThe only problem I have now is my insurance does not like approving any of my visits or surgeries. Back in April of this year, I needed to have surgery to remove a cancerous tumor in my upper right arm that was causing extreme burning pain and they denied it. They were also a jerk to my surgeon on the phone who was explaining to them the seriousness of my situation. So I had to appeal the decision and thankfully it worked. \n\nBut then I was supposed to have a visit with my Neurofibromatosis specialist on October 11th and they denied that appointment, so I had to appeal the decision. Which it was approved on Wednesday, they approved six appointments that are good until April 2019. \n\nI have been going to Chicago for 20 years, I wish that my insurance would stop with this whole wanting to stay in network thing.  I was diagnosed when I was 4 and life has been a battle. When I was a child the doctors told my parents I would not live to see the age of 16 and by the grace of GOD, I am 44 and still kicking. I know you might be scared but we are all here for you. We all have our unique struggles in life and when it comes down to it, we support each other.   I am seeing the dermatologist tomorrow and expect he will refer me to the geneticist. \n\nI am mostly scared for my kids from what I have seen about how bad it could be for them. I am lucky that I have been mostly unaffected and it is crazy that there is no way to know how bad they could have it. My daughter (a year and a half old) might have enough cafe spots so I will be calling her pediatrician after I have heard what the dermatologist thinks about my status. My Tumor is on the right side of my face so its noticeable. When I was a kid, I got into a lot of fights since bullies thought I was an easy target. I learned abouth empathy at an ealry age and it helped me as I got older.  yep, then the specialist will send you to an eye dr, then the eye dr will send you to a neuro, then the neuro will send you to a special eye dr, then they will send you to get bloodwork, then a geneticist will take blood and youll finally get a diagnosis.  ", "Questions for parents with NF babies Hello,\n\nI have a one and a half year old baby boy, he has CAL spots and I have had him tested, the tests came back with a mutation on NF1. He is doing all right, no developmental issues, no tumors that we know of yet (he had a brain MRI, ophthalmologic exam, etc), but he is soooo small. He is not a big eater, but still, so tiny. He is 80 cm long and weighs 9 kg. Can I do something for him to catch up? Did you also confront with this issue? His blood work was also ok a few months ago. How do you stop worrying about them all the time? I would speak with your sons pediatrician about this. Just take things one day at a time. I was diagnosed when I was 15, but doctors always told my parents when I was born that they thought I had it. \n\nIf you have questions let me know. My son is 10 and still struggling bad with fine motor and education. One day at a time. Roll with the punches that may or may not come. Good luck friend. My daughter has NF1, as do I.  She was born weighing 6lbs (or about 2.7kg) at birth and was 18\" (~45.7cm).\n\nShe was always on the smaller side. Based on you using metric, I am guessing you are not in the US so I do not know if this type of data is available where you are. My daughter's doctors, both her pediatrician and her nf specialist, used 2 charts that compared other children her age to show what percentile she was in (I am sorry, I cannot think of what it is called). One chart was of all children, one was children with NF. My kid was always small on the one with all children and average when compared to other NF kids.  She did hit a massive growth spurt around the age of 7 and grew 5\"/~12.7cm in a 12 month span. She is now 11 and its quite tall for her age.\n\nI think all kids grow differently but have noticed NF kids tend to be a bit smaller. I think talking to his doctor will help with any worries. I would postpone (and skip) vaccines (we did for our boy).  Most people and likely the doctor will disagree.  Yet, the  size of a dose is not adjusted according to size of an infant.  So, having a bigger baby 6, 9, 12, 24, 36 or more months older when they get whichever shots you find necessary will be a benefit for him. No Was your boy premature? Does he have feeding issues? Unless you provide scientific evidence to make such a statement, it is antivax crap. I was always tiny (still am, but genetics also). My parents had me to the pediatrician because I just was not growing when I was a baby. Tests showed nothing was wrong, and back then we did not know it had to do with NF as much. All the dr told them was that tallest I would ever be was 5\u20192\u201d (sorry I do not know the metric for that). I did start growing, but have always been short (I did not even top 5\u2019).\n\nSpeaking for my mother, you will never stop worrying. They tried to be proactive and get me into the Dr to get an MRI every couple years. I never worried about what I could not change. Pay attention to your child's signals. My child always had symptoms because she was born with Plexiform Neurofibroma tumors under her skin.\n\nShe, however, did everything her siblings did and I let her judge what she could do. I encouraged her to always do her best. Aside from her many hospitalizations for surgeries she finished high school and received her BA. I am not a parent but I have NF1.  I was a very small baby (2.2 kg), but NF did not affect my growth in the long run.  I grew up to be a normal size.", "Stephy's last wish ", "Happy Cakeday, r/neurofibromatosis!

He lost most of the function in his right hand.\n\nHe is seeing wrist surgeons but recovery is very slow since this was nerve related.\n\nJust wondered if anyone had similar symptoms here?

Thank you person with a funny bane \ud83d\ude00 I have a shitload of tumors. They took one out of my elbow and I lost feeling in my hand for months. I still do not have feeling in my pinky on my left hand. \n\nIt seems to be pretty rare to actually have a lot of tumors that hurt all the time.\n\nI started out with just a buncha lumps that hurt to touch. Now I have got them in places where they have constant pressure. If I move my wrist on my right arm the wrong way, it puts pressure on one in my wrist. Which hurts like hell and makes my hand lock up completely. \n\nAlso got some in my torso pelvis type area. Sometimes they hurt really bad and it feels like I got stabbed in the gut, then sometimes I throw up a bunch. \n\nIt is pretty shitty. And honestly I would not ever let them cut a tumor out again, unless it was causing me unbearable pain. Getting them cut out seems to do more damage than it fixes.

However, me keeping this and electing not to have surgery would mean I would occasionally have pangs with a definite chance of having it grow much bigger. \n\nHas anyone here had NF related surgery with consequences such as these? I would love to hear what you have to say because I am actually so scared. Last year I had a golfball sized tumor removed from my ulnar nerve just above the right elbow.  I had it for several years, before I first had it MRI'ed about 5 years ago, and it was only in the past year and a half that it began to impede strength, mobility, and dexterity in my right hand.  I still have lingering numbness/tingling in my pinky, but my strength, mobility, and dexterity are back better than prior to surgery (it has been so long since \"normal\" that I do not know if I am or ever will get back there).  \n\n\nThe real point and why I would suggest removal if you are able to arrange it; the pathology report on the tumor came back benign, but had \"abnormal formations\".  Talking with both the surgeon and the NF oncologist (and my own study of NF1), I came away with the strong impression that if the tumor was not removed, it eventually would have gone malignant.    \n\n\nSmall tumors pea-dime sized tumors that do not keep growing (especially if they do not cause pain) are not the problem.  When they get large, keep growing, and cause pain, that would be, in my opinion, a good time to get them removed.    \n\n\nAs far as the surgery itself, yes I was nervous going in, but in hindsight I know it was worth it.  4+ months of PT after, and my arm is doing well, I am not worrying about that particular tumor anymore (lost insurance just before I was to get my first full body MRI so that sucks, but this tumor is gone), and have a really cool scar to show people.  In the end, it definitely was worth it to get the tumor removed.    \n\n\nIf you have not yet, definitely talk to a surgeon who would be doing the surgery, or at least a NF specialist.  Talk with them about the pros/cons of surgery.  And if you are leaning against surgery, at least try to get a biopsy to rule out a malignant tumor. I have a plexiform in my left leg.  I had it debulked at the hip in December 2017, which only sent me into more pain going down my leg, primarily at the knee.  I had the knee part debullked sixish month later.  But yeah, the first half of 2018 was not a good time for me. I have had four surgeries we related to Neurofibromatosis and they have all been successful. The only real issue was with the first surgery I had and that was because the surgeon who performed the surgery had lied to my parents and I. He said he had preformed surgery on other with the same condition, but when he preformed the surgery and saw how difficult it was he would later tell my mom after he had completed the surgery that he would never do a surgery on me again. He had no idea how wrapped the tumors are in the nerves. I have sense had my three other surgeries all done in Chicago, by doctors familiar with Neurofibromatosis and have had no issues at all. Hey op! I have had a few schwannomma removals. Cannot type it all out right now but PM me and I will get back to you tomorrow! Oh damn I am sorry to hear that, your recovery sounded rough. Hope you are feeling a lot better now!!! Started a chat with you mate! Why the heck would surgeons even lie about being okay with operating with things like that. There is so much liability at stake. \nIm glad you have more capable surgeons now Thank you for your thought out reply! I really appreciate it \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\n\nI have spoken to the gp and genetics department and they showed a lot of concern towards the lump. It is definitely a neurofibroma and the surgeon seemed familiar with it.  I trust the surgeon enough because the department of genetics reccomended them and I am from Australia so our healthcare system is pretty good. \n\nMy potential surgeon is a neurosurgeon and a spinal one. I asked him so many questions about the lump and such but forgot to ask whether he operated on these before. I might sit on it for a bit longer but it is so so tedious. \n\nI have already spoken about the pros and cons of surgery already and it is a tricky pick. Removing it seems like the avenue I am likely to consider though. Who know why he lied, maybe he was looking for a thrill of something or just did not grasp how differ  getting these tumors out really is.", "Question about baby I have a nf1 from my mom and I have a 16 mo baby. My baby have one light spot and nothing. I know to be clear I need to do some blood test but I am wonder if she did not have any other symptoms other than only one spot then is it possibly that my baby do not have it? Because I saw lots of baby diagnosed with nf1 have a visible symptoms in early ages like before 1. TIA! Neurofibromatosis can effect everyone differently, it is possible that things could progress as she gets older. I was not fully diagnosed until I was 15, puberty is what set things off for me. When I was a baby, doctors thought I had it, but test were inconclusive, I was tested again when I was 9 with the same results.\n\nIt would be best to discuss this with your child\u2019s doctor. You have a 50:50 chance of passing it on with each pregnancy/child. She could not be showing symptoms yet, or she could not have it. Talk to her doctor. Most Nf1 signs, with the exception of cafe au lait spots,  are absent in infancy, therefor waiting  for these signs to establish the diagnosis in the case of a positive parent does not have much sense.\n\nIf it is the blood test that puts you off, the genetic test can be done with a pain-free cheek  swab. \n\nNf1 manifestations are age related and will appear in determined period of life. Do not live in doubt and do not delay a possible diagnosis. This is correct. NF1 is a progressive disease and the number of cafe au lait spots can increase overtime in people with it. Many doctors would test at this age without clear clinical diagnosis, but it is also legitimate to observe if there at not at least 2 criteria met and see if clinical diagnosis can be made at the follow-up. It is a bit more complicated than that. Clinical signs of NF1 have a different age of onset, in other words they are age-dependent. These statements express two deeply different concepts and only the second holds true: each clinical sign of NF1 is not increasing in frequency with age but has its own specific age of onset as stated in the new NF1 book. \n\nThis is why there has been a push to change the diagnostic criteria, because what made sense based on the information they had when they created them in the 1980s is outdated now, and with the exception of an hereditary case, waiting to meet the two criteria would only result in a delayed diagnosis, with potentially, a negative outcome. Cafe au lait spot number and size and number and size of neurofibromas often increase with age. That is progressive. Yes, the clinical findings appear at different ages, and this is another way NF1 can present progressively. The graph in the CTF's book suggests cafe au lait spots appear between 0 to 2 years, and the first spots almost always present in that age range, but new ones can appear after that time.\nMy statement on testing or observing reflects the range of practice in the USA. Observation would still involve seeing an ophthalmologist and close follow up with thorough physical exam.", "PGD IVF I have NF1. I was diagnosed by  symptoms and family history as a child. Later it was confirmed by a genetic test. NF has not really affected my quality\ufffc of life. About 6 years ago I went through PGD IVF to ensure my offspring did not have NF. As a result I have 2 healthy boys!  If you have any questions about the process or my NF ask away! This is great, comforting news for everyone of us who is hestitant to plan family or even date due to our condition. I think someone else on here mentioned successes with IVF too.   \n\n\nHowever, I have heard IVF comes with other risks and am wondering if you have any info about that (surely, they must have informed you about it before doing it)? Thank you for hosting this small AmA! I do not know any other people personally who have NF1 or who have gone through PGD, so it is really interesting to hear about your experiences. \n\nDid you see any massive physical changes in yourself when you were pregnant? As in, fibroma growth or something like that? Or did you not have many physical symptoms of NF1 to begin with and before you became pregnant? There is an increased risk of miscarriage I believe. And you are labeled a high risk pregnancy. I got extra special ultra sounds for each kid. With number 2 I had an instance of bleeding when I was like 10weeks pregnant . Which apparently is normal. I knew slight bleeding was normal but did not realize gushing blood can be expected. Depending on your health IVF can be like 50/50 percent chance you will have a term pregnancy. There is also a risk of having multiples. Even if they implant one. I only had 2 eggs so only did one egg each time. There is also all the meds you have to take which suck! \ufffc I did start growing mild fibromas on my abdomen and back. Before pregnancy I only had spots and freckling. They have stayed pretty mild after two pregnancies . My mom's NF went crazy after she had kids. Sounds very scary.

Kind of corresponds with what I had read about IVF then, but - again - I am extremely happy to hear it ended up working out well for you. &lt;3\n\nI am not female and I am not sure if I would be comfortable with \"forcing\" a fully healthy woman who could have a \"normal pregnancy\" to go through all of that. If it were to have bad results on either her and/or the offspring, it would feel even more awful knowing I am the one responsible for it. Yes my ex-husband did not agree with adoption, even though I would have loved to do it! But like I said I was worth all the stress and misery because I have two healthy boys. I have nothing against adoption either and even if I met a woman who was fine with it too, it would feel very bad to \"rob\" her of her potential to have her own, genetic offspring. \n\nGood to know there are options with proven, good results though. \n\nI am curious to see how the CRISP-R-technology will develop too. We are going through the same without much success :(\n\nHow many viable eggs did you guys get? (Viable for transfer) The first round was like 14 I think due to to much clotting. The second round was about 30+. Out of those eggs two were \"good.\" I did have a scare the day before the second extraction of overain hyperstimulation syndrome . The nurse said my ovaries were \"kissing.\" There was a chance I would have to be hospitalized and the extraction would not take place. It was a stressful night. The first round resulted in 0 viable embryos. It was devastating to me and I want to give up all hope of ever getting pregnant. When I started round two I was so distressed and wanted to stop. But close friends encouraged me and supported me to go forward. &gt;The first round resulted in 0 viable embryos. It was devastating to me and I want to give up all hope of ever getting pregnant. When I started round two I was so distressed and wanted to stop. But close friends encouraged me and supported me to go forward.\n\nCan I ask your age and what country you are in?   \n\n\nWe are in New Zealand and the govt funds two rounds. I am in the USA. My insurance covered my meds once (I have blue shield) The rest was out of pocket. We tried to send evidence as to why it would be good to do Pgd off but they denied it. I am 31 right now . I started this journey when I was about 23-24 I believe . It took a while for me to get a viable embryo! Congrats, going through this process myself, I can say that it is a super stressful and painful process. Especially for the ladies!\n\nI compare it to a rocket launch, every thing is timed and lined up for the perfect launch.\n\nWe had one viable egg last time for transfer (back) and that was not successful.\n\nThis time they came back with the same so we are just waiting for 2021 to get a transfer.\n\nHoping this is the one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT:   \n\n\nOh I should have said that my wife is 38 and I am 39. So we are quite a bit older. I will not lie. I so did not want to do the process again. When the first round resulted in no embryos my doctor called an encouraged me to talk to my close friends and family before deciding to repeat the process. The second time around getting the shots tore me apart. I had  a strong supery system though and that kept me sane. The wife's belly was so bruised, and apparently the last injection before the collection was the worse. \n\nBrave ladies! I know I cannot do that. \n\nYou know that she really loves me (I am the one with NF) by going through all this. Yes! My belly was so bruised! My butt was so much worse though when I had to do intramuscular Injections. I itched so much!! \ufffc We are in the process of doing this. Our first attempt, unfortunately our daughter was stillborn at 33 weeks early this year.  Probably unrelated to the IVF but this pregnancy stuff is not easy even without the ivf part.  We are getting ready for another attempt. In our locale, all expenses for the PGD and IVF are out of pocket, so cost, as well as physical and emotional stress, might determine how many times we try. It is very expensive and as a guy there is not much I can do about the physical challenges of IVF cycles or the pregnancy itself for that matter. And everything has probabilities so we to try to be optimistic when things are going well but never too optimistic. Regular pregnancy attempts have a high failure rate too and failed implantation and early miscarriage is common but the IVF process elevates the anxiety.  \n\n Like you, my case is mild, but I was scared by the complete unpredictability of whether my kids\u2019 cases would be mild or not. We looked at other options for having children but decided we could, and wanted, to try this at least as couple times. My husband and I are also going through the process right now. His NF was a spontaneous mutation so it took a little longer for them to make the genetic probes. We had 10 embryos sent for testing and 8 came back affected. We only have one normal embryo (the other was abnormal.) I am going to have an ERA done to hopefully help our one little embryo stick. I am praying that we do not have to go through a second round as everything is out of pocket for us and it is definitely not a process for the faint of heart. However, I know that I would do it all over again if I have to in order to avoid passing it on. I do not have any questions for this post but, just wanted to thank you for posting your experience and welcoming questions.  I have a 3 month old daughter who is being tested (genetically) for NF1.  Neither I or my husband, or anyone in our families have NF1 so if positive, it will be a spontaneous mutation.  Never having heard of NF1, I am very worried and afraid for my little girl.  Reading your post brings me hope that there is a possibility that she have the opportunity to have unaffected babies should she choose to \u2764\ufe0f may i ask how much you paid out of pocket? i myself live in the US and have blue shield too. I want kids but i do not want to pass the gene along to them. I am 31 right now and wonder if i should start the process now? I am not engaged or married yet, but my boyfriend and i do eventually want kids. It is hard to stay how much it costs. But it was a couple thousands blue cross paid once for my meds... I will say a couple thousands . Like 20000 or more omg twenty thousand. that is so sad and discouraging, it should be fully covered, it should not be that much to have a healthy baby or to have a baby in general. the healthcare system in the states is so fucked. this makes me really sad since other countries fully cover IVF. i was thinking more like 10k. It could be cheaper if the first round is successful. thank you! it is nice to ask questions to someone who lives in the states and went through exactly what i want to do. How long did it take from when you inquired about IVF to the egg retrieval/testing 1.5 years. Mostly because I had to do two rounds. Before I could start the second round my doctor told me to take time and really think about if I wanted to try again. He encouraged me to talk to friends and family too. okay that is not too terrible, kind of works with my timeline since i am not even engaged yet, hopefully soon though LOL. thank you for all the information, i better start saving, i would love to have kids in the next 4-5 years. I am glad you were able to have success and have 2 healthy babies.", "My mom has given up. ", "anyone else? does anyone else imagine what their life would be like if they did not have nf? like seriously. if you would be taller, smarter, perfect body, etc? I constantly look at other females and wish I were them. this is a constant daily thing. I wish I had someone else body or rather not have this nf disorder at all.  I would rather be super fat than have nf. I know that is a horrible thing to say. but with being fat, you can at least change things, get surgery and fix yourself. there is no fixing nf. you will die because of it. I know I am so negative but this is me. take me as I am. I am not going to alter my mind because then I would be living a lie. I get this told constantly to change my outlook. easy to say since those people do not understand how it is to be in my ugly skin. This is a daily struggle I have. I often fantasise about there being a cure and all my limitations from NF suddenly going away. But like they say you need to play with the cards you have been given. I the only thing I wish I could change is being taller. I have pretty much accepted my fibromas and only have them removed if its on my face or causing pain. You have to start taking things one day at a time. I think you really need to talk with someone about what you are feeling. There is no such thing as the perfect body, we are all exactly the way we are supposed to be. What matters is who were are on the inside. That is what is important at the end of the day. Comparing ourselves to others is the worse thing anyone can do to themselves. All this negativity does not do you any good. Start looking at the positives in your life, once you start doing that you will feel a whole lot better. I do not care about being taller, I just wish I was not so skinny, and my wrists were not so fucking tiny.\n\nPlus I would love to be less socially awkward, yay for learning disabilities from nf honestly yeah I tend to feel really insecure about my patchy skin and the few neurofibromas I have.(i do not really have that many neurofibromas anyway probably like 5-12)\n\nsince people always ask why do not I try popping them or asked if I was bitten by a bug. I am slowly coming to terms with it and stop comparing myself to other girls who have \"perfect skin\" or the \"perfect bodies\"\n\nI would probably still be able to do things like ballet if I did not have coordination issues I have a fibroma on my eyelid and people are always asking if I have an eye infection. It really sucks and makes me self conscious because people think I am walking around with something contagious unless they ask and I explain. I can relate to that to an extent since I have one on my nose and people ask about it often and why I never seemed to have popped my \"nose pimple\" and it makes me quite insecure.", "I have had NF all my life but I have never known much about it.

It is called nf1 I have tumors that grow on my nerves. They are not really that harmful. I also have a cool cluster of birthmarks. \nSeems to break it down enough I have started saying it is a  genetic condition, which causes normal benign (non-cancerous) tumours to grow on the body they can be external or internal. I have one on the left side of my face (point to it) and over my chest and back.  I have started to try and give people as much knowledge as possible about it.  If children I go with I have these large spots and \"birth mark\"  - for children I find this enough without making it too complex.  I have also found a few great YouTube videos which help explain it. I used to be embarrassed honestly. Now I just tell people it is a Neurological disorder that makes tumors grow on my nerves.\nMost of mine are internal, and cause my chronic back pain. I have a large amount along my spine. Pretty much this That is what I say Just be straight with them by telling the truth, if they have questions and your comfortable answering then answer them as best as you can, if they ask a question your not comfortable answering then just say that your not comfortable answering that question right now I just tell me it gives me these awful bumps, they are not cancer, and it makes me really clumsy. It also maybe why I am short 152cm just call it a neurological disorder ... explain how my eye used to get stuck down, and i cannot really see out of my right eye... and reassure people it does not mean i am retarded. a genetic thing that affects the nervous system and causes bumps and shit. This one waitress at a restaurant I frequent told me she liked my freckles recently, and for the first time in my life I said \u201cthank you\u201d instead of correcting her", "My doctor wants me to try acupuncture for pain, but I am hesitant I was asking about medical massage for my back pain and additional PT, but she wants to try this, and I do not know if I trust it, especially with NF.\n\n\nAnyone have experience? I would post this on like a massage or even a acupuncture page on reddit. Make sure you explain what nf is in the nerves sense of things (make sure you are specific). People there should be able to tell you what they think. Acupuncture is a placebo. There is no evidence that it is effective in a controlled study. Save your time and money. Also, find a new doctor if this the best they can do. My doctor has said that to me as well, I will not do it, I rather get more medicine for my itching and nerve pain That is sort of how I feel about it.  She is my 2nd primary that I see when my regular is not available but I am just desperate now.\n\nLike I will go once and see if they can use this referral for something else in their office like I have done with some other referrals.\n\nMy pain management doctor is over his head with my NF and will not do anything more without direct word from my NF team, as I have spinal tumors he is scared to handle with injections I am a licensed acupuncturist who also happens to have Neurofibromatosis Type 1. I am unable to answer direct questions from your case for liability reasons, but I can tell you that if you do see somebody, to please see an acupuncturist who is licensed. In my state you have to have a Masters of Science or above to practice, and that includes basic medical knowledge, which in our field also includes drug/herb interactions. If you bring in notes from your last MRI for example, a good acupuncturist would know exactly what your radiology or lab notes are talking about. One thing that is very important is to be as detailed with your history as possible, and to let them know of any possible tumor development that your neurologist or NF specialist is also keeping an eye on. That would allow us to be extra careful in that particular area. Make sure to voice whatever concerns that you have from the beginning, because that will allow someone who is uncomfortable with your particular case to refer you to someone who is more knowledgeable. People with NF tend to have complex medical histories, so it is beneficial to be as thorough as possible. In all honesty, there are great and poor practitioners out there in every field of medicine. A good practitioner will know what you are talking about, and if they do not they will be honest about how they will research and work *with* you. A bad acupuncturist tends to be someone who is arrogant, and lets their ego override the comfort of their patient, so go with your gut feeling when you meet someone for your initial consultation. \n\nThere are quite a few things that we can do for back pain, even if it is neurologically related. Most of us are trained in different massage techniques and therapies as well. We do not just stab people in the back with needles! One thing to keep in mind is that we cannot cure NF, so if you find someone who alludes to that, know that they are full of it. Pain that is directly related to structure is going to be more difficult to manage. The longer that you have had an issue or the more chronic an ailment is, the longer it usually takes to find relief (this is a general rule, but not always the case), so be patient if you find someone that you like. It might come down to finding relief, and then maintaining where you are when you do, rather than resolving the issue all together. \n\nIf you would like I can post here or PM you with more tips to help your first session go more smoothly. I hope that you find relief for your pain soon. I am sorry for your struggles. I have been fairly lucky to have most of my painful tumors excised. \n\nI do not know if you are aware, but the MEK inhibitors are becoming available soon if you are in the USA. Talk to your doctor so you can be first in line. The differences for those that see results are remarkable. I did it and it seemed to make the pain worse for my plexiform. While acupuncture can be a good thing, when it comes to nf it could be complicated. When I was first diagnosed and was having pain my parents asked my nf specialist about seeing a chiropractor, my doctor who have continued to see for the last 20-21 years said that a chiropractor would not know what to do with me and most would be scared by the results of my MRI results. I would imagine there would be a similar concern with acupuncture. I would make sure that the person who does the acupuncture is both aware and understands what nf it and how it effects the person, especially given it effects everyone differently. \n\nWas this was specialist that suggested it or your primary care doctor? I take pain medication for my my and have for the last then plus years. I have not but temped to try it. But reading about making pain worse I do not think I will even bother I have tried lots of different non pharmaceutical treatments for pain including massage, rolfing and acupuncture.  I have had good results with all of them, but of course nothing can take away the pain completely.  I know that acupuncture does not work for everyone, but I got a lot of relief, so if you can get it covered by insurance, or have a community acupuncture clinic with licensed practitioners, I would say give it a try. It is changed my life!! I do it weekly I have never had it for My NF specifically, but it helped my carpal tunnel. It was totally painless and worked for me.", "Raise Your Voice!

He is having a hard time at his school staying focused, doing transitions, and he is not playing with the other kids in a socially appropriate manner. At home, he seems irritated often and is destructive (hitting his dad, sibling, and dog out of nowhere). Throws toys and anything he finds, and laughs. He has two optic gliomas and is getting another MRI in a month. \n\nWe are considering moving him to special ed where he would get more support and we are talking to a child psychologist who is knowledgable about NF1. Overall, I am starting to worry about him and his future. I hope that his is a phase and that I will get my sweet boy back, but I am scared that this is NF1 and symptoms that are starting to develop. \n\nAny advise, feedback, or words of encouragement? My son was the same way, and due to bad advice from professionals we kept him in main stream school for much longer than we should have. If I could turn back the clock I would have placed him in a special school much sooner. Unfortunately the challenging behaviour was not a phase for my son. He is now 14 and is more challenging than ever. Cruel to my dog, bullies his little sister, has no moral compass, has no respect for anyone, only cares about himself and has epic meltdowns and tantrums daily. I think its 70% NF1 and 30% teenage angst.  I know this isnt what you want to hear, but every day is a struggle and I cant bring myself to sugar coat it for you.   I hope things turn out different for you, Thank you for sharing that! Good or bad, it is helpful to hear it! I am so sorry he is being tough. When did you end up moving him to special ed school? And when did you start noticing challenging behavior? He moved to special ed when he was 11, I live in the UK, so that was his transition from primary school to secondary school. Tbh he was challenging from the day he was born, he cried all the time, he wouldnt sleep and it was clear he was different to other children from when he was a toddler.  My son is a particularly severe case of NF1, so have hope that it may get better for you! His problems are mainly behavioural, he only has a few neurofibromas and one of those is in his brain which may contribute to his behaviour. My son is 10. He was diagnosed at 3 and we got him in early preschool. He is had an IEP and special education from the start. He is still significantly behind today. Seems like he is only 6 or 7 mentally. I am still lost. Nothing we have done has seemed to help. Medications, special treatment, normal treatment. Good luck friend. Gotcha! Did he ever get a diagnosis of any kind? I am sure my little one will get an ADHD one at some point... He has been really easy up until now - slept great, ate well and was overall really lovely, but now I am not sure who he is anymore... \n\nThere is a fantastic Facebook group called NF Moms Rock!!!!! if you arent already a member there. There are UK moms on there. I am sorry! It is so tough! Does he have behavioral issues? Brain tumors? My guy is definitely behind with language and social interaction, but he is tall and heavy for his age so I think the delay becomes more pronounced with him. Like people are expecting him to be more advanced but he is actually behind. Yes, he was diagnosed with NF1 when he was three, then ADHD when he was 7, then autism when he was 11. We call him the triple threat \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c his doctors believe the autism is tied with his NF1 rather than a separate condition. Thanks for the tip, I will definitely look that up \u2764 if it helps, my husband just reminded me that my daughter who does not have NF1 skipped the terrible 2's and had a really bratty phase when she was 3, maybe your son is having something like that? That is reassuring because my dude did skip the terrible 2s. I hope this is just some terrible 3s...\n\nI think you will really enjoy the group. For most part, everyone is supportive and empowering. I have learnt so much from other moms there and makes me feel less lonely in all of this. I hope so too, and I  am sending positive thoughts to your family! Feel free to hit me up anytime you need to talk! He is 3.\n\nYou are overthinking this.\n\nSpecial ed because he is doing normal 3 year old things? Parent him. Teach him that those things are inappropriate. I see where you are coming from and I thought that way too. To add some more information to get the full scope: He just went through a full, multiple step Neuropsychological evaluation by a child psychologist, he has a SEIT with him in the classroom on a daily basis, we just had a meeting with his teachers. Also, us parents see a behavioral therapist that help us adjusting our parenting to suit his issues. All think that special ed is the way to go, but fundamentally it is our call. Believe me, if this was just me and our parenting style, we would not be where we are right now. Nothing would make me happier than someone telling me to just adjust my parenting.\n\nEdit to add: he also has a significant language delay that we think plays into all this and is an important part of seeking out Special ed. It does not sound like something related to Neurofibromatosis. I have type 1, and while I do have a learning disability and have difficulty making friends, I was never destructive. I would talk with your son\u2019s pediatrician about his behavior. It is possible something else is causing this behavior. Thank you! I hope the MRI next month will be helpful to us. Maybe tumor growth somewhere new? We do have ADHD in the family so that might be playing in as well. You are welcome. That does sound more close to an ADHD behavior and if there is a family history that does make it more of a possibility. Growing up my sister had a classmate who was diagnosed with ADHD in grade school and I remember he would have out burst like that and hit. One time he punched me in the nose on the school bus. His parents got him help and it took some time, but he is going much better now. And I am sure if your son ends up having ADHD, with your support he will be just fine. Thank you, I hope so too! You are welcome. i have NF1 and it is often the cause of mental disabilities and disorders, myself included(OCD, ADHD, and ASD, and mental disorders) i would 100% look into testing for ADHD and ASD(autism spectrum disorder) based on what you said. they do not go away and it is better to start treatment and accommodations earlier in life rather than him hating himself for not doing good in school and socially without a known reason in the future Disabilities can show differently from kid to kid, different ages, environments, brains, and sexes all create different experiences. He could have more than one and they could be making him impulsive Yeah, tough is an understatement. Behavioral issues - short temper, explosive even. No tumors anywhere that we have found yet, fortunately. Social interaction is 3-4 years behind peers. Language is finally to a point where we can understand him a majority of the time. That took for-ever! He is great with video games and he is very loving. I would be open to video chatting with you and my wife and son sometime if you are interested. Good luck. A  So difficult to be in this situation as a parent!  No one else can tell you what is best for your child.  Yes, get expert opinions, but do what you feel is right.  The school system at both private and public schools here in the US told me that my son needed to be in special Ed.  I resisted because cognitively he is significantly above average.  He does have ADHD and social skills difficulties (even though he is ridiculously outgoing) but I knew that if he went into special Ed he would never catch up to his cognitive abilities.  (He also has physical challenges as he had bilateral optic gliomas, is no blind in one eye, and the chemo further deteriorated both his fine and gross motor skills.) But I can say that if I thought he was lagging cognitively I would have gladly welcomed the support of special Ed.  I am entirely confident that the schools he was in just did not want to put in the effort to deal with his behavioral struggles.  I felt especially confident in my assessment when 2 independent Neuro-psych Dr.s confirmed with their own assessments.  Bottom line-know what your boy needs and make it happen.  Maybe that is even to sit school out for the time being.  Because of chemo and surgeries my son was not in school til 5 years old.  All around I feel like I did the best I could for him. The Neuro psych evaluation did not show ASD?  Because if not, I would say some of the behaviors you are seeing may be temporary.  My lovely sweet boy went through about a 10 month long phase at about the same age where he thought hurting me was hysterically funny.  I did a lot of crying during that time, but it did not last.  Hope the same will be true for you! No, no ASD mentioned whatsoever. ADHD and Language Processing Disorder was brought up. It is strange, because the past few days he has been a joy, but the weekend he was a terror. We are going to start tracing his sleep patterns and food intake to see how that might play into everything. He hasnt been sleeping well. Hi there, my partner has NF 1, and linked in with that is autism. I am also autistic, have you possibly considered the idea of him being on the spectrum? This of course is meant with no offence! Because NF 1 can be associated with ASD! (Autism spectrum disorder) No offense taken at all! Yes ASD was considered when they did the Neuropsych evaluation but it was not flagged as a potential diagnosis by either his psychologist, the SEIT or the behavioral therapist. He is very sweet and social, has always kept eye contact etc. His social issues are more with kids his own age. He does fairly well with younger and older kids. But, who knows, maybe they will revisit ASD at a later time. Honestly revisiting will be so helpful. I am 21 and have only just been diagnosed. I could have had so much help during school, and my jobs I have had, but because no diagnosis they cannot physically give extra time in exams etc. It is soo worth looking back over. Because even at his age he could have learnt to mask! \nI hope you can figure out what is going on and I only wish you and your son the best :) Thank you! He is so little and diagnosing him properly is going to take some time. We will definitely revisit ASD throughout his childhood. Completely agree :) yeah that is probably best, and ofc you know him the best too! Good idea.  I know my son still (12 years old) is very affected by lack of sleep.  This has been true his whole life.  Without enough sleep he gets tantrums, crying jags, and is obstinate.   With the right amount of sleep he is a joy.  He is my only child so I cannot compare his reactions to a different child who gets the same amount of sleep.  But it is remarkable to see the change when he is tired.  At night if he stays up too late he gets CRAZY hyper.  Then the next day it will be all the stuff above.  I hope that is your answer because it is so easy to fix! It is crazy what a big difference proper sleep makes! My guy just started having sleep issues a few months ago. He goes to sleep fine, but wakes up every night. First it was around 1:30 (and he would go back to sleep around 3) and now he can go until 4am (but stays up after that). We are playing around with different melatonin dosages to see if we can get him (and ourselves) some more sleep! You can always try what I have always done with my cats:  lots of play shortly before (my) bedtime.  Works like a charm!  (And no. I am not comparing your boy with an animal!)  Or try a later bedtime if you have not already.  Heaven knows we need our sleep at least as badly as our little ones! So my son is only a bit older than yours, he will be four in February, and he also has NF1. We went through a rough stretch earlier this spring with similar behaviors, and I chalked it up partially to his age, and partially to the pandemic. At the time he was not attending his daycare preschool, and I think he really missed his friends and his old routine. He is been doing much better these last few months he was able to return to attending preschool. I am not saying your son does not need additional support, but I do think three is a challenging age anyway, not to mention in our current circumstances.", "How I found out I had Neurofibromatosis I am 25 years old and at 17 I received life changing news. I have had really bad pain since puberty.  It all started in 2010 when I woke up with pain in my abdomen which seemed like the pain I normally have, but it got worse so I had to go to the ER. It  took them hours to figure out what was wrong. Eventually they found out it was my appendix and when I went into surgery they got an answer to why my appendix was hard to find l. The surgery took longer than it was supposed to because they found a softball sized benign tumors attached to the muscle wall which was pushing my appendix out of the way. After that surgery it got the ball rolling and several tests later I was diagnosed with Neurofibromatosis 1. In my case It was a genetic mutation that happened at conception. They found hundreds of benign tumors all throughout my body. I do not know the official count because they stopped counting at 500. I have two brain tumors in my thalamus, a cluster of tumors wrapped around my lower spine and the rest are every where else. Because of the tumors putting pressure on my nerves I am in pain 24/7. On a good day I am a 6. What truly help keep me distracted from the pain is art and music. Last year after several ocular migraines I grew a black spot on my right eye that is most likely permanent. I have a surgery coming up on February 14th. The surgery hopefully will help regulate my pain.  I was diagnosed at 15, it is likely mine was also a genetic mutation, however there is a possibility that a distant cousin on my moms side of the family may have had it, which would mean a great or so grand parent was a carrier, but we do not know for sure as back then no one knew anything.\n\nI have had four surgeries, in 2001 I had a tumors removed on my lower right arm, in 2007 i hav tumors removed on my cervical spine that were crushing against it, in 2014 I had a cancerous tumor removed from my upper right leg, in 2018 I had a cancerous tumor removed from my upper right arm.\n\nI see my neurofibromatosis doctor at least 1-3 times a year and have yearly MRI. It looks like tumors have grown back on my cervical spine. I will be seeing my doctor on the 28th of this month in Chicago.\n\nI have pain as well, some days are better than others, but my pain medication helps with most of it. I do walk with a slight limp and going only sit and stand for certain periods of time. I need to be able to get up and move around and sit at any given moment.\n\nIt sucks, but I take it one day at a time  Just for the record: NF is a \"dominant\" disorder and therefore cannot be carried without being expressed. If your mother went through testing and came out clear, you would be a case of fresh mutation and the possible case you describe would have nothing to do with it whatsoever. \n\n\"Recessive\" disorders on the other hand requires both copies of a gene to be mutated and can therefore \"hide\" in otherwise healthy individuals.  She never got tested. My doctor who is well known in his field of neurofibromatosis is aware of the distant cousin possibility of there being a family history. It is brought up all the time. I am real versed in my own diagnosis  Out of curiosity who is your NF doctor? Dr. Tonsgard &gt;Ah, okay. When you said that he is well known in his field of Neurofibromatosis, it reminded me of my mums and I first NF doctor when we lived in Massachusetts. When we lived there, we had Doctor Korf, and although I was too young to really remember him, apparently he is brilliant.  That is cool. I have been seeing my NF doctor when he diagnosed me twenty years ago. He is been really good with me, especially back in the early days, we would have to drive two hours to see him from where I lived. My parents then heard from a family friend who is a heart surgeon at our local hospital that they had fired a new neurologist who is really good, so they thought I could start seeing him. I had a bunch of test and MRI scans done. When my local hospital reviewed the scans, they freaked out called my parents saying my leg needed to be amputated. Well my parents called Dr. Tonsgard in a panic, who told us come in and he would review the scans, he looked them over and said that I did not need to have my leg amputated. And that was over 15 years ago.\n\nI know at some point I am going to need a new doctor once he retires, but he always has residents who periodically show up during my appointments, so even once he does retire I am confident that he will leave me in good hands. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Dr Korf is THE foremost expert in NF1.  Yes he is! And when I was a kid, and lived in Massachusetts...mum and I saw him, because I was so young, I do not remember much about him...but I do remember those NF doctor visits that we had every year. Mostly because afterwards, mum would take me to FAO Schwarz, and I got to pick out a toy. \n\nWhen we moved back to Australia, and were finding our new NF doctor, mum did send him an email (dunno how she found it), and he did say he remembered us, which was kind of cool. That is very good to know! Yeah, it is", "Rant on NF I am a 27 year old female living in Midwestern United States. I have NF1 and for those of you who do not know what that is- it is a rare genetic disorder in which tumors can grow on nerve endings it can also impair eyesight and hearing... amongst other things. Most days I.dont think twice about this \"disease\"...but today it is really getting me down. I have always looked different...and only recently...id say since I turned 25.. I have cared less and less about how people saw me. But just because it does not affect me as much as it used to like when I was in high school does not mean that I am completely unaffected by people's words, judgements, and\u00a0 stares..\n\nI wish there was a cure for NF I wish there was something I could make all of my tumors go away. It is a catch-22 for me because without my unique condition I would not be who I am today but God damn it I would like to be entralked in.my iwn vanity every once in awhile.... hard to do when you look at yourself in the mirror and see bumpy skin. \n\nThis is me this is who I am. \n\nNF  Do not lose hope. They are closer to a cure every day. Research into CRISPR technology will allow for genetic editing in humans. Although the future results are muddied at best, we will be getting much better treatment in the future. \n Unfortunately there is nothing that can be done, I also have nf1, no facial tumors though. My biggest tumor is on my lower back and because of this I have never been able to wear pants that stay up. I also suffer from chronic pain and fatigue. Sometimes it can be rough, but at the end of the day we just have to make the best of our situation. If you, or anyone with Nf want to chat pm me. Also, there have been recent advances in nonsense suppression therapy. 20% of all Nf1 patients have a nonsense mutation causing the disease. Although Ataluren has mixed results for DMD and CF its much closer to being widely available as you can actually get it for DMD in Europe and there is a research clinic in Alabama looking at nonsense suppression in nf. \n\nI would guess we will likely see nonsense suppressors for nf on the market before CRISPR therapies.\n\nBut more imminent than either of these are MEK-inhibitors. Selumetinib has already had a successful phase 1 trial in human children at reducing plexiform volume and there are currently phase 2 trials ongoing for both plexiform in children and cutaneous neurofibromas in adults.  I am trying not to get my hopes up because so many fail in phase 2/3 trials but the fact that phase 1 was successful in humans rather than mice is exciting.  I am in the exact same position as you. I never cared much in highschool about what I had or how different I looked. It is only now that I have started to really feel it; and more so let the whole NF thing get me down. You just have to do you and not let anyone bring you down rather it be their stares, words, or anything else! No one's opinions matter except yours, if you accept yourself, forget anyone else and what they have to say or think.  It sucks having it. I am 33, but I learned when I was 15 that I had it. Doctors always believed I might have it, but test were always inconclusive. I also was born with a lazy right eye and also when I was 15 we learned I have high blood pressure, which can be caused by having nf, but there is also a family history of high blood pressure on my dads side. I also have a learning disability.\n\nSometimes the hardest part is being the only one in my family that has this condition. Neither of my parents or siblings have it. It is possible distant relative may have had it, but no one really know as back then no one knew anything about it.\n\nI have had three surges done. My last one turned out to be a cancerous tumor. My doctors are pretty sure they got all of the tumor. I just had eye long MRI scans done and I will be heading to Chicago to see my doctor who I have been seein for over 15 years. I am hoping all goes well, but according The the doctors here at my local hospital where I had my scans done. The doctor who read my MRI scans thinks the tumor in my right arm may be cancerous.\n\n", "Has anyone's parents here tried to use NF1 against you/as ammunition? (Could be triggering for some people) Its been a few weeks ever since my mother has said pretty hurtful things that relate to this condition such as the fact that when i was younger apparently my cognitive brain level was at half my age and therefore i dont know anything  (and stillapplies to this day when convenient) or that i was told \"you wont amount to anything because im clumsy and forgetful\" ( i read people here sometimes experience short term memory loss). Im just wondering how many people out there have to deal with asshole parents alongside this condition.", "MPNST treatment &amp; trials Hi all. My partner was recently diagnosed with MPNST, developed in an NF1 plexiform neurofibroma in her pelvis, so not operable. We are lucky enough to be in London, UK with a great team offering treatment, but of course because of the seriousness of MPNST, we have been doing a whole lot of research into potential clinical trials and other treatment options as well. Just wondering if there is others out there also doing the same thing who would be interested in comparing notes and divide and conquering? It is hard going, especially if you do not have a medical background! Or anyone that is previously gone through this that has some good tips, would be really grateful... Hello from Australia. \n\nI am sorry I have no experience about MPNST , but I wanted to guide you towards sci-hub and Libgen is you are not already familiar with them . I use a VPN when I access them. \n\nAs you will have probably notice, many papers on pubmed are locked by a paywall and you only have access to the abstract. Under the abstract title, you will see two numbers, the PMID and the DOI. Copy one of these and paste it into sci-hub  (  and click open. 95% of the times , it will unlock the paper. Try the DOI and if it does not word the PMID.  \n\nIf it does not open, you can go on ( and request it.\n\nSci-hub changes its URL regularly, when it happens, go on wikipedia  and in the info box, you will always see the current URL or (    \nWe have to do our own research because we cannot really afford to wait for changes in guidelines. It took 19 years for the MEK inhibitors to be approved, but first results were there since 2001. \n\nNow medical books and books on NF1, for that you need   . This is where I get all my medical books from, for me it is mainly oncology books, gut microbiome, metabolic diseases, neurology, genetics\n\nThe newest NF1 books is there. Just type \" neurofibromatosis\" and the Tadini book is listed amongst others.  A second group of books will be found with the key word \" neurofibromatoses\" (with an E at the end)   \nIt is better to go by a specific keyword or authors, because it is not a research engine like google but a database like a library .\n\nIn my research for what interests me (nutritional intervention) , MPNST does come up ( a researcher I follow, Prof Melone has published about curcumin and MPNST (  she is the director of the NF1 centre at Napoli , Italy.  \n\nThere is the annual CTF conference coming up next month, I am already enrolled as it will be virtual. This is a good place where you find out about where the research is going and first results. \n\n( \n\nat the bottom top the same page, you will see the archives for the past years and maybe find something to pursue there as well. \n\nCheck the YouTube channels of CTF and NF Network for the webinars. \n\nIn addition to all this, I wanted to tell you that I am in correspondence with a young woman who had an MPNST 8 years ago and is now going through IVF. So there are success stories . I have had two of these types of tumors, 2014 upper right leg and 2018 upper right arm. Both of mine were able to be removed. These tumors did cause a lot of pain and burning sensation. I am sorry that your partners is not able to be removed.\n\nIf you have any questions let me know. &gt;\n\nThank you so much, this is so helpful! Thank you so much for your response. Have you looked into any alternative therapies aside from chemo and radiation? I am assuming perhaps not, if thankfully your tumours were able to be removed... I have had no chemo or radiation. I was told that it could cause issues and actually make the cancerous tumors spread or come back stronger. The only way I would ever have chemo/radiation is if it became absolutely necessary. The surgeon surgically removed the cancerous tumors, so far it seems no new cancerous tumors have grown. I am not having any of the same type of pain I had when I did have cancerous tumors. \n\nIf you have any other tumors, please let me know. Thank you for the news in that last paragraph. My son, 20 was just recently diagnosed with MPNST, the tumor was in his foot, they amputated to just below the knee. He was fitted with a prosthetic and then less than a month later another tumor appeared making in not possible to wear the prosthetic. We then were told of a trial drug and tried that for two months today we found out that drug was not working. Next step is back to the surgeon to see if more surgery and possibly chemo or an oral med (I forget the name at the moment) are possibilities. This must be very scary for you all. \n\nI am sorry  the trial drug failed, and hopefully one of the next options on the table will be the one. \n\nWhilst you wait for the appointment with surgeon and oncologist, I wanted to draw your attention to a mice study which induced MPNST cell death in the animals treated with Calebin A, a polyphenol derived from turmeric. You are probably familiar with curcumin, but turmeric has several more active compounds. The study is here ( , and access without the paywall is here ( click on save if you want to download it.\n\nThe study also mentions EGCG, Epigallocatechin gallate, the main active compound of green tea. \n\nProf. Melone has been looking for several years at polyphenols as an adjuvant - not a substitution - to the management of NF1 and its complications. ( \n\nShe is the director of the NF1 centre in Naples, Italy, where dietary intervention is part of the services offered. \n\nMore studies to look at on curcumin here ( \n\nand a new compound that deserves a deeper look: sulforaphane,  mentioned in this paper (   called \"Neurofibromatosis: Molecular Pathogenesis and Natural Compounds as Potential Treatments \" (you need to scroll down table 1) . \n\nThe university of Minnesota is starting a trial soon on polyphenols ( not for MPNST but just to point out that this line of investigation is getting traction ) and Prof David Largaespada from the same university is investigating is there is a way to trigger the immune system to attack the MPNST cells by attaching a virus to them. This is a theory in its infancy, but the concept of the immune system and exploiting it, could be something worth looking into if this is something that can resonate with you. \n\nAt the June CTF  Global NF Conference, the verdict was drawn on the critical role of inflammation in NF1 patient and more specifically the T-cells. We are getting an understanding how the microenvironment  can influence tumour development. Again, early days and early days in research means 15 years.  It took 19 years from the first success for MEK inhibitor (MEKi) to become the first drug approved for Nf1. \n\nI presume one of the drug trialed was a MEKi or will probably be. There is  also the mTOR inhibitors to explore. In the figure in this paper ( you can see how many pathways are involved in the development of MPNST. Each of them can offer a chance of intervention. \n\nIn trials on mice , the combination of MEKi and mTORi combined was the most effective but too toxic to try in human, however mTOR is a nutrient-sensing pathway very responsive to diet, the polyphenols and the lack of protein. There are more than 600 paper on pubmed about mTOR inhibition with food, but this one ( explains the various compounds quite well. In addition to the polyphenols, the reduction of protein will slow mTOR down. So if your son was to be put on a MEKi, you could attempt to inhibit mTOR from the nutrient sensing angle, to try to inhibit both at the same time, one with drug one with a dietary intervention. \n\nTalk to your son's doctor if you plan to try to integrate or consider diet in between treatment and absolutely you **must** tell them during active treatment as some supplements  may interfere with chemotherapy  . Read as much as you want, but before  giving something in the form of supplements , not food, talk to the medical team. \n\nAnother compound that is getting a lot of attention when it comes to mTOR inhibition is sulforaphane -  which I already mentioned above - pubmed has close to 1900 papers on that. The brand most used in clinical trial is Avmacol. \n\nWhat I am trying to tell you is that in addition to the few drugs available, maybe you could look at the natural compounds. I understand it is not for everyone, I am just suggesting this possibility in the case it was something you had not thought about . \n\nin case there was any doubt, I am not a doctor, so always talk and listen to real doctor in real life. I am managing my  Nf1 with diet but I do not have a MPNST and I do not know if it could help your son. But I am a mother and if my son had MPNST I would want to know about this, at the very least, just to read a bit about it. \n\nBest wishes from Australia Thank you. Hello nylorac, \n\nI was thinking about you and was wondering how things have evolved for your son. I hope the surgeons were able to come forward with a plan . All the best We are doing and oral med and radiation.  They have recently changed his pain meds so things are relatively calm right now.  Thank you for thinking of us.", "PET scans Does anyone have any experience with having a PET scan post surgery. My husband who has NFI had a tumour removed last year (plexiform with early malignant changes)\n\nWe are worried about the radiation exposure especially worried it may cause the other plexiform tumours to become malignant.\n\nHe had the surgery in Canada and all his surgeons and NF specialists said he does not need a PET scan\n\nHowever we are in Australia and the NF specialists and oncologist here are recommending PET scans every 6 months.\n\nNot sure what to do. It is better to have it and not need it than die of cancer. I have been having at least 1 MRI every year for 2 decades so i would get the PET scan I had only 2 that were both pre and post radiation therapy for a form of neurofibroma sarcoma. It was not much different than any other CT scan other than getting the medication before the scan and I had to use a different bathroom than other people for a day or two due to the radioactive medication goes out in urine. He is getting 6 monthly MRI and in between 6 monthly x-rays but he is skipped some of the xrays. So supposed to be some kind of imaging every 3 months\n\nHe had a PET scan before the surgery which was completely normal. Which is also why the Canadian docs did not want to repeat it.\n\nBut the australian docs have a different PET scan protocol for NF where they do 3 scans and watch how the dye reacts in neurofibromas.\n\nSo maybe this different PET protocol will show something That Colorado thing is comforting to know!\n\nWe keep getting mixed opinions from docs so it is hard to decide. His aunt who is a family doc has had patients who have got cancer after the pet scans so she is very against it in someone like him. That Is good! MRI\u2019s are very safe as they do not have any radiation.\n\nPET Scans do and that is why we are reluctant to get it Our worry is it will cause cancer by radiating his other plexiform tumours. He Never got a diagnosis of cancer. Basically he had changed in the cells of the tumour but they do not really know it is significance, it could be early malignancy or benign Yes I think that is what it is called!\n\nThanks I think we will do that.", "New bed Hi NF friends! I tend to experience a lot of pain from being on the wrong mattress. My joints crack and swell a lot, and the pressure from the tumors sends my nerves into overdrive. I am looking to buy a new mattress and am wondering if anyone has had similar experiences or suggestions. I have a memory foam mattress I bought off of Amazon and I like it way better than my spring mattress. I bought a really firm one specifically designed for people with kyphoscoliosis  which I also have I love my memory foam off amazon too. Memory foam. I have been using one for years! I got one when I started wearing a back brace in middle school; the brace is gone but I cannot get rid of a sick a comfy mattress.\n\nThere are also foam toppers if you cannot afford a full one I bought this one off Amazon a while ago and it is been good for me. I also use a memory foam pillow, I believe the pillow is called my perfect pillow, I got that during Black Friday deals as stores like Carson\u2019s.\n\n", "POLL How Many tumors do you have ? I know it is already got posted a while ago by  (credit to him) but we are a bigger community now, so the result can be more diversified\n\n( Do not know, I know they are all over my body, some are large masses bunched together, other small and medium sized ones, Way more than I can count **hrmmm count, way more than i can.** \n\n*-MagJack*\n\n***\n\n\n\n^(Commands: 'opt out', 'delete') Yeah, it is cannot be hard to keep the count, I got a scan for my leg, to learn I have over 200 fibroma in it, but I got operated and it seems good for now\nI really hope they do not inconvenience you I have no idea because I have not gotten an mri since 2019 It is not too bad, I have pain medication and they were able to remove the cancerous tumors in my leg and arm. I just take things day by day. I have not been checked on since I was 18 and I am 37 now. The ones that I can see and feel I have about 15.

Those things are not cheap They are not cheep at all. I was going to get one at the end of 2020 never did I have not had one since like 2017 I did not even knew they counted those, they never did for me.\n\nI just check on a photo of my back i took not too long ago. On just a small section of my upper back, I counted 410. I still missed a bunch of them because the Quality is not great and you could tell something is 'there' but not if it is a fibroma or some discoloration.\n\nThe lower back is just as worse, as is my chest. I am guessing i am well over a thousand. Thankfully my case is extremely mild so I can get away with that but yeah MRI especially contrast are just so high it is not even worth it sometimes My back alone has nearly 300. That is by far the worst part of my body in terms of tumors. Worried about how bad it is going to get throughout my life as I am only in my 20\u2019s. I see a bleak future ahead of me. I found out a guy in my high school has NF after I did a report on it for biology. He mentioned it to me afterwords. He only suffers from bad eyesight, shorter stature, and cafe spots but never developed even one tumor. It is still crazy to me how widely it can vary from person to person. Does it hurt when you lay down??\nFor me its my right legs who got over 200 but they are mostly small\nWithout the scan I would not know they exist I think what \"grinds my gears\" as Peter Griffin would say is that surgery is generally considered elective. Unless a doctor signs off on it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat being said... NEVER, ever, never-ever use Black Salve to burn off tumors to save money. I had second degree burns on my neck from it. It could easily have destroyed my lymph-nodes. Mine are described as \u201cinnumerable\u201d on any MRI I get. Always a fun summary to read. He still could have gotten them later, no? I suffer from bad memory, I will have to ask my then girlfriend if I had any when we dated. I do not think I had as many as I do now. My face looked a lot more pristine, that I know. I send him a message and asked as we are still cool. He said he still has not grown any tumors but has an increasing amount of cherry angiomas compared to his early 20s. He also has a little hearing issues but is not sure if it is related to the NF or loud music when he was younger. He is one Lucky bastard.", "Can I still build up muscle despite having NF1? I have always had a skinny body with very weak muscles and motor skills, I have been told it can be caused by Neurofibromatosis Type 1 and I wanted to know if I could possibly ever build up strong and bigger muscles by working out? It is a bit embarrassing having to rely on other people to help with carrying things so I do not strain myself. It probably varies from person to person, but at different points in my life, I have managed to build up some muscle. I have never been particularly strong myself and my motor skills and coordination are not great but exercise has helped.  I am (was...since the past year I have not done much) more of  a distance runner than anything (probably because that does not require as much coordination, so I was more competitive with peers than in something like basketball or soccer). My muscle strength was/is more in the legs and core because of the running. In any case, if you are not a regular exerciser, it is always best to first check with a doctor and if you are doing any type of weight lifting, especially free weights, have someone there to help and spot you. Yes. Just so you know most athletes you see on TV are using a ton of supplements and other substances to get bigger. Do not compare yourself to them, it is just not a fair comparison. It is their full time 40 hour a week job to exercise and perform. \n\nIf you want muscle and mass you need to work for it. You need to eat for it. You need to sleep for it. You can accomplish quite a lot. \n\nI recommend simplesciencefitness.com as a place to start. I used to be the 135lb skinny kid and am in my 40s now with no negative effects from exercise.  Talk to me about anything involved. **I found links in your comment that were not hyperlinked:**\n\n* (\n\n*I did the honors for you.*\n\n***\n\n^( ^| ^( ^| ^&lt;3 Sure just eat correctly and work out and exercise and you can do it. I was 115 lbs the day I left for boot camp almost completed basic training but was medical discarded for a foot injury. That is beside the point but I left weighing 145 Lbs and it was sold muscle. 115 lbs is 52.21 kg Interesting. I always thought NF was a disqualifying condition for the service. Was not diagnosed until I was in my 30s Yes I am pretty build fuck people who say u cannot if u work hard and put in the time you will build mussle dm me if u want more info Neurofibromatosis condition varies in each person, it would be best to discuss this with your doctor or specialist. Everybody is different but I have NF1 and when I was on my college swim team I got pretty jacked. Keep in mind this was a 2 hour practice in pool M-F, with a 1 hr 45 min pool practice on Sat. Also 4 morning practices a week 2 in pool 2 in weight room for an 1hr 45 each. So obviously not a typical workout regimine. And I would use ome of those protein powder supplements after each workout. However I still believe if you get yourself set on a normal workout routine you could build some muscle. Again though I dont know how much NF1 varies person to person or how old you are, like I was pretty gangly till college, I think I was a late bloomer in terms of getting my muscle/testosterone. So maybe you are too. With NF1, we are blessed with so many manifestations in all type of organs, including muscles. \n\nIt has been discovered some of us have a lipid storage myopathy, which means, we store fat where we should not and typically this involves the muscles. Hence the weakness, poor muscle tone, the fatigue and so on. But do not despair, there is a solution. It is called L-Carnitine \n\nYou can read more here \n\n( \n\n( \n\nand if you go on this blog post (  at the very bottom , in the comments, one of the researcher posted a comment that says : \n\n\"My name is Matthew Summers, and I am the author of the myopathy study under discussion. I would just like to make a quick clarification about the blog post. You mentioned \u201cAfter six months, they tested both groups and found that the mice who had the enriched diet had 45 percent more grip strength and 71 percent LESS fat stored in cells.\u201d In actual fact we achieved these results after only 8-weeks (not 6 months), making them even more exciting.\" \n\nSince then they moved from mice to children and the study was successful. \n\nSo, have a look into L-Carnitine and since it is a cheap and safe supplement, why not give it a go.", "Tumor on tendion Any ever have a tumor on the Achilles tendon? I have one that is gotten really bad and I want to have it removed. Any idea how long recovery would be? Mine was not directly on the tendon but deep between the tibia/fibula. It was not very large. I got a few others out at the same time. I was homebound then walked with a cane a little for a couple weeks but was back to my desk job after. Still used a cane a while longer but not very long. \n\nIt was a more painful one. Pressing on it lightly was the worst of mine. Glad it is out. Might have been on the inside of the tendon. In 2014 I had a cancerous Neurofibromatosis plex tumor removed from my upper right leg. I was probably in the hospital about a week, maybe a little less and then about two weeks recovery at home resting. I never needed a cane or anything and was able to walk fine right after I woke up from the surgery. If you have questions, let me know.

I have always managed this with long term medication. Previously my other \"normal\" length leg compensates for the other when my back is bad. I do a pretty physical job, I am a psych nurse, so I am at times on the floor with patients, or restraint or on my feet for lengthy periods of time. \nYesterday my right side of my hip was bad, I assumed it was due to the cold weather, as it has been bad historically. I woke up this morning, hip improved but my left foot was painful on the sole, middle ish area and struggled to put pressure on, meaning walking was very painful, improves when I am not walking, but feels like I am standing on a blunted  pointy golf ball, if that makes sense. I spoke to the dr at work, he would never heard of NF, so not on to much of a winner with that. Anyone else experienced this with the same/similar complications from NF... or is it unrelated? Sounds like the pain I had with plantar fasciitis. But when I saw a 2nd foot doctor he said something about my ligaments being to loose and that was causing the foot pain because the ligaments were not holding it together. He said he had seen it in other NF patients but my genetics doctor does not see a connection. \n\nI kind of dealt with the pain with arch inserts and I think I eventually learned to carry my weight different because it does not hirt as much anymore. When was the last time you had a full body MRI?\nIf it has been more than a year I would schedule one right away. My husband had a similar symptom which lead to the discovery that he had NF1. It could be that a tumor is pinching some nerves in your leg or spine..", "Had my first round of chemo today in hopes to shrink my spinal tumors. I go every two weeks for 12 treatments. MRI's afterwards to see if there was a change in the size of the tumors.  Good luck hope everything's going to turn out good Good luck! If you do not mind me asking, which drug are you on? I took Avastin for a few years. Avastin Years?  Did it help? So, yes and no. I was the 2nd person with NF2 to be treated with Avastin. At that time, 2007ish, they did not know that eventually everyone needs to take a break after treatment, for a month or so. \n\nIn my case, it worked great for three years. Then my protein counts started to shoot up, I had to come off for a long time, and it did not work when they restarted it. They have learned a lot since then, so you should be able to be on it for a lot longer. Today was the first step, I still have a long road ahead of me, but I am staying positive. Thanks for the info I was on Avastin for my NF2 back around 2008-2010. It was still experimental for acoustic neuromas. But IT WORKED FOR ALL OF THEM!!!!\n\nAll my tumors stopped growing for 5y!\n\nIt really works. I had to take tons of Zofran and Aloxi on it, but I would be destroyed by now if I did not do it.\n\nI am starting it again soon to hopefully buy more time. But it really works. Hang in there. I have been on Avastin since Oct last year. The last MRI showed the tumors some were stable others a few mm smaller. Hope it does great on you.", "I was recently diagnosed with neurofibromas In December of my sophomore year of college I got an MRI because I was complaining of some pretty awful back and leg pain, I then found out I had a whole bunch of tumors in my lower spine and pelvis, I do not know the exact number, but there are probably around 30 ish but they are all fused to my spine and nerves. \nI get some pretty intense pain, and because of this I have had to leave school twice now, the second time being withdrawing completely from school. My only remedy to this pain is opiates and I take them for at least three months when I have a \"flare up\". This diagnosis has changed my.whole life and im honestly still lost to what the fuck to do. Thankfully my tumors have contained themselves to fucking up the inside of my body, but Im afraid I will get more tumors or growths on the outside of my body, I know it is vain but it is concerning.\nI also worry that with my constant exposure to opiates and the long use of them can be very dangerous of repeated.over and over, and I feel like I am destroying my organs.\n\n\n\n\nP$ I am sorry for format/ run on sentences, just had to write down what I have been thinking I hear you buddy, it can be rough, I to have them in my spine and a massive one on my leg I tried Opiates, I had a 75 mG patch of Fentynal and before that was on Opana neither worked for me, surprisingly Weed helped, and if you cannot do that try CBD oil, I use that (the vape pen no thc)and it still helps.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have the fibromas on the outside, luckily they are mostly on my torso I have a few on my head, I do not consider it being vain, people are not usually concerned why they just see them attached and it disgusts a lot of people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChances are you will not see to many appear outside your body if they already have not, according to my DRs, just keep your head up, they are also working on getting a drug FDA approved that helps reduce the size of tumors I do not recall the name on the top of my head. I have neurofibromas on the root nerves of my spine, my spine, my brain and a bunch of other places. I took opiates for a long time. 125mcg patch of fentanyl, plus percocet, amitriptyline, lyrica and a bunch of other things. I found they made me sick and caused a bunch of other problems. But I only found out 15 years after I started taking them and had to stop because I had no money to afford them.\n\nLyrica is great at managing nerve pain. It caused me to be kind of slow, but it helped a lot.\n\nNow I just do CBD and occasionally marijuana. A 1 to 1 combination of cbd to thc is effective. Are they able to do surgery to remove any of the tumors? I just had a big tumor removed that was fused with my spine.\n\nUnfortunately its not a cookie cutter diagnoses and we all experience different symptoms.I agree with the others and treat pain with CBD or marijuana. Opiates can cause a great deal of problems. \nThey can help I have been taking pain medication since 2006 or 2007, I take two different medication, twice a day, as long as you are responsible with it, it is possible to take them in a healthy way. I was diagnosed with Neurofibromatosis when I was 15. I am 36 now. I have tumors all throughout my body, since 2001 I have had four surgeries related to my Neurofibromatosis. If you have any questions, ask away. I try my best to be very careful with it but sometimes.i lose track of how many I have taken or what time and it gets confusing No surgery, they are localized to my lower spine and I guess if they were to get in there id be paralyzed I also smoke weed and it helps but not entirely Try take it them the same time every day, that is what I do with all my medications.

", "Shivers/spasms in NF Does anyone else with NF1 experience spontaneous, strong shivers/spasms (nearly my whole body shakes for a moment sometimes). These do not happen when I am cold and I have not been able to correlate any environmental circumstance to these, including sleep deprivation. The only other explanation I can think of is that they are a symptom related to anxiety, as they were most common during graduate school and have become a little less common (though my anxiety levels are still high, so...).\n\nMy suspicion turns to NF because I do not know others who experience these and it seems like it may be nerve related. I have tried to do research on this but have not found any information. I do not see, nor live (New Mexico) anywhere near NF specialists. The primary care doctors I have seen do not have much expertise and have just said they are uncertain what could cause them but not to worry about it--which is reassuring, I suppose, although I still want to know why it happens as they can be pretty annoying and people around me notice them. I get these, not sure if it is related to NF or not though. For sure more annoying than anything. I get them.  They are possible seizure related because they stopped with seizure related medication that I was taking for pain. My mom (with NF2) gets pretty intense spasms that usually coincide with pain. I have it happen from time to time. I sometimes get them, but honestly thought they were normal. I get them but only very minor ones. Thank you for the answer. It is definitely annoying, especially if others see them and ask what is going on. Maybe! But I have had people without NF tell me they never have them. Then again, my siblings with NF do not have them, so who knows? This is helpful advice. I will keep that in mind next time I go a doctor. At this point it is not so disruptive that I do not think I will need medication but if they are seizure related I will want to keep an eye on it. I hope your pain is relieved! I am sorry to hear that! Thank you for the additional data point! I am sorry you have to deal with them also. I am glad they are minor! Thank you for answering.

We held briefings for the house and the senate to ask for medical funding for NF the funding is run through a program called the CDMRP (Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program). \n\nWe need the support of the house and the senate to get the money for the research. It was this money that in the past helped create the first NF drug Selimetinib  which is close to getting FDA approval. \n\nPlease call your representatives and Senators and tell them to sign the NFRP (NF Research Program) through the CDMRP \u2018dear colleagues letter\u2019 in the 2021 appropriation period. Thanks.  I will do this, do you have any links to more info? Hey,\n\nIs this what you are talking about?\n\n Yes! Last year we asked for 15 million in funding and it was approved. In the pay we have typically always had the congressional support we need and the president will just sign because it is more money that technically gets friended to the DOD. It is a win win. People against more military funding like it because it is actually going to medical research. People who do like military funding like it because it is technically going to a military program. \n\nThis year we are asking for an additional 5 million, so we need any extra support we can get from the house and the senate. Ah okay - so you are talking about funding that will be approved ~11 months from now? The final step of the president signing it typically happens around December. This funding is for the 2021 fiscal year. But it need to go through the house for a vote and the senate for a vote before it makes it there. \n\nThe hose and senate will typically vote, from what I have heard, sometime in the summer or early fall. \n\nNext month is when most groups will start to lobby for these types of requests. \n\nAlso, if anyone happens to be in Wisconsin, only call Senator Ron Johnson. Every other legislator in the state actively works with the groups trying to get this funding and have all signed a \u2018Dear Colleague Letter\u2019 which is a very important step in getting the funding.  If you email his DC office, select \u2018Health\u2019 as the issue and mention the name Michael Weiss in the email. He is Johnson health staffer and oversees any health related issues.

Looking at Children find they have it and knowing what might be to come bus heartbreaking for me. Not long ago I met someone who also has NF and it is sad seeing the way it has negatively effected their life at a relatively young age. How is this illegal? There are scientists (probably all over the world) working on gene editing for this exact purpose. One of the many methods is called CRISPR. Gene therapy is hopefully something we will see in our lifetime. There are therapies that already exist that attempt to bridge this gap. Look at nonsense suppression or exon skipping for example. Still very new but may be coming to market in the next decade. I would only support as long as it was not used as a sort of prescreening to terminate a life.

I have undergone 27 brain surgeries, but it has not been stressful at all. I have a learning disability but was able to graduate college with a lot of hard work and studying.

When I was a baby I had eye surgery to try and repair my eye, but unfortunately it did not take and it is believed to be because of my Neurofibromatosis. \n\nI have never done anything to hide my eye. The only thing that was ever done that sort of covered it was done just to try and correct it. When I was in preschool I would wear a patch over my left eye to try to force my right eye to correct itself. I just remember the kids wondering why I had to wear it sometimes, but none of them were ever mean about it or anything. Not disfigurement or loss, but I know all too well about sight loss.

Fortunately, I suffer from no disfigurements of the eye or major issues. I have strabismus, astigmatism, and pretty crap eyes in general. My prescription is pretty strong but luckily brings my vision back to near normal (about 20/60 compared to 20/600 without glasses.)

My mom who does not have Neurofibromatosis, she was born with a lazy eye, but when she was very young she had surgery and it was corrected. When I was a baby I had surgery, but they were not able to correct mine.

I had eye surgery probably in 84-85 and then around 1999-2000 is when I was told the surgery from back when I was little did not take likely due to me having Neurofibromatosis.

Wanted to introduce myself a little Hi all,\n\nCannot believe it took me this long to find this subreddit.  I am 22, turning 23 in a week, and a senior in college.  Was diagnosed with NF type 1 when I was one year old, so I have lived knowing I have had NF just about my entire life.  The disorder has affected me in multiple ways.  For example, my balance really is not that good.  I have a few small Neurofibromas here and there, most of which I just live with.  Had one taken off my foot when I was a baby (which is what allowed me to be diagnosed with NF), and then another removed from my left hand when I was 15.  I have countless others, that I have not gotten removed, mostly as they do not bother me enough to undergo another surgery, but also because of fear of nerve damage (almost had one removed from the back of my left knee when I was nine, but the doctor recommended that we should not after an MRI).\n\nThe most traumatic thing NF has put me through, however, was shortly after my 12th birthday.  The doctors found three astrocytomas in my brain and I was rushed into the hospital for emergency surgery to get the largest of them removed.  Complications arised, including a staph infection and need for two shunts, and I spent a good three and a half weeks in the hospital.  I then had to go back a few more times that summer for follow up surgeries.  Two years later, another astrocytoma started to grow, so I went back to get that tumor removed as well.  However, that surgery was not nearly as traumatic as the previous brain tumor removal.  I have had a few small follow up surgeries since, but they were all smaller things, such as a shunt revision or two.\n\nAnyways, just wanted to introduce myself and say that I am glad I found this place.

Luckily I came across this sub. I have asked doctors and NF Specialists, but have always been told that they were not sure. I have NF1, the main side effect is an optic glioma. I only have partial vision out of my right eye, and no vision out of my left eye. Just curious what y\u2019alls take is, and if anyone on this sub has claimed it as a disability on job applications. I do just to be on the safe side I live in the United States. I do not recall seeing this particular question on any application I have ever filled out for a job.   I have seen  questions about needing accommodations on the job.  At the moment my NF does not have anything that would affect any job I have had so far.  So there is no need for me to disclose anything about having NF.  \n\n\nI think overall my health is my business and an employer only needs to know about an issue if  it will affect possibly my performance on the job.  \n\nNot knowing what jobs you are talking about it is tough to say if you should disclose or not.   I also worry about discrimination when applying for jobs.  Employers do not always want some one with health issues as it can cost the company money ( insurance cost,  a person needing time off,  accommodations).   \n\nKnow the disability laws where you live.  And what employers are allowed and not allowed to ask. It effects everyone differently. It just depends how it effects the individual person. However there most likely will not a question on a job application regarding disables or medical related condition as least here in the United States. There however may be a question about accommodation that an individual would need to help preform the job requirements.\n\nMine effects me a lot, I have problems standing for long periods or time as well as sitting. It need to be able to get up and move around when needed. It does help to keep them elevated. I have a limit to what I can lift. My balance has gotten worse over the years. I cannot go on ladders anymore. My left leg does give out and recently I have fallen a couple of times. I have pain throughout the day, thankfully my pain medication helps with most of it. In both 2014 and 2018 I had cancerous tumors both of which were causing severe pain, thankful once they were removed that type of pain went away. Since last October I have had a strange warming sensation in my right foot, most of the time my foot feels numb, this has not changed at all. According to my last MRI scans I do have tumors that have grown back on the back of my neck, but they are not pressing against my spinal cord like they were in late 2006. If it effects your vision, I would consider it a disability. in the US it is against the law to discriminate based on disability.  This is not a question that would be asked on an application. In the UK it is sometimes asked about disability in relation to the employer offering guaranteed interviews to disabled applicants who meet the application criteria. They might ask about disabilities so they can make adjustments to interview. It is all separate to the equal opportunities form you might have to fill in. My NF causes me no disability. In your case, it is not the NF that is your disability, but your vision impairment. It is only a disability if you cannot do something every one else can, or can only do it with special accommodations. A lot of applications do have \"voluntary self-identification/disclosure\", but I do not remember the exact purpose. I always hesitate when I answer it, mostly fearing it is more likely to hurt me, legal or not.", "24M Neurofibromatosis 1 here , I have a question about sexual relationship. Hello to whoever is reading this. My name is Nash and i have been diagnosed with NF1 when i was about 1   I am lucky enought to be one of the least severe case in my province in Canada , all my neurofibromas havent grown in size at all and Im in perfect health.\n\nIve never been in a relation before so Im kind of lost about a lot of thing. So as far as I know the gene for NF1 is hereditary wich means my kids will have it , I know there are some medical way / procedure of countering the gene with artificial insimenation but I dont know if there is still a risk. So I have two question.\n\n\nLets say my girlfriend and I have unprotected sex , she is on the pill and I ejaculate inside her , could that transfer the gene to her and make her have the NF1 gene that she would give to her child ? Should I always wear a comdon because of NF1 ?\n\nMy other question is even with artificial insemination is there a risk that the gene develops into the diseas for my child or my wife ?\n\nThank you in advance. You cannot transmit NF1 to your girlfriend.\n\nIf you guys conceive without IVF, there is a 50% chance that the baby will get NF1. You can only get NF hereditarily or through a mutation in your genes. You can only be born with it. It is 50/50 for passing it on to your children. If you do decide to have children, and they are born with NF, they will have a wonderful parent that can help them and will understand them through their NF journey. You can screen for it iirc NF is a genetic disease, dumping your genetic load into your partner will not give them your genes. You cannot give it to your girlfriend. It would only be passed on to your children, it is about a 50% chance of passing Neurofibromatosis on to them. You should also be aware that while you may have a less severe case of it that does not guarantee your children will be born with a less severe case. Neurofibromatosis effects everyone differently. NF is not contagious, it is however passibable to your children. 50% they will have it... As someone above me in this thread has said Also, I do not mean this to come off as condescending at all, but I know Sex Ed in a lot of places is fucking terrible, but it seems like you have some confusion about the difference between genetic conditions passed through reproduction and STIs, which are passed through sex.

I know people are going through worse but this is really making me go into a dark depressed state and I am not sure how to handle this well. I am so sorry that you are having to deal with this. It is totally understandable and valid and important for you to be upset, do not be surprised if you end up going through the different stages of grief. I do not know if this is appropriate, but maybe doing some family sign language would be good so that you guys have a solid base of sign language so that if you need it in the future it is already there. And if hopefully you do not need it, you will still have a cool way to communicate with your kids! I was suggested learning sign language when I was first diagnosed. Think I did not want to acknowledge the possibility so just put it off. My wife already knows some sign language. She is been preparing for the possibility better then me. Lol smh. With my kids though it may be a fun new activity rather then the chore I seem to look at it as. Thank you for taking the time to talk to me. I am sorry you are losing your hearing.

Hope not and I wish you the best. \nIn have my son on NF1. \nIt is amazing all you ppl how strong you are comparing to us having \"problems\". Your story is similar to mine but different in one key way--I was diagnosed much earlier and my whole life has been framed in terms of \"the future likelihood of deafness.\" I have recently found a bit of relief from tinnitus with EFT. I know it is unsolicited, but here is a place to start if you are curious:  I also have NF2. I lost my hearing when I was sixteen, due to two different radiation therapies on both vestibular schwannomas. My hearing loss is very profound.\n\n  \n\n\nSince then, I have gotten both my bachelor's and master's in game design and development. I speak three languages and program in many more (one of which is Japanese, which I learned AFTER my hearing loss). While getting my bachelor's, I did not even have any transcriptions of sorts. I only had instructor notes or PowerPoints. I pretty much taught myself both my degrees because I would go to class and sit in proverbial silence.\n\n  \n\n\nWhy am I saying all of this? Because hearing loss, while a huge pain in the ass, is manageable for us. You learn how to adapt to it. The only thing we cannot do as deaf people is hear.\n\n  \n\n\nAssuming you have not already, you can look into Avastin. It did not shrink my tumors but made my hearing a little better for a little while (but not by much). Alternatively, try looking into Selumetinib clinical trials. Cincinnati is currently looking nf2 participants for that and, if it works anywhere near as well as it does for Nf1, your tumors could shrink by thirty percent. I myself cannot take it however, as I was on Avastin for five years and it damaged my kidneys.\n\n  \n\n\nFor more immediate accessibility, I recommend Google's Live Transcribe app on the play store. I use it religiously and it is like having subtitles IRL. Hearing aids for us can help, too. Mine do not help much but they are better than nothing. I get recommendations for implants all the time but that is too invasive for my liking.\n\n  \n\n\nOut of curiosity, where was your cyber knife treatment issued to? This was very motivating. Congrats on all your accomplishments. This is how I want to adapt and fight this NF2 fight. My cyber knife treatment was done at Virginia Hospital Center. Thanks! It is been a long road and I am hardly done.\n\n  \n\n\nSorry, I mean what was cyber knife done on? Your vestibular schwannomas? Oh yeah exactly vestibular Schwannoma on my right side. \n\nHad all except one surgery at NIH in Maryland. \n\nSome Drs. Have recommended to look into Avastin also.  I would read about the trials and things on it for awhile but shyed away from it since having kids. \nI am very weary of trial type treatments since I have kids now. It is understandable. Trials are a big step.\n\n  \n\n\nIf you do end up doing Avastin... If I could go back I probably would not do it more than two years. Everyone is different but with my kidneys being agitated it limits what other medications I can safely take. Everyone is different though.\n\n  \n\n\nMost trials are for efficacy and have already been evaluated for safety. Selumetinib, for example. It is still a risk like anything else but it is not like you would be going in completely blind. It is something to think about.", "Anyone have tattoos? Hello! :-) I was wondering if any of you guys have tattoos? I have wanted to get one but I am too scared and have not asked my specialist. I am covered with neurofibromas  head to toe unfortunately. There is small gaps between my body but it would not be enough to get the tattoo I want. Thank you I do not. I would never want to pay for pain, especially when I already live with pain. Plus over time tattoos can start to look faded and then they can start to sag with body changes, a surgery in the future could need to be done where the tattoo is and that would likely ruin it. Just does not seem worth the cost to me. I have two large tattoos. No issues with them. I have two\u2026.One small and one larger and did not have any problems\u2026planning for a couple more next year\u2026I have just tried to place them where I do not have any fibromas\u2026but from what I have heard, it does not cause a lot of issues if you tattoo over one I do not as I am scared of needles and pain. But I have seen some very cleaver ones which make neurofibroma\u2019s disappear into it. 25F here. I have a half sleeve. A back piece and I am getting two more in the next year. I love all my pieces and they represent who I have been in a certain seasons in my life. I only have a couple fibromas and not near the tattoo but I am sure a good artist would not have an issue. I have 10 biggest is my chest to \u2018cover\u2019 my pectus excavatum Awesome , I hope to get one soon :-) That is great to hear! I am hopeful it will be the same for me.  Thanks:) Yeah I am scared too and just been overthinking this whole situation. Also yes! I have heard of that as well. Might be interesting! Oh sweet! Yeah, I think what I will do is look around and ask the artist if they have experience with it too. I am in Canada but willing to go somewhere else for it. Just as soon as covid restrictions here ease off a bit. They started up again. I understand,  yeah it can be painful for sure. Depending on the situation too. I am still looking into it further and will go from there. Thanks! You are welcome No issues with my tattoo here. The only thing would be planning it as far out from your next MRI as possible. The black ink usually has metal in it, and can cause burning. I have one, did not have any issues with it and do not to this day I plan on getting more to cover the NF patches and fibromas  in the future If someone really wants the tattoo, then the pain is worth it to them. I have 15 tats one on a bump and nothing bad has happened so far I got it done close to two years ago That is good to hear :-) Now I am getting more pumped about looking into getting one on my arm. Nice! \ud83d\ude00 That is dope!! I have 5. 3 in black ink 2 in white. No problems at all. Sweet \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude0e I have two tattoos, however none around the tumors. I have 8. Nice \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude4c I have 11 or 12 tattoos. They just have to go around the tumors. I have one very large one and it goes over a smaller fibroma at one point. I have 1 tattoo right now. I would like more. Awesome:)", "not knowing is the hardest part... I will try to make this short. I am a 17 year old girl with NF1. I have cafe-au-lait spots pretty much all over my body but the worst ones are on my neck and torso. I used to be kind of self-conscious about them, but they do not really bother me anymore. I have a few plexiform tumors that are kind of painful that the doctor cannot remove due to the risk of significant nerve damage. Thankfully they mostly only hurt when hit or bumped against something. I would say I have things pretty lucky, and I am so grateful for that, but what scares me is how unpredictable the disease is. I have passed the whole \"puberty\" stage so I guess i am out of the woods in regards to the major changes that typically come with that. but, again, the disease is unpredictable and plenty of people have said they had many new growths into their 20's. So I guess what I am getting at here is that its so scary not knowing... that 2 years from now i could possibly have my face become completely disfigured or i could become physically disabled... i have been thinking about it a lot lately and psyching myself out. is anyone else experiencing this and how do you deal with it? thank you so much for taking the time to read", "Neurofibromatosis and cannabis I do not get high after smokimg weed, in anyway is it possible that it is because of me having neurofibromatosis TYPE 1? Do people w NF1 do not get high? People with nf get high. Maybe you had dirt weed, did not smoke it right, or enough. I have NF1 and I have gotten high multiple times (I do not smoke weed that much though). Last time I did not really get that high because it was a bad batch my cousin said. \n\nBut maybe you are not getting high because you are not smoking it right, not enough, or it is a bad batch. Weed affects everyone differently. Thanks a lot for the info Np, good luck! Okay thanks a lot Sorry, but having Neurofibromatosis does not mean you do not get high. That is just silly. It is more likely you just have a high tolerance. Oh okay thanks, lmao im so dumb nah i get high especially from eddibles no you are not its an understandable question.  ive been drinking for 12 years never massively but never had a hang over and i use to think it was my nf too hahaha Totally get high nf1 , I use edibles .. 1 10mg edible is good enough for me I wish 10mg was enough for me\ud83d\ude02 NF1 people are using cannabis can you tell me its benefits and side-effects with a NF1 focus?

I want to know if there is any hope for a future cure? Are there any trials or something going on?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks I am not really sure of what is going on at the clinical front, but I am studying NF1 for my upcoming thesis (at a cellular level) and there are a lot of studies being done all across the board. Going on Google Scholar and searching for NF might help to give you an idea of the research being done right now. I think that along the sidebar there is an option to choose \"clinical\" or something to narrow down the research papers to only ones regarding treatment options. I would try doing that and narrowing down the date range to 2018-2019 to find potential trials. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRegarding hope- there is always hope. There are tons of researchers all across the globe dedicating loads of time effort to understanding this condition inside and out in order to find a cure! We do not know a ton about the biochemical mechanisms that encompass the condition, but are trying to learn everything that we can. The first step to defeating the monster is to understand the beast- it is motivations, methods, etc. I think that we live in the era that will see a cure, or at least the development of an effective treatment. My brother and niece both have NF1 as well, so it is a topic that I hold close to my heart. That is Selumetinib, right? There are a number of trials going on that are showing 20-40% tumor shrinkage. My doctor is going to try to get me into one of them. That is really cool! I had a plexiform tumor removed from my cervical spine back in 2002 at age 4 and boy was that a rough time. Glad there are advancements being made so people do not have to go through the suffering I experienced. I luckily do not remember much of recovery (apart from the oral pain medication that tasted like banana flavoured candies), all I really remember well is the massive migraines and temporarily losing control of my forearms (my family tells me I looked like a t-rex haha) I had before surgery. It was definitely nowhere near my spinal fusion surgery though haha.", "Bladder retention? I am just curious if anyone else here has experienced bladder retention/inability to urinate.", "surges questions I have 3 tumors I really want gone, one of them being underneath my hair would I need to shave my head for that? I am fine if I have too, as I have always wanted to try shaving my head but I havent had the courage to do so with my tumor :/\n\nAlso, have any of you had one in a *very intimate* area? I am thankful my fiance does not really mind, but I am tired of feeling ugly about them. I think you would need to shave your head.  I had some brain tumors taken out when I was 12 and then 14 and had my head shaved. Had to wear a hat for a while, but it grew back pretty quickly.\n\nI had a few small lumps above my groin that I am sure no one else even notices, but they are there.\n\nAnd I did have a neurofibroma removed from my left buttock back in December.  I am not sure if you could see it, but it hurt like hell.  And my butt was huge and inflamed afterwards, which I did feel very self conscious about. Depending on spacing, location, etc. they will definitely shave *parts* of your scalp.  Talk to a dermatologist who is experienced in that subject tp see if yours are candidates for removal. They bleed like a faucet fyi. They will need a cauterization tool. I have one on my penis that my neurosurgeon said I would have to get a urologist to do. But I did just get one right up the thigh into the groin removed. Still kind of sore (it was 3 weeks ago and I got several cut out) but so far I am happy with the decision.  I have had a few small fibromas removed from my scalp.  I did not need to shave any part of my head, my dermatologist cut out the fibromas.  Funny enough, I got an under cut a year later and had it shaved for about 2 years lol.   I would describe this one as the size of half of a lime, while not HUGE, it is not nessarily small/tiny either.  I have one on the side of my head that shows unless I have it cut with scissors. I used to have it cut with a guard and clippers. They will shave the area around it but will not shave your whole head. I had a rather large one removed when I was in 7th grade. It was found by the lady who cut my hair. The docs wanted it gone. I did not realize how big it was and the surgery left a scare that starts on my neck and wraps around the back of head. The scar is about a 1/4 wide and very noticeable. If the fibroma is small the scar will be small and will probably be covered if you have your hair longer than roughly a 4-5 guard.", "SO close to meeting our goal to help Jimmy Powers, my friend's 2 year-old living with NF1.

Google image search on cafe au lait spots gives a good representation of them, my son has several. Usually there are bigger, no?

Particularly, I have one on one of my breasts and hate it so much. I really want to get it removed. Anyone else have experience with this?  I (27F) had electrodesiccation to remove all of my small bumps front-to-back (about 70 in total) for cosmetics reasons, about a dozen of which were on my chest and breasts. I had it done in October 2020, and now, nearly every one is a flat, white scar. The ones on my chest healed in a few months, which is faster than the rest of the bumps removed on body. My insurance also covered the procedure since my plastic surgeon coded it correctly. While it sounds like a lot of bumps, my NF is really mild, and after the surgery, it does not look like I have NF at all. Your experience finding a doctor and coverage may vary of course. If you had more specific questions, I am happy to chat over DM. Yes! I will DM you. Thanks I had one recently removed on my shoulder about half inch in diameter. You could even see it when I wore a shirt. I hated it. I am so glad I got it removed. Did you have any particular questions about it? How much did it cost to get it removed? I realize it wildly varies from person to person but I am about to lose my health insurance soon (not even sure if my basic plan would have covered it anyway) but I am wondering how expensive it would be to pay out of pocket? Mine are small but I have at least 4 I want removed. My insurance covered so I am not sure of the price. Tell your doctor that they hurt and it should be covered by your insurance. Just do not tell them it is cosmetic. Oh yeah. Loads of them. I had a couple in my face when I was younger and they were still rare to pop up. They were also quite noticable. Got them removed quite easily.\n\nI even got one removed that was right next to my nipple. And I do mean right next to. Got it removed because I feared it might grow too large and damage that area, and because it looked like I had three nipples lol.\n\nIn retrospect, If I had a guarantee it would stop growing i would have let it stay there because it looked funny as hell.\n\nIf you are in the position to do so (financially), you should really consider doing it. If you worry about scars, they will be tiny. You can get them get lasered away too. Elektrowhatchamacallit or something.\n\n I cannot answer how much it cost for me because I forget and I live in a country with social healthcare so the cost is already low. I do not have NF1, but my husband and daughter do. I made my husband promise that we will get any bumps removed that she wants for cosmetic reasons. She is only 4 right now so it is not an issue. 28M had a large one removed from my chest wall which was partially cosmetic and partly because if someone accidentally bumped me id would cause severe pain. i currently have one behind my eye which makes it droop and makes me look light a bit of a stroke victim.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nif you can get it removed without causing other health issues id say get it done. Just make sure you have a good surgeon because having a scar is another issue, luckily mine is not that noticeable even though its big. I have only had one lump removed for cosmetic reasons, it turned out to be a lipoma not a fibroma, unfortunately it is starting to grow back now a few years later, so I will probably need it removed again at some point. \n\nIt is on my back and so ugly and big I cannot take my top off in public. Even at the beach I had one removed from near my belly button when I was 18. Purely cosmetic. Did it ever grow back? And did you go through a hospital or private clinic? It did not grow back. I think just a private plastic surgeon. It was done at an outpatient surgical center. I had three cut out. Grape sized on my forearm, Cherry sized on my shoulder and a pea sized one on my thigh. Worth it to me but they did scar pretty badly. \n\nI have since found a surgeon in Dallas who specializes in removing fibromas. While getting a consult for electrodessication, she saw the scars on the other ones and informed me the reason it healed so poorly is bc the skin over fibromas does not heal like normal skin. So you have to stitch it up differently. Cool! Thank you for sharing I have one near my nipple too and it looks like what you just described! I desperately want it gone so I am looking at plastic surgeons and am willing to pay what it takes. Glad you were able to get them taken care of! I have had about 15 removed from one breast (I have mosaic so it is all on the same nerve pathway) and now I have 15 flat, round scars. They are only slightly less noticeable but I feel like they draw far fewer questions when I am in a swimsuit than the tumors did.  They were all covered by insurance because they itched occasionally and they rubbed on my bra, causing irritation. My dermatologist handled it in his office under local anesthetic, and I believe he biopsied at least a couple of them to make sure nothing was turning cancerous.\n\nIf I had to do it over, I would have them all removed in one long line instead of in little tiny circles, only because I feel like one scar is less strange than 15 tiny circle-scars. (Mine were all fairly close together). \n\nGood luck! I got mine removed by a dermatologist and it really is tiny, but maybe a plastic surgeon can guarantee an even smaller scar. Yes. Numerous tumors removed. I have had them removed from my face, neck and arms. I have five removed which was covered by insurance and the doc was nice enough to code them so that I would not have to pay out of my pockets.\n\nI do not feel any pain anymore but they did leave a scar which you can find in my history.\n\nI am due for another visit because my last appointment was cancelled due to covid and because it is not considered an essential life and death surgery No, given that most of the time insurance will not cover it for cosmetic reasons and the difficultly of removing these tumors, by specialist will only have me have them removed if they become problematic or to prevent a problem in the future. I have tumors all throughout by body, the biggest one in my right upper leg. I had this too and had mine removed. Best choice I made! It was covered for me which was nice. But I would have paid for every single bump I did not like. Good to know! I am getting a consultation with a plastic surgeon soon so I am really hoping it works out. Unfortunately I do not have insurance but I am willing to pay out of pocket. Do you remember how much you paid for ones that were not covered through insurance? I live in Canada so all of mine have fortunately been covered by insurance What country are you in? Was it covered by your private insurance, or your provinces health insurance? I live in the US - I go to Northwestern Hospital in downtown Chicago Provinces health insurance! Since the NF is considered a disability or medical conaition (I forget the classification)\n\nBut if I needed drugs for it I believe that would be out of pocket. I have no personal insurance. I apologize being late to the party. I just discovered the Reddit group. I am glad I did. I had a patch of red soft skin on top of my shoulder. I had it most of my life and was self conscious about it. It irritated me sometimes when I put on a backpack. I hated going shirtless. I had plastic surgery done and now I have smooth scar and I am okay with it. I rather people see me with a scar. I made sure it was coded correctly. I actually go in 2 weeks for some bumps on the back of my head removed", "Koselugo (Selumetinib) and acne Hi all,\n\nI have been taking this for a month now and so far I have been getting ton of acne on the face back and chest areas. It was expected but I want to see if anyone is experiencing similar symptoms. What are you guys using for acne. My doctor just prescribe Clindamycin Gel. I hope this will works. I do not like the look on my face. I got acme. I started the medication back in June, after after about   two weeks or so the acme started. My doctor prescribed me Tretinoin 0.025% Cream 20gm. It was also recommended I get a lotion and face cleansers, I was told to get Vanicream Moisturizing Lotion and Vanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser. All three helped keep control of it and probably around late September I stopped having as bad of acme. Thanks for the reply. Have your tumor(s) shrunk? I cannot confirm 100%, as I have not had any MRIs or xrays. My doctor told me they usually see shrinkage around 6-8 months, but I do feel like I have had some of my tumor shrink. Yep. I get super bad acne if I do not take the medication and use the the topical cream. If I do both those it stays under control. I have my 1 year MRI next month so I will know how well it is working then I also got some gnarly acne form rash one month into using a MEK inhibitor (mirdametinib), and my doctor prescribed me clindamycin gel and a course of doxycycline. The rash has definitely calmed down, but my face has not been the same since :\u2019(. I am working with a dermatologist and trying different topical agents to help with the remaining/recurrent rash on my face. Now I am scared about the acne. It will not stop? How many mg are you taking a day? Mirdametiib is a little different than Selumetinib. (It is still in clinical trials.) \n\nI am on 4mg twice daily. \n\nBut I have never had acne in my pubescent years, so I guess I had to live out the acne life at some point in my life. hehhh :'). hopefully the mek inhibitor works (only been only it for a few months).\n\nAlso, remember to moisturize! Your skin turns so dry. Doxycyclene works well. Try to also keep your skin hydrated with a non pore blocking product. My oncologist prescribed steroid creams. I started seeing a dermatologist a couple of months ago and she was a bit alarmed that I had been using betamethasone cream on my face, but I got to say it was extremely effective at reducing the acne early on. I am talking an order of magnitude reduction in spots over about two weeks. And actually I have not had to do much at all for my face (other than moisturise) in the past four or five months, apart from one outbreak of acne a month ago that needed a bit of clindamycin for a few days. Bleach baths 2-3 times a week.  1/4 - 1/2 C bleach in a tub and soak for 15 minutes.  This is roughly equal to the strength of a public pool.\n\nNot sure when it comes to the face how to treat it.  My doc put me on Doxycycline as a preventative measure for outbreaks on the skin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeep the skin moist with a lotion.  Avoid lotions with a lot of preservatives.  For now I am planning on using aloe vera natural without any alcohol, dye or perfumes.

In both 2014 and 2018 I had peripheral nerve sheath that were causing a lot of pain that would wake me up in the middle of the night and would prevent me from doing things I enjoy. In my case they were both cancerous, but after I had surgery to remove them, I was fine right away. I was up walking around hours after both and that pain I was having was gone. That is very encouraging. I have been told these are benign so far but am hoping to have a better understanding after the 17th ( my neurosurgeon appt ). Thank you. You are welcome.

Or talks with the heads of your company about your situation? I have not looked into outside insurance yet. Going To have to wait another year for that. I have a network exception in with HR and the insurance, but not holding my breath for 6-8 weeks and have it denied. I am scared to play surgeon roulette. West Virginia is not particularly flush with quality surgeons. Maybe I will search for a new job. I hear that, years ago when I was in high school. This surgeon had told my parents he was familiar with Neurofibromatosis and had done surgeries before. Turns out he lied, after my surgery he told my mom he would never do a surgery on me again. He had no clue how difficult it would be. For six months my arm would turn a shade of green. It eventually went away and all was okay, but my dad was not happy that he lied to us.\n\nSince then I have had my three other surgeries done in Chicago, but surgeons recommended by my Neurofibromatosis specialist. The only reason we did not do my first one there was because we lived about two hours away and wanted to be closer to home.  \n\nI did however have an issue with my last surgery in 2018 with my insurance that was out of network. They did not want to pay and this was for a cancerous nf tumor. Thankfully my primary doctor at home and the Chicago hospital all had my back and we were able to appeal the decision from my insurance, which mine was through Medicaid. I do not know if you would be able to appeal the decision with your works insurance, but I would look into it, especially if your doctors will help plead your case. Thank you so much. That gives me hope, considering I work for a big hospital system and consequently the insurance is the company itself. The HR benefits team itself is the insurer. Attached to the network exception the surgeon also gave them my personal 20 page patient summary since 2015. Hopefully that factors in, so they consider how vital these doctors are. I wish you the best of luck. Hate to hear about this. I hope you find the insurance you need, do not want to get political but Medicare for all! No matter wherever, whenever you should get the care you need. I agree. But I would be fine with just small steps, at very least get rid of networks. I hate them so much. I really wish you can get the surgery you need on time! Call your insurance company and ask for a \"case manager.\" Then try 5o get your JH doctors to do a peer-to-peer with your insurance company doctors to explain the necessity of their procedures and care. I had some trouble with my nf doctor being listed out of network. My husband was able to put in an appeal to them and they made a special exception because it was rare Contact the Social Worker at the hospital. There may be funds donated  for cases like yours. I see him too. He is great! I am glad I can see him Can confirm peer to peer is the way to go, my insurance tried to deny me MRIs and CTs, because \"I already had one last year, and do not need another one medically speaking\". I got the referral number, case number, and the agents extension. Called my doctors office and asked them to do a peer to peer. A day later it was approved. \n\nIt is gotten to the point that I have play messenger between insurance and the 6-7 doctors/specialists I have to see. It is always fun to ask for a print out of my medical records, and take them with me everywhere. Yup. Likewise but my last scans (before last month's) were 6 years prior I mean I could understand the confusion there. Do you also sleep in \"the cage\"? I certainly have. I used to pretend I was playing asteroids when I was a kid My son is also a patient of Dr Slopis. He is awesome and very knowledgeable.", "Does sexual activity cause new neurofibroma growths? Before i proceed with the description, i would like to apologise to all in advance if this post make any of you all feel uncomfortable, but it is also a burning i had for some time. \n\ni found two new growths today. A small one, and a slightly bigger growth which is a little pinkish in color, and slightlyyyt painful when rubbed/pressed on. I did not notice these two yesterday. But as i was showering today, i found these two new ones.\n\nI am 24/m, and there has not been any injuries, any change in diet, but the only thing i did was having myself engaged in a little sexual activity.\n\nMy question and and query; would sex/masturbation/or being as simple as being \u201chorny\u201d cause new growths to surface as these sexual activities would be classified in \u201cchanges in hormones\u201d (i assume) - and what several websites state that would cause in new growths. You have nothing to worry about one has absolutely nothing to do with the other. no not in my experience. Obviously ask  a doctor All I can tell you is due to the tumor in my bladder/vaginal area, sex has been getting more painful lately. Than it used to be. Not sure if it is due to my tumor growing more or not. But I am trying to get in with my doctors to get that checked out. No, no new tumors will come about because of that. You may however feel discomfort depending on where you have tumors located. Tbh I am 18 m masterbate 4 times a week and have no effect if anything it makes me more active Maybe if ur taking birth control will probably do that in my next visit; thank youu! that is comforting to hear\ud83e\udd23 thankyouuu You are welcome okaii, thank youu No, but it could be an STD. Go see a doctor. My mom used to say that estrogen can increase fibroma growth.  There is also such a thing as trauma to the site. what is trauma to the site? If this is true, I am becoming a nun! lol", "Does anyone else feel worthless I feel so worthless and feel like there is no point to anything. Having this horrible disease just makes you feel like complete garbage.   You are not garbage - please talk to a professional if you feel you are. You have worth but the best thing you can do for yourself is talk with a therapist. There is no shame in taking care of yourself. You deserve to be happy. Frustrated, yes. Worthless, no. It is so easy to feel that way just try to remember it is not true. No one is better than you. We are all just lumps of cosmic dust randomly assembled. Some of us are just luckier than others. I do not know your symptoms but I know NF can take your body. Do not let it take your soul as well. \nYOU CAN BEAT THIS!! I feel it. It sucks huh. That there is nothing that I am good for? Like I have this awful disease that just fucks me up. Makes me different than everyone around me.\nYeah I know the feeling.  I have NF1. The fact that I have it does not bother me at all. I have had 27 brain surgeries but still live life to the fullest. I hardly even think about having the disease. The last time I was told I had to have surgery, I just laughed.  Being positive really helps. good for you :) I wish I was like but it consumes me! Mostly because I have fibromas on my face so anytime I look in the mirror or people ask me about it, just serves as a constant reminder  I want to be your friend, can I?\n\nI also have NF disease I have had 3 operations in my face and 4 in my body and also brown spots in my face and body, Sometimes people ask me why these brown spots are in your face \u201cI answer that it is a genetic disease. But they do not know, I just can remove this tumor and I can not do anything else for brown spots\u201d. I do not have many friends because of this thing\n Yes I messaged you  I am sorry to hear that it consumes you. I have met several people with NF but for the most part, they have had mild cases. One girl has a visible tumor but she does not let it bother her. For the most part, I have a very mild case with no real visible neurofibromas. Mine to pretty mild as well just some slight disfigurement. It is noticeable but nothing to drastic. other than the slight disfigurement tho my health is in pretty condition I guess compared to the more severe cases  I have met a few. One last summer but before that, none since 2009. Met some at an NF event I spoke at that year. Hiii, can I just ask what the surgeries is about though? Ive NF1, and recently gone for a brain MRI. They told me they saw something and had requested me to go for a second one with contrast. I did it yesterday and currently awaiting results. Any tips?:/ I have had one tumor, which oddly enough had nothing to do with NF. These rest of my surgeries were shunt related for hydrocephalus which means \u201cwater on the brain.\u201d I had a shunt put in at age 4 and have had 25 revisions. It is a tube that goes from the brain and drains into my stomach. It is possible that they saw some fluid during the MRI. The shunt surgeries are pretty simple. The last time I went in for surgery, I was out quickly. I developed a blood clot the day after surgery. I was out the next day. Everyone is different. If this is in fact what is going on with you, let me know and I will let you know what to look out for. I seeeeee... I hope all's getting better for you:/ we all got to stay strong and get through this together!! And yess I would keep u updated:) Everything has been good with me for 9 years. No problems. It is all about being positive. Whatever the results are, things will be ok. Neurosurgeons are great doctors and they will make sure you stay healthy. Thank you so much for that! Really needed itttt:/ ", "Questions about NF 1. I have NF1 and and a fibromas on my skin. (The soft tissue) I know these are rather harmless and do not become cancerous. \n\nI was wondering what the bumps are called that you can feel underneath the skin and hurt when you put pressure on them. They vary in size from feeling like a corn of rice, to the size of a marble or even bigger. Are these tumors underneath the skin also called fibromas?\n\nLastly, I do not have any plexiform fibromas at the moment. And my NF 1 case is rather mild without serious complications. But I can still develope plexiform fibromas in the future right? Even if I do not have them now? Is there a way of telling how likely this is or is NF1 just very unpredictable?  Hi. I have had NF1 my whole life. Some of the ones beneath the skin I had to watch. I had one and it was growing and pressing on the nerves of my wrist and hand. It was basically making it so I was having trouble grasping things. It was a fibroma that was strangling the nerves at my wrist and attached to another nerve further up my arm that was the size of a plum. I would say each case of NF is unique. I have 3 siblings. Out of the 4 of us, 3 have NF. My bro has had no surgeries for his. My sister has epilepsy with hers and has had a few surgeries. I have had multiple surgeries for NF1. Each case is different. Did the fibroma in your wrist grow over time? Or did it appear suddenly?  The one near my hand came on suddenly and was about the size of a marble but had rooted around the nerves. I had let it go a couple months until I had trouble grasping things. Sometimes you think they are benign ...How much trouble can they cause? That is why I wrote that. They do not need to be cancerous to cause you grief. If your body tells you there is a problem, get it checked. I had to insist to a doc to take a closer look. He said if it had gone on longer, the nerve damage would be worse.   I have many of these bumps under my skin - I have been calling them nodules but I guess they are fibromas? They cause me lots numbness since they rest on nerves or cluster around nerves. So far, the doctors have not removed any since it has not caused any permanent damage (although the clinic I am with seems to be quite a slow moving one, so there is that). It is hard for me to keep track of all of the fibromas because I have so many of them but I try to keep an eye on and see - some have grown over time, I discover new ones (or at least ones I have not noticed before) all the time. I am lucky because I have a mild form of NF, just the birthmarks, freckling and these bumps. I have been experiencing increasing and severe headaches over the past three years, along with lots of dizziness, numbness, so much bone pain/body aches but I do not actually know if it is NF related or something else. The doctors I have seen have sent me for tests (MRI, CT Scans) and found some stuff but waiting for the specialists takes forever. I think all we can do is try to be aware of our bodies as much as we can and keep monitoring things. Good luck, though. I am sorry I do not know too much though! I was born with NF as a gene mutation, diagnosed, went about my life for 25 some years and then basically started experiencing more body problems and started to see doctors who think it is NF related. Haha.   I am in the same boat. My case is mild compared to others I have seen. It is just the ones that were in my arm and hand that were awful. Sometimes you have to push docs to get them to help. I am right there with you on headaches and dizziness. I try to tell anyone (NF or not) that if your body tells you something is wrong, check it out. Good luck to you too!", "Nf1 and Ed issues? I have been \u2018inexperienced\u2019 in my life down to a few factors, but recently I have started seeing a fantastic, supportive women. But things in the bedroom could be better; do other men experience this, or would it have any effect on libido in men/women? I do not know of any implicit connection, but in specific cases i suppose it could be nf related. it is probably more related to stress, at least for me it is Nah I am always hard as a rock when hooking up. Performance anxiety for sure if you watched a lot of porn, that could affect things as well. If that is not the case, you can talk to your doc about some medications. If you do not want to talk to your doctor, there is always bluechew. Woman here: My libido is low, but I think is for my anxiety and depression, not for NF. I have OCD too so... you can imagine. :(\n\nA decade running away of love or sex relationship but wishing it. 25F with NF here. I have a really high libido. I also am fairly inexperienced due to lots of factors, mostly because I grew up religious. I think communication is huge not matter what the issue/experience level is. When you say \u201cit could be better\u201d are you talking about needing to climax? The connection between you and said partner? getting them off? Because each one has a different answer. \n1. Try different positions \n2. Ask partner what they like \n3. Learn what you like with your own body \n4. Try toys. I have a vibrator that my partner uses on me an I climax in like 30 seconds. \n\nMy partner has depression and anxiety. His current medication has lowered his libido. We find other ways to connected sexually. Sex does not have to just be penetrative penis/vagina sex, most women cannot get off just my penetration alone. She will get off 3 or 4 times during a session, where as I can have trouble finishing, and it is me staying hard is the issue. We do use toys, but she does not want us to become over reliant on them. I think it is mostly all in my head Due to some of my tumor locations (including on my ****) I have never really had erections and any sexual encounter I do have leans on \"fetishes and body worship\"... Things like that How big are your tumors there? Cause I have a small fibroma on the tip, your comment made me think this might be a cause Mines actually starts in my abdominal region then extends to my penis. It is kind of hard to describe it lol it is just a hot mess down there for me sadly I have nf1, when I get hard on my own it is like a diamond.  But I have from time to time lost it in the middle of it and all.  Thank God my wife loves me for me.  But I do have issues getting it going from time to time.  I use Cialas from time to time, try that, it is not covered by any plan, so expect to pay about 70 CAD for 4 pills , but one pill stays in your system for 48 hours.  Trust me they work well and will give you your confidence back.  Once your confidence is sky high, and you have or find a special some one......PLOW THEM IN TO NEXT WEEK..", "Long-Term Neurological Disorder From Antidepressant? Is it possible? Ever since I started antidepressants, I have gotten extreme discomfort with my body. I have episodic headaches, feel tingling and burning sensation throuout my body, and it gets worse when I start doing physical exercise. I like to play soccer but I cannot continue after sometime not because I am tired but the burning and tingling sensation gets completely unbearable. I have racing heartbeat most of the time and developed minor tremor as well. My body jerks ( involuntary muscle jerks (esp. upper torso) like getting electricuted) often. I cannot concentrate on my study or professors' lectures. I do not have psychiatric issues: I am not depressed, I do not have any harmful thoughts, no psychosis, nothing. What all I have is extreme physical difficulties. I have a past history of anxiety and was on meds as well but I did not have any of these symptoms. After having some anxiety issue again, my doc put me on antiDs and my life has been a hell. Self-analysing myself while referring to Google, I thought I had some brain disorder like Multiple Sclerosis or Parkinson's Disease but now I suspect I have extreme neurological problems (like superagitated nerves or nerve damage) from antidepressants. My doctor has put me on 200 mg of sertraline. I am on my 4th week on this dose but I still do not see any improvement (remind you my mood and cognition are fine. Its just these damn physical discomforts).   Do you think its just antidepressant messing me up or there is something serious underlying disease? (I do not have any genetic disease and my parents are healthy and do not have them) Can neurological test find out any nerve disorder caused by antidepressants (I very much suspect it is the cause)? Should I do CT scan/MRI of brain? I do not know what I should do. Anybody had similar experience before/ now. I need advice! Help!! The only way to have Neurofibromatosis is to be born with it. One of your parents would have passed it on to you or like me have it be a spontaneous mutation that happened before you are born. Being on at medication would not have caused it to happen. My anxiety makes me focus on health issues and I spent a lot of time googling different potential disorders just like you are.\n\n  \n\n\nCall your doctor and tell them your concerns. Start simple though, probably best to discuss stopping this drug and seeing if your symptoms improve. Thanks. Will talk to him. 200mg of sertraline is a lot to start with. I would recommend starting with 50mg. \nIt takes 6-8 weeks for an SSRI to start working. To have severe side effect like you stated can be associated with the serotonic system. \nTalk to your doc about reducing the dosage and give it at least two more weeks. Hey, I hear your concerns. It is scary when your bodies are not doing what they are supposed to, Good news, does not sound like you have NF. :) I would talk to your doctor  about what is going on to discontinue your medication. They might just want to discontinue your medication to see if your symptoms stop. If they do not stop talk to your doctor again an get a referral for a neurologist.", "Annoyed wow, so my right arm has so many new fibromas, 4 more since I said anything here (the poll) about NF. I have had heart pain, and also my lower back seems like it had a hard fibroma I do not know if it is on the nerve of my spine or on the skin above the spine. It hurts my back when I touch it\u2026.It seems like they just grow overnight. And I am now realizing that my NF1 is not as mild as ppl make it seem to be. I know I will have a lot more fibromas in the future but hopefully I can get some help with it. I do not even know if this is normal? is it? To grow them like I am a damn fibroma farm? Im going to see a doctor. soon hopefully We do tend to have more as we get older but this does not mean you have to sit and watch helplessly. \n\nWe now know that T-cell are required to start new tumour, so lowering your inflammation with diet could help. There has been only 1 dietary intervention clinical trial and it was successful in reducing the amount and size of neurofibromas combining a diet high in polyphenols with curcumin. \n\ndetails on what to eat and what not to eat are described in the paper \n\n( \n\nThen we also know that neurofibromas have a very high number of mast cells in them (again linked to the immune system) so taking a mast cell stabiliser like ketotifen might help preventing more from forming. Ketotifen will not work on existing tumours but more at preventing new ones from forming. Ketotifen is an elegy drug used in small children and I have talked often about diet and our options here and on Inspire. \n\nIn this discussion I give detail about the scientific literature behind the ketotifen recommendations and a couple of members have shared their story on taking it. \n\n( \n\nTalk to your doctor about the diet study and ketotifen and since both are harmless, maybe see if your doctor would ok you to try it for 3-6 months. \n\nI would also suggest you consider taking vitamin D combined with K2, studies have shown we are deficient and levels might be linked to neurofibroma development. Thank you I will talk to my doctor, and I will read abt the study I am not a doctor, but here is a webinar from a very famous NF doctor ,  Dr. Kaleb Yohay, the director of NYU Langone\u2019s Comprehensive Neurofibromatosis Center, the largest and most active neurofibromatosis (NF) clinic in the United States, and at the end of his video, around 1h14.30,  he talks briefly about  vitamin D, curcumin and Ketotifen. \n\n( Neurofibromatosis effects every differently, some people do have a mild case of it, while others like myself have a more severe case of it. Since the beginning of June, I have been taking Koselugo, my doctor said we really will not know whether it is working for at least 6-8 months. If possible I would discuss this with the doctor.", "Why must i have NF1? I am 15, and for a long time I was unaware of my condition. Until a few months ago, when I discovered what I had. All the while, my parents lied to me about it, passing it off as birthmarks caused by my mom's craving for chocolate chip cookies. That devastated me. Since then, I have lived in fear of what might happen to me. I look hideous. I have several CALs, am quite short (5'1\"), have a slightly larger head, and possibly mild scoliosis. I went to the dermatologist recently, and she found I may have started developing the neurofibromas. I do NOT want tumours to grow on my body. That did it for me. I could not be more depressed. Why must this happen to me? I am probably the only one in the entire school (and city) who has the condition. I just feel so confused and tired. I fear I might have a severe case later on. I wish I did not have NF1. No one here understands. I am also a hypochondriac with a fear of doctors which makes it even worse. Every small bump or pain I feel will send me into panic. I just hope that I will be one of those people who have really, really, mild NF1 where they do not or barely get any tumours at all. I just want to cry. I did not ask for this. I fear no one will ever like me and I will forever be alone. NF1 is a curse. I will not wish it even on my worst enemy. I was like you when I was 15. Scared, angry,  ashamed of my condition, lonely and jealous of \"normals\". I will tell you this, your life will be different, but only as beautiful as you make it. You may have to work harder for some things, but not everything. The best advice I can give you is to stop comparing yourself to others. Instead, ask what can you do today to better yourself. People who do not like you because of nf are not worth knowing. 7.5 billion people in the world. You choose who you make important to you. \n\nYou are at a stage where nf will be treatable or curable within a few decades. It sounds ages away, but I am 38. I have lived 2 decades more than you dealing with this and I can say I have hope. If I were 15 again, I would dedicate my life and education to this disease. If you are not stem strong, aim for management, politics, policy, education, etc.\nAlso, exercise. Often. Every day of you can. It relieves stress and makes you healthier. Being healthier makes issues easier to deal with. I have had a few tumors removed and those scars heal. No one points them out to me or even cares. I work a great job, have close friends at work, and have a good future ahead. \nBe bold. Be brave. Be passionate and live your life. You ate worthy of love.  I have often thought that one of the cruelest things about this condition is that it manifests so often at puberty. At 15 I was so self-conscious and having something like this suddenly affecting the way I look would have devastated me. I can only say \"be strong\". In five years it will not feel so bad. In ten, even less so.\n\nRegarding your parents lying to you; try to forgive them, they were most likely trying to spare you this pain and hoping you would not develop any obvious symptoms. As a parent of a child with NF1 myself (my five year old was recently diagnosed and has scoliosis and optic gliomas) I can see the attraction of thinking that way. It is short-term thinking, but that is how we humans work; we would rather try to avoid relatively little immediate pain at the risk of more in the longer term. I can tell you that they will be going through exactly the same emotions as you are. When I think about my son's future, of the chemo which is almost assuredly to come, the huge list of health problems, the way his friends could react, I almost want to just grind to a halt. The future just seems too bleak.\n\nWhat I am trying to say is; talk to your parents about your feelings. Believe me, they will understand. As a parent to a child (only eleven months old) with spontaneous NF1, one of the things I struggle with is how/when to tell him.  At the moment I am just hoping there will be viable therapy before I have to. He has very mild sphenoid wing dysplasia, which means he requires an annual MRI to check for optic glioma and/or plexiform neurofibroma of the orbit. First one came back clean, thank God. However at some point he will figure out that an annual MRI is not normal and we will have to break the news, likely at a young age. \n\nAll the fears that you have are legitimate. However, I just want to offer some encouragement. If you are only finding out about your diagnosis at 15, then yours is already a mild case. You have avoided optic gliomas (which almost always present by age 7), and you have also likely avoided plexiform neurofibromas, which almost always present in primary school. \n\nCutaneous neurofibromas, the ones you are beginning to see, are treatable already - look up Electrodesiccation or carbon dioxide lasers.  If you get them taken care of routinely. \n\nI want to second another posters prediction of a cure within 20-30 years. With the advent of CRISPR, genetic therapy is going to come fast to a large number of diseases.  If you have a nonsense mutation (have you had a genetic test?), read through drugs are being actively researched for nf1 and are actually already on the market for other diseases.  There is also a study starting to see if MEK inhibitors prevent cutaneous neurofibroma growth.  Mild case? Thank god. I seem to have only extremely mild scoliosis, no optic gliomas, no plexiforms, no/&lt;5 tiny (as of now) neurofibromas (thank God it is treatable), or any tumours. I also excel in school, and I do not have learning difficulties. I have extremely good hearing and people have been amazed about me being able to tell even a slight difference. All I have right now are the entirely harmless CALs (some even find it cute), freckling (same with the CALs), being slightly shorter (5'2\"), and a slightly larger head. (About =&lt;1.5\" larger). It brings me comfort that I have been spared from a lot of complications. Makes me think I will have a case of NF1 like Robert Redford did - very mild - and people find him attractive. Good to know about the neurofibromas being treatable. I hope that in 10-20 years, NF1 will be highly treatable and save lives. I want to have children when I grow up so maybe I can get gene modification to make sure I do not pass on NF1. You can get PDG IVF to avoid passing it on, this is a very standard procedure. It is essentially regular IVF except they perform genetic testing on the fertilised eggs and only implant those without the NF1 mutation. \n\nIt is of course, expensive. I have read upwards of $30,000 if you want insurance against no resulting pregnancy.  Same as me man I am 32 now. I learned more about my diagnosis  as I got older high school years. When they started having ne attend IEP meetings and trying to get ne to understand  to take over my medical checks ups as I got older  from doctors.  Me personally  I was not prepared . Stuff to get  now and be prepared for it.\n\n1  all your medical records\n2 school report cards/ all iep mettings if you have one\n3 MRI images if you have them.\n4. All doctors offices you ever been too.\n5. All prescriptions you  are taken  and have taken.\n\nI went 16 years without getting check up. My mom seamed to stop caring in 1999 my freshman  year that was my last MRI and doctor appointment  per my records from then. All all my school records were lost exempt last iep mettting.\n\nWith NF-1, it is very common to have sepression, anxiety, adhd, and autism.   It was not until I met my wife that I got tools to get help I needed again and check ups.  \n\nI recommeed seeing psychologist.  It is very likely you may have depression  or even adhd abs not even know it.  I read my files and it seamed that my mom did not want another label on me  I know now I have ADHD, but as I read files and notes and how I act , I also belive I am on the ASD spectrum.  (Autism )\n\nI know it is hard to recommend  you are young use tools you have now . Aso yiur parents how to,set up appointments, get referals. This is stuff I was not taught and did not even know how to do until I was like 30   \n\nMainly do to same fear of seeing doctor. I have a huge ass fibroma on the neck. I proudly present it as a hecky. \n\nVitamin D is extremely  important  for those of nf but it is also linked to depression  if you level is low.  Get sun  for like 5 minutes or more a day, vitamin d3 supplement is what my Nero recommended.\n\nMost important  thing is get your records so your have them it is record of your life and diagnosis. \n\n\n Again my case big fibromas on neck, small one on my arm looks like a freckle right now , one on my leg, over 30 cafe spots, 8mm benign brain tumor (low grade Gilad ), adhd  \n\nYa I mention adhd , depression,  and autism   they are all linked to brain and the central nervous  system  which is part of what NF-1 affects Not at very young , around 10 yo 12 would be safe bet. I become more aware around then . Due to constant check ups , mris (rocket ship rides).  What I can recommend  dio t tike opt adhd or autism  as child grows older.  I belive my mom hurt me more there then anything else saying that those kids where the destr action  in class. Based off my notes and records that I have I should of been diagnosed  with both of those  and it probably  would  if made school little easier  to grasp.  But I am assuming she did not want another label attached. \n1 keep all MRIs..\n\n2 all doctors notes\n\n3 all school  report cards.\n\n4 504/IEP meetings  \n\nNF1  is extremely  random  so keep everything  . MRI seems scary, but I will probably give it a go. I have to see an orthopedist soon to check for bone deformities. MRI is not scary you just lay down  for like 30 minutes  get a shot  then lay down again..  it is like a one hour nap. I am also surprised you gave got one . They typically  check the spine or brain  you age.   I just recently found out about my diagnosis. I might have an MRI scan soon. But I hope there is nothing wrong with me. I just want the spots. Nothing more than that. I do not want the tumours or any other complications. Are you really sure that my chance of having a really mild case is bigger? What if I still do not have any complications by the time I am 30? im 32,  benign brain tumor, bumps on the skin, cafe spots, 3 fibromas\n\nNF1 is randon. there is no guessing. you can easily wake up with new fibroma or cafe spot\n\nyou can also have other central nervous system issues, autiusm, adhd, scoliols  etc. I to was 15 when I found out I had it. Doctors always believed I had and my parents knew it was always a possibility, but test results were inconclusive. It was until I was 15 that test came back positive. I am now 33 and yeah it is not easy. It sucks. No one else in my family has it.\n\nI have had three surgeries so far one in 2001, another in 2007 and one in 2014. The one is 2014 turned out to be cancerous, but the doctors are sure they removed all of the tumor in my leg.\n\nI felt like it was a curse too and I was in pain, but believe me your is there for you and they only wanted to protect you and allow you to be a kid for as long as you possible could be. Thankfully, I managed to avoid several complications. I just hope it stays that way. I only have the spots and MAYBE very tiny neurofibromas around my body, but they are very, very, few and almost not noticeable. I hope it stays that way for you. Sadly for me it has not. I have many large one in my legs and pelvis. And then there a good sized one in my neck and right arms.  Wait there is a cure? I am 21 and lived with knowledge of it my whole life. The only thing that shows is my gigantic head (which I have grown to love lol) and the little bumps on my chest. I have an optical glioma but it is shrunk on itself, which is something my doctor had never seen before.   There are a lot of clinical trials on MEK inhibitors and some other top notch drugs coming out in the next decade. Also CRSPR technology once it is ready for human usage will be a boon to anyone with genetic disabilities.  I apologise for the very slow reply - only just discovered this sub again (plus its kind of quiet so this post is still on the front page...) I felt the need to reply though, cause they way you are talking kind of reminds me of how I think sometimes\n\nHonestly, all I can can is try not to worry about it too much. I am 25, and I was diagnosed very young, as my mum has NF1 and they just tested us asap. But I have always been told by her if there is nothing too severe going on by the time you have hit puberty, you likely do not have to much to worry about.\n\nI have had one guy tell me in the past he would be wary about dting me, cause he wants kids and would not want to have kids with me cause \"what if they end up like (my) mum?\" but honesty - screw anyone who thinks like that. (besides if you are very worried IVF is always an option, albiet an expensive one)\n\nYou are your own person - and if people are not willing to look past your NF to see who you are, then theyre not worth worrying about. \n\nAnd theres plenty of people here who are willing to listen and talk any time you need to vent. You are not alone with this. :)", "Just a small rant I didnt think a page like this would exist, i have Neurofibromatosis type 1. The reason i am actually posting this is because I just found(15 mins ago,), another bump on my jaw... sucks. Most of mine are on my back and torso. I have some on my face, legs, head, ect. I have a baby that has the Caf\u00e9-au-lait spots. \n\nI am definitely open to conversations, questions or whatever... I would even post pictures. We all have similar and different experiences with it. We should try to make people more aware of this. My case is rather mild. Still, it is always that moment a new one pops up and you are like \u201cwelp, I guess this is forever too.\u201d I got the smattering of small ones. I had a few larger ones removed a couple years ago. Felt good getting that done. My case is not bad. Had one on my eye and now my face ya ugly AF.  I have lots of cafe spots. I am going to tattoo over some and leave some I have a few tattoos just to help distracte from them. But I cant tattoo my whole body.. i do not want too either. How is the one on your eye ? Does it effect your vision? I have had some removed and it seems like 1 might be growing back, the 2 on my arm they \"removed\" they did not do a good job at all. Its like the just cut the middle of them, that is it. Ive decided not to try again unless I need too. I have a couple scars I do not mind because they were in sensitive places and I am glad to have them gone. The couple on my arm bothered me but have faded with time and Mederma. I should have done research and asked questions though, I thought they would be removed laparoscopically. But I guess nerve work requires more.\n\nBut he did a good job with the removal, no sign of returning. I dont even want to get checked on, its been 12 + years. How old were you when you got the removal? How old are you? I am 20 and I just got a new little bump in my arm that I have noticed. I am kind of mad. But why do not you get it removed? I am 29, and I have a few of them. Unless they really start messing me physically i do not see a point of getting them removed. Does not seem like a realistic idea. Very much my eye is all the way turned out and I have a lazy eye it is  up useable I have a tumour removed and it gifted me a nice scar  where I used it for a tattoo idea. Picture can be found in portfolio and I am planning to get more 35. I am sorry to hear that. I should not bitch so much about my status. i personally have not had anything like that happen. My sister had one in her brain at the age of 3. I will be 29 in a few days and felt like I have made it past the point where I would have to worry. But with comments I am reading from others, and my findings one on my jaw, i guess its a life time worry. It varies for everyone. Obviously getting checked out is wise but do not necessarily measure your condition at a certain age against others. But of it helps, the ones I got removed had been there and the same size over 10 years for some. I dont want to be put in that CAT scan thing, I cannot remember the name of it but its a loud tunnel thing. You cannot move, or you are not supposed to so they can get clear images. I have always felt if I do not have something, the radiation from the machine will give it to me. MRI. It is safe. It does not use radiation. And damn you have no idea what a relief it is to get a clean scan back. Mine played music inside it. But yes, you cannot move. It was hard for me because I get itchy a lot.\n\nMy advice is since they work it in chunks rather than nonstop to let you know when you ca move between scans if you need to. Maybe I will do it then, the covid does not make it easier, who wants to go to a hospital at all now... unless absolutely necessary. But ill try to see what I can do, my son will have to soon I feel. My wife wants more kids and does not seem to car about the Neurofibromatosis like I feel she should. It is tough, yeah. My dad also had it. Part of the reason I have decided to not have them. Also never been in a good place financially. \n\nAt any rate, best of luck to you.", "Tumor removal For any one who has had tumors removed, was there any scarring or like dents from where the tumors where? I have been thinking about getting a few removed but have not found anything on the after effects which I am slightly worried about. How big are the ones you are wanting to remove and where? I have had properly near 20 smallish subcutaneous ones removed. Most of them are flat scars with some discoloration. The one I had removed from my face was done by a plastic surgeon but the others were done my a dermatologist. I have had loads of tumors removed.\nJust massage the heck outa that scar tissue with vitamin E oil\nThe scar will slowly disappear.\nPlus, the technics used to hide sutures is way different than 15 years ago, my old scars you can totally see\nBut the new ones, the surgeons hide that cut in a skin fold, or some other magic shit They are on my chest, they are all relatively small the largest been the size of a pea. I would try are get them all removed by a plastic surgeon. It really depends on the size, the location and most of all, your genes. Do you scar easily from other things? \n\nI scar easily and badly. The neurofibromas I have had removed on my chest have all left scars, even though they were small, on the surface of my skin and the surgery was done by an experienced dermatology surgeon. The scars are not terrible, but are just as noticeable as my neurofibromas were. It is been 15+ years since my last surgery and the scars are mostly flat, slightly puffy circles that are still a different color than the rest of my skin (used to be redder, now much lighter than the surrounding skin). \n\nBut my primary reason for removal was because of pain and itching, not appearance. I have had some those size removed by my derm doctor. They used this thing like a tiny apple corer, or a curvy/hook scalpel. They have to go a little deep to help prevent it growing back. A plastic surgeon may be able to make a cleaner scar. \n\nDo you know how you scar from past surgeries/injuries? I have had some removed and there is scarring. But I use mederma and that helps. Mine were rather small though, one inch or less. Had a couple in my arms, one in the back, ankle, and groin. None dangerous but uncomfortable to mild pain The scaring depends more on the surgeons sewing than anything. My daughter had two tumors removed and the more skillful surgeon left almost no scar ( the scars are on the scalp and hair covers them). For surgeries in very noticeable body areas an NF plastic surgeon would do the removals and closing. I have a dent on my back where one tumor was removed. I also have a scar on the right side of my face that goes to the bottom of my chin Do you have any scars on ur face? Yes a flat one (mostly discolorstion), but its really only noticable when you stare at it. It is right at the corner of my mouth, so the doc said it would be tricky to keep smooth. Plus I was a teenager when I had it removed and did not listen to the post-op instructions carefully. I spent to much time in the sun, but in Texas in the summer its hard to avoid. I am very prone to scars and keloids :(! I just stared growing 3 small little tumors on my face. 3 on my right cheek and one on my jaw. How big were your facial tumors? The one on my face was about the size of a pencil's eraser. Others I have had removed on my abdomen and ankle were a variety of sizes, some eraser sized some half that size, some are almost skin tag size. I had a smaller one removed from under my chin, it did not scar but it is growing back. If you scar easy you may want to look at some of the scar creams on the market, I looked at them but they require daily applications and I am to scatter brained to keep up with that. Hello do neurofibromas come back in your case?", "What to expect from neurology consult? Hi, I am wondering if anyone can tell me what to expect at my son\u2019s neurology consult. He is had some large CAL spots since birth and has slowly gotten more. He is now 7yrs old and officially has 7 spots with other areas looking like they might be darkening and becoming CALs. So our pediatrician has referred us. He has an appointment in November with a neurologist who runs the NF clinic at that hospital. I am just wondering what we can expect to happen? Is it basically just looking at the spots and answering questions? Do they always do genetic testing? My husband and I are pretty sure at this point that even if our insurance does not cover it we would pay just to know. Just looking for any insight to prepare for, not exactly sure how to explain to my son that we have to drive 2 hours away just to have his spots (that he mostly cannot see cause all but one are on his butt and back of his shoulders/torso) looked at. Our first appointment was short. Pretty much the dr looked at my sons spots and asked a few family health history questions.  We were taken down the hall to a pediatric opthalmologist for an eye exam.  They said we should go ahead with genetic testing.  Went to another area for the blood test. That was it.  Good luck and wishing you the best. When I was 15 and had my first consult with the doctor who diagnosed me back in 1999. He looked at some of my birth marks and the visible tumors I had.  Also had some blood drawn. Asked some basic questions. Then some weeks later, it was actuality the last week of my freshmen year of highschool, I had to stay at the hospital for a week and had a bunch of test done. MRIs, ekgs, ct scan and more blood drawls. Where eventually I was 100% diagnosed. \n\nSince then I have had four surgeries related to my Neurofibromatosis and typically have MRIs done every year if not every other year. If you have any questions, let me know. I have been seeing the same nf specialist who diagnosed me. I am curious, why did you have to stay in the hospital? Was that just specific to your case or is that routine? Mostly because I needed all those tests done and we were coming from out of state. They also wanted to do a urine test that I believe was 24-48 hours long. I regularly see a neurologist as an adult, did not as a child, but a first appointment will probably entail questions (health history, is there family history of NF? What symptoms?), looking at spots, asking family medical history, and maybe a few quick reflex/neuro/balance tests (touching finger to nose, seeing how many fingers are being displayed, tapping the knee, watching him walk down hall). The neurologist might ask for MRI at a later time just for baseline. By the time I saw a neurologist, I had already had genetic testing, but that might be a possibility, too. I was diagnosed like a year after high school. Noticed some of the symptoms way before that but never got crazy enough for me to feel like I should see someone. I think about that a lot and am thankful it was after high school. Do not think I could have made it through high school going through this. Did not really effect me too much other than needing more doctor visits than the average high school student. I just dealt with it and took it one day at a time. Oh, I see. Thanks for answering my question. I am looking into a clinic 6 hours away, and I am wondering if that would be something they would suggest. I would prefer not because of my daughter\u2019s age. It is possible, but if there is a Ronald McDonald House by the hospital perhaps you would be able to stay there. Sometimes when I needed to go to Chicago for a round of MRIs, my mom and I would stay there for a couple of days. Chances are , if the appointment is at an NF clinic, that a genetic counsellor will also be present to talk about what a possible diagnosis means and go through the benefits or not of genetic testing. \n\nSince 2014, there is a big push to change the diagnostic criteria for Nf1 since the manifestations occur over a course of years and some people will have them very early and others later, which would delay a diagnosis. \n\nAt the first appointment, the neurologist will look at the skin of course, and probably touch the skin as well running the hands along the limbs and the torso to feel for subcutaneous neurofibromas or possible plexiform. The neurologist will also do some basic neurologic tests such as assessing reflexes, and the follow the finger/touch nose kind of basic tests. \n\nBecause many of the Nf manifestations overlap with other disorder such as Legius, also known as Nf1-like syndrome, which has cafe au lait, without any of the tumours, in 2020, there are ground to justify a genetic test. \n\nThe old criteria of having 2 out of a list of 6 was justified and perfect for the period in which the diagnosis criteria was done, in the 1980s, before genetic test was available . Nowadays, doing the test, which gets cheaper every years, just cuts the doubt one way or the other. \n\nAt the appointment , in addition to the genetic test chat, you will probably be offered am ophthalmologist appointment which will look at the back the eye at the optic nerve and look for Lisch nodules on the iris. This last manifestation is not always present in the early years, and not all with Nf1 have them, but if you do have them, you do have Nf1. Thank you for taking the time for this response, it was very informative. The fact that your son has all his spots concentrate on one part of his body might be an indication of a mosaic (also called segmented in the old books). This is when the mutation does not occur at conception but at a post-zygotic stage, so a first lot of cell has a functioning nf1, the successive a mutated one, and all the successive cells will have bits of both. \n\nIn a mosaic case, the severity is usually very low, mainly having only the  pigmented lesions. Mosaic nf1 is not always caught on genetic blood test, because blood cells might come form the first division line and be fine. An option if one really really wants to be sure, is to do the genetic test on a biopsy from one of the pigmented area. \n\nAre you and the father of the child of different heritage, with one being darker than the other or is your son very fair with freckles and red hair? Because this is a frequent cause of innocent skin spots. \n\nYou can read a bit more on this mixed heritage and also mosaicism on Dr Korf's statement (he was part of the team that designed the diagnostic criteria) here ( We are the same heritage but my son is fair skinned with strawberry blonde hair and freckles on his face only. His spots are mostly on his butt, lower back, the newer ones being on the backs of his shoulder area. One spot is behind his knee. Some of the spots he is had since birth and are pretty big, like at least 1.5 inch in width. The newer ones are dime-sized. My husband has one CAL. Thank you for all of this information, I really appreciate it. Strawberry blonde is somewhere between red hair and blond, and if you are of Irish or Welsh descent, it is another step towards a benign innocent skin marking.  The reference to red hair is there but mainly missed by most doctors. \n\n(\n\nI looked at one of the papers cited on sci-hub and a table reports the details of each child, and one listed as strawberry blond, had not only the largest amount of CALs but also the biggest in size (the largest being 2x7 cm). The authors describe the CALs  of all children as having irregular or feathery borders.\n\nTo answer the second part of your original question \"how to explain to my son that we have to drive 2 hours away just to have his spots looked at\" , I would go for honesty: you have some spots on your skin and we want to know what they are. Our usual doctor, DR XYZ, does not know but he/she knows a doctor that can tell us, so we will go and see them. And then talk about what he wants for dinner. Do not make a big fuss or deal about it. Others have answered your question about the consult very thoroughly and consistently with my experience.   Be prepared with things to keep your son occupied in case you are waiting or having a long chat with the docs.  My son was diagnosed at 3 yrs old.  I am going to paste a reply I sent not too long ago to another parent about traveling a long way for related dr appointments and how I talked to him about it.  I hope it is helpful:\n\nWith all of that travel time it would be great if you could set up all of your appointments in one day (possible if you are going to an NF specialist in a hospital setting) and stay overnight in a hotel. Then do something fun the next day to relieve your stress! As your daughter gets older this will make the doc. visits something to look forward to because she will know that a fun adventure is all part of the package. I will tell you that my son NEVER heard words like: disease, tumor, cancer, chemo, MRI, etc. As he got older and started asking I answered his questions honestly, but when he was little he just knew that he was really special and there were interesting things happening in his body that the doctors wanted to learn about and take special pictures of. I always made sure the hospital was fun and entertaining. At 12 yrs old he still thinks it is fun to go there! So despite the distance you have to travel just look at it as an opportunity to have some fun while you are away.\nHang in there. No matter what, you will be giving your daughter all the same love and opportunities that you would have in any circumstance and I am sure she will grow to be a happy little girl!", "Tattoos? Thinking of getting a tattoo tomorrow! Anyone had any issues with tattoos relating to their NF? If you get mris frequently it could effect that I think ? Not an issue. Just watch where they put it No issues and I have a fair amount of tattoos\n Only if there is metal. Most places use vegan ink now. Just make sure you check with your artist!! I always do. Lol Sometimes I get wry looks from Docs and nurses. No medical complications.  I have one that is on top of a fibroma with no problem. I ended up having to get an MRI about three months after I got the one on my back and there was no side effects from it......the tattoos they are talking about are more than likely older tattoos like prison tattoos or war time tattoos that would sometimes you metal in the ink. ", "Son diagnosed with NF1. We live in a small Alaskan town. No specialists in Alaska. Considering a move to lower 48. To have better access to medical treatment. I am kind of lost and do not know what to do/expect. Is seeing a specialist nessesary?  Even if your son ends up having a mild case, as I do, seeing a specialist on some sort of cadence is not a bad idea. My two cents would be to crunch the numbers on the relative cost between flying to a specialist annually or moving nearer to a specialist in the lower 48 when taking into account CoL, your industry's job market, etc. I would also consider speaking with geneticists in the area to see of they can point you to geneticists within AK who habe a high-degree of familiarity with NF. Yes. Seeing a specialist is a necessary precaution. My son also has NF1 and he has a tumor in his brain which needs monitored with regular MRIs. Tumors can grow in any organ and cause complications. In my experience doctors that are not NF1 specialists have very little understanding and knowledge. We have had doctors who have never even heard of the condition. My son also has learning disabilities and behavioural difficulties associated with NF1. We have needed the help of specialists for this too. But every case is different. Good luck, I feel for you. It is hard enough dealing with NF1 I cant imagine how difficult it is in the USA. There is no geneticists in ak. I am from Mn where there are 3 nf clinics. Providence Medical Group in Anchorage has a pediatric genetics clinic; their geneticist, Dr. David M. Koeller, is currently accepting patients. The website does not speak to their familiarity with NF but it does not hurt to ask. \n\nI am happy to hear you have a history in a state with such high-quality care/specialists as MN. Do you have family there/is your industry doing well in MN? And as a side note, having both moved a lot *and* being diagnosed with NF1, make sure the move is absolutely necessary before you do. Unless he is very young or already has an extended support system within MN, the move will only exacerbate the stress and frustration NF will add. I know this is a stressful decision and I sincerely hope everything comes together well for you both. I would recommend moving to the lower 48 since it will help to see a specialist. Things are different from when I was a child and doctors are a lot better. I wish you the best of luck and if you have any questions do not be afraid to ask No, a specialist is not needed.  My son has NF1.  A great specialist may convince you they are needed but they can only monitor the growth of tumors.  And then suggest occasional surgeries to remove them.  If you suspect your son has a tumor needing to be removed, you will know it without the assistance of a specialist, and then can take action. Absolutely. My son has like 8 special doctors he is seen since his diagnosis at 1. Mri every 6 months because his blood flow is limited in his braid and he has 2 tumors in his brain too we just found. Good luck I would crunch numbers about going to Washington, I used to work up in Alaska I flew from Utah and round trip tickets (depending on time of year, summers where worse) were 400-500$ I would love to know how you are able to suspect tumors growing on internal organs without medical help????? How old is your son? Our son is 3 and was diagnosed with NF1 before he turned 1. Yes we see a specialist. Appointments are every few months or as we feel we need to.\n\nIs a specialist a must? No, but i think it depends on your own comfort level and peace of mind. I would say see the specialist and let them tell you the need. Kind of the route we went.\n\nYou mentioned Minnesota -- but i am not familiar with their medical network. If you can look elsewhere, i would highly recommend the Philly/NJ or even DE. ( is world renowned. Plenty of satellite campuses in the area, too. UPENN, Nemours, Shriners -- the list can go on. In addition to Providence mentioned in another comment\n\n\nAlaska Division of Public Health, Anchorage, AK\nPhone: 907-269-3430\u00a0\nLocation: Anchorage, AK\t\nWebsite:\u00a0Alaska Genetics Clinic\nPhysicians:\u00a0Meg Kurtagh, Clinic Manager\u00a0\nSpecialty:\u00a0Genetic Disorders\u00a0\nFacility Type:\u00a0Women's, Childern's and Family Health It is good to following to catch any underlying things that could happen. My daughters go once a year. Care guidelines for children have been published. I have NF1 and also work for NF Midwest so I have seen it.\n\n Seeing a specialist can help. Years ago, in my town we had a new neurologist come to our local hospital, this was still early in the time since I had been diagnosed by a specialist who was located in Chicago.  My parents liked the idea of seeing a doctor closer to home, so this doctor had ordered a bunch of test, MRIs and so on. This doctor freaked when he saw my images and told my parents my right leg needed to be amputated.\n\nConcerned my parents contacted the specialist in Chicago who diagnosed me. He told them to bring me in along with the images from the MRI. He looked them over and said no I did not need to have my leg amputated. While I do walk with a limp and have pain, I still have both my legs. And this was almost twenty years ago.\n\nI still continue to see this specialist about 1-3 times a year and have MRI scans 1-2 times a year.\n\nIt is also good to have a specialist for when you need to have surgeries, as the specialist will know which surgeons can be trusted with these difficult surgeries as removing these types of tumors is no easy task. \n\nSo in my opinion yes it is very important to have a specialist, however this can all depend on how the person is effected with Neurofibromatosis as it effects everyone differently Sorry, but I would have to disagree, I have seen doctors who were not familiar or as familiar with Neurofibromatosis an they freaked and wanted to start removing limbs. It is also important when tumors need to be removed that it is done by a surgeon who knows what these tumors do and how they are wrapped around the nerves. Not just any surgeon can do it. It is best that a specialist recommends one to you as he or she has worked with this surgeon before and knows that this surgeon known and understand these types of tumors. Hi! Chiming in. I am 22 and have been treated by the NF team at CHOP for my entire life. They will see you for your entire life; there is no need to transfer to an adult NF team. I see my doctor as needed now but have been there as recent as May and have his personal phone number. I can answer any questions that you have about them. My niece just was diagnosed with NF1 she had developed tumors behind her eyes and will need chemo. I believe seeing a specialist is wise to make sure you stay on top of any tumors m", "Transitioning MtF with NF1? Hello, today I was at the doctor's office and they were inspecting me to see if I meet the nf1 criteria. I did meet it and she said it is likely that I have nf1.\n\n\nAnyways, I am 17 years old and have felt like a girl sense I was around the age of 7. This has caused a fair bit of pain throughout my life, mostly in recent years. I have been wanting to transition sense I was 14 but am not able to until I turn 18, less then a month from now. \n\nI was wondering if anyone knew anything about estrogen HRT and nf1 and if it will cause any issues. \n\nI currently have no tumors. I have darker spots on my skin and ADHD and very mild scoliosis.\n\nThe doctor is not totally sure if I have nf1 yet because no genetic testing has been done. But it is very likely I have it. It would really be best to discuss this with your doctor, but hormones can effect how Neurofibromatosis act. In my case while like anyone with Neurofibromatosis your born with it, but for someone of us things do not really jump start until we hit puberty. I was not diagnosed until I was 15, but it was always believed I had it, but test results were always inconclusive.\n\nI have also read that woman who get pregnant can also experience problems with Neurofibromatosis with it getting worse, but that does not happen to everyone. This condition unfortunately does effect everyone differently, so it can be difficult to say how it will progress in an individual.\n\nIf you do end up getting diagnosed, it would be wise to speak with your doctor and a Neurofibromatosis specialist regarding any medications you would need to take in regards to your transitioning on how they could effect Neurofibromatosis. I have NF2, so this may be VERY different, but if you have any central nervous system tumors, many of them have progesterone and estrogen receptors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBe VERY careful, those hormones can sometimes cause tumor growth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDefinitely still transition &lt;3 but look into something like hormone blockers vs estrogen and progesterone if you have tumors where that is a worry, friendo. How do I know if I have central nervous system tumors? I know nothing about hormones and how they could/could not impact NF-1. I echo the others, talk to your doctors. \n\nIf you have not already, you will want to get a brain and full spine MRI (idk what country you live in but if it is the US you MIGHT have to fight your insurance on it. Do so. And get your doctors to help.). This will a) serve as a baseline and b)hopefully detect any tumors on/around your spine and brain.\n\nMore importantly\u2026Congrats on living your true life. I hope and pray you have support in your life. If not, know that I support and celebrate YOU!! Best thing to do is talk to a neurologist but I hope the best for you :) In your situation, I would request a genetic test for Nf1 to confirm diagnosis to have the best options for a successful transition. \n\nHaving a scoliosis, mild or severe, is not a criteria for Nf1. The skeletal criteria are the very specific and distinctive osseous lesion such as sphenoid dysplasia or thinning of long bone cortex with or without pseudarthrosis. \n\nIn the same way ADHD is now so diffuse in the society that it cannot be used as a diagnosis criteria. \n\nTherefor, it seems to me you only have the cafe au lait spots. How many do you have? \n\nMy advice, would be to have the test done and  clear the path for the future. \n\nI will still try to answer your question about estrogens. This is a tricky one, and like many things in Nf1, we do not know. We do know that neurofibromas have estrogens receptors but at the same time, the worst phase for neurofibromas growth is after the menopause, when estrogens levels plummet to nothing. After many years of yes/no, it seems pregnancy does not affect neurofibromas growth in pregnant women compared to non-pregnant nf1 women \n\n( \n\nand pregnancy is the moment with the highest estrogen levels , so this should be reassuring to you.  I had four pregnancies  and did not notice a massive eruption. I did get some, maybe 5 o6 over the 4 pregnancies, but at the same time, I was also getting older, and becoming older seems to matter more than the hormones. \n\nWe are getting an understanding on how the microenvironment and the immune system - especially inflammation and T-cells - are responsible for tumours initiation. \n\nBecause Nf1 is such a mysterious and nebulous disease, whatever you can clarify and know for sure is a plus. You do not want any doubt about the diagnosis because there are other conditions such as Legius, also known as Nf1-like syndrome that present with dark sports and nothing else, none of the tumours . Legius occasionally has attention deficit disorder and could fit , so maybe testing for both should be considered. \n\nWhatever comes, there will a plan to move forward and I wish you all the best. Very informative and insightful Booksncoffee. Besides seeing your NF specialists, Find an endocrinologist that specialized in transitioning, they may know more about potential  adverse effects. Hopefully the can give you doses that are within therapeutic range and wont be supra-physiological. If its managed slowly and patiently Id speculate that it would cause less issues, the body does not does not like wild fluctuations.  \n\nThis is the trans NF group Hi, it depends on the tumor your doctor suspects you might have, but usually tumors in the central nervous system are detected from MRI scan. Or at least, from my experience, that is how they diagnosed mine.\n\nI would definitely suggest you ask your doctor to get one That study is really interesting. I definitely noticed a big increase in fibromas. They were all small and mostly on my chest. They have faded a lot since I gave birth. I also had some old ones grow a big. Nothing huge but pregnancy definitely impacted things. I wonder if it depends in the mutation or something. Many things happen during pregnancy. Our immune system changes and contrary to popular belief, not everything goes down. T-cells actually go up ( and will persist for a while after delivery and then go down to normal again. \n\nAt the recent NF1 medical conference, there was quite a focus on the importance of T cells for tumour initiation.  \n\nAnother thing that happens in pregnancy, is that we eat more and cellular pathways are sensitive to nutrient. An abundance of nutrients will up regulate mTOR and could drive cell growth. \n\nNf1 is very complicated and fascinating. The immune system is unique to each of us, and it might be the key to explain why two people with the exact same mutation have such extreme differences in manifestations. Thanks so much for the extra info! You seem really knowledgeable. Refreshing - the majority of the people in the Facebook groups I am in barely,  or just do not, understand how the disorder is inherited. I am not on FB, so cannot judge. I am however on Inspire and there we tend to go deep into the science. \n\nI live in Australia, no NF-ologist here, I was very unimpressed by the lack of knowledge of the doctors here, so to give myself the better chances, I decided to dig deep into Nf1. An MRI Congrats on starting hrt soon. Make an appointment soon because sometimes theres a bit of a wait for a good doctor. Good news is even with an NF diagnosis you will still be able to transition.\n\nIm 31 and have been on hrt 6 1/2 years now. I did develop some subcutaneous neurofibromas recently, but no reason to suspect a connection. Someone mentioned pregnant women having issues, but your hormones will not be in that range anyways. Just monitory your levels and keep them in the right range. You do not want them too high anyways, its counter productive. Ive been on various forma of estrogen and AAs. pill, patch, different injections. Spiro, lupron, and now an orchi. so if you have any questions lmk", "Pain correlated with low blood sugar Hello peeps, mainly a lurker but just curious if anyone experiences something I have been noticing. I have a small grouping of tumors on the left side of my face and I have noticed that any time I go awhile without eating i get this sharp pain behind my left eye. Most other pains relating to NF are of varying degrees and strike at random but those eye pains are rather consistent anytime I test it out. Just curious if I was alone in this or if anyone has experienced anything similar. Is it a migraine?", "NF1 worsening rapidly Heyo! I am Britt. I was born with NF1 as I inherited it from my mother who also has the condition. I have a lot of tiny tumors scattered all over me along with some medium sized ones. The last few months I have noticed more and more fibromas popping up and the ones I currently have are growing in size. It is really frightening me tbh but currently have no insurance and no job. I am working on both of those things but I have some personal issues getting in the way. \n \nI am on a medication for Crohn\u2019s disease called Entyvio. I am in a medical study for it so they supply the medication for no charge. I am worried it is making the condition worse or if it is not related to that. My concern is that if they are growing externally then they must be growing internally as well. An internal tumor was never found although the last MRI I had was in 2015 so that probably changed \n\nHas anyone else noticed their condition worsen in their mid 20\u2019s? Did it eventually slow down or even speed up? I am so dysphoric as it is and have agoraphobia from the NF. The fact it is getting worse is doing no good for my mental health. I am trying to get Medicaid as soon as I can but I know that most likely will not cover an NF specialist. I have never seen one so I really do not have a gauge on the severity of my condition. I am just scared tbh. It is getting so much worse by the day. Hello, it is likely down to your age and there is a chance it is the medication if it affects your hormones. \nAlso are you under alot of stress, that can increase tumors growth. I had a few pop up when my father died. \n\nIf you want to talk about it feel free to PM me Heyo! I am under a ton of stress actually. We just put my childhood dog to sleep day after thanksgiving. That and a ton of other issues stemming from years ago are making me anxious and stressed 24/7.  I feel an overwhelming sense of dread for most of the evening and just want to go to bed. Everything is piling up and I am just tired of it all. If that is the issue then I have a ton of work to do to try and fix it lol Age probably plays into but I think the stress is a big factor. .if you can afford it trying going for a massage once a week or bi weekly. Meditation helps too. I know its easier said than done but try to limit stress as much as you can I am in my latter 30's. I think for me the tumors came somewhat slower over time, but never stopped completely. Since you are in a study for Entyvio, talk to the doctors in that study. It is worth checking out, especially if there might be some side-effect. Mine got worse as I got older. I was diagnosed when I was 15, that was a little over 20 years ago. Since then I have had tumor grow bigger and in both 2014 and 2018 I had some turn cancerous. I have MRIs pretty much yearly.\n\nIt is possible for Medicaid to cover you to see your NF specialist, it can be difficult if it is a doctor that is out of network, but at least from my experience if you have a primary doctor that has your back and makes it clear to whomever your Medicaid insurance will be through, they will allow you to see your nf doctor. Now if you nf doctor is in the state you live in and not out of network it will be easier. My doctor is out of network, and at times it was a pain and I had to files appeals to see him, because my Medicaid insurance would deny it, but I would fight it along with my primary doctor and it would work. \n\nI was recently approved for Medicare so that is going to help big time for when I need to go out of state. \n\nI did have to get a lawyer to help with getting Medicaid, so if you are denied you will want to look into that. Could you be pregnant? I know pregnancy can exacerbate neurofibromatosis I am in my late 20s and started noticing increased growth a few years ago. As far as I know it is only my skin, but I have never had a full body MRI before, but nothing in my brain has changed. I have met a few other people who started getting more and more in their late 20s, so I am starting to wonder if the puberty/pregnancy/menopause is not as accurate as I would always been told. Mine is still pretty mild, but it is really negatively affecting my already poor body image, especially with imagining what it might be like in the future. Interesting. I am in my late 30\u2019s and the tumor growth and amount of tumors popping up every year seems to increase compared to how it was in my childhood and teens. My freckling has increased with age. I have however had a brain and spine MRI and they said they did not see any tumors. I am 25. So I do not have bumps yet, but I have so so so many frecklings all over my body. I hope you progress much much faster. based I noticed my NF \"worsen\" in my mid 20's (I am 26 now). I have noticed that I have more fibromas throughout my body; while stress has always been a part of my life, I feel that my age has more to do with it than stress does in my specific instance. Regardless, I do feel for you and I too am scared about my condition and hoping I do not end up in some catastrophic condition. I genuinely do hope that your condition improves. If you ever want to talk, feel free to message me.", "Hello! New here. My mom has NF1 and has recently loss her balance and coordination and speaks slurred. After a recent MRI, a tumor was found around the cerebellum. We are now waiting for an appointment for biopsy of this tumor. I would love to hear about your experience with this. Thank you.  I have neurofibromatosis and poor balance, so far no tumors in my brain though. Pretty much everywhere else. I have had a cancerous tumor removed from my right leg in 2014, that was caused a ton of pain. I also have had two other surgeries one on my arm in 2001 when I was in high school and then another in 2007 to removed tumors that were pressing against my spine. Right now we are waiting on here results from MRI scans of my right arm where I have a large tumor. My mom had it, and same deal, we are poor so we had to rely on medicaid, which 3 times in a row, the doctor they sent us to was a child doctor. She kept getting worse so we went to the ER, she had a late stage tumor, she lasted about 5 or 6 months after that.", "Meet up Chicago How would you feel to do a meet up in Chicago?  We could go to a coffee shop, go hiking, go eat, or anything. I just feel like we (me too) need to go out more. if you ever make your way to Cleveland let me k ow I will. I just feel like, personally anyway, like we need to get together in our cities and form a strong community. I will piggyback on this!

Im in for ny meetup", "Unable to get treatment I have a ton of cafe au lait spots and patches everywhere on my body and I am a dark skinned F. I was told by my dermatologist that laser would simply make my skin even worse and it is catered towards people with lighter skin. This makes me pretty upset as I have huge patches all over my body and spots as well then my dermatologist simply said the best thing to do is to leave it alone. This crushes my esteem entirely. I do not think I can appreciate myself for who I am because of this. It is not that the laser is catered towards lighter skins, but the laser will remove all the skin pigment as well as the the cutaneous neurofibromas leaving a white scar which will be more visible on darker skins but it is still quite visible on white skins as well. \n\nYou can understand it better by looking at the pictures in this paper. \n\n( \n\nIf you keep reading the paper, it describes a new technique to remove neurofibromas, which is better explained in more details in this paper: \n\n( \n\nWhile you investigate which options amongst all the ones described would better suit your skin, can I suggest you have a look at the dietary approach which as shown some success? No harm can come from trying?  I talk a bit about it here ( and it was in 2017 analysed in every detail on Inspire , just google nf1 + diet.\n\nAs you maybe know, a drug called Koselugo, is being trialled for the cutaneous neurofibromas . Maybe there is a clinical trial near you ( \n\nIt is not an easy drug (ton of side effects) , and the delivery is not tissue specific, meaning you cannot really target it to the skin and not elsewhere. This is why they are now trying the same drug as a cream and again clinical trials recruiting ( \n\nThis to say, that there is a lot more going on on the management of nf1 than what might be known at the doctor's office. New techniques, new drugs, and even old supplements such as vitamin D ( \n\nDo not lose hope. Talk yo your doctor about giving the  diet and supplements a try  or a the very least, look into it.  In Italy, dietary intervention is part of the treatment package given to Nf1 patients in hospitals, \n\nAnd I did not even touch the gene editing or manipulating and there several projects targeting the nf1 gene in several ways, some correcting the defective copy of the gene (quite hard to do) other trying to boost the \"un-mutated\" and functioning copy. \n\nIf your dermatologist is not prepared to be on your side and look beyond what she/he knows, look for someone else. Would she/he try the new technique (modified biopsy)  on a couple of your neurofibromas and see how your skin responses to it?  \n\nI hope I have given you some options and that maybe there is something to you will think worth pursuing. I would recommend speaking out a Neurofibromatosis specialist about your options. I have a ton of tumors all throughout my body, but only had surgery when it is necessary, whether as preventative, cancerous or to prevent a bigger issue down the line. These tumors can be very difficult to remove, so it is highly recommended to see someone who is familiar with the condition. I am not struggling with neurofibromas but rather with cafe au lait macules. Basically my derm refused treating it as it would cause more issues because I have dark brown skin so. That is the main issue. Oh, I see. Well, there is less literature on Cafe au lait spots, and also less research because they tend to fade in adulthood, but clearly they have not in your case. \n\nDo you have cafe au lait macules that are lighter or darker than your skin?  If darker, read the following:\n\nTo lighten cafe au lait spots, I would suggest you read the literature on vitamin D and even Ketotifen (\n\nand\n\n(\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKetotifen lightened my hyperpigmentation patches since I started it. This is something you might want to look at. In addition, moringa tea has been proven to be even more effective than ketotifen as a mast cell controller. So if buying ketotifen is difficult, trying the tea might be an option. \n\n( Pretty sure laser would be more effective than all of these options. Imo the best option is meeting up with a different dermatologist.", "Do I have NF? I have cafe au lait spots all over my entire body, since i was born. Ive gotten more over time and now have hundreds, im a 24 yr old female. I also have freckling just above my groin area. I mentioned it to a doctor once but he just said okay and nothing else so I was not sure if it mattered. Lately I have been having fluttering and pausing sensations in my heart and moments of detachment/confusion/disassociation every day, a few times a day for a few seconds and pressure in my head. Doctors just said im probably anxious, just thought I would finally look into NF since im having some more concerning symptoms. The \"official\" criteria for diagnosis is two or more of the following\n\n1.Six or more caf\u00e9-au-lait macules over 5 mm in diameter in prepubertal individuals and over 15mm in greatest diameter in postpubertal individuals.\n2. Two or more neurofibromas of any type or one plexiform neurofibroma.\n3. Freckling in the axillary or inguinal regions.\n4. Two or more Lisch nodules (iris hamartomas).\n5. Optic glioma.\n6. A distinctive osseous lesion such as sphenoid dysplasia or thinning of long bone cortex, with or without pseudarthrosis.\n7. First-degree relative (parent, sibling, or offspring) with NF-1 by the above criteria.\n\nFrom your description  it sounds as though you qualify since you have #1 and #3. However you should see a doctor for a more concrete diagnosis, and do not accept \"okay\" for an answer.\n\nDoctors can be understandably frustrated if a patient Googles symptoms comes jn and tries to give themselves a diagnosis, but a good doctor should still listen to and address your concerns. &gt;st above my groin area. I mentioned it to a doctor once but he just said okay and nothing else so I was not sure if it mattered.

Doctors just said im probably anxious, just thought I would finally look into NF since im having some more\n\nExactly this. \\^\\^\\^\\^ There are a lot of conditions that can overlap in their symptoms. Tell your doctor, \"Hey. I have \\. I know these can indicators that I have NF. I am concerned because \\ I would like to get tested/Get an MRI so I can treated if it is NF, or rule it out if it is not.\"\n\nMake sure you focus on the head issues and how it is impacting your life: Does it make you feel unsafe to be outside? Unsafe driving? Feel like you will faint. The doctors will pay more attention if you say exactly how it is impacting my life and not just \"My arm hurts when I do this.\" \n\nYour doctor definitely should not have dismissed you like that cause it is weird having detachment issues. But again, it could be anxiety (that needs to be treated.), or it could be something else.\n\nBest of luck in getting treatment Look into legius syndrome also. I have Neurofibromatosis and according my my doctor who is one of the top in Neurofibromatosis field and who had diagnosed me 20 years ago has said I am on the more severe side, but I have never experienced any fluttering or sensations in my heart and never have felt detached or confused on a daily basis.\n\nNow that is not to say you do not have NF as it can effect everyone differently, but it would be best to discuss what is going on with your doctor. If your doctor will not listen to you then it might be time to find a new doctor.", "Worried about having this disorder and i am feeling awful please help! Hello I am 17 years old and have ADHD, scoliosis,  and hydrocephalus. I have had all of these things for a very long time now and have never thought much of it. In March 2020 I grew a decently size darker area under my armpit and its flat. I never thought much of it until it did not go away. In early August 2021 I went to a doctor who said he suspects I have neurofibromatosis but is not sure so he is sending me to another  doctor on September 8th to get it verified. \n\nI did not think much of it back then but today I googled what it is and I am terrified. I do not want to lose my eye sight, hearing, balance, or freaking die because of this I do not want to grow bumps all over my body. \n\nI have been in constant fear almost all day and wanting to cry. I also left for vacation today and I am not even enjoying that because I am so upset. I already have major body image issues and I cannot deal with this.\n\nDoes anyone else think this is likely neurofibromatosis? Nf is a common genetic disorder that most people who have it live functioning lives with above average dr intervention. Sounds like you are already no stranger to health problems. I also have hydrocephalus, scoliosis and adhd as it turns out. I had to have a few surgeries when I was your age but things settled down once I was fully grown. I am married and work full time and I live a pretty normal life with the occasional...\"yo doc wtf is this?.... Okay I will keep an eye on it\"\n\n If you have nf, then with what you have explained it is just an answer to the question of  what the overarching problem is--the things you have already been managing. It would not change much. The things you described are known to happen to people with NF (as I said those exact ones are my struggles too). Generally that is as bad as it gets. Hard to say it like that because it can still be a huge struggle, but all things considered the common experience of NF COULD be worse...\n\nNF will not kill you silently. If something does not seem right you go to the doctor you find a solution. It will not kill you in your sleep. \n\nAll this being said, I think self diagnosing is a bad idea, especially if you are prone to anxiety and dwelling on fears. Even still, we all have NF and it sucks sometimes but our lives are also beautiful and yours will be too. I am not a doctor so I cannot say anything about if you have it or not. But as a fellow teen with NF, I feel for you OP. Living with a disorder sucks, but we still have to make the most out of what we have. \n\nAlso, high school is just hard. I lowkey want out of there and to start over entirely. Being a teenager, NF or not, just sucks.\n\nAnd crying is normal. I cry, we all cry. Honestly for me just sobbing into my pillow for a few minutes makes me feel better.\n\nAlso, being diagnosed with NF does not suddenly change you body, make you die, etc. It just puts a label on what you have already experienced. And although labels suck, it is really just that in retrospect. A shitty label, but still a label.\n\nI cannot really say much else other than to hang in there. It is going to be hard, but it is possible to be strong. \u2764\ufe0f I have NF and live normally. I do not even think about at all really. I was not diagnosed until I was 15, I am 38 now. I suggest do not look up this condition on the internet, while I have been told by my doctor that I have one of the more severe cases of it, I do not look anything close to the pictures online that you see.\n\nI do have some balance kisses, but I do not need a cane. I am still able to drive. My hearing is fine. I do have some eye issues, but do not need  glasses. I was born with a right lazy eye, which is something I got from my mom. She was born with one too, but surgery corrected hers when she was young. Unfortunately for me surgery did not correct mine.\n\nIf have had four surgeries related to my Neurofibromatosis. I am still able to live a pretty normal life. If you have any questions, let me know. Do you have any tumors internal or external? Also how does neurofibromatosis effect you If you do not mind me asking what were the surgery for specifically (ex. Tumor on hand). And how old were you when you had your first surgery They were all to remove tumors.\n\nLower right arm, this was done as a preventative. It was in 2001 and I was 17.\n\nCervical spine, I had tumors pressing against my cervical spine. This was done in 2006.\n\nUpper right leg, I had a cancerous tumor removed. This was done in 2014.\n\nUpper right arms, I had a cancerous tumor removed. This was done in 2018.\n\nI never needed any chemo or radiation done in case you were wondering. If you have any more questions, just let me know. I have NF and I have pretty much a normal life. Have had a bunch of brain surgeries, but have not been stressed about them at all. I never really think about it. I play a lot of golf and have a very active social life. I have ADHD and have something called kyphosis (similar to scoliosis). Definitely do not be worried about your condition (if you in fact have NF). Things can change over time as NF is progressive. How old are you if I may ask I am 36 Sorry I forgot to ask, how old were you when you had your first surgery. Had my first at age 4 to put a shunt in for hydrocephalus. I actually had one tumor which had nothing to do with NF. I have had 25 shunt revisions, but nothing since 2009. One tiny little lump on my back that is basically unnoticeable. Other than that, nothing besides a bunch of birth marks. Does not effect me at all. I have NF, I was diagnosed at 12, and I am (near enough) 29 now \n\nI have had a few surgeries, and obviously have annual MRI scans because of optic nerve tumours, but other than that I do not even think about it. \n\nI am very active, climbing 3 times a week, regularly going on multi day hikes, and I would say that mostly I enjoy life. I do not understand how you all are so happy. If it turns out I do have this disease I do not know if I will be able to live with it, and no I am not suicidal.  I do not want to have surgery a lot and constantly spend money on a MRI scan. It sounds depressing.  And the thought of growing tumors on my body terrifies me. The thought of possibly losing your eye sight or hearing terrfies me. I cannot handle this, I hope I find out on the 8th. I will keep you all posted. I cannot speak for everyone else, but I definitely have not always been happy. \n\nI have struggled hard in the past, but I have learned to accept it. \n\nI will admit that the possibility of losing my eyesight is terrifying, but I just take the view of it has not happened yet, so it is unlikely to happen.\n\nAnd yeah, I admit that I am very lucky to live in a country with universal healthcare, so surgery and MRI scans do not cost anything, which I am very grateful for.\n\nHonestly though, do not spend your life worrying about what might happen, we can all only focus on the here and now. \n\nYou will be fine, and we are a pretty supportive bunch of people in here, who are happy to answer pretty much any questions. I was diagnosed when I was 7 when my severe scoliosis was noticed. I had spinal fusion surgery at that time to correct the curve. I also have ADHD. \n\nThe biggest impact NF has had on me is in having children. NF is not something I wanted to pass on so my husband and I did IVF with genetic testing to avoid it. Expensive but worth it. I am 34 btw. \n\nI have many small external tumors, a few on my face which of course I hate but I still feel pretty. I have 1 internal I am aware of and I have a doc appt next month where they will write an rx for me to go get a full body mri to check for others. I should of noted in op that my scoliosis is quite minor, at first it had a slight curve to the right then it was left. When I was last checked it was straight but that may of changed. I am assuming they would of noticed tumors when they did all the scans back then.\n\nAnyways, does makeup help with hiding the tumors on your face if you have tried that? Also have you had any surgery aside from your back and when did your first tumors form. I had a small one removed on my stomach at 17 for cosmetic reasons. I had that one since I can remember. The ones on my face are small but not flat so coverup does not really do much. I have one on my eyelid that is grown a bit recently due to pregnancy hormones and I am planning to discuss removal because it makes my eyelid thicker and it is starting to interfere with mt vision when I need to squint in bright light. I am 15 and I have been diagnosed since I remember, I do not know how old you are but you usually develop most of your tumours through puberty (obviously it is different for everyone so i cannot say for certain). I also have ADHD and (minor) scoliosis (these can both develop because of NF, so along with the dark patch it is a sign)\nBut I would not worry, if that is the only thing you have noticed and you are 17 I am sure you will not have anything severe as the people that do, have had it severe since childhood. \nI have more of a mild version so I have around 5 in total small bumps across my body, which are not noticeable at all, unless pointed out.\nThe only part of my life it affects me is with my coordination and learning difficulties. \nYou have gone through the hard bit and are not sure if you have it. Please do not worry. It is not so bad, I live my life completely normally, and if you have been already you will! Were those above the skin or below it ? And what were the sizes ? How many tumors do you have ? Sorry for so many questions What were those surgeries for and where ? If you can tell please Were the removed tumor on the skin or below them ? My doctor said that it can do nerve problems so he hesitates to remove it but I really want them removed On the skin The tumors I had removed are inside they were wrapped around my nerves, as are all the tumors I have. They are all different sizes. I have tumors all throughout my body, not sure on the number. Were the tumors subcutaneous (just below the skin) or deep rooted ? Also can You like tell me a rough size estimate , were it bigger than an inch ? And did you get any numbness after removing the tumors , like nerve damage or something ? Because my doctor said that dermal neurofibromas never turn cancerous , and since you had cancerous ones , were they plexiform ones from birth ? The tumors are wrapped around my nerves. I really have no idea on the extract size of the tumors or really even an estimate. I just know they are different sizes. I do know that the last one I had removed was ankhs they size of an egg. I do have some numbness and weakness. For the cancerous tumors they were plexiform ones, but I do not believe had these tumors at birth, they came about over time as I go older, growing and eventually becoming cancerous. Thanks for answering :) You are welcome.", "People with NF1 that had to wear any kind of brace, did wearing the brace make you insecure? \n\n( I had to wear a bunch of braces when I was really young, age 4-6 or 7. I had a brace that I called \u201cthe halo\u201d because 8 needed it to fuse my spine. It was basically a regular brace with a metal halo around me head and then crews around the halo that were literally embedded in my head. I had to wear that for a few months. When I was young I was much stronger emotionally and kept going to school and everything and didnt even notice what anyone thought. I even had a birthday party with it. Such a brave person. I was never that confident with my back brace... probably because I am a teen and you were very young.\n\nHow did you feel when people stared at you for the braces?\n\nWhen my back brace which I used to wear (scoliosis) peeked out from under my shirt I would feel quite embarrassed...  I also had a halo when I was younger due to a spinal fusion. I was about 10 though and had to wear it for 6 months. It was originally only supposed to be 3 but the fusion did not hold twice so surgeons had to go in and fix it 2 times. \n\nAlso had a small neck brace when I was about 6 for a fusion but the one when I was ten was more complicated, needing the halo.\n\nI was young at the time so it was really more uncomfortable to wear than anything.

My classmates were really nice and supportive.", "I feel like doctors do not take me having neurofibromatosis seriously Every time I go to some doctor, I tell them I have neurofibroatosis which they just dismiss and do not think it is not important for my problems, I also have some trauma of when I got  the diagnostic when I was a kid and the doctor was rude to me and made me feel ashamed and guilty for having this. I feel like they just are ignorant about this condition so this is why they do not take it seriously, only one doctor has taken it seriously, on the top of that I live in a third world country and there are almost no specialist, and none where I live. I feel so alone and I am so afraid that no doctor will me take seriously and will die of this, also I am afraid that I will not have enough money for surgery since I do not know if my country's healthcare cover them(at least for neurofibromatosis) and if they do I will have to wait years since that is how it works where I live. Sorry for the rant but I feel soo alone, I hate having this, I have how it seems under researched,  I hate living in a shitty country. I live in America and have not had any better luck with doctors when talking about NF. A lot of them do not even know what it is. \nI have been dealing with a glomus tumor for about 12 years and the pain has getting progressively worse over the last 3 years. Cannot find any doctors to listen to me. They just kind of brush it off. One doctor tried to tell me that it was probably skin cancer. For 10 fucking years? I do not think so. \nI hate having NF as well. I hate that it seems to be unknown, but from things I have read, they are doing more and more research all the time. They have even come out with a drug that can help with plexiform fibromas.\nI am really sorry you are dealing with this, but please know that you are not alone. I do not think this sub is very big, but there are people here who are also dealing with NF and a lot of them are also very knowledgable. Have you tried looking for a specialist? When I was a kid my parents were recommended one, he actuality diagnosed me when I was 15. I been going to him for 22 years.\n\n\nI am sorry you have not been lucky with your primary doctors. I was lucky enough that growing up my pediatrician always believed I had Neurofibromatosis, so she kept an eye out for it and had my parents to me to the university of Michigan when I was nine, but they could not confirm whether I did or did not. It was not until I was 15 when things took off, because of puberty. So then she turned to a clinic in Grand Rapids that specializes in nf, but they said for me to go to University of Chicago. And that is where I have met my current specialist. Since then my primary doctor has changed, after my pediatrician, I had three different primary doctor. Two retired and I have had my new one for almost a year. They have all been pretty great and help with communicating with my doctor in Chicago. \n\nI hope that you are able to find doctors that will listen to you and have at least some understanding of nf.\n\nHere is the info about the drug that was approved by the fda not too long ago. Next week I will be starting a bunch of test my doctor wants to have done, before he puts me on the medication.\n No, I have not looked for a specialist. I cannot afford it but I do not even know where to start if I could. I live in a small town and the doctors do not seem to know much outside of what is common. \nMy daughter has had great doctors. The pediatricians know what NF is and referred specialists and she is been getting amazing care. She actually just had brain surgery in July from one of the highest-rated doctors in the state. I am thankful for that at least. The probably with NF is that it is not a common disease so most doctors do not even know how to spell it let alone what it is about. Thankfully the doctor my parents took me to when I was sick as a kid knew about it...and got us to an eye doctor who he actually done a case study about it when he was pre-med.\n\nI have not been as lucky since I moved to Florida. I did go to a good rheumatologist who actually researched NF which definitely helped with diagnosing why I have been in so much pain. \n\nI recommend using the link that someone else posted on here and finding a doctor nearby. If you are able, maybe try visiting one that is close to you...even if you only go every couple of years to see them, it is better than having someone who does not know. \n\nEven though I am 1000 miles away from my dr in PA, I still get MRI results sent up to him because I know I can trust him. 1000 miles is 1609.34 km This may sound a little weird, but even though you are not the patient, I would talk to her pediatrician and tell her about your issue. Sometimes specialty children's hospitals will make exceptions for adults, especially when they are teaching hospitals. You can always approach the subject with the main question being if she knows of any specialist she can direct you towards for adult NF care. I have thought about that but I feel guilty hijacking my child\u2019s appointment like that. I did not mean during your child's appointment! Why would anyone take that precious time away from a child who needs it? You can do that on your own time separately. Lol. Well, it feels kind of weird just randomly asking too. Currently I am just trying to find a doctor who can remove the glomus tumor, preferably one who has done it before. Will probably need to go to a bigger city, but that is okay. Have you checked out Children's Tumor Foundation? They also connect adults with specialists. That is one of the reasons why I mentioned your daughter's specialist, because they (pediatric specialists) sometimes work with adults, especially if it comes to surgery within a teaching hospital setting. I know on the Inspire forums for Neurofibromatosis, there are quite a few people who have contacted CTF directly to get into contact with surgeons for tumor removal. I think they might even be able to connect people with financial help as well, but I am not certain. I have checked them out for my daughter but it for myself. There is an NF clinic in Overland Park, KS that I found a few years ago but I never called them. It would be quite a drive but not too terribly far. I might call them next week just to see if I need a referral or what. Every single doctor ive been to has dismissed it/and my concerns. I live in Australia, so a first world nation- not many doctors know about it like they do in the U.S- However i think the reason why they are so dismissive/dont give a shit is because at the end of the day we are all 'lost causes'. They dont know what will happen and they cant cure it. I think most doctors feel like they can do more for cancer patients.", "What kind of doctors do you see? My question is, what kind of specialist should I be seeing? Who do you see? What drugs to you take to slow the growth of the external bumps? \n\nI was diagnosed with type 1 when I was under 10 when my mom was, I am in my mid 30s now. I have never seen a specialist for NF because I only recently found out they exist (and the local one is not accepting new patients). I have seen a lot here say they see a neurologist, but I just asked my PCP for a referral and she asked what my goal was. She asked if I just want some growths removed, and that a dermatologist would be a better option for that. Last year when I mentioned getting an MRI, she said they are not necessary. I had one once, to check my spine and brain for tumors about 15 years ago but I have no idea how that came to be. She did order one, however, for my knee as I have a giant growth there (7x3.5x13.8cm ... biopsy done, non cancerous). \n\nI have a fair amount of fibromas on my trunk, it hurts to put on a bra or shirt. It hurts when someone pats my back during a hug (EVERYONE does that back tap during a hug). It sucks.  I just want to receive treatment and do not really know where to start. We are supposed to get MRI once a year. I went 10 years without one and did not think my neurologist or doctor would ever stop talking about it. ( I was a kid, not my fault my parents never took me) \n\nI do not take any drugs other than OTC pain medication and ice packs. Wish I could do one of the promising trials though. Check to see if there is a NF support group around where you live.  They might be able to give more information about what doctors are good in your area.  I wish that I could help more but I have not seen a doctor specifically for NF in a long time. I would caution you against following your PCPs advice. Cutaneous neurofibromas are generally not able to be removed by a dermatologist. Typically, you will need to go to a plastic surgeon familiar with NF1 specifically. We do see a neurologist for my son, but my son is only 4 years old. I believe once he is finished puberty the neurologist will be less important. &gt;We are supposed to get MRI once a year.\n\nOh... That is good to know! When I was diagnosed the doctors (not at my family doctor, but it was at an endocrinologist centre) were just like \"do not think about it, and just go to the doctor if you get any new symptoms\". Extreme caution with this one.  The tumor on my stomach was supposed to be extremely small and eady to remove.  The nurse, the other new nurses and the doctors faces went right when they found out how deep and huge it was.  They removed it inside the doctors office.  The large nerve that runs under the skin of your stomach is over an inch in diameter.  I was told to never have any tumors removed again without being under full anesthesia. You should be followed by an NF specialist which will involve annual checks with MRI as long as nothing troubling is happening. \nAs you may already realize NF can cause problems that are not visible but can be problematic.  That is why the MRIs are important. \nDermatologist is not the right place for fibroma removal.  \nDoes not sound like your PCP has any idea about NF.  If you need referrals to come from her because of insurance then I would change to a new PCP.  \nTo find a specialist check NFnetwork.org(nfnetwork.org) they maintain a database by geography.  You can also check with big/teaching hospitals near you.  NF specialists are sometimes part of neurology and sometimes pediatrics. Do not let the pediatric label dissuade you.  \nIt is really worth the effort to find one.  \nGood luck! **I found links in your comment that were not hyperlinked:**\n\n* (\n\n*I did the honors for you.*\n\n***\n\n^( ^| ^( ^| ^&lt;3 Thanks! I have searched the NF network, the only clinic near me is a teaching hospital (UC Davis) and they are not accepting new patients.  I could try San Francisco, which is 1.5-3.5 hours away depending on the bay bridge (traffic is a bitch!). \nMy PCP had emailed back saying a neurologist is not the way to go as they cannot remove and asked what my goals are. \nI basically said I do want some removed because it hurts to even put on a shirt because it tugs on them, that hugs hurt when someone does that back-tap and it feels like they are wearing a needle-glove. That the last time I saw a dermatologist he dismissed my concerns and only looped one off of my nipple so I could breast feed. But, I want to see anyone who is very familiar with NF so they can guide me. I also said that I have heard many in (this) NF group discuss medications to suppress growths. \nIDK, I guess I just need a new PCP. It sucks because she really is great outside of lack of NF knowledge. Good bot Thank you, I_comment_on_stuff_, for voting on LinkifyBot.\n\nThis bot wants to find the best and worst bots on Reddit. (\n\n***\n\n^(Even if I do not reply to your comment, I am still listening for votes. Check the webpage to see if your vote registered!) OMG that is terrifying! Yeah!! You def need to drop that doc!!  LOL sounds like a game show!  I know there are others on here that know what is available in California so maybe post for just that question.  If I were in your shoes, and there were no other options, I would get myself an appointment with a neurologist or plastic surgeon at UC Davis.  Then they can help you get into the NF clinic from inside the system.  \nThis is a much underrated symptom of NF:  Having to be your own advocate.  It is really hard especially when you are having symptoms and are feeling crummy, but that is when it is most important to put your big boy/girl pants on and do some guerrilla warfare.  Make those camo pants if it helps!  \nThink of the person who has loved you most in all the world.  Then imagine you are that person and fight as hard as they would fight for you. Thank you. I did meet with an oncologist at UCD because of a giant tumor in my knee (not cancer, woo!). I asked him for a referral to the NF clinic, but I need to follow up. Maybe an insider, like you said, had more pull. I see my regular primary doctor, I see my Neurofibromatosis specialist and I also see a cancer doctor for precautionary reasons (in both 2014 and 2018 I had some tumors turn cancerous that were removed). If you have any questions let me know.", "NF and tattoos? Does anyone here have experience with getting tattoos over fibromas? I have a few already but none close to my NF spots.\n\nI should clarify, most of mine are not raised bumps (like my dad\u2019s and brother\u2019s are, and like most pictures of NF cases I have seen). I have got a few like that, but most feel more internal? There is still a mass, but it is more internal. I am 25F and a lot of these spots are on my boobs and thighs. They are the fleshiest parts of me so maybe that is a contributing factor to why they are not as bumpy, but there is also a quarter sized one on my back so who knows.\n\nInstead of a bump, i just feel a hole in a lower layer of skin. Imagine punching a hole in a sheet of paper and laying another sheet on top of it, that is the best way I can describe it.\n\nI have not found any information regarding spots like these, or if they are even fibromas. But they seem like they would be okay to tattoo over since they are more internal rather than a raised bump. Yeah, it will probably hurt more, but tattoos help me to hate my body less so it is absolutely worth it.\n\nIf anyone has any more info about these spots, I would love to hear it! Hey, that is exactly like most of mine. I have a handful of ones that are lumps but most are like as you described little holes under the skin.\nI do not have any tattoos over any of them, but I do not imagine it should cause a problem. I have had a tattoo over a spot similar to what you describe without any issues. I thought it might be a problem, but the ink has held up well. I would speak with your Neurofibromatosis specialist about this. I was not diagnosed until I was 15 and that when things really started taking off for me with the growing of tumors and over the last twenty years it has unfortunately gotten worse. There is also something about tattoos and MRI scans, I have had many MRI scans over the years and on the form I have to sign every time, they ask about having any tattoos. I do not know how often you have MRIs, I tend to have them once a year if not every six months. I have one of these 'holes' on my back... I never even considered if it was NF related, since it is only one.  I do not even know if it is under a CAL patch or not, I never thought to look.  My NF is mostly just my body covered in CALs and I have hypertension.  I have often wondered how my NF might react to tattoos though. I figured it would not hurt to at least try over one of the smaller ones! Awesome! Makes me hopeful that I can have the same success! \ud83e\udd1e I think that may have something to do with the tattoo ink, I have had mine show up as questionable spots on airport scanners.\n\nSorry to hear your NF has gotten worse! My NF progression has been pretty slow, I do consider myself lucky with that one. I am not sure if I will need many more MRIs in the future (I have only had 5 and three were at one time for my spine), I have not really talked to my doctor about that. I can only assume it is NF related because I have not been told otherwise, and I have gotten more as I have gotten older so I figured it has to be. I can only hope I do not have ANOTHER condition to worry about \ud83d\ude2b Thank you,\n\nI am happy that you are is not as bad, hopefully yours will stay that way, either way it might be something to discuss with your doctor, it, it could not hurt. Good luck to you and stay healthy. In regards to the tattoos and MRIs, my specialist told me it is due to the metals in black ink. It can cause pulling due to magnetism. For example, I once had a 3.5hr MRI sprint for the whole body, and my tiny tattoo on my clavicle was on FIRE after that much time in the tube. I am sure it is not something else to worry about, I have never asked a doctor about mine.... I just thought I was a weirdo.  Lol.  Maybe ask a general question to non NF'ers and see if anyone else has these?  I know mine feels slightly bruised if pressure is put on it. Yeah, never getting a tattoo (not that I have ever consider one, never would pay for pain when I already have pain). I generally in the MRI 2-4 hours every time I have one, because of how much needs to be scanned. I am getting my first tattoo on Thursday. I have NF1. Are there anything that I need to be aware about. Unfortunately I cannot really tell you! None of my tattoos are on/near NF spots (at least not yet). Unless you are getting the tattoo in an area with NF spots/fibromas, I would not worry, but I would talk to your tattoo artist if you are concerned. Even if they are unfamiliar with NF, they may be able to give you some advice. Ok. It is going to be by my rise,which has no spots by my rust. I am covered in tattoos by about 50% of my body. I get MRIs every 4-5 months if not more. In the US they are should not be any metals in the black inks, unless it is old work.  I have had no issue I do not know, I just know every time I have to have a mri done, that question is always asked on the form. You should be fine, I have one of the most severe cases of nf and I have about 50% coverage of my body in tattoos. I have had no issues. I get about 6-8 mris a year. Ok. Thank you. My friend is COVERED with tattoos", "Mom still refuses to believe I have NF despite confirmation from multiple doctors. &amp;#x200B;\n\nI was apparently diagnosed when I was 4 years old, but my parents hit it from me until my dad finally told me when I was 22. At that point I had suspicions about it, since I have many of the trademark symptoms - huge cafe au lait spots, short stature, scoliosis, about a dozen tiny neurofibromas (tumors, about the size of a pencil eraser that just look like little skin lumps) and one plexiform neurofibroma (big tumor) on my left side.\n\nI had heard about NF a few times online and brought it up with my mom a couple times when I was a teenager. SHe said I was tested as a kid, but the results were never \"conclusive\" and the fact that I had scoliosis and cafe-au-lait spots was nothing to worry about. \n\nMy dad told me the truth, about six month ago, that I had been diagnosed when I was 4 at Children's Hospital in DC. When I confronted my mom about this, she started screaming and hysterically crying, sobbing, shrieking, saying how she took me to \"all the best doctors\" and did \"everything she could\" and, according to her, all the doctors told her not to worry. She said she was going to bring it up when I was pregnant, when I am at the highest risk in my life of developing tumors and when I pose a 50% risk of passing the disease onto my kids. She said there is no possible way I could have a genetic disorder, that there is absolutely nothing wrong with me  and I am \"too smart\" to have a genetic disorder (wtf?) and doctors just like to put fears in people's heads... etc etc etc.\n\nI had an official diagnosis from a NF doctor about two weeks ago; luckily I have a local NF specialist clinic in Philadelphia. I have literally almost every single symptom of the disease, including a huge tumor on my left side that I am trying to get removed. Mom insists that it is just 'fat', even though I have had it for my entire life and it does not look or feel like fat. The doctor took one look at it and immediately confirmed that it was a plexiform NF. I really should have had it removed years ago, but mom would not acknowledge it as being anything abnormal. When I told her about the appointment and the official diagnosis, she flat-out denied it, still. She maintained that \"doctors will diagnose anyone who walks in the door with anything they feel like\". She kept saying that the lump I have on my side is just \"fat\" and \"you have NEVER had a neurofibroma in your LIFE!\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I told her I needed to get a tumor removed, she was like, \"What, that fat lump you have?\" FAT DOES NOT GROW IN HARD LUMPS, MOM!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny time it comes up, she just insists that I do not have the disease, that I do not have any tumors (I have over a dozen!!!). Her absolute denial of this is baffling to me.\n\nI also apparently had a brain MRI when I was 8 where they found that I had not a brain tumor, but an unusual thickening of the optic nerve in my brain. I need to get an up-to-date brain MRI and a full body MRI to check for internal tumors. This is a health issue I am going to need to deal with for the rest of my life. I have a highly increased risk of multiple types of cancer, and I need to be watching for tumors and related health issues they can cause, and she cannot even even acknowledge a diagnosis because... well, I have no idea why. Maybe she is too proud to admit that she has a daughter with absolutely no medical problems, I have no idea.  Did not you post a few weeks ago/months ago about how your mom hid the diagnosis from you? In that case it seemed less like denial and more like she was purposely hiding it. \n\nYou are an adult and your parents no longer have legal right to your medical records. You have the ability to control this. Does not matter what they do as long as you talk to your doctor and say you do not want your mom knowing they cannot tell her anything. ((\n\nIf you can, get a job with insurance and get out of the house as soon as you can. This is not a healthy relationship to be in.\n\nBut if you have been monitored for it your life like your spinal surgeon says, then why you do you need a full body MRI? Have you had no other MRIs?\n\nI am not doubting your experience, but honestly, the fact that your mom cannot deal with a diagnosis is her problem not yours. I think there might be better support groups . I would recommend The Children's Tumor Foundation. (( They deal with people of all ages with NF and they might be better equipped to help.\n\n&amp;#x200B; Maybe she is got a mild case and cannot deal with having passed it on to you, so she denies it.  Most NF specialists recommend full body MRI periodically  Yeah. I get a regular spine and brain scan every year. But it seemed like from what OP was saying was that they were being monitored in some way which is what confused me I have not had an MRI since I was about 8. The doctors have been \"following\" me at my spinal checkups, but I do not really know what this means. It could be spontaneous and she nevertheless blames herself. My dad's was spontaneous and grandad dealt with it by suspecting dad was not his kid. \n\nI am sorry you are having to deal with that OP, but glad you are getting the treatment now.  Yeah. TBH, not a lot of this is making any kind of sense. My advice still stands: get out and leave your mother behind as soon as you can. The relationship is not healthy and it is unfair for you to be around somebody who has denied you knowledge of a medical condition you have and now is in denial that you ever had it, despite knowing it and taking you to doctors for it when you were younger. She needs help. You just need a check up or two. If possible I would talk with your dad about your feelings and how it is effecting you. Maybe you can do a family meeting or even a family group consoling with a professional, because your moms denial is not a good thing nor is it healthy. I was diagnosed when I was 15, I am 35 now. I have been pretty much having full body scans at least once a year. \n\n\n\n &gt;But if you have been monitored for it your life like your spinal surgeon says, then why you do you need a full body MRI? Have you had no other MRIs?\n\nfrom what I remember (please OP, do correct me if i am wrong) OP's mom is a lawyer and threatened with legal action if the doctor's ever said anything to OP. you are right that she is a lawyer. she did not threaten them with legal action, but she just forbade them from telling me. since i was a minor, whatever she said went. i have only seen my spinal surgeon twice since i turned 18, and only on the second occasion (about 6 months ago, when he was looking at my spine) did the NF come up. And only then because I explicitly asked him about it.  pretty sure the genetic testing they have been able to do to confirm NF is fairly new stuff, and your mom isnt completely wrong that they never provided a \"definitive\" diagnosis.  prior to genetic testing theyd just list all the symptoms, and if you checked enough boxes well then that was enough to get a diagnosis.  GL either way", "Hello everyone Hello, I am kind of new to this sub, been frequenting it on and off but never really posted anything.\n\nI have NF1 and was diagnosed when I was very little. It has not been a huge bother in my life but I have had a lot of fibroma growth on my body. Mostly on my back and chest which makes me feel really insecure.\n\nI have a fairly barge bump on my arm which I am actually getting removed this year. It will be the first surgery I have to remove one. I am pretty excited because I always wear long sleeves to hide it. People always ask what it is and Idk what to say. I also have one on my forehead which does not bother me I have learned to love with but hate when people ask about it (I say it is a scar) and they say well I should get it removed in a rude attitude like it is ugly and would look better without.\nWhat can I expect with surgery? Is there any pain after its gone and have you guys experienced it coming back?\nI have not had an MRI in a really long time since I went through puberty. I am 25 now.\n\nI read here a lot that you guys experience all kinds of other body pain, stiffness, joint pain, high blood pressure. Doctors have never told me about such things. And I never knew that those kinds of symptoms can be related. Can anyone explain all this to me a little? \n\nI do have a fibroma behind my optic nerve which has not given me trouble. And I have slight scoliosis which also has not given me trouble but again these are things I have not checked up on in years.\n\nI hear that this consition can also cause clumsyness? Is this true? Everyone tells me I am super clumsy. I drop a lot of things but I always thought this was because I move fast, I am a pretty speedy person.\n\nLately I have been having problems with my left ear tho idk if this is related to NF. Doctors are not helpful, they see me for literally 3m dismiss me and I leave. My ear is in pain and it feels like it leaks water, it also seems swollen in the center or like there is a bump beneath it. Doctors keep telling me it is allergies but that makes no sense that that is the one and only symptom in my left ear only. All my allergy test came back negative too. I am struggling to find good help. I had problems with my eyes esrlier this year too which was dismissed as allergies by several doctors who just looked at old diagnosis and said the same thing. Eventually it went away on its own but it depressed me to feel so helpless where no doctor could aid. I went to 6 different clinics.\n\nAny of you planning on having kids or have had kids? I do not want to have children because I do not want my consition to get worst I also would not want to pass it down. Idk if that is selfish of me.\n\nSorry to rant, I do not have anyone to talk to about this and never really opened up to friends about it. I opened up to one friend once and she told me I was a liar and did not believe me (shitty friend). My boyfriend knows and does not care about it, it does not bother him and he tells me I am beautiful every day! I love having him by my side.\n\nI guess I am here because I am scared of what is to come in the future of my life. And also to get out insecurities on those days that I feel down. Thanks for all those who listened and contributed here. Glad to be a part of the community.", "Podcast/book Okay, so I am toying with the idea of maybe doing a podcast or writing a book, about my struggles with NF. To give advice and just in general my view point, as someone who is struggled with it since I was a little kid. Any advice or suggestions on weather this could be a good idea or not. I would look to get parts that are my parents views on it as well as my brother's so it could help parents or siblings too. I think is a good idea,but you can also do different episodes if you did a podcast. I had NF since I was a baby. Over all not many people know about nf in general. Also many family have learn about when There kids are diagnosed because it could be the first diagnosed in there family with nf. I would love to contribute to it in any way I can", "NF1 Toddler Hello,\n\nAnyone here dealing with or dealt with their toddler being diagnosed? If so what helped you cope?\n\nMy kiddo was diagnosed before they turned 1 and with every visit we seem to keep getting worse and worse news. I was not diagnosed until I was 15, but my parents said doctors always thought I had it, but test results were always inconclusive. They could not say one way or the other. \n\nIf you have any questions, please let me know We did a gene test which showed kiddo had NF1, our first sign was the Cafe au leit spots all over kiddos body. Kiddos neurologist seemed hopeful that was going to be the only sign of their NF but and MRI scan proved that would not be the case. \n\nHas NF had a huge impact on your life? Hello.  My baby was diagnosed before she was one.  In fact, she was diagnosed at only 4 months.  The first months were so tough, especially with all the Google searches turning up heartbreaking stories.  \nMay i ask what lead your baby to need an MRI?  It is my understanding that MRI\u2019s are not typically done for babies with NF1 unless there are signs that one is needed. Especially because of the required sedation. My kiddo is 2 now and we noticed a bump on their  back that seemed to double in size within a month which concerned us. We took them to the neurologist who decided to get an MRI done of their back and head (Ophthalmologist noticed that their pupils were \"blury\" when they had their yearly eye exam). \n\nSedation was terrifying for me but kiddo had amazing nurses that distracted them and made them feel at ease. Procedure from start to finish took about 3 hours and they were back to their regular selves as soon as they woke up.\n\nIs your daughter the first in the family? Has the \"bump\" in your child been identified as a plexiform? Having them removed when small and unproblematic might be a good option ( \n\nHave you already received the report on the optic nerves and chiasm? Good nurses are so important, I am glad your kiddo had them for such a scary experience. Yes, my daughter is the first in the family.  We see specialists every 3 months on top of her regular check ups. I was diagnosed at 10. Although I have had growths of concern requiring surgery, at 29 I found my quality of life improved taking vitamins, a whole feeds diet and cannabis. My pain has greatly reduced, I have less migraines and more energy. If you want to chat at all please feel free to reach out. X Yes, they told us they will not do anything to it until it becomes problematic. I am assuming that maybe due to kiddos age? \n\nYes, they were concerned/amazed with the findings so we have to go back in a few weeks and get another sedated MRI. Kiddos optic nerve is apparently double the size of NF patients and they are having no side effect from it. Our kiddo is the first in the family too, which to me makes it more frustrating because i just have more questions then answers on what caused the gene mutation. \n\nMay I ask what caused you to get your daughter tested for NF? Which vitamins are you using? Also, what is a feeds diet?\n\nI have been looking at alternative medicine options since the doctors have told us kiddo will require chemo the question is just when. \n\nI have bad zero luck on the alternative medicine options though \ud83d\ude14. I am also mind blow by how many NF patients there are and chemo is still the only option with today's technology. Hey, my son was diagnosed at 6 months, he is 5 now. We have had bumps along the way including 18 months of chemotherapy for bilateral optic gliomas.  I can definitely relate to each appt revealing worse news. Feel free to reach out if you want to chat. My son has NF1 &amp; he is 7 yrs old. 7 yrs old &amp; he is still in 4-5 clothing. He has annual check-ups with the specialists. We recently had a phone call from the specialist, who then said my little boys hormone levels were dropping which is bad he does not seem to be growing as normal. The specialist was thinking about putting my little boy on steroids, but he said with steroids it can make the tumours grow faster which they do not want &amp; they will want to do a brain scan on him, which we agreed to. Because he is only a child they will have to put him to sleep for the scan. The doctor said with COVID19 everything is a bit behind &amp; the scan can take up to, 9 to 11 months... He also has sunken chest, where his ribcage is inside his body. If you do not mind me asking how did your son do with the chemo? Did he receive it via IV or the oral? More importantly how is he doing now? I am so sorry, I hope they come up with a solution that can help him with his hormones but not cause any reactions to his NF. \n\nAre you seeing a \"regular\" doctor for your son's NF or are you seeing NF Clinical Specialist? I can relate one hundred percent with how you are feeling.  Yes you may ask anything you like - I will send you a private message if that is ok. Yes that is perfectly fine! I am not the original commenter, but I am assuming they meant a \"whole foods\" diet, which is generally beneficial.\n\nAlso, you can look at some content from Dr. Yohay. He is a pediatric nf specialist in NYC, and people have posted his presentations on YouTube. He does mention some vitamins, new studies and offers helpful information. Thank you for this info,  I will definitely take a look at the videos. For the most part no, I do have limitations, but I am able to do most things, like drive and get around on my own without a cane or assistance. Hope they are ok. Lots of people have vary mild symptoms :) He did relatively well. He started it almost 3 years ago now so at the time in Canada, Vinblastine (IV) was the standard treatment for NF1+ gliomas. I think now parents would have a choice between Vinblastine or a Trametinib (MEK inhibitor) study.\n\nHe is doing well now, the gliomas actually showed zero growth between initial discovery and the time he started chemo 2 months later, and have not grown since. It makes me wonder if it was all pointless but you cannot take the chance. That is good to know, thank you for making me feel a bit at ease. You are welcome Unfortunately for my kiddo that does not seem like it will be the case but I am trying to remain hopeful That is good to know. Was there anything you guys did for him that made the treatments easier and less scary? He was 2.5yrs when he started so he did not really know any differently. He still goes for port flushes every 6 weeks as we have not yet removed it. He really hates them now as he is more self aware but the hospital (McMaster Children's Hospital in Ontario) has amazing child life specialists that bring tablets or other toys into the room to help distract the kids. Not a parent, a teenager, but hang in there. NF is hard. Try and connect with another parent who has a kid with NF so your kiddo has a buddy. I have heard of people doing this for other conditions but do not really know that much about it. We are in the United States and recently started going to Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. I am hoping they are amazing as well since they are a children's hospital and they are the top NF clinic on the East Coast. \n\nDo you know if the port is a standard? My kiddo is not one who leaves things alone that are on their body. The drug informs the delivery mechanism... Since we needed a drug that is only delivered intravenously we needed a port. My understanding is that the US is usually a bit ahead of Canada in terms of drug approvals so my bet would be an optic glioma diagnosed today in the states would get an oral chemo like Selumetinib The doctors said we have the option of oral or IV so I am curious to find out if one way is better then the other. Your story sounds just like ours!  My son was diagnosed at 3.5 years with bilateral optic gliomas and large plexiform on low back.  We did 1 yr of iv chemo plus surgery.  One glioma disappeared, the other stopped growing.  He is now blind in one eye and has perfect vision in the other.   \nOur most recent full body scan revealed some tumors that we were not aware of, but I would always prefer to know about them so we can watch them.   \nHe is 13 years old now.  When he was little I NEVER told him he was sick.  Still do not refer to NF as a disease.  The time we have spent in the hospital has always been fun.  We never had appointments.  Only adventures.  He has only positive memories of those early years after diagnosis.  Since he was so young I bought him an iPad at the start of chemo.  We only used it while at the hospital which was then something to look forward to.   \nWe have a bit of a scare right now, and the other night he was crying in my arms, worried about the outcome.  I told him what I will tell you:  We cannot control it, and we do not know what is next.  So we put one foot in front of the other and always do the next right thing - call the doc, get imaging, schedule surgery\u2026.whatever is required.  We do the next right thing.  And then the next.  \nWith NF you do not know what, if anything, is going to happen next.  Control what you can, do what you can, but do not wallow in \u2018what if..\u2019 it will distract you; just be vigilant.  Know you are not alone.\n\nAfter reading some of your other comments in this thread, I will add a bit more\u2026.\nChemo we had was vinchristine and carboplatin.  He was ported which was better than regular IV.  Post was placed in the center of his chest which was a great choice because the scar now is not visible unless he is shirtless, usually it is placed high and can be noticed with a more open collared shirt.  The docs described this protocol as \u2018chemo light\u2019.  He did not lose his hair.  He would occasionally vomit within an hour of completing chemo, but not any other time.  He had no appetite throughout treatment and after a year he only weighed 2/3 of what he weighed at the start, but he was not starving!  I fed him a lot of smoothies and milkshakes which were easier to get him to eat than actual food.   It was def not as bad as I had imagined!!!   \nI see you are probably nearby.  We are in Annapolis MD and go to Hopkins. Thank you, I will keep that in mind.  \n\nHow did your son handle the chemo and surgery? Did he have a quick recovery? I added some comments about the chemo to my post.   Surgery was no biggie.  He was hurting for the first 24 hours, but fine with his drip of pain meds.  We went home about 30 hours after surgery (this was brain surgery, not port placement) and it was smooth sailing from there. \nPort placement is no biggie.   Outpatient.  \nI understand what you said about how hard it is seeing your child get sedated.  Keep in mind you have choices.  The anesthesiologist will always want to use gas.  It is easier for them.  My son could not stand it so I have always insisted on IV sedation (which they use anyway after the gas).   My guy also needs a certain cocktail of meds as he comes out of anesthesia to make it a smooth transition.  I have to request this, but they are obliging.   \nWith MRIs I told my son that since he had something very special happening in his brain the doctors really wanted special pictures of it. Hi yes whole foods. I eat 80% whole feeds (fruits vegetables nuts seeds whole meal bread or rices) and 20% whatever I want. \n\nSupplements I would recommend circumin &amp; black pepper (that is one vitamin as the pepper helps with the digestion), reishi mushrooms, broccoli sprout extract and black seed oil x x I want to say thank you to everyone who has replied with their story. I feel a little better knowing that even though things can be scary at the end of the day it will all be ok in one way or another. Genetic doctors in the UK, in. Manchester. They are specialist. Well, I do not have any kids myself, but I was diagnosed with NF1 at around age 5 and underwent cytostatic-treatment at age 7. Ever since, my condition has been more or less stable and the tumour is not growing. They say if no radical changes occur during puberty it is less likely they will occur after and it has been true for me so far.\n\nUndergoing chemo I fell back a little in school and had mild difficulties learning how to write and also suffered from reduced co-ordination. I have managed to get myself a BA-degree and am not any more less normal than other people of my age as far as mental/cognitional ability goes and I do not have any disfigurements. Lots of CAL-spots on my body and only four small fibromas (that did not show up until much later in life) on my upper-body. \n\nI am 29 today and live a \"normal\" life. Apart from reduced vision I do not really have any problems. I had to undergo decompression surgery of my optic canal two years ago though and they say I will most likely need a second for my right side as well, but not as long as things stay as they are right now.\n\nNF is very unpredictable and varies a lot from case to case and individual to individual, so it is really hard to say what to expect. I cross my fingers and hope you and our child will be able to get through this with as few complications and trouble as possible.PS. I heard there is a new drug (Koselugo) that has been approved with proven success in treating NF1 in children (not sure if they are planning to us it on adults too); maybe that is something you could look into or discuss with your child's neurologist/other professional. Thank you for your reply. Couple of dumb questions, what is and what does  cystostatic-treatment consist of? As well, what do they do during decompression surgery?\n\nI have learned that Koselugo is only approved to work on specific items related to NF unfortunately none of what my kiddo has. I know there are a couple of therapies (gene and autoimmune) that are in clinical trials now that are typically way less harsher then chemo so mom me is being hopeful that they will be approved by the time kiddo needs therapy. Cytostatic-treament is a form of chemo. In short it is a drug that inhibits cell-division. It was pretty rough as it made me physically weaker than my classmates and caused tiredness as well as pain. I wore a portacath under my skin in the chest through which I was given the drugs and this caused some insecurities since it resulted in staring and comments such as \"did you swallow a bottle cap or what is that?\"\n\nOptic decompression surgery is a form of neuro-surgery that removes bone from the optic canal to give the optic nerve more space. My tumour had put a lot of pressure there and my optic nerve needed \"breathing space\". It is a very complicated procedure, but has a very high success rate. I will most likely need it on my right side as well, but although it is a procedure with a high success rate there is - of course - always a risk (they may slit the optic nerve resulting in blindness) they are not willing to take unless it is really needed. \n\nI have not looked too much into Koselugo, but it sucks to hear it is not working on your child. The positive thing to take from it, however, is that the drug is out and that research is still going on. Hopefully, it will lead to more amazing beeakthroughs in the future. \n\nNF is a very unpredictable condition that varies from individual to individual, but I would like to think it is a good thing your child was diagnosed so early. :)\n\nI do not want to say that kids are too stupid to understand, but I think it is even harder for a parent in a sense. When I got the treatment I did not really know what was going on and was too young to understand the big words. I also kind of thought it was normal for kids to visit the hospital every week. \n\nI wish your child and your family the best and hope you will get through this with happiness intact. \n\nStay strong! My last 2 brain cells did not realize there were different types of chemo, I just assumed when chemo is mentioned it is all the same type. \n\nI am glad that both procedures were a success for you! I have heard success stories from others so it give me hope that regardless of how bad the procedure sounds that it ends up being better at the end of it. \n\nThank you! We had an MRI 2 weeks ago and we got good news (the massive tumor they thought was on his spine is non existent) we are now in a happy place until the next MRI comes around then we turn into a nervous wreck. But happy and positive thoughts is what I try to keep in my head thanks to stories I have heard and other parents experiences.", "How do we get a genetic test if my son doesnt meet all the criteria My 1 year old son has 5 CALs. I just really think he should be tested. We are on a looong waiting list to be checked out by a dermatologist (that is where the pediatrician referred us) and i can just hear them already telling us no because he only had 5 and no other symptom yet.\n\nI will pay whatever amount of money. I just dont know how to get it. Use Invitae. It cost USD 250 (( and you will need 125 more if you do not have a referral and need to get it from one of their doctor (( \n\n(  the Nf1 page\n\nThis said, going solo into genetic testing is dangerous because it can feed an obsession. Cafe au lait (CAL) spots are not uncommon, especially in fair or red hair children or mixed heritage \n\n\n\n\"We do see occasional healthy children with as many as six caf\u00e9-au-lait spots, though usually these spots are usually relatively indistinct and have irregular margins. Often these children have fair skin and red hair, or have parents of different ancestry, with one having darker skin than the other.  These children tend to be healthy and do not have any underlying medical problem as far as is known.\" \n\nMany disorders including Legius present with CAL and are totally benign. So it could be nothing/ something else and not especially Nf1. \n\nI have NF1 confirmed by genetic test and do not have a single CAL. Thanks for this info. Unfortunately, we are not mixed ethnicities, and he is not pale.  I just today read that nevus anemicus is not seen in legius syndrome, despite being common in nf1. \n\nWhat led you to finding out you had nf1? A pathology analysis of one of my tumours . I was not diagnosed fully until I was 15. Doctors always thought I had it after I was born and even when I was 9 and went to University of Michigan and they ran some test there, tests results were always inconclusive. It seems that once puberty hit is when things started to take off and I was diagnosed at 15 at the university of Chicago. How were you diagnosed in the end? When you say the tests were inconclusive, what was inconclusive about them? I do not really recall I was too young. I just know that is what I was told. All I can remember when I was nine was them doing some blood work and looking at the birth marks and bumps on my head.\n\nWhen I was 15 and went to Chicago, I was in the hospital for a week and they ran a bunch of test. Blood work, MRIs and other X-rays. Ask your doctor for a referral to a genetic counselor. They can help you get your child tested and explain the results. They can also help make referrals for other tests/specialists if needed.", "Service animals? Does anyone with NF have a service animal and if so, what do you have them for? I have Neurofibromatosis, I have a dog put she is not a service animal. But with my dog I enjoy taking her for walks, they are short walks, as I have balance issues and walk with a slight limp. Our walks are normally only 15-20 minutes long. We do not walk during the winter because of the snow and ice. I do toss the ball around for her outside. And she likes laying next to me on the coach and resting her head on my lap. She likes to sleep next to me in bed. I personally do not have one but, I know some service animals can be trained to detect seizures which may be helpful for some of us. I personally do not have \n\nI have met one person with NF1 that had an \"emotional support animal\" due to her issues arising from the disorder, but a full service dog would not be too crazy depdning on severity.  Although I expect it would likely be more common to see a service animal with an NF2 patient than NF1 due to vision/hearing/mobility loss. I do! His name is Rocky, and he is a Mini Pin/Chihuahua (MinChi) mix who is 8lb of quiet furry sweetness (he never barks), and he is now 8yo. We have spent all but a total of 36 hours together since he was 5 months old. He is *always* with me. And if I get crap for having him somewhere, then I just do not patronize that business despite the fact Rocky is a legit and licensed Medical Alert Dog. He is trained to catch seizures or incidents where I may not be able to call for or get help on my own. I have deteriorating NF2 and he has caught several incidents over the years that even nurses in the hospital missed.\n\nOn that note, I was staying in a hospital post-op, and this new nurse screwed up the IV twice. We asked for an experienced nurse politely and she went to find one but came back and said nobody else was available and she was the only option if I wanted my medication. She gave it one more shot and it *looked* like she got the stick and even had a blood return.\n\nThen she went to administer the medication and everything went to crap. She administered it *WAY* too fast, and that IV she put in evidently went *through* the vein. So all that medicine she just pushed way too fast did not even make it in the vein, but it did get pushed right into a nerve and it hurt *so bad* that I started blacking out and could not see.\n\nRocky was under the covers of the bed and knew something was up and he started *HOWLING*. Rocky laid down on top of me and did not stop howling until some nurse heard him all the way across the hospital floor and came in to see what was wrong. Luckily she caught my eyes rolling around and me mumbling that something was not right and I could not see, and she knew I just had brain surgery for a nerve tumor, and she knew Rocky was an alert dog. So she did the math and realized I was having a vasovagal reaction and passing out. She stabilized me and made sure I was ok. Then, needless to say, the first nurse got thrown out and in a lot of trouble for lying about another nurse being unavailable to do my IV, then doing another IV against patient wishes and messing it up, then administering medication and ignoring an adverse reaction I was having post-administration. \n\nHospital legal kissed my butt for the next week hoping I would not sue. I did not and would not have despite being miffed about the incident.\n\nAt least my dog caught it, right? Lol!", "My NF story with hopes of a baby I am so happy to have found this reddit! I am a 30 yr old female with NF1, and very fortunate NF has not caused many life difficulties. My NF background... I was diagnosed at 6 mo old due to multiple CALs. Had a seizure around this time too, but this was my only one and is most likely non-NF related, temp spiked high very fast. I had MRIs of my brain throughout childhood for baseline studies and they never reflected much change. I do have an optic glioma which I thought was just in my left eye until recently. No vision probs, eye sight is 20/20 or 20/15. I am the shortest in my family, but not by that much. My head is also larger than the standard size, but that is also a characteristic I may have inherited from my dad. Jump start to about a year ago when my husband and I started talking about having a baby. Saw a geneticist and bloodwork confirmed the NF, and the marker. Then saw the endocronolgist who tok me to two NF specialists and a neuro opthomologist. Two more MRIs - which looked fine- never compared to older tests, which pissed me off.  Had some vision tests... Which showed optic gliomas in both eyes. Never noticed any vision change ever.... Now, Planning on doing IVF with PGD to eliminate any possibly of passing on the disorder. Our choice, and although I have never had problems does not mean our kids would if I did pass it on.\n\nHave any of you experienced IVF with PGD to eliminate your NF gene?

I live in a fairly rural area and not many doctors are familiar with NF (I often know more than them). I do not currently have any known issues related to NF but would like to talk to someone who is knowledgable, and just give me a check-up. I have had difficulty finding physicians that see adults. Does anyone have a recommendation? I can comfortably travel to Salt Lake, Denver, Seattle or other places in the west. To side track the conversation \n\nNot in the states but it is very common for people with NF to know more than Doctors.  I have come across a few who have knew about it and we had good conversation about it. Some where not even my doctor I have met them all over. The MAYO Clinic offers NF clinics in its locations ( is some info about it! Hey! If you can travel to Denver then I strongly recommend working with the UC Hospital in Aurora. There are doctors in Denver who can get you a recommendation to schedule an appointment with a neurologist at UC Health. I had a tumor removed there and everything went smoothly. Be aware tho that UC Health is kind of pricey and charges facility fees etc The best doctor I have come across and would recommend is ( at Hoag in Newport Beach, CA. He is a well knowledge when it comes to NF1, NF2, and schwannomatosis. He even asks all of the questions others do not even think of, like about birthmarks, your dental health, and if you have freckles on your groin. He is considered to be the top brain tumor guy for all of Hoag. 10/10 will always go back to. This should help you out, I do not live I cannot give any recommendations as my doctor is in Chicago. I hope your able to find a specialist. I see mine at least 1-3 times a year.\n\n I forgot there were some knowledgeable folks in MN, that is about the same distance as the others. I have NF and my dad is a doctor is the Portland metro area. Yo buddy! I just moved to Boulder and I been having bad pain with my NF recently. Thank you for putting this on my radar. Good to know, I will check into that. I have decent insurance but they may not cover it out of state. One clinic did mention that there are some things that can be done to work with a provider/facility that is not covered, and that you could chat with billing beforehand maybe work some sort of discount. I have looked at that before, I was hoping for a recommendation from someone who has actually seen a doc that is knowledgeable and treats adults. I have been working to get into a NF clinic in SLC but when I called to check on the status of the referral I was told that doc does not see adults even though I asked when I called initially. I would recommend my doctor who sees both adults and kids, but he is all the way in Chicago. When you called that clinic did you ask if they had any recommendations on doctors who see adults? I would think, or at least hope that they would have someone for the children patients to turn to when they become an adult. To be fair though that is true of a large number of \"rare\" (or at least uncommon) disorders/diseases.\n\n Unless it is a specialist most doctors, particularly general practitioners, would not see many patients with NF and if they do would not directly treat it. Most people in the medical field I meet  that are not close to the neurological fields have heard of it, or can quickly piece together what it is just from medical experience but will not have the indepth knowledge that a person who lives with it 24 hours a day would. &gt;He even asks all of the questions others do not even think of, like about birthmarks, your dental health, and if you have freckles on your groin\n\nI am sure he is great, but those questions should be pretty much the absolute bare minimum (birthmarks and freckling for sure, dental health might be a little less common) ANY doctor discussing NF should be touching on. In fact it would be a huge red flag if a neurologist of all people \"did not even think of\" that so I am not sure that alone sets a very high bar. I am not sure what to tell you. I have spoken with a few doctors throughout the process, and he is the only one to bring these up. Also a great bunch in Phoenix.", "Stinging shocks? Stinging shocks is the best way I can describe it. It is like a jolting shock of pain and it either lingers or goes away quickly. Does anyone else ever get these and if so, how do you deal with it.

I get them in my toes but my foot doctor says its nerve damage from bunions but I suspect I may have a deeper fibroma. I do not know if it is the same sensation, but I get it in a tumor I have on my stomach. I say it \u201cgets angry.\u201d That is really the only way I can describe it.  It is pretty painful. Does not last terribly long, but seems like if it happens once, it will happen several times that day. I get them in my big toes and my fingers. They are not fun. :( I also experience these. I have a decent size tumor on my side and I get horrible, sharp shooting pains up my side along the tract of the tumor. They usually last a few minutes but they are pretty debilitating. \nI did not notice these until post-surgery when I was diagnosed tho, so I have always wondered about that. I also get them but just one finger and one toe.  I was given a diagnosis of RA but suspect that it is NF because RA does not stay the same it will progress in symptoms.  The best way I describe it is labor in the finger. Happens to me in my ear where I have a tumor. Several sharp stabs like someone jabbed a needle in my ear which lasts for a few seconds and then it is gone. Thankfully it only happens a few times a year. In the moment I just take some deep breaths and try to focus on whatever I am doing, rather than the pain. I have this too. I have not done anything about it, it happens on such random frequencies, I feel like my doctor thinks I am crazy when I brought it up. They only last for 30 sec or maybe a min. But they go from happening once a day, to not happening for weeks at a time. Had it in the right shoulder about once a day until I removed the motherfucker, was sensitive AF too. Dunno if the odd banana-like shape it had could have anything to do with it being so sensitive. I get these in a plexiform in my neck, describing it as a shock sounds right. Goes away in &lt; 30 seconds usually but is like getting stabbed. On my finger nails all the time. Its definitely a bummer. I just have to put up with it when it happens, but if it becomes a constant stinging burning pain that lingers for a while. Tell your doctor, if that is happening you will want to have a mri scan done on location of where the pain is happening.

Do you know how you scar from previous surgeries/injuries? \n\nI have had plenty removed and even one from my face (when I was a teenager) and its been worth it to me. But now I really dont care about them unless they cause pain. You should try and get a referral for a different doctor And continue to discuss your options.

She has a appointment w a genetic pediatrition thru her doc. She has cafe au lait spots like her father. Make an appt with an ophthalmologist to have them look at her optic nerve.

It was not until I was 15 that I was fully diagnosed with it. \n\nAnd since then over the last 20 plus years, tumors have grown in number and size and a few even turned cancerous. Those were very painful, thankfully they were removed. \n\nSo yeah I agree OP should speak with a doctor who is either very familiar or is a specialist in Neurofibromatosis, as hormones can effect the way  these type of tumors react. In some cases some pregnant woman have experienced increase of tumors in both size and numbers. Hey! Fellow FTNB w/ NF1 I did low dose T for about a year and did not have any NF1 related side effects. My PCP at the LGBTQ clinic consulted a doctor at the NF clinic who said there is less concern with T that MTF HRT.

I feel a bit paranoid I am going to start developing more and more. You need to see a doctor because it could be something else, such as oral squamous cell papilloma. Yes we do - rarely - develop neurofibromas on the tongue, but as the very first one? Not sure, .... they usually appear first on the trunk. \n\nSee a doctor and they will be able to assess if that growth is a neurofibroma or something else and what to do with it. You should make an appointment and show it your doctor as soon as possible. I am going to as soon as I can. I am in between primary doctors rn but scheduling an appointment as soon as I find a new one. Does not seem like an oral cancer but will be scheduling an appointment soon. I am in between primary doctors at the moment after switching insurances. Need to lock in a new primary and I will schedule an appointment after that. Good, the sooner the better. Do not worry about fibroma, I have more than 100 (mostly small) and I am doing just fines \nWhen they become a pain you just remove them and you get a nice scar I am kind of interested about the size, and color when you see it in mirror.

My kiddo has a grab bag of issues related to NF1, but there is one thing we cannot get figured out yet.  She is been having pain, nausea, &amp; vomiting when every time she eats, sometimes to the point of passing out. We have run a gamut of tests (ultrasound, CT, angiogram) and nothing is turning up any solutions. \nMy husband just had a random thought that it may be related to a fibroma in the vagus nerve. Not vagus but I did on my optic nerve which my doctors said was common with kids with NF1 but they are very slow growing (I was almost 25 when they found it). I had similar symptoms; headaches, constant nausea, and worsening eye site. Does she get migraines? optic glioma club! I did not find mine either until I was in my late 20s, that is because my family doctor growing up was not a good doctor, when I got a new doctor and gave them the letter I got when I was 7 suggesting that I get an MRI. I got one and they found it and been watching since, and I have gained a few specialist. But makes since with the symptoms I have. I had one neurofibroma on my vagus nerve. It was the size of a grapefruit though it was not visible externally luckily and created no visible deformity. I had it removed in late 2017 and almost bleed to death on the operating table. Luckily, I was at one of the best hospitals (NYU Langone) and with one of the best surgeons in the world and I lived to tell this tale. Btw, I felt no noticeable difference, but who is to say that you wont feel better if you get it removed. I had them all growing up. Now I get regular migraines. An MRI could not hurt though. Kiddo has a glioma diagnosed at 3 years - she did 14 months of chemo &amp; it is pretty stable (knock on wood!).  We had about 6 months of calm before the belly issues started, so we are back on trying to solve another health mystery Hmmmmm.... I have never heard of GI migraines. She has seizures from time to time, so maybe intertwined? Time to go to Dr Google. She has an optic glioma she finished treatment with last year we are on the quarterly MRI schedule ... nothing showing up that ties to the belly issues yet. Wow! That is quite a harrowing experience! Im sorry to hear the removal did not make a difference for you, but glad you were at the right place for your care. The problem with GI migraines, especially when they present in children, which is the most common presentation, is that doctors will generally tend to write them off as anxiety or the child complaining of a regular stomach ache. The fact that she is throwing up after every meal is more concerning. Seizures run in the NF portion of my family as well. I got the most mild presentation of my dad and siblings. \n\nI had a lot of stomach issues growing up. I have nf1 btw. I spent a lot of time at home because of migraines or stomach issues. But I did not have a lot of seizures as a child. More mild seizures started as an adult but I have never had a grand mal seizure. Thanks so much for the details on your experience. I can see how it would be easy to write it off as anxiety - we initially did just that. We are super lucky to have some great docs with a lot of NF experience, so we are hoping to figure this all out. I just hate this phase of it - rule everything out to pinpoint the actual cause of her symptoms Good luck! Thank you!", "Just a reminder You guys are beautiful.

I have only CALs so far, but lately I have noticed I have quite a lot of subcutaneous bumps on my arms, fingers, and legs. Some are weird because I have one near my left and right wrist at almost the exact same position. They are movable, but they are firm. There are also a few near my tailbone and a few in the occipital region in my head. What are these? I cannot find anything on google because I do not think it is a lipoma or a lymph node or something like that, and from what I have read neurofibromas are soft and fleshy. Is it a cyst or something?\n\nI am kind of scared what this can do to my health. I already despise myself enough and I am terrified of ending up unhealthy, disfigured, and alone. What do I do? What are these?  I am not sure. I have several at the base of my neck that feel like little bb's.  That is weird as well.

I do not know what to do. How have you guys faired? I have type 2, started a university degree in mathematics, but then the beginning of the second year i had to urgently remove a brain cancer, which apparently was pushing on an area that is responsible for regulating the mood. For what i was told by the neuro-psychologist i never quite got back all my cognitive ability, but after 8 months finally got to a very close level. He also said that usually it takes people less time, especially women. Also i suffered from depression for the following year and an half because of the area in which the tumor was. Now, 3.5 years later, i am on my way to finishing the degree and i would say that if you give it enough time to recover, the body can adapt pretty well to it. If you have a supportive family and/or friends, i am sure you can fare well; you may have some difficulties to grasp stuff, but so does 95% of people, it is up to you to overcome those and i found that friends and family greatly help.

I recently received my bachelors in neuroscience and havnt been able to find a decent paying job either :( \nI am on the path to become a PA but I am feeling lots of doubt as of recently. \nI am a little slower to grasp things as well and sometimes my tumor pain gets the best of me.

For most of my Gen Ed classes I scraped by, but for things that I actually care about I have not had a problem.

Have you been diagnosed with ADD? I understand it is common for those of us with NF. I have a Master's in Education and am having a difficult time as well. I am also debating getting a second degree to supplement my current one. No I do not think so, they thought I had it when I was a kid, but I think the doctor said I did not have it.

I do not know how worth it is for you to get retested. I also have the delay to grasp things, but when I do I am totally set. And my last couple years of college were vastly improved once I was officially diagnosed and medicated. I Have type 1 and it also takes me awhile to grasp certain things. Especially math. I would say if you want to go back to school then do it. Try to see if the campus has a disabilities center that would be able to help you.

My grandmother had neurofibromatosis, the kind where it was all over her body. I do not know which type it was. She had two sons, my dad and my uncle. My uncle also had it on his body, but not as much as my grandmother. He then passed it to his daughter, who passed it to her two children. No one had it severely enough to need chemotherapy, except for my cousins two children. They both had to get chemotherapy, at very young ages. \n\nAs far as I know, my father does not have it. He is had other health problems, and cat scans and brain scans for other issues unrelated, where if he had it I assume they would have found it. I also have no reason to suspect I have it.\n\nMy question is, I have seen how it has affected my family members. I am worried I could still somehow pass the genetics down to my future children. I have tried to research about it, but have not found anything that helps me. Is it possible my children could inherit this from me even if I and my father do not have it? Or, would anyone be willing to point me in a direction to be able to find out this information.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks! I cannot give to actually evidence but it may be possible? None of my parents had it however my grandma from my dad's side had it and that passed onto me and I am the youngest in my family of six (I am the only one who has it). No, it is dominant so you cannot pass it on unless you have it yourself. It cannot skip a generation. You could get genetic testing to make sure you do not have an extremely mild case. No. Its out of your bloodline. I have NF1 and have a 50% chance of passing it on to me baby. If they do not have it, they will not pass it on. It would be considered a spontaneous mutation if your kid has it It was not passed on if your dad does not have it. Its a spontaneous mutation OR your dad has a very mild undiagnosed case Never met my dad so I would never know lol Actually chemotherap, can make Neurofibromatosis worse. It is only given in extreme cases. I have been told this by my specialist. \n\nNow, whether you yourself can pass it on, not likely. However mutations can happen. That is how I got mine. Though there is some belief that relative on both sides of my family may have had it, as family members remember them having tumors, that would grow back after being removed. But no one knows for sure, no one knew anything back then. There are many things that mimic other things and share similar symptoms.\n\nIf you really are concerned and want to know for certain to give you peace of mind, it would be best to speak with your doctor. There are test that can be down to determine what you could pass, but I do believe they are pricey and may end up opening a whole other can of worms. But I do know people who have done it, because they had concerns. That is how I have it. No one else in my family has it. Chemo makes it worse? I was put on chemo at a very young age (7-8) and from my understanding, it being discovered and treated so early is the reason I have been able to live a - more or less - \"normal life\". It is possible, however unlikely that your children could get it from a spontaneous genetic mutation, that is what happened to me. \n\nThey will not inherit it, but they could still end up with it. That is me, spontaneous mutation...and I have 5 siblings....none of them have it. Lucky me. My specialist, who is one of the top specialist, said that chemo can make the tumors grow more and spread it and that it really does not make much of any improvement at all. He told my parents and I this way back when I was diagnosed. \n\nIn 2018 I had a cancerous tumor in my right arm that was causing a lot of pain and needed a biopsy to confirm that it was cancerous, as the mri scans were enough to tell. It was talked about then that I possibly would need to have chemo, even with the risks, depending on  which nerves the tumor was wrapped around. It my median nerve it was have required it along with other surgery so that I would lose the ability to use my hand. Thankfully it was my sensory nerve. I am not aware that chemo can make it worse.  My son had 12 months of chemo at 3 years old and that was not one of the things I was warned about. That is really interesting. My condition has been more or less stable (apart from recent optic nerve decompressio surgery) ever since I had cytotoxins. I am just going by what my specialist had told me and my parents. Neurofibromatosis does effect everyone differently and in my case, I have been told that for types of tumors that I have they would basically feed off chemo/radiation, so they would only use it on me in extreme cases. thank you so much for your comment! i may look into making sure I dont have a mild case. I thought so, but was not sure if I was carrying a recessive gene or something. I was not quite sure how it worked. Now I know it is most likely only possible thru a gene mutation. Thank you for your comment and I wish you health and happiness Mine is a spontaneous mutation as well. Yay us. No problem. Hope you get good results. I reread your family history and see that neither you nor your father have any symptoms, so I think it is safe to say you do not have the mutation. As others have said, there is still a chance for a de novo mutation, about 1 in 3000.\n\nThe below information applies for someone who has a parent with NF1 and no symptoms themselves.\nNF1 like many genetic conditions with dominant inheritance, has variable expressivity. There is a very small chance you have NF1 but have not manifested any symptoms. Again, this would be a very rare occurrence, because NF1 is expected to manifest in some way in all people with a pathogenic variant by the end of childhood.\nThe best way to be more certain would be to get genetic testing. \nOnce again, it is extremely likely you did NOT inherit the neurofibromin change. Yes and no, if you dont have it you will not pass it down to your children hereditory but they still have a 1 in 2500 chance for a random mutation to occur. I have NF1 and there is no family history of it in my family... Sounds like a spontaneous mutation? We think that is how my son got it. That is how I got it as well I hear ya, Wolf.  I was told that radiation was a problem for 2 reasons:  the effect on a growing brain, and that it can promote tumor growth.  Maybe they did not want to throw any bad news in about the chemo since that was our chance? I was told promote tumor growth and could actually cause it to spread. In 2018, I had cancerous tumor in my upper right arm. There were cause a burning pain that would shoot down my arm all the way to my wrist. I actually needed a biopsy because they were not sure based off the MRIs scans. They also did not know until they cut my arm open if it were my sensory nerve or median nerve that the tumors were wrapped around. Thankfully it was the sensory. Had it been the median nerves, there was concerns that I would then need some chemo and another surgery to give my hand some function back, as I could have lost that if they had to mess around with the median nerves to remove the tumors from my arm.", "friends? chats? conversation?

I have to ridden or driven one, but given my status of my Neurofibromatosis I doubt it be good for me. My arms and legs can jump without warning and do have weaknesses, it is probably also the reason I was never able to learn to ride a bike without the help of training wheel. The last time I tried was when I was 15 and that was over 15 years ago and my condition has worsened sense then. \n\nNow whether driving a motorcycle would be good for you or not cannot really say, as everyone condition can vary.

I had driven only manual cars before so clutch and shifting were never problems for me. \n\nIf you have not ridden before, absolutely take a beginner's motorcycle course. They are usually offered at a community outreach center. Mine was an offshoot of a local community college. Even though I had ridden for years prior, the course was very useful.  Thank you very much. I will have to look into that. It seems fun and freeing to drive one. It is a lot of fun. Best of luck and be safe! I have NF1.

Our insurance would not cover genetic testing so we finally decided to pay out of pocket so we could have definitive answers, today the results came in positive. Looking for advise on what we can expect and how to support her. I am not sure about family history yet, they suspect I gave it to her and offered free genetic testing for me to confirm. My mom has the spots too and within the past year was diagnosed with a small brain tumor, she was born deaf as well so I am leaning towards maybe both me and my mom having a milder form....anyways sorry for rambling just trying to figure out where we go from here.  Its really hard to tell you what all to expect since every case is so different.  I have NF type 1, I am the first in my family so it is a genetic mutation for me.  I have 1 child, she has it as well. She was diagnosed at 3 months based on family history, caf\u00e9 au lait spots, and a small fibroma that was present at her birth.\n\n\nFor me, as a 30 year old female, my NF had the most issues during puberty and pregnancy due to the hormonal chances.  I have multiple brain lesions, a tumor near my spinal cord, a large platform plexiform fibroma in my pelvis and 1,000+ fibromas ranging in size from a pinhead to a grape on my back, chest, stomach, neck, and feet. I have chronic migraines and mild hip/back pain. Depression and anxiety are also an issue for me, which I am told is common for NF people. As awful as that all may sound, I live a very normal life. I am not considered medically disabled, I graduated high school and college, I am married, can care for my self entirely. \n\n\nMy daughter is almost 9. NF caused a brain tumor which, while noncancerous, caused her to lose all vision in one eye.  She had to go thru a year of chemo to treat it. She also has been diagnosed with precocious puberty, likely triggered by NF and the brain tumor.  She has a few fibromas on her skin that we monitor. She also lives a very normal life, goes to school, plays sports, functions like any other kid her age.\n\n\nAs for doctors, I would strongly recommend getting her in to see a pediatric neurologist.  We are located in the US, and as far as I know most Children's Hospitals have NF clinics, where my daughter and I are both seen. I would prefer her be seen in an NF clinic since they would have specialists that focus strongly on NF.  Also, an ophthalmologist is preferable for eye exams. An optometrist checks eyes BUT an ophthalmologist deals more with the optic nerve, which is where my daughter's brain tumor is located.  Learning disabilities are common, so please do not hesitate for an evaluation if she struggles in school.\n\n\nCtf.org is great, Children's Tumor Foundation has a lot of valuable information, as does  and \n\nThere are opportunities across the US to have get togethers with others with NF.  We go to annual gatherings where hundreds of NF folks gather and find support from each other. Facebook has a lot of support groups as well.\n\n\nOn a more personal level, from one parent to another, I want to suggest that you do not treat her any different because of her diagnosis.  My parents babied me, did not let me play sports or do things my siblings were doing out of fear of me getting hurt.\nMy daughter is not given special treatment because of her diagnosis.  She plays sports, gets muddy and dirty, gets disciplined when needed, and is not permitted to use NF as a excuse for anything. We might have to do things different but that does not make her less worthy than anyone else. Love her unconditionally and do not let her feel less than anyone for being different.\n\n\nIf you ever need to talk, feel free to reach out to me. I was not diagnosed until I was 15, it was always thought I might have it. I went in to U of M when I was 9, but results were incunclusive. When I hit 15 and was already going through puberty was when the on switch on turned on. My pediatrician always believed I had it, but could not say officially. She first called a hospital in Grand Rapids, but they told her to tell my parents to take me to Chicago.\n\nIt was in Chicago I got my official diagnosis. That was 20 years ago. Neither one of my parents have it or my three younger siblings. There is a slim possibility that a distant cousin on my moms side might have had it. My moms second cousin father may have had it, but no one knows for sure.\n\nIn the last twenty years I have had four surgeries.\n\n2001 - I had tumors removed from my lower right arm, this surgery was done just as a precaution \n\n2007 - I had tumors removed from the back of my neck on the spine, they were pressing against it and if the surgery was not done I could have woken up on morning and not been able to move my legs.\n\n2014 - I had cancerous tumors removed from my upper right leg\n\n2018 - this past April I had cancerous tumors removed from my upper right arm\n\nI see my Neurofibromatosis specialist in Chicago at least once a year if not every six months. I also have years full body MRI scans.\n\nNeurofibromatosis can affect everyone differently. I do have chronic pain which I take two different pain medications for. I did not start taking pain meds until 2007. I do have poor balance, sometimes my right leg give out on me. I also have involuntary jerks where my arms, legs, hands, and head will jerk around, sometimes it looks like a tremor. I cannot walk for long periods of time and I need to be able to get up and move around when I need to. \n\nI also have a learning disability, lazy and high blood pressure. However all these three things do run in my family, but they can also be caused by Neurofibromatosis. My father was diagnosed with a learning disability when he was nine, he also has high blood pressure and that does run on his side of the family. My mother was born with a lazy eye, but she grew out of it when she was 2 or 3. \n\nIf you have any questions feel free to ask. I was diagnosed at 9 months, and am the first in my family to have it (that we know of). My parents would get my MRIs of my brain every few years, and turned into an every two year occurrence after they found a benign tumour on my brain. I was ten when I got the surgery and since it was close to my fine motor skills I had to get gamma knife a year later to kill off the rest.   \n\n\nMRIs would be my biggest piece of advice, that and year eye exams and lisch (sp) nodules can grow in the eye. Keep an eye on her spots and fibromas as well to keep an eye out for any changes.\n\n  \nNF definitely comes with a variety of issues, some have it worse than others. I had some of the learning disability side, but of course we did not realize it was part of NF. I do have the pain and whatnot and have to be more careful in the sun than other people, a difficult thing living in the Sunshine State.  Thank you so much for the reply! It is good to read real life experiences. We live in Madison,WI and the local children\u2019s hospital here does have a clinic that specializes in NF. She is already been followed by an ophthalmologist (though I am a bit nervous we have not been able to get thru a complete exam on that machine that takes the pictures inside the eye because she is so been young and does not understand enough to sit and look at the right things)  I plan on reaching out to her teachers. They are scheduling us to meet with the team (geneticist, dermatologist etc) in February to go over stuff too.... just trying to wrap my head around it all now that we officially have a diagnosis. Thank you so much for your reply! It really helps to read others experiences, happy to have a place I can ask questions as we go down this road. Never too early to be watching for optic gliomas. In my opinion she should be receiving an MRI annually. You are welcome  It might be worth getting genetic counseling. Every year they are discovering more genotype / phenotype correlations. A very small subset of the nf population can actually predict symptoms, which is a first for this condition.  youre going to want to see an eye dr probably twice a year to monitor for lisch nodules, and find a pediatric neurologist.  they will probably order an mri with contrast to take a look at the brain and set a baseline. then follow up as needed every year or 2. ", "Trying to get a clearer idea of what I may (or may not?) have. Multiple Schwannomas. Hey everyone. I am 24 and have a few Schwannomas in my left foot. Since I was a kid I had a single lump in my ankle that was painful if I hit it. I had it removed in 2013 and had some nerve damage from surgery (numbness on bottom of foot, cannot really move little toes), and between then and now I have had a few more pop up. I had a small one biopsied last year and it came back as Schwannoma, and I am having the two larger (2cm-ish) ones removed by my podiatrist soon since they are causing some pain. I do not really have any other lumps on my body that I know of, aside from a small bump only visible if I flex my left forearm that I want to get checked out.\n\nI do not have any other other symptoms, skin lesions, deficits, etc.\n\nI suppose I have a couple cafe au lait spots on my body but nothing I have ever really noticed. \n\nDoes anyone have a similar situation? Could this be Schwannomatosis? Thanks! Yes, this could definitely be schwannomatosis.  If your tumors are limited to only your left ankle/foot, it could be what is known as segmental or mosaic schwannomatosis, where only a portion of your body's cells carry the mutation causing this disease.  If you are interested in pursuing a formal diagnosis, I would highly recommend consulting with an NF specialist (preferably before your next surgeries, so they can advise on how to save those tumor samples for genetic testing.)  You might also want to consult a neurosurgeon before your remove any more tumors - post-operative deficits like you mentioned are unfortunately common, and seeing someone specialized in peripheral nerve tumors can help minimize that risk. How many spots you have, and how big there are? Do you have freakles as well ?( If yes, where?) Are you sure is NF? I have three separate ones that I can see. The largest is about the length of my fingertip but not as wide. I have a little bit of splotchy discoloration on my lower back but it is not really well defined spots. Not sure if it is related. I do not have many freckles at all. Maybe some slight freckling on top of my wrists that runs onto my hands a bit if you look close. Thanks for the info. Are most neurosurgeons well-versed in the condition or should I look for someone who specializes? Not really sure what I am looking for exactly I am not a doctor, but I m pretty sure you do not have NF To put it  into something easy to understand. Schwannomas are some very unusual type of nerve tumours and they raise the alarm for two diseases when someone has **several** of them. The diseases are NF2 and Schwannomatosis. The diagnosis of NF2 is easier because there is a genetic test and there is a very unique type of schwannoma that will grow in the ear. This one is called vestibular schwannoma ,  also known as acoustic neuroma. This very tiny tumour will grown on the nerve that goes from the ear to the brain. \n\nIf neurofibromas are the hallmark of Nf1,  schwannomas are the hallmark of NF2 and Nf2 comes occasionally with caf\u00e9 au lait which are smaller in size and number than in Nf1. \n\nI think you should consult a neurologist and definitely do **not** let a podiatrist remove the schwannomas! You need a neurosurgeon to avoid complication. We are talking about nerves, a podiatrist has not the training or even the understanding of the nerves. Do you know who removed your previous tumour in 2013? \n\nThe neurologist might require a genetic consult or not. \n\nThere is a genetic test for NF2 . The gene is called Merlin but often an MRI is all it takes to make the diagnosis. If there is a bilateral  acoustic neuroma , it is a definitive. \n\nYou do not seem to have any hearing or balance issue, so it could be schwannomatosis\n\nThere is no genetic test for schwannomatosis. Some people have a mutation on either a  gene called  LZTR1 or SMARCB1  Some people have confirmed schwannomatosis and no mutation. The diagnosis will be made on the basis of multiple schwannoma and not being NF2. \n\nThird option, there is the misconception that people with NF1 do not get schwannomas. Whilst not common it is reported in the medical literature . There is a genetic test for NF1. I do not have cafe au lait or freckles and have a positive NF1 test, so just looking at the skin is not a good clinical sign. \n\nIt is also possible you have none of the above diseases or you have them in a mosaic form . This is however a question for the neurologist. \n\nBoth CTF ( and Neurofibromatosis network ( have a \"find a doctor \" section on their website. \n\nIf you are unsure on who you need, call the helpline / support and they will help you. \n\nBest wishes I do not think a lot of neurosurgeons are well versed in schwannomatosis specifically, but at least seeing someone who operates on a lot of peripheral nerve sheath tumors (like schwannomas and neurofibromas) would probably be helpful to minimize the chance of nerve damage during the surgery. \n\nI know that the NF clinics at John Hopkins Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital, and NYU Langone Hospital all see a lot of schwannomatosis patients and have good surgeons if you are interested in traveling for an expert opinion.  Others might be able to suggest additional clinics, or you can check out the Children's Tumor Foundation NF clinic network to see who they could recommend near you.", "27, blind in one eye (optic glioma) Hi all,\n\nI have been blind in one eye from an optic glioma for a good long while. I had chemotherapy when I was younger, but it seems that the vision loss from the optic glioma is permanent. I am totally blind in that eye. It is not like putting a blindfold or an eyepatch... it is incredibly hard to describe. The best way I have been able to come up with is \u201cImagine complete darkness, then take away the darkness.\u201d\n\nTwenty or so years have passed since then, and despite only having vision in one eye, I would say these days I make a passable adult.\n\nHas there been any research in the past years concerning optic gliomas? Are there any specific surgeries I could into that could potentially restore the vision in my eye? I read there was a John Hopkins study back in 2013 or so, but I could never find a follow-up. My son (4) has optic gliomas in both eyes. My very limited understanding of them is that the tumors are along the nerve sheath, and as they grow, they essentially crush the optic nerve that they are surrounding. The goal of treatment is to stop them from growing. I am not aware of any treatment to regenerate the nerve after it is been damaged, but I am not a doctor. Your post gives me so much hope.  My daughter has an optic nerve glioma, is blind in one eye, and has gone through a year of chemo.  The damage to her optic nerve is extensive enough that vision is not expected to return; her optic nerve has completely atrophied and the nerve itself has some torsion. Her eye is starting to \"drift\" due to muscle loss from it not working.  She is 9.\n\n\nAll that aside, she is a very normal child with big plans for her future.\n\n\n\nCan I ask your input on something?  How can I help her to continue to feel normal?  What areas did you struggle with and what could have made them easier? Do you have any advice or suggestions on how to help her cope? My blind eye also drifted, almost all the way to the side. I think growing up with a healthy group of friends (at least through elementary years) was helpful for me - but I had no idea I would be where I am today. \n\nThe best thing to help her feel normal? Let her do the things she wants to do (within reason, of course) - even if they may seem dangerous. Let her play soccer, join the softball team, treat her like you would if she did not have NF, do not feel like you have to shelter or protect her.\n\nOne NF specific issue I struggled with was an occasional verbal bullying about my spots, and for a long time after that stopped whenever I was asked about them it was difficult to open up about them.    Recently a cute waitress told me she liked my freckles \u2014 first time I was able to see them positively, but  my experience was that I was very self-conscious about them and I am not sure how I would improve that experience, if I went back in time. But it really sucks to be bullied about something you cannot change -  and really after elementary school I did not get bullied for it anymore. I think everyone is going through enough of their own shit to deal with other people, and thankfully, you do not run into too many bullies in adulthood, and those who are bullies are not really adults. But for the time being? Just make her feel like a normal kid. Times have changed, but what made me feel normal was being able to go out with my friends later in the evening.\n\nFrom what I gather, my situation is a little different from yours in that my NF is hereditary, my mom grew up with NF, so I think she already had an idea of what it was like growing up, and as a result I think I got away with a lot. \n\nI think I got everything here, feel free to ask follow-up questions too.\n\nWhat are your daughters\u2019 plans for the future?\n\nHow well does she understand her symptoms/NF? She understands NF pretty well, I have it also, so it is an open part of our daily lives. I am covered in thousands of small fibromas, all smaller than a kidney bean, on my back, chest, and stomach plus several smaller on my arms, neck and face. Her dad, my husband, has spent a lot of time listening to my experiences, doing independent research, and talking with our doctors so that he can be helpful also.\n\n\nAs for the future, she wants to do something involving art or animals. She is talked about wanting to work with endangered animals or going to study them in their native habitats. She is also wanting to teach art to teenagers. She is very intelligent and bright and I am completely certain she can achieve any goal she has. Ah, okay. I guess I kind of assumed she was a first generation kid with NF. How do you manage yours? I hope my advice sounded helpful. It was the first time I had considered answering that question. Because I have NF, I am against the idea of having children. Although my case is very mild, it can also be much worse, and that is not really an experience I want to knowingly possibly pass on to another human being. \n\n Your husband and her father sound like a very sweet person. =) They recommend seeing an ophthalmologist. I was unaware of what ophthalmologist is until my neurologist told me about them. Essentially, they are eye doctors that focus on eye health, and at times can operate. I too have an optic glioma, that is being very closely monitored.", "I have a neurofibroma on face and it makes me feel really ugly! And looks consume my life. I cannot deal with this.  I have small Neurofibromatosis tumors on my face, I have had them since I was a little kid, I also have a lazy right eye which that too I was born will. I have a large Neurofibromatosis tumor that below my right ear on the side of my face below my jaw. I am 35 years old now, the tumor that below my ear is roughly 5-6 years old. \n\nSo I get it, but I have learned that looks are not everything. What matters is the person you are on the inside. But if these tumors on your face are causing discomfort I would talk about it with your doctor, perhaps it would be a good idea to get head CT and MRI scans. I tend to get full body from head to toe, at least once a year, because I have tumors all throughout my body and then the last four years I have had two surgeries to remove cancerous tumors.\n\nI hope things get better for you. A good dermatologist should be able to make some good recommendations for you. I would start there.  They are much more likely to recommend treatments if they cause discomfort or agitation.  I have had small tumors on the face for some time now and it does not help that my face is noticeably lopsided. So, understanding the feeling of being ugly. The best method I found for myself was being open and honest with those around me how I felt about my looks and talking to a therapist to help with dealing with my condition.   I have the means talk to someone, if do not have the means open up to your family and friends and expression how you feel. It could help process what is going on with you. \n\nAlso, a dermatologist could be useful in getting rid of the tumors that can be removed from your face can also help improve your emotional state of being.  \n\nGood Luck. Feel Better.  You can. You will be OK.  Would you be more specific about your lazy eye?  Is it just refractive amblyopia or is it strabismic?\n\nI have a wicked astigmatism in my left eye, so mine is refractive.  But, apparently a trained doctor can still see the slight strabismus that I have as a result of my lazy eye.\n\nI have wondered if NF has something to do with it. I am not sure. I was born with a lazy eye, I had surgery when I was one to try to correct it and it did not work. My mom was also born with a lazy eye, but hers corrected itself when she was a toddler. I have been told that my NF may have been what prevented it from being able to be corrected.  I got two on my face and several on my arms. I have never felt it bothered me if people do not like it they can look elsewhere. I know everyone is different but you should not let that define you or mwk you feel lass. You should discuss with your neurologist see if it can be removed without any damage to the face.  I had a really big one inside my cheek that people mistook for a huge wad of chewing tobacco. I had it removed &amp; never regretted it. There is a scar, but the surgeon was able to hide it somewhat by making part of the incision along my jaw. There is a risk when you start cutting in the area in which my fibroma was located; there is a major nerve bundle running through it.\n\nDefinitely speak to a doctor - it sounds like this is really having an effect on you. Get all the information you can. I have had most of mine removed by a dermatologist, but the one inside my cheek was removed by an ENT. i had strabismic, i actually got surgery 2 years ago and MAN WHAT A DIFFERENCE seeing normal is. I saw double or what i called \u201c one and a half\u201d of things basically my entire life i thought that was normal.  I remember the first time I got glasses that corrected my bad eye and suddenly I had depth perception. It was pretty trippy the way everything popped out. I could not drive with them for a month.  Hi, where does the lop-sidedness come from? Is it a tumor? Or something like sphenoid wing dysplasia.  I have scoliosis that was not treated properly in early childhood so my left side of my body grew differently than my right side. I  have two completely different shoe size by a lot. Not a smidge a lot.  By agitation you mean the agitated feeling I get knowing that I am ugly cause of NF? I feel the same way. I do not have any cutaneous neurofibromas, but I have severe skeletal deformities due to scoliosis which was caused by my NF. I sometimes cannot look at my chest in the mirror its so bad. I find that have close friends and family to speak to helps. When you can speak to someone who truly doesnt care about how you look it feels good and you may find that you will stop thinking about it too.

My child and myself have NF1. \n\nYes dna test was done on ancestry, 23 and me, my heritage, gedmatch, family tree dna and geni. You did not get any hits off ancestry or 23 for him, such has his children or himself that could lead you to him? I got none for him or his kids. I found leads to his bioogical parents but he was adopted out so those do no good. do you know his first name? No i do not. His birth mother does not know. Sorry thought i hit reply when i commented. \nNo. I found people that led me to his parents but nether he nor his kids have tested it seems and it would be VERY obvious if he did since our genetic relationship is EXTREMLY close. What is his birth mother's name? Her last name is Darling. first name? That is not my info to give out. I will just say it starts with a B. I have already spoken with her and she gave me what info she remembers. She too wants to find her son but i am directly related to him in another way. I am his daughter.

Happy Holidays to you too! I really hope this place continues to grow. It is nice to see people exchange information on latest advances in science, and also find comfort in what we are all going through. Anything that gives each other hope, and reminds us that we are not alone is a positive thing! I feel like this sub helps support the resiliency that we all need. Thank you for creating this sub! It has been a great resource for me. Today I literally found out about a newer drug called Selumetinib while reading through comments on posts. After reading every report I could find online I am feeling hopeful that it will help me. My doctor is looking into it and I have a couple emails out to research centers about participating in their clinical trials. Fingers crossed! I have not been around long, but my daughter was diagnosed with NF1 a month ago...2 days after her 2nd birthday. I was so happy to find there is a sub for this specifically. I have no idea what the future will bring, or how severe her case will be, &amp; that sucks because I just want to protect her. She is such a strong little girl, though. She is fearless...clumsy af lol, but fearless. She is very intelligent &amp; social &amp; happy, so I am hoping the clumsiness will be the worst of it. Although, lately she has developed a strong dislike for certain texture on her skin. It is like certain fabrics hurt her?

My arms and hands are getting weak, I cannot even hold my phone for more than a minute. Right now I am using this speech to text function, because I can not type. A few years ago I started experiencing neuropathy in my left pinky toe, it pretty much stayed like that for the last 4 years up until the last couple of months where it has spread all the way up to my knee. My leg feels really heavy and like it is asleep. In the last 2 months, i have also suffered really bad symptoms of arthritis in my hands. I am desperate for help, but I am afraid that nothing can be done.\n\nHas anyone else experienced new symptoms or preexisting conditions getting progressively worse over a short period of time? The weakness in my right leg has gotten worse over the years where it give out a lot more then it used to. I am sure a walking stick or something is in my future at some point.

Have you talked to your doctor about MEK inhibitors? I did have an MRI on my cervical spine.  There is a tumor putting pressure on my spinal cord at C-6 on the left.  I did have an MRI on my brain about a year ago and there was no cause for concern.  I have not had my lumbar spine looked at in a few years.  In the last 15 years, i have had 2 major surgeries on my lumbar spine, one L-2  L3 and another one L4 L5. \nI also had one surgery to remove a tumor my cervical spine, I believe C-3 which was about 12 years ago where I do have a build up of spinal fluid I also had an EMG on my right arm and was first diagnosed with carpal tunnel. I had MRI of my complete right arm.  They found numerous tumors up and down my right on, but the neurologist recommended not to have them removed. You could do more damage than good Never heard of it.  We see Dr. Slopis in Houston and he has been amazing for our son and my wife. He is a leader in the feild on NF and I highly recommend him.

I am in Tampa Florida and I cannot travel like that it is an emerging space that looks promising to me but unclear when or how it develops- ( It actually was about 6 months ago.  I did see your neurosurgeon after the cervical spine MRI. He said that the tumor was operable, but to wait 6 months, have another scan and see if there was any change. I have an appointment for next month The surgeon did say that where the tumor is located at C-6 on the left side, it would cause weakness and pain down my left arm. I forget exactly what fingers he said. He did say if the tumors were removed it could cause more weakness in the elbow.  My hand would be ok.  Thank god I am right handed.

My insurance is Medicaid and I am not sure if they will cover it if I have a genetic issue. Another thing I am concerning is during my first pregnancy my symptoms got worse. I researched and lots of woman experience their symptoms getting worse during pregnancy due to hormones. Since pgd is all about hormones control and lot of shots that makes me worried. Anyone can share the experience with me? How much you guys pay for it? I know everyone is different but I want to know and prepare! Thanks! I did PGD. Compared to the pregnancy, IVF is not a lot of hormones because it is for a short time. I am sure Medicaid will not cover it. My private insurance did not. We paid completely out of pocket for ours, about 21k, but it was so worth it to know our baby is healthy and NF ends with me. Our daughter is almost 6 months old now. Happy to answer any other questions you may have. How long did you take for the processing from the beginning to pregnancy(like from beginning to confirm pregnancy?) I already have my genetic test results. And how much did you pay it total if you do not mind share. Is your symptoms got worse during pregnancy or about the same? Thank you! It is not easy to find NF pt with pgd so it is so helpful! I had my consultation in April and transferred my first embryo in December. My egg retrieval was delayed by 4 weeks because my sister passed away so it could have taken 1 month less if that were the case. We paid a little over 20k but another clinic quoted us closer to 35k so shop around. I have relatively mild symptoms as is and during pregnancy I saw some new small fibromas and a few old small ones grew a little. \n\nThere is a group on Facebook called \u201cNF going through IVF (PGD)\u201d that you should join. What about when males have nf1? Do you know if it is it basically a similar ordeal? One thing to remember is that PDG requires a known genetic marker. We tried genetic testing to identify the gene, and they could not find it. We also found out that mosaic cases are not eligible for PDG. We are in the process of doing IVF with PGD. I am in NY so insurance (not medicaid) will cover most of it. My husband is the one with NF1. Our daughter also has it. We should be doing egg retrieval in April. Exact same process.

My whole life I always knew I had something as I had a few visible bumps and several bumps that I could feel below the surface of my skin. I never imagined my birth marks were even remotely related though... anyways, despite me having these things I was never checked out as a child and no one ever knew what I had, but I seemed perfectly fine and normal so it was brushed off, but in the back of my mind I always felt these bumps were tumors. After I graduated high school I went to my doctor to get checked out, and the doctor brushed it off and did not know what it was. They ran blood tests and found nothing and basically told me I was fine. I went back to the same doctor office for an unrelated issue and a different doctor there saw a large protruding lump on abdomen that I have had for a very long time. She was unsure what it was and told me to see a dermatologist. I went to the dermatologist in February and the doctor recognized it was NF immediately. He removed the lump from my stomach and it came back as NF-1 plexiform. Since then I have been having multiple doctor visits all year including my first brain MRI and more scans to come. The whole thing has been very overwhelming... I am lucky in the sense that it is not very noticeable on me (for now anyways) as I have very few visible lumps... but the whole thing has made me feel very bleak. No one in my family has NF and I hate talking about it. Anyways, i just wanted to vent and share what I have been going through as of late... has anyone else had a late diagnosis? I almost wish I could turn back time and feel normal again... I was diagnosed when I was 15, doctors had always thought I had it even when I was born, but results at that time were inconclusive, I was even tested back in 1993 when I was nine at the university of Michigan, but again the results were inconclusive.\n\nThen once puberty hit things starts to take off with the tumors, I always had the birthmarks and maybe a couple tiny tumors, but once I started going through puberty more tumors started growing and these were bigger. My parents were first going to take me to Grand Rapids as my pediatrician knew of two locations I could go to get tested again, the other option of University of Chicago. Grand Rapids before ever seeing me told us that I needed to go to Chicago. \n\nI ended up staying a week at the hospital having all sorts of tests done. Where I ended up being diagnosed. Since then I have had four surgeries, the last two I had both in 2014 and 2018 were to remove tumors that had turned cancerous. \n\nI usually see my doctor about 1-3 times a year and I have yearly MRI scans. If you have any questions let me know. Oh I also am the only one in my family that has it. There is a small possibility that a distant cousin on my moms side of the family may have had it and there is also a small chance that my dad grandparent or great grand parent may have had it, but no one know for sure. Thank you for your reply, it is nice to know I am not really alone even if it feels that way at times. It is hard to think positively knowing that so many things could potentially go wrong in the future and my life could be impacted in various ways. I try to be positive and go on as I normally have up to this point, but it is difficult at times when I dwell on it too deeply. I know everyone has different experiences with it, and I am sorry you have had so many poor experiences. It seems like it can be a difficult thing to live with so I suppose we just have to be strong. Yes we do. I was diagnosed at 4. I have had several issues throughout my lifetime. I have a learning disability, which lead to a longer than normal route in college. I finished with a bachelor\u2019s though. I have also undergone 27 brain surgeries during my lifetime. The shunt I had for hydrocephalus has been revised quite a few times. I also had a brain tumor but was somehow unrelated to NF. Even though I have had these issues, it has not caused any stress. To be honest, if I am told I need to go in for brain surgery, I just smile. I am usually in and out in one day and back to my normal activities almost immediately. I do not have to go for checkups unless I feel there is a problem or if I need a follow up. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. I was the first in my family to have it as well (that we know of). I was diagnosed at nine months when the doctors noticed my larger cafe-au-lait spots and the spotting along my groin and arm pits. It is been tough, and I am self-conscious of the fibromas on my back. Mine is not extremely visible (as of now) but it is still something I see as being different. \n\nIt is great that you already got your first MRI. I have been getting them for years. It is great that you knew your body well enough to feel that something was not right and I applaud you for really pushing to see what was happening. Also to note, get eye appointments regularly. If you do not know already NF can affect the lisch nodules in your eyes and it is good to keep an eye on that. I was not diagnosed till I was 19 (21 now). It is definitely raised a lot of concerns and questions for me. I have not been able to find a good surgeon or doctor. Definitely a weird thing to be diagnosed with at 20 I was not diagnosed until last year when I was 30 - your story sounds very familiar! Within a year I went from having a lump my primary care dr could not identify to having multiple MRIs, genetic testing, a slew of other scans and tests, and ultimately surgery. Now every year it is another routine of MRIs to keep monitoring things. It was extremely overwhelming at first for me too, and a huge life change. Knowing there are other people out there in the same boat as me made it a little easier, and I am slowly getting better at explaining to my friends and family what this all means (and why I am so frazzled from it). Having a good group of doctors to navigate everything has also been helpful. \n\nPM me if you want to talk! I was diagnosed when I was 18. Thankfully I have a mild case, my only problems are high blood pressure and a mild scoliosis.\n\nWhat I find weird though, around 2012 I was admitted to the hospital because I had suddenly gotten high blood pressure and felt really bad. They had no clue why I had this and they checked me everywhere but could not find anything. They did notice that I have many Caf\u00e9 au lait spots, and checked me for McCune\u2013Albright syndrome. However they did not check me for Neurofibromatosis, I have got no idea why.\n\nThen in 2016 I went to my doctor because my blood pressure was getting higher again despite my medications, and he sent me to an endocrinologist, because that has not really been checked yet. He also noticed the spots and offered to test my blood genetically for Neurofibromatosis, and that is how I got the diagnosis.\n\nBut thankfully I have got a mild case so I did not suffer any consequences for my late diagnosis. But it is still weird that no one thought about this earlier, I have had many doctors throughout my life notice the spots. My mom has it, so i was diagnosed at birth. I know what you mean though, I want to feel normal too and I pretend to be \ud83d\ude02 there a Facebook group and a few have gone to this doc in San Francisco his name is Andre Panossian. He did great work.", "What do early bumps look like on the skin?

Pls pm me if you are or happen to know anyone with this condition. Thank you!", "The start of a neurofibroma Hello all! I am a 24 year old female and i have yet to be diagnosed with NF. Although, I went to a dermatologist a few years back and they suggested that I had it. I have had little to no symptoms growing up other then all the CAL spots. I have many(big and small). I have one neurofibertoma that has been the same size since i was very young. I feel as though I am starting to get more! I am un aware of what the start of one looks like, at what age did you see more? What do they look like or feel like? I have a bunch of little bumps but they pop...(gross I know). So i am not sure if they are neurofbromas or not. I am set to see a dermatologist in a few months but i am getting very anxious.  Little bumps that are popping just sounds like clogged pores.  I was about 24 when I started to see more.  However, I was diagnosed at birth, but that is because my dad had it.  Luckily my optical gliomas have not really grown, nor my brain tumors.  I have just noticed more on my skin over the years. \nNeurofibromas never \"pop.\" They my start small like something coming up from under the skin. I have a few large ones, many small ones, and some of them are painful.\nBut good luck on the diagnosis, I hope you get more information. When did you first get diagnosed with brain tumors? I believe I was 2 years old. I think my mom still has the MRI images from back then.  I am not sure why I had the MRI, but I would say it would have been to see if I had NFs in the brain.\nI am 33 now, but I need to see a specialist to make sure the tumors do not grow.  Oh wow. Did you have any symptoms from the brain tumors? Sorry for all the questions. And when you get new bumps, they are the same color as skin? And how quickly did yours grow?  When I was 16 I noticed I was getting the soft tissue tumours. If you looked at me you probably could not tell I have NF besides the one soft tissue on my neck, the rest are on my back. \nI do however have a learning disability, dyslexia, coordination issues, depression and such. \nEveryone suffers a little differently from NF. Hi! 23 y.o. with NF1 here. (Been diagnosed since I was a baby) Usually the most common time to get neurofibromas is puberty. I believe you may also get them during pregnancy/menopause. They can pop up randomly though and grow.\n\nThey usually are pink bumps that will feel kind of firm with some give. They do not pop. \n\nIt might be scary but you might want to see a neuro-oncologist or somebody who specializes in the conditions to see if you need an MRI to check for internal ones. \n\nMine simply monitors my neurofibromas. Mine are mostly internal, brain and spine but have not affected me much. \n\nLet me know if you need any help. This kind of stuff can be scary sometimes, but you will get through it. How quickly do neurofibromas grow? Thanks for the help!! Honestly, it varies. Most of mine have not grown at all. They have just been there. I had a few pop up but I do not remember how long it took for them to appear.\n\nThe only one that really did grow was internal and it grew pretty quickly. I do not remember how much or how quickly but it was enough to be concerned. I had it removed and it was benign so no worries there. The two external ones I had removed did not grow much either. They were just in bad places.\n\nBut really the growth varies and if they are removed they can grow back (unfortunately). The neurofibromas for me are pinkish. I have a few flat ones that are more purplish and doctors usually think they are bruises.\n\nIf you cannot see a neuro-oncologist or similar doctor sooner, keep track of the neurofibromas and if they are changing in anyway. It will be helpful. A dermatologist cannot really do any treatment and a specialist can help you with a lot of stuff and give you answers to a lot of your questions about how your specific case of NF could affect you. NF really varies from person to person so no two cases are alike.\n\nHope this helps. Sorry for the late reply, I was dealing with a death in my family.\nI really do not know if I have symptoms from the brain tumors. I actually might, but I never have seen a specialist. I really have been thinking about going to see one.\nWhen I get new bumps they tend to be skin color, then become pink or brown after growing large enough (the brown are older ones). Some are painful if moved the wrong way. It is hard to say how fast they grow and what triggers the growth.  I have been trying to see what causes them to grow, but I think it is just with age.\n", "My NF diagnosis story: Oh ya I know I have a feeling some of you might get a little kick out of my NF diagnosis story, it is quite unusual and very late night sitcom-esk.  I first need to say I was born into some very  favorable circumstances. My dad is a doctor and a damn good one at that. In addition I was even more lucky that my dad had a patient with NF at the time of my birth. Having someone with deep medical knowledge in your life can really help put a cap on and contextualize family medical drama.  That is if they remember to tell you about all that fancy medical stuff. Now my dad is an   amazing doctor, an amazing father, and he treats my mom very well, but when off work he has the tendency to be a little bumbling and unfocused. This is where the story starts. My dad got a phone call from a female medical school friend that she was going to be in town and wanted to meet up. My dad, being the nice guy he is, invited her over to dinner. Now my mom absolutely hated this woman. My mom thought this friend was loud, obnoxious, and inconsiderate. But what is done is done, she was going to be coming over and my mom just had to fake enthusiasm. The night of the dinner comes and this medical school friend joins my parents for a nice dinner and some catching up. \nAt this time I was still a baby, like around 1 if I remember the story correctly. During the dinner the friend looked at me, paused for a moment, then turned to my dad. She asks \"Does PM_ME_KIM_JONG-UN happen to have neurofibromatosis?\" My dad casually responds with, \"Oh ya, I know. He does.\" Now this is the first time my mom ever heard of this. She does not know what neurofibromatosis is. She has no clue what issue this lady is seeing in her cute baby boy.  \"Neurofibromatosis, what the hell is that!\" \"What is going on!\" \"Is my baby going to die!\" were likely the thoughts rushing  through my mom's mind. My mom proceeds to break down crying, which pretty much ends the dinner. So that is the story of how I got diagnosed with NF.\n\nTL;DR: My dad is a doctor and forgot to tell my mom he diagnosed me with NF.  Still married I hope.  Yes, they are still married. They can look back at this story and laugh  That is a very funny story, but I can imagine your mother must have been very unpleasantly surprised. Has your dad ever told you why he did not share this with your mother at an earlier stage? While NF generally is not a life threatening disease, I think it would be serious enough to share this as soon as it is diagnosed. Also, I am curious as to how your dad\u2019s friend was able to see you have NF, just from looking at you, especially since you were just a baby - that is very sharp.  It was very much so indeed a very unpleasant surprise, but all turned out well and all is well past any drama. I never explicitly asked my dad, but I imagine it was the fact he was in his own head. He likely knew he did not need to freak out but just keep an eye on me. He knew what to look for and to him that was about it. It kind of makes sense. My mom sometimes complains that when it comes to sickness or death my dad has the tendency to be a little emotionally distant from it and he has the tendency to  look at the facts of the matter.     \n \nAs for what tipped her off I was told it was the caf\u00e9 au lait spots. I was surprised about that too.  ", "Found a new lump today... So the last few days i have had a bit of pain in my right testicle. At first I was not too worried and assumed it would got away.  But come three days later it has not and was not getting any better. So today I decided I should check myself for any lumps.  I found one. I felt a small but very painful lump. I called and made an appointment with my doctor straight away and will be seeing him tomorrow. I am a little bit worried that it might be something serious. Hope not. ", "Neurofibromatosis Type ? I have these kinds of spot all over my body some are very tiny some are big. They have not created any medical problem as such for me but I wanted to lighten the small one on my face.

Or whether it can be treated ", "Awaiting the call back from my first MRI I called my doctors office to remind them to call me and I heard the nurse ask if \u201cmy tumor markings have changed?\u201d No idea what that means exactly made the mistake of googling that and now I am firmly believing I have cancer and I will die.  Taking some sleep meds so I can stop my brain from going a millions miles a second.  Not all tumors and growths are cancerous! I know saying do not worry is easier said than done, but try to stay positive. My son has a tumor In his brain but its non cancerous and nothing to worry about. He has an MRI every 2 years to keep an eye on it, but his doctors are happy that its non threatening. Do not be afraid to contact your doctor and tell them your worries. They can probably put your mind at rest.  The vast majority of NF-related tumors are non-cancerous. Yeah. Not all tumors are cancerous. (If they were we would all be screwed) It is good to get them monitored to make sure they do not change but I have survived 23 years so far, with three brain tumors and a bunch in my spine, so there is that.\n\nHave a cup of calming tea, watch your favorite show and breath. 99% chance everything is okay. You are not going to die. I have neurofibromatosis, an in both 2014 and 2018, I have had cancerous tumors successfully removed. Before I had them removed I was experiencing extreme pain where these tumors were located, once they were removed the pain was gone, along with the cancerous tumor.\n\n Did you have to do chemo or radiation?  No, I did not. And people with neurofibromatosis really should not have either one unless it is absolutely necessary, because both can make the neurofibromatosis tumors worse. My last surgery from April 2018 there was concern that I might need to have radiation, they would not know until they opened up my arm. Thankfully it was not as bad as they thought and there was no need for radiation which was something they did not want to do given how both can effect people with neurofibromatosis. This has actually been very comforting. Thank you so much.  You are welcome. If you have any other questions feel free to ask. Also there are about 4-5 different drug trials going on, that are showing results of 20-40% shirkage of tumors. My doctor who diagnosed me when I was 15 about twenty years ago, is hoping to get me into one of them. We just have to figure out which one is best for me given that I live out of state of the hospital that he works at and most trials have special conditions that need to be made. I do not think I can add any more but agree with what others have said\n Yeah they mentioned one that is not yet approved by the FDA but it is in their clinical studies.

Sure, I have a facial disfigurement that has affected my eyesight and my hearing in my right ear. Sure, people look and make comments toward me when I walk down the street. The one thing that matters is that I love myself and I have good people around me who love me too. I know it does not seem like a lot but some things are simple and try not to overthink them. My husband lost a significant amount in the last year. It is been hard but having a support system is important. Finding people who are willing to communicate can be frustrating but also worth it. He uses notepad on his iPhone in public when communicating. It is not perfect and can be a pain. We are working on learning sign language. The deaf community is wonderful and vibrant. Definitely look there for resources. You might connect with a lot of people.

I just live one day at a time. I do not worry about NF. I actually hardly even think about it. I am lucky to have a mild case. I have had 27 brain surgeries but have not been stressed about them tough. I play quite a bit of golf and go out all the time. I am very approachable and I am good at talking with people. My advice to you is not to let NF define you who are. We were all dealt different cards at birth. We just have to try and make the best of our lives.

I guess I should not let this disease define me and my life that is a start. The point is to focus on what you have. Many people live perfect lives with no hearing. You just have to learn a different form of communication. \nI feel you though. My son is mute/non verbal (reason unknown, his hearing is fine) and so my whole family is having to learn sign language.

Have a handful left and nice to still have them around. Nice to see someone outside my family able to have the patience to communicate with me. On my good days the main thing that makes me feel good I notice is being productive. I am not currently employed but been doing projects and trying to learn something everyday whether it be sign language or coding or something. I have lazy days for sure I just try to remind myself to not let those lazy days stretch out into multiple days. I am down to shoot the sh*t whenever.

Perhaps it would help with surgery scars too. ", "Recreational steroid use Does anyone have any experience with HRT, Sarms and any form a steroids and would any cause a spike in tumor growth. I believe that the testosterone therapy offered at some male medical clinics can have a direct impact on increased growth. It causes a major change in your body chemistry and triggers growth. I have not been able to link it directly but I had no issues or sign of NF until I was almost 40 at which point I would been to the clinic looking for that prescribed medical edge to help recovery times and training for races. Not long after I had the growths start. Thinking it was a side effect of the therapy (steroids) I stopped treatment but it was too late. The NF gene had been awakened. I do not have the specific experience you are asking about but it is well documented that hormone changes can have a significant impact on tumor growth.  Do not do it. Have you tried any others besides testosterone I would have to look back and see what all was prescribed. I believe it was simply to boost available testosterone levels. This would be something best to speak with your doctor about. I took HGH as a child to grow taller and had no tumor growth but I was very closely monitored and got MRIs every three months to make sure there were no changes.", "Any expierence with Dr. Andre Panossian Hi guys. 27M here.

That Is super late.\nIm just worried \nMy question is i might do an ivf when i grow up but does pregnancy really make it worse?\nAnd how does hormones make it worse? What Is the science?\nAlso can i get tattoos on my birthmarks or small bumps??\nc I too was diagnosed when I was 15 (I will be 37 later this month) neither one of my parents, grandparents, or even my three younger siblings have it. My understanding is yes unfortunately pregnancy can make Neurofibromatosis worse for someone, nf does effect everyone differently, but there is a chance that during pregnancy your condition can get worse and there is a chance it will remain the same. There is a 50% chance of your children being born with nf, now there are things that can be down medically like the IVF to prevent/reduce the chances of passing it on to your future children.\n\nIf you have questions let me know. Hi ya!\n\nI was told your youth will mostly predict how bad you will have it throughout your life. If you both were adults/older and then learned you have it  I think you might not have to worry about a horrible case you would mostly be past it. I mean anything can happen and hormones can always change it. Woman and menopause I am told can make it worse as well. \nIt really is differnt for everyone. Which stinks but also means you might be totally fine. \n\nI know its impossible not to worry, but try not to stress so much about. That too can make it worse. \n\nYou can still do ivf with a surrogate if you dont want to be pregnant yourself. however you still need to do the hormone shots and stuff so I think it would still be a risk of  increasing symptoms. I went to a doctor would told me the risk was lower than being pregnant myself.\n\nI know people who get tattoos on theirs so I think that depends on your pain tolerance. I have not read anything on how that would cause anything negative.\n\nHow are you and your mom handling things? I will be thinking of you both. The basic science behind potential increases in neurofibromas during pregnancy is the increased amount of hormones / growth factors going around the body. This in a way mirrors the reason why plexiform neurofibromas generally grow faster in kids, because they also have a lot of growth factors going around their bodies that are involved in their development and maturity. The important thing to know is that most women with NF1 have healthy pregnancies, so you should just discuss with your doctor to find out more about the risks specific to you. This also relates to your question on tattoos. Part of the reason tumours can regrow after surgical resection is the increase in growth factors needed for wound healing. I could not say for sure but I would imagine tattoos might be risky given the damage they cause to the skin, and therefore the need for growth factors to heal those wounds. Again, probably a question for your doctor but there might be some members of the subreddit who have first hand experience on this who can advise Lots of good answers already here. I recommend ( for more detailed answers and references. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have tattoos over some bumps and some discolored areas of skin and have not had an issue so far. Your mileage may vary as that each case and tattoo is unique. 2nding that tattoos are not an issue for me either since i cannot speak to pregnancy. Using your egg, you have 50% of passing it along to your child. This can be learning disabilities too. Getting tattoos on top of your neuromas  means colored bumps. Later on, if they or when do appear to be sort of honest.. They can be removed if they are painful.\n   Or possibly they will be internal.  You might or might not be bothered by them. It is a hard call when your body responds.\n     Have you had that one blood test for chromosome 17?  It is a long road of acceptance. By now if you do not have major headaches, or body pains this is great.  Just look up NF1.  The tumors can grow in the brain, but this it not a big deal. They are tiny. Children get these.  Tumors on your spine--these are non cancerous. They cannot be removed. As cutting them out cause damage spinal cord. It just causes daily pain as they in-between the vertebrae.   This can seen on a MRI.  Optical tumors exists. \nUsually NF1 and NF2 is treated early on babies. The medical world does a great job with babies. As these on babies can be cancerous. Sort of rare for adults.\n    So, as an adult you have neuromas to watch for, your heart. Not passing it your child. And it will be your choice of you want to take a chance to trigger it your own body.  So many babies are out in the world that need to be adopted.\n     I would NEVER want to take a chance to trigger NF1 or NF2. Or think about passing it along to precious child.  But this truly is you choice.  I have NF1, and am very grateful that I never passed it along to my child. Sad but true, but if you are in procreation period of life, consider adopting. Then you will not trigger anything in your body. Or if you want to have your own child it is 50%.   I have done my homework. It is just my two cents. I have done a lot reading. I was diagnosed late in life.  And.. the light bulb was turned on for me... I had my answer as to why.. I had to speed through it all.. If you know what I mean.   Like when you see your life in slow-mo  as mine was the classic.\n    You are going to be fine, but things do happen.  Finding the right MDs along the way, and  most of all friends.  I have several tattoos, and I have tattooed over my cafe au lait spots with no ill effects. I have never tattooed over existing neurofibromas, but I have had a couple insect bite ones grow in an area i have had tattooed. I have also heard of people tattoo over smaller neurofibromas without trouble, and they say that it has made the bumps less obvious to others.  \n\n\nYour mom must not have a lot of obvious symptoms (i.e. few bumps etc) to have only found out in her late 40's. Is her case very mild?  \n\n\nI am 36 (m) and i have had a pretty mild case so far, with my skin bumps fairly late in terms of onset (they began late 20s). But, to date, no one will be able to tell i have it unless they knew specifically what to look for. I am saying this because not all cases progress in the way you mostly read about online, either through medical articles or anecdotes from people. I know it is hard, but do not worry about something that has not happened yet.\n\nRe: Pregnancy. I have read in forums about the experiences of women with nf1 and pregnancy and it really is very case dependent. Some have had no increase of bumps during or soon after the pregnancy, while some say it went haywire during or soon after they got pregnant. It might not be entirely helpful to know about how other cases go because it might not reflect the way your case progresses, because nf1 is super variable. I was diagnosed at 7 with NF1. I am 32 now. We did not want to pass it on to our children and I am currently 33 weeks pregnant with our first baby through IVF w/ PGD (genetic testing). Pregnancy has definitely made my bumps worse. I have never been covered or anything but I have quite a lot of new ones and some have grown too. But it is worth it to me and I also know my baby is healthy which is the best feeling ever. how worse was it  get? and how bad it was in first place? what is plexiform neurofibromas? Tumors continued to grow in size. New ones continued to develop, as I have gotten older my balance and strength had gotten worse. In both 2014 and 2018 I have had tumor turn cancerous. In 2006 I had tumor grow on my cervical spine that if I did not have them removed I could have woken up one day unable to move. Since then the tumors have grown back, but right now they are not pressing against my cervical spine. \n\nWhen I was 15, I did not have too many issue using stairs, but I did have a good size mass on my right leg and one on my arm. The one on my arm was removed in 2001 as a preventative measure. I did have occasional tremors in my hands, but those have seemed to go away. i dont have anything to say rather just\n\n thanks glad really! Things are going to fine, you just need to work through it all. You will live. You will make it. Now is your time to read all about it. Work through any depression or issues that you have, as things have changed. They change for anyone who has NF1. Just know you are still loved the same way. I am 30 and I got diagnosed about a year and a half ago while I was already pregnant with my second baby. (The doctor at a prenatal appointment noticed one of my birthmarks and recommend I see a geneticist.) My daughter (firstborn) has NF1 too, but my son does not. My dad and my sister most likely have it also, but have not been formally diagnosed yet.\n\nI have one bump (neurofibroma) that did grow a little larger while I was pregnant, and I also got a handful of new very itty bitty ones on my torso while pregnant. Being pregnant sucks in general, so the effects from NF1 were not relatively a big deal for me at all. I am do not know the specifics of the science of it, but pregnancy causes massive temporary changes to your hormones and immune system and all together it makes you more likely to have the bumps growing.\n\nBeing diagnosed later in life is not something to worry about now. My geneticist says that the more severe complications of NF1 usually show up very early, like by the time you are 4 or 5 years old. For women with NF1, there is an increased risk of breast cancer a bit earlier in life than for most women, so your doctor may want you to start getting mammograms at age 30. Your mom is old enough that she should already be getting breast cancer screenings, so that is not a particular concern for her.\n\nYou should definitely be able to get tattoos on your birthmarks, but I am not sure about whether you can get them on your bumps. It would probably depend on their size, whether they are growing, and the comfort of the tattoo artist with attempting it. thank you, lot of love! thanks for ypur info!  \nim so so happy that your son doesnt have it, he is lucky!  \ni hope you, your sister, your father and daughter all are fine always thanks for all this info!i am glad your case is mild!

I have had two surgeries to remove them and they were both cancerous. They we both located in my upper right arm and upper right leg. The one in my leg was a higher grade cancerous tumor that was pretty large. It caused a lot of pain that would shoot up, so much so that it made it difficult to drive, sit for long periods and even to lay down and fall asleep was difficult. The one in my arm was a lower grade, about the size of an egg. It too caused a lot of burn, my arm would have this shooting burning pain that could last 15-20 minutes. There tumors like most nf tumors were wrapped around my nerves, which can make them difficult to remove. It talks chronic pain that can be related to NF1. 1:3000 births. So shiny pokemon rare. does painful neurofibroma mean canverous? No, I still have pain, but the type of pain I had when it where the tumor turned out to be cancerous was different than the every day pain. I need to have an mri done to confirm and also at least for my arm I needed a biopsy to know that it was cancerous okay thanks", "Anxiety with my NF1- encouragement would be amazing! I am a first time poster here. So, I am really struggling with (almost debilitating) anxiety. This anxiety has to do with the possibility of getting cancer in the future due to NF. Even though I have it pretty mild, it is still possible. The thought of cancer terrifies me. I read a lot about breast cancer and brain cancer ...maybe a little too much. I want to be able to grow old and not die of cancer. I have not met too many people in their 60s and beyond with NF1 and that scares me. I am part of a fb support group (faces of NF if you are looking for one) but that does not always help. It almost makes it worse because I see so many people who are struggling. I get it, and I think the majority of us deal with that fear, so to a certain extent it is normal. Just to put another spin on it, having a rare disorder forces us to be more self educated about our condition, which also means we are more aware of what may or may not happen. Worrying about the outcomes of something you are very informed of would be a normal thing. It would be a part of your self preservation. It is okay, and even healthy to worry...a little bit. If you are like me, it is difficult to stop the anxiety cycle, but try your best to limit how much you research things online. Remind yourself that they are coming out with more research, and advancements on combination therapies. Keeping in mind the hope for newer treatments, and gratitude for what we have, will also help build resilience for the paths we are forced to take. It is okay to feel whatever you are feeling, and then let it go. \n\nPeople post on NF forums for advice for their struggles, or to vent. Hardly anyone shouts to the internet abyss to make chit chat over how well they are doing. Also many chronic illness forums can end up an echo chamber for negativity, especially when the disease involves pain or disfigurement. The Neurofibromatosis Inspire forums has quite a few people over 60, but in general I prefer the crowd here. I feel like NF Facebook groups feels like Limbo for Anxiety (it never freaking ends). It sure is a limbo for anxiety! I am tempted to leave all the groups on fb and just hangout here. I am holding onto the hope of having a milder case! I also get where you are coming from. I recently face a lot anxiety of thinking about what possibly my life may be in the future. I have had a lot of pain in my legs recently and I always think back to it might be cancer or it is cancer, I will have to tell myself that there are people out there with or without enough who have it worse than me so I need to suck it up and power through. We are all here for you no matter what, if you want to talk DM me or if you just want to rant I am also here. We are love you and care about you\ufffc Aw, your leg pain probably is not cancer! I have knee pain, but I also walk on the side of my feet. If it was cancer I would be dead by now. I think what helps me is knowing that cancer is still rare in people with NF. That is what I have heard, anyway. Thanks for the encouragement! I am glad I found this sub. :) I get where your coming from and I have the same fear too. I would not call it an anxiety in my case but more of an want to understand my body. It is an important thing to consider when you have NF. The fact it is on your mind show to me you care about you and your body. The main issue it sounds is it causes personal and mental struggles.  \n\nFor me that important thing is education and being proactive. I was blessed to be in the fortunate circumstances of having a dad who is a doctor. He was able to teach me alot about NF and how to take care of my body with having NF. The first thing is keeping my body healthy and strong. Having a strong immune system is not just only important for recognizing cancer cells and killing them but having a happy and productive life. The second thing is knowing that I do need to do these checkups with my doctor more often and set up a plan. I get a ct brain scan every two years. Also if I find any new bumps that I consider out of the ordinary I talk with my doctor... even if it is on an embarrassing location like my ^^^^^left ^^^^^butt ^^^^^cheek. The third is knowing my body. I know this sounds weird, but to make the second point possible I try to know for me what feels normal, what on my body I feel is normal, and understand what is my normal. \n\n\nI would say that my top advice is to say what you are feeling is not wrong. I feel it needs to be redirected to fill a productive mindset. This is a very interpersonal process. We may be linked by having NF-1, but we are different people with different bodies. I think finding the self-care plan, preventative care plan, and bodily understanding is important to redirect this feeling. I think it is normal to be hit by anxiety for various reasons when diagnosed with NF. My best advice is for you is to  talk about this with your doctor.   \n\n\nI was diagnosed with NF1 at about age 4 and underwent cytotoxic therapy in elementary school. I still consider my lucky as my case is not as severe as it is for many others. My main problems are with my vision as it cannot be fully restored even with glasses.  \n\n\nAs fpr anxiety I try to be careful with that word as it is often misused and abused these days, but I am very reluctant to talk about my diagnose and am scared to death to date because I do not want to ruin a fully healthy woman's dreams of having a family with fully healthy children. I do not want to bother anyone with my issues. I control the things I can to prevent cancer or limit the impact. I do the mammograms and the monthly breast exam, eat healthy with lots of veggies, try to maintain a healthy weight, and exercise. I cannot control my genetics but I can control my day to day life.  And I try to focus on the fact it is better to know the risk then to be unaware because you are less likely to dismiss a symptom and delay getting treatment.", "NF and all its problems with me Neurofibromatosis type 1 is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with a tumor suppressor gene defect on chromosome 17q. Its incidence is 1 in 3500 persons. Although NF1 has variable expression, it is usually recognized by cutaneous stigmas such as caf\u00e9-au-lait macules and intertriginous freckling and by development of neurofibromas. Plexiform neurofibromas are a distinct type of neurogenic tumor with malignant potential. About 10% of patients with NF1 develop malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors with very poor prognosis. Bone dysplasia, scoliosis, and meningeal defects (spanning from dural ectasia to meningoceles) are common in patients with NF1. Intrathoracic meningoceles are rare but, when present, are usually seen in the constellation of NF1. The etiology of meningoceles is thought to be herniation of spinal meninges with cerebrospinal fluid extrusion through enlarged intervertebral foramina. \n\n\nI have an very large inoperable 6.5cm meningocele mass along with being fused from C2 to T12 Apply for the study to take selumetinib! It has been proven to make the tumors smaller.", "Just wanted to introduce myself Just wanted to say hi. I was happy to find a group here on reddit. I have not gotten a NF diagnosis yet but heres my story so far.  I am 40 and I have been in the military for 11 years now. I tore a muscle in my back 5 years ago during training and have had consistently worsening pain pretty well since. I am in the combat arms and chalked it up to the tear and the consistent training tempo ( and maybe a bit of age lol ). So xrays showed some issues but nothing that would account for the constant pain so I was sent to a physiatrist who sent me for a MRI. I got the results yesterday and have neurofibroma's along my T7 through to my T10, 7 8 and 10 are on the left side, 9 is on the right. The Doc is sending me for an enhanced MRI and then to see a neurosurgeon. I have been doing the Dr. Google searches which only freaked me out a bit. Glad there is a group of real people here. \nSo ya, Hi.  No more googling!!  That will definitely scare the bejesus out of you!  \nNfnetwork.org \n\nMake sure the neurosurgeon is experienced with NF.  If not the above site will show you NF docs in your area \n\nGood luck!

If so how did you meet ?  Moved close to a major city (for a job, not for dating, but it dramatically increases the number of people one can meet). Did online dating (ok Cupid, back in the day). Realized that as a man I had to send lots of messages without getting too invested in expecting replies. Really made the effort. Got a few replies, some turned into dates, a couple into second dates. Was old enough at this point to know what I wanted and was not just looking for play (nothing wrong with that, just not my goal at that point). Eventually met a great woman, am married now. \n\nMy nf is \u201cmild\u201d \u2014 only one tumor\u2014 but then again, it is on my face. Also I am a man. \n\nI was insecure about dating when I was a teen/college years, eventually got over it. Figured out how to have an active social life while single, which I highly recommend. Makes you more interesting and happier. \n\nAlso I super recommend to just about anyone that they should move closer to a city (of at least a million people) if they are not already. There is a lot more people doing stuff, and usually more single people, and people more welcoming of outsiders, since that is pretty common. Smaller towns settle into routines of child rearing and close circles of friends and that is hard to break into if it is not where you are. Plus, better medical care in cities.  I have been married for a little over a year now and we met on the Tinder. I let him know right away about my NF and showed him some fibromas. He did not seem to mind, even my hideous back.  I am engaged. Was married before. I had known my ex-wife since high school. Met my fiance on ok cupid. She is amazing, she always says she wishes I just had one day where I felt 100%, but it is not my fault I am sick and it does not change anything  I do. We met on OK Cupid. I have been very shy when first meeting and never good at making the first move. But to be honest this was not necessarily because of my NF. It is fairly mild, and I did not really start getting as obvious until recent years. \n\nBut I was up front about it on first meeting. Chatting online helps a lot. I am smart and funny and can do they well without having to look at a lady I fancy's face.  How and when did you get over the insecurity?  What tips do you have to have a more active social life while single? I do not think I should give advice to a stranger about these sorts of things. I do not know how old you are, or where you are, or (especially  on this subreddit) how nf affects you.\n\nBut, what worked for me to be a more sociable single, especially post-college, was to get involved in meetups via ( I was new to the city I was in so that was a natural resource to use. I found a few meetup groups that seemed interesting to me and tried to attend meetups regularly, with an emphasis on regularly (even if I was not super motivated every time). Lots of people come and go in these things, but if you are a regular, you start seeing the same other regulars, and you get to know one another. But even if that does not happen, because you picked an activity you enjoy already (whether that is hiking or eating out or talking about books) you are having fun anyway. After the groups went away I stayed in touch the people who were 'regulars', at first just as few people who I knew were reliably interested in going on hikes. Some became friends.\n\nI also did some volunteering. I tried to do things that were specific to my interests and skills, so that it could be something I could keep doing regularly more easily. For example, though did not end up working with my schedule,  I got trained to help people learn how to write.\n\nThe general idea is do things you enjoy, ideally with people, ideally consistently with the same people. If you are shy, do not worry about 'socializing', just try to do things you enjoy with other people. My husband and I also met on ok Cupid. I am seeing a trend here haha. I was on the site off and on but mostly on for 3.5 years. Online dating is a soul sucking experience but it was completely worth it in the end. If I had to go back in time and do it again for twice as long to get to where I am today I would do it in a heartbeat. Once you find the right person and put in the effort to have a healthy relationship, it is the greatest thing in the world. But that takes time and being completely okay with however long it is going to take. What you resist persists. Until I stopped putting pressure on every date wondering if it would finally turn into a relationship, nothing EVER turned into anything. But when I finally knew I was worth it and it would definitely happen eventually, and I was 100% okay with however long it took, that was when I finally met my husband. Because I was finally open.  I got married a little over a month ago.  We met on Plenty it Fish in June of 2013, he proposed April 2017 and got married July 2018.  We had the conversation about my neurofibromatosis pretty quickly.  I have a few small bumps on hand which he asked about and we had the conversation then. I am married and we are celebrating our anniversary on Oct 11. We met on a online dating site ( and we have been together seven year and have been married almost four.", "Tumour Behind right eye Causing a droopy eye/eyelide I am a 28M with NFI 1 its deemed to be a \"mild case\" but i have tumours in my brain, spine stomach. I have always had a droopy eye light on my right side which gets worse as i get tired and have always hated it to the point of refusing to have photos taken of me. I went to a plastic surgeon to get it corrected 2 years ago but we discovered there was a tumour behind the eye that pushed the eye forward i think its called  Mechanical Ptosis and was told that it may be risky if the tumour grows over time.

My fiance knows I have NF and loves me regardless. She sees me sick and in pain, and is right by my side. She just loves me. The nf is just something I have, it does not define me or us. There are people who can see past it, and will love you for who you are Yes that is something I do kind of worry about  Been loved and in love before.  Just remember everyone is a person just like you.  Some people have problems too, only different from yours.  Nf1. Pretty bumpy. Lots of cal spots lots of weird nipple looking bumps. Short. Getting married next September. She knows all about my nf1 and is very cool about it. I still worry sometimes, but then I think if someone would not love you because you have NF, then they do not deserve you. :) true love would not care and would be supporting.  I did worry about it for while, But I found someone who loves me and we are getting married next June! Sometimes I still worry about the likelihood of passing it on to kids, but he is very understanding of that as well.  I had an ex who would kiss my bumps. It was very sweet.  Sometimes yes. Mostly with the learning disability I have with it. I am on the lower end of having fibromas, and the spots. But everything else is a concern for me. Even when it comes to friendships. \n I wondered that until I was 21. I honestly thought that I was going to be alone, and single until I died. I was super shy and struggled with just having conversations with people. I still do until I know them. I met my wife in college, who loved my imperfections, she thinks they are amazing. I am incredibly lucky to have met her. She had no worries about our children knowing the risk that they would inherit it. Her grandmother is not a fan of me, only because of my NF1. She does not like having \"disfigured\" great grand-kids. But there will be plenty of people who are supportive and willing to stick with you and love you.

It is from April 17th to 19th in Scottsdale, Arizona.\n\nHere is a link to the event's webpage, if anyone is interested.\n", "When &amp; how did your parents tell you about your NF1? My son was suspected as having NF1 since age 4, but the Genetic test came back negative.  Now that puberty is here, he is developing neurofibromas and his pediatrician feels he definitely has it despite the negative genetics test. He is got enough other criteria. \n\nHere is the thing, he does not really know he has it or what it is. When do I tell him? It is definitely mild thus far. And I do not want to add unnecessary stress to his life. Teen years suck enough without worrying about this condition if his symptoms do not need treatment yet. \n\nAdvice? Experiences? Anything you wish your folks had done differently?  Honestly, it is his life, it is his body.  He deserves to know.  It is much more terrifying to not understand. and in the case of bullying and self esteem, it is still just as likely to happen when there is a word for it vs keeping him in the dark.  My parents did not tell me until I was about 13 despite me asking them many times why I had to go through multiple check ups every year. Their reasoning was that they did not want me to worry too much about my condition and potentially spoil my quality of life at such a young age. Now while I appreciate their intentions, I would probably have preferred to be clued in on what was going on earlier. Having MRIs, eye tests and etc became confusing and stressful once I started questioning why I had to do it.\nSo it is up to you and how you think your child is going handle it but if recommend telling them sooner rather than later.  I know you mean well so I will be nice, but keeping your kid away from understanding himself and nf is not a good idea. My dad tried protecting me from it by not letting me go to any nf events or to meet others out of fear that I would not be able to handle the possible ways I could be affected later in life. Do not hide anything he needs to know about his own health. I knew from a very young age but it was never really talked about as I had no issues. \nThere were the uncomfortable doctor appointments getting poked and prodded by new interns checking the auxiliary freckling. \nMy son has it too and I never hid it as he is covered in cafe au lait spots. \nI would have a light but frank conversation as NF is very unpredictable but not always so scary.  You should tell him so he understands why he gets neurofibromas My mom has it, and I was diagnosed at a very young age. I have always had a large cafe-au-lait on my neck, so I have always known I was different. I do not remember how old I was, but really young when my mom talked to me about it and NF. I handled it well, and knowing about it helped me mentally prepare for the other manifestations as they came, and eventually the tumors. I think your son can handle it, too, and as others have said, IMO I think it is better for a kid to know what he has. I do not quite remember when I was told, but I remember around grade 3, I came home upset that people kept pointing out my strange \u201cBirthmarks\u201d. Then, my mom who also has it, was very straight forward with me, and patiently answered any questions I had.  My parents told me when I questioned why we were going to the \"brain doctor\". I must have been 8 at the time. I have NF and work in a children\u2019s hospital. From my person and professional experience I would tell him. Having a word for the changes he is noticing in his body (..apart from puberty) can be comforting. Also, you will never be the \u201cliar\u201d later in life. I understand your desire to shield him, but telling him and letting him know that it does not change who he is, his capabilities, or personality is the best option, in my opinion.  When I was 7, my mom noticed a growth on the back of my leg. We checked me into the hospital to run some checks, where a doctor who had a look at me had a suspicion and called the leading NF expert in the country at the time to come over. He just bluntly confirmed that I had NF1 since I had all the telltale signs, did not even run a genetic test. I was then just sent home and did not get to play any Nintendo. From there pretty much just introduced to it together with my parents through doctors and the national NF1 union. Thank you all for your advice and experiences. I will tell him.  I was in the same situation being the kid. When I was born doctors always believed I had it, but test results were always inconclusive. Then once puberty hit the on switch came on and I was diagnosed when I was 15. \n\nIt did suck having to spend a whole week in the hospital for all the tests to be done and having to lay still for full body MRI scans. I was never mad at my parents, just mad at the disease. If his doctor thinks he has it then you need to get him to be tested by a doctor who studies and sees other people with neurofibromatosis. My childhood doctor always believed I had it since I was a toddler.  I knew from a young age that I had something different, of course being young you do not quite understand about NF.....all I knew was that I was different and I had to get a MRI every other year. What I understood was that I got to miss school to go into a loud machine, but hey, my parents would give me a present for putting up with it all, so I was not upset. \n\nI have the markings, which is tough as it prevented (and still prevents) me from dressing the way most girls dress. I was quite understanding of it, and my parents were always taking preventative measures to make sure I stayed healthy, which is the best thing you can do. \n\nMy eye doctor just happened to have done a case study on NF, so he was familiar with tumors on the optic nerve. My best advice would be to tell him, let him know that it is nothing horrible. He just has to be more careful than most people which would be limited time in the sun and going to more doctors visits than other kids his age.\n\nIf he is worried about it affecting his relationships tell him not to worry. Every relationship I have ever been in I told them. I like to think that the so is reaction tells you everything you need to know about them. If you do not accept it, or crinkle their nose, you do not need that type of person in your life. If they are accepting, then you know you have somebody who is looking at you as a person, not for your image or for the better. \n\nI think my parents handled it as best as they could. We had little to no idea what it was when I was diagnosed at 9 months back in 1992. We gradually learned and accepted this is who I was. I am not going to lie to you, it does affect me. I had the learning disabilities associated with it, and in 2001 they found a tumor on my brain, which I got removed the following year. NF is a part of me, for better or worse. \n\nAll I can stress, is be ahead of everything. Make sure he gets to the eye doctor every year, maybe try to find one who is familiar with it, and get an MRI or something. Tumors can develop anywhere, but the brain and spine are two of the most common locations. \n\n*Sorry if I repeated some things.... My parents have told me for as long as I can remember. As far as I know, I have known I  had NF all my life. I think it was best that way -- I cannot imagine being surprised by it, or by having weird symptoms I could not understand. I had a facial tumor which is not fun a teenager but my case was otherwise pretty mild. If I were your son, I would want to know. I have known since I was very very young. I had a bow in my tibia which required major surgery. So they let me know about it so that I could understand why I was having all these surgeries and had to go to the doctors every few months and have MRIs done. It was not till I was a teenager that I actually researched it on my own.  How was pregnancy with NF? My husband and I want children, but as of now are planning on going the adoption route because we fear passing my NF and the complications that can occur while pregnant. \n\nI do not have an extremely severe case. I have two tumors that cannot be removed, both on my arm. One is fairly large but does not cause me any pain or discomfort. \n\nI know there is a 50% chance of passing it and if it does it could be very mild or extremely severe, you will not know until the child is born. \n\nDid you do genetic testing when you first got pregnant and how was your actual pregnancy?\n\n I have always know, I guess my parents told me when I was very young.\nYou should tell him. I would tell him when he asks about his fibromas.\nI would help him by making him aware of what is going on, letting him know that things are under control. \nIMO/IME it is going to be WAY more stressful if he does not know what is going on.\nBest of luck\n", "I have nf1 and feel worse :( Hi,i have nf1. Have it from my mother. I always Found it difficult to handle. I have the lumbs and some caf\u00e9 aux lait spots. So i knew it from birth. Already removed some with surgery. I am now 34 years old and since one year it get worse.i had a lot of stress because  bought an apartment and had lots of renovation also started back with anticonception. So probably that is why getting worse ..\n\nBut i hate myself and now it is summer and so hot and i cannot nothing Else then to wear short sleeves. Normally i say when wearing long sleeves ow not that hot. But there is a heating now and cannot say it. It also started more in my face,... That i think is more worse :(. \n\nHow do you guys handle this... Do you come out? Do you wear short sleeves? Are their People having it worse that are married or having a boyfriend? \n\nPS: Sorry for my bad English :)\n\nAnd thanks for reading i just want to write it of  It can be difficult at times. I have had a shop keeper ask me if I have chicken pox before! I am starting to care less and less as time goes on. I cannot avoid showing mine all of the time (all across my chest and back)\n\nMost people do not say anything at all. Some people do. Depending on my mood will depend how I deal with it. I work with kids so I tell them it is skin tags/moles (although they insist I have been stung by many, many bees) for people I am closer to I tell the truth. The lady thay asked of I had chicken pox caught me off guard and I panicked and said yes and before I knew it I was spinning a whole story about how I got them and that km getting better now. Which I can totally laugh about now at a later date. Yes most off the times they asked me if i get bit by musquitos... But when it al comes to my face what then :( i 'm also more selfaware about it because i am talking someone online and we did not meet up yet... And i am scared for what he is going to think about me etc :( but i i tellhim before he will find pictures and that wil defintely scare him off ... Hate summertime when \ncannot be covered of. I consider myself lucky because i have it very mild, but I do not go out much either (due to other issues).  I maybe had 1 person saying something nasty in all my life. Most people do not seem to care nor notice, but I am still very self-aware.  I am not very sociable, so not much to do in the area of relationships. But you should consider telling him. btw, NL/FR? My uncle has NF with lots of neurofibromas on his face and all over his body and he is married to a beautiful lady. From the flemish part :) . Yeah maybe he is ok .... I just deal with it. I have had a number of surgeries, so I have a few scars that are very noticeable. I have always had a lazy right eye, so I guess I have always been used to people staring at me. There is not a whole lot I can do about it. My only other option is to hide out in doors at home and never go anywhere and that would not be any fun. I have NF1 with lots of neurofibromas all around, including my face and neck.  I have good friends and community to go out with and have had a happy life. but as a female, I never wear a V neck shirt because of where the tumors are and seldom tank tops. Short sleeves is fine for me. It is been rough at times, but mostly ok. I focus on doing what makes me happy and forget the negative people. I am so sorry you are going through a stressful time with it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSimilar boat for me: got it from Dad, mine is mild to moderate (thank God). 36, got my first surgery to remove a few last year. Summer can be worse, the self-consciousness, the way the light catches them and new ones...I am in a great relationship though, and I kind of...I do not care what other people think. It is not like I go out shirtless constantly anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTry to stay positive and focus on what makes life great for you. Gaming, reading, solo hikes...whatever it takes to bring yourself outa that darkness. Thank you all for your answers and advice... Feels good to know i am not alone. And also good to know that there are people that can love me in a romantic way. Probably need to love myself a little bit more to,to allow and see it... I am happy that most of you just handle it in a normal way. \n\nI have it from my mother and Although i am not saying it is her fault i have it and i do not blame her...i always feel that it stands out relationship in the way... I love her ,but when seeing her it is always confrontating in one way... And remember me that i have it... But she is also confident with it,i guess.. or it seems like it.\n\nI never talk about it with her ... She wears short sleeves, dresses like it is all normal and she has nothing lol. Wish could be like her. Do you guys have a good relationship with the parent you get it from?\n\nSorry for all the questions,but i feel like after 34 years i need finally to talk about it :( I see so many confident people in this Facebook group I am just wowed by them. I was so self conscious my whole life because of my huge birth marks \ud83d\ude2d I say dress how you feel comfortable even in the heat. I am sure you are beautiful \u2764\ufe0f Thx kittysprinkles... Indeed everybody seems so confident! I hope i will be like that one day and just think like Well if you do not like me look at the other side but it is so hard! You feel now better with your birth marks? It comes and goes depends on the day I guess. Today I was feeling pretty down about it. I see more lumps appearing.", "NF1? I was born with a lot of birthmarks. It bugged me a lot when I was little because I would get bullied because of it. I have large and small birthmarks all over my body. I never got it checked when I was little and now that I live on my own, I decided to look up what these birthmarks were. Which brings me here, Neurofibromatosis.\n\nMost of my birthmarks are on my upper body, I have a lot of larger ones on my lower back, one one on my neck, and one on my knee. I also have a lot of little birthmarks on my armpits. I have always had bad vision and my back has always been crooked. (One side of my shoulder blade sticks out more than the other.)\n\nI would love to go see a specialist but before I do I want to make sure that I am not over reacting. Are these common symptoms for NF1? Is this something I should go see a specialist for? Which type of doctor would you go see?\n\nThank you all! The birthmarks/Cafe au lait spots with freckles near armpit it is really hard to say if its nf related. scoliosis is common with nf. I would definitely bring it up with your doctor. The thing is your gp probably will have no idea. So you could ask to get tested? I dont think your out of line for wanting to get checked, it is just a process. My spots are all over. Legs, arms, back, stomach etc. Do you have any other common indicators? Birthmarks alone dont necessary mean you have nf. Differnt medical issues can also present them. I do think it is great your taking control of your health this way! Thank you! I have always had back issues but I am not sure if it is scoliosis. I have been told to get it checked when I randomly took a yoga class because my yoga instructor thought I did, but I never got to it. Other wise, I am not very familiar with the symptoms but I have also heard that people with NF tend to be short. I am 4\u201911.\n\nDo you know of any other indicators that I should look out for?\n\nThank you! I appreciate your input! No worries, it is pretty overwhelming trying to look it all up. The pictures alone are scary. Is your back painful? Its wonderful if not!\n\nSo there are differnt types of nf. My one specialist said it is hard sometimes getting put into one category. I have basically all the following symptoms.\n\nSo the ones we talked about the birthmarks, then freckling in armpits or groin area.\n\ntumors\ntiny bumps on the iris\nthe lumps/bumps ontop of or under the skin\nBone deformities\nTumor on optic nerve\nLearning disabilities\nHead size larger than average\nShort Stature (I am 4'10) \n\nSymptoms for NF2\nGradual hearing loss\nRinging in the ears\nPoor balance\nHead aches\nNumbness and weakness in arms or legs\nFacial drop\nVision problems\n\nSymptoms for Schwannomatosis\nChronic pain anywhere in the body\nNumbness or weakness in various parts of body\nLoss of Muscle\n\nI had genetic testing done that confirmed I had nf. However that was years after a dr. Told my parents I had it. So the birthmarks could be a good start. It is also not the 90s so it is becoming easier to get help with nf related things. Hmm my back hurts often but not always. I felt that my symptoms line up with NF1. I do not know if anyone in my family has it. I am glad to know that i am not going crazy and over reacting! All I see are childhood related things so I was not sure where to start! hahah \n\nThank you \ud83d\ude0a Birth marks are hard to say, as many other things can also cause birthmarks. Do you have any of the other symptoms of Neurofibromatosis, I believe you need to have at least six of them? I was diagnosed when I 15, by a neurologist. My pediatrician always believed I had it who had been seeing me since I had been little, but when I was referred to someone at University of Michigan when I was nine, but they were not able to say whether I had it or did not. Thank you! I know, birthmarks are hard to say. They are all flat but yes i have WAAAAAAAY more than 6. I do not know if this is what it is referring to when they say bumps under the skin but i have indents on some parts of my body where if you run your finger over that part of feels like there is a hole under the skin. (Not sure if these are the symptoms). \n\nThank you again! :) I may have missed types in my previous message. For Neurofibromatosis you will need two of more of these symptoms \n\nSix or more caf\u00e9 au lait macules greater than 5mm in diameter in prepubertal individuals and greater than 15mm in postpubertal individuals.\n\nTwo or more neurofibromas of any type or one plexiform neurofibroma.\n\nFreckling in the axillary or inguinal region.\n\nOptic pathway glioma.\n\nTwo or more Lisch nodules (iris hamartomas).\n\nDistinctive osseous lesion such as sphenoid dysplasia or thinning of long bone cortex with or without pseudarthrosis.\n\nA first-degree relative (i.e., parent, sibling, offspring) with NF1 by the above criteria. This is exactly how I ended up here. I found out about this condition the same way. I set up an appointment with my doctor for next month because I noticed I am getting new cafe au lait spots on my thigh. I have them all along my right calf all the way up my thigh and end on my butt. I have some on my back and a tiny one on my wrist. I have the spine curvature you mentioned and one of my ribs sticks out more than the other. I noticed my bones are curved outward on my legs as well. I am a little worried because I have some spots on my retina and around my eye that were diagnosed as scars by an ophthalmologist, but the retina specialist said they could also be cysts. I hate the uncertainty. I hope my GP can give me some answers Wow, it is awesome to know that there is a great support system here. I actually found out today that I have severe scoliosis. I was too shy to ask about my cafe au lait spots. haha A part of me tells me that I am just over reacting. \n\nInteresting that you noticed you have new cafe au lait spots. I have too many, I cannot even keep track. Hope everything goes well with your appointment next month! :) The freckles in my pits tipped my dermatologist off when I was 11. Just be prepared they are going to ask you if they are in your groin lol at age 11 I was Horrified! Nothing to be embarrassed about though. With NF you get very! comfortable saying pretty much anything in a drs office.... These guys are here to help if anything they think NF is super interesting. My eye drs always grab their colleagues to come look at the specks (lisch nodules) in my eyes.  My GP read up about when I mentioned it as his new patient last year which I appreciated. And typically a neurologist referred by you GP. Sometimes you get lucky and get a neurologist that actually specializes in NF. Sounds really similar to when I found out about mine. Did your dermatologist know what NF was? I actually just had a physical for the first time (yay adulting!) and my doctor wanted to check my spine because he suspected I had scoliosis and turns out I do. I should have asked him about NF but I was to embarrassed :( I did not know who to go to about it :( Yes the dermatologist did. Honestly a lot of doctors do not. I had one tell me out of all his medical training (which is like 10 years I think) he only read one small paragraph about it. Nothing to be embarrassed about. You could even say something like \u201cI know this sounds silly but...\u201d if you are concerned about how it sounds. I pull that sometimes. Just say you have concerns about it and are wondering if he has any recommendations. Pretty much guarantee he will just refer you to the doctor in the right direction.", "New to the sub! Hi, I am new to the sub. I cannot believe it took me this long to find it. I am seventeen and was diagnosed with NF1 when I was three. \n\nI have a (malignant) right optic glioma and have way too many CALs. Thankfully, I only have a couple neurofibromas, and they are easily hid.\n\nAlthough my NF1 is quite mild, I have been effected psychologically more than physically, so I am really stoked I have found this sub.", "I just found out i was diagnosed i was looking at my medical history for school and i saw that my history included neurofibromatosis type 1. Looking into it i was diagnosed in April 2019(i am 13 btw) and my parents knew but did not tell me?! idk why though. So i brought it up to my dad and asked why and he said he does not think i have it despite the diagnosis from my doctor and that is why he did not want me to get genetically tested. How do i bring it up to him that i want to get genetically tested(per the doctor\u2019s recommendation)? You could get genetically tested in with your parents to see if one of them has it and gave it to you or just a gene mutation. Like myself I am the only one in my family who has NF. Sometimes it is hard to find out if you have it but you could live a completely healthy life without having any symptoms I would just talk with your parents. Tell them that you would feel safer knowing. That getting tested now would make you more proactive about you health. If you dont have it then amazing! If however you do then you can know what to look out for and be prepared. That way if you do get some symptoms you will know what steps to take. \n\nI am my own mutation, no one else in my family has it. If you got tested it would let your parents know if they needed to or not. First of all I am so sorry. This has to be rough. My mom was very open. A bit too open really. \n\nCan you think of what happened around that time that would cause you to get diagnosed I think that we had just gotten a new pediatrician the year prior and she said that i should probably check out my cafe au lait spots since i had a lot of them and that is all i rlly remember Thanks a lot for the advice:) Do you have any learning difficulties?  Any trouble making friends? Any bumps? i have a bump on my forehead by my temple and i do have trouble staying attention and zone out a lot in class and kind of do have difficulty making friends That probably is why . For me I have bumps and a ton of trouble making friends . I would recommend asking to get tested for peace of mind. Diagnosis wrong dad right: great. But chances are he denies it because he is afraid. Having NF can be scary Ok, thanks a lot for your help! I was not diagnosed until I was 15, though doctors had suspected I may have it when I was born, but test results back then were inconclusive, I was tested again when I was nine but results were also inconclusive. It was until after I had hit puberty and was 15 that the on switch was turned on. My pediatrician referred me to see a specialist in Chicago and I have been seeing him for the past 20 plus years. \n\nTell him that you have been reading up on Neurofibromatosis and would like to know,  because for some people it can be very serious. Unfortunately my case is one of the more serious ones and neither of my parents have it, grandparents, or any of my three younger siblings. As far as we know I am the only one in the family that was diagnosed with it, including aunt, uncles and cousins. I agree with the good advice you are receiving here.  Your dad might not understand that there can be serious issues with NF that are not visible.  If all your dad did was a little bit of a google search then he probably 1) got the bejeezus scared out of him, and 2) figured you must not have it since you do not look like any of the pictures he saw. \nThis is a very complex and tricky disorder and it is definitely not only about what is visible.  \nI hope that when your dad sees your commitment to understanding more about the diagnosis, and learns more himself, he will understand how important it is for you.  \nIt might not be a big deal in your life at all.  Many people are pretty symptom-free.  But it can be sneaky so the most important thing is to be followed by an NF specialist.  NF network .org has lists of these.  More than likely they will just set you up for a few appointments each year.  No big deal, but it is important that a specialist is keeping a regular eye on you so that if something does arise you can tackle it early.  \nGood luck! I am going to go against the current here and tell you why I have not tested my children based on the advice e of my geneticist. \n\nI was diagnosed in my 40s, a year after we moved to Australia. During one of the consultation at the nf1 clinic, I had a very long appointment which was mainly a legal chat, very unpleasant. I am in Australia, so what I am writing might not apply to the USA or other countries. \n\nThe appointment was all about the obligations of disclosure of any confirmed genetic disorder at certain specific and important steps in life and why it would be in my children'  interest to not have a confirmed diagnosis, given that it would impact their ability to stipulate life insurance, do certain jobs (pilot, certain forces, ... ), immigrate to many countries who have medical criteria, and even apply for some mortgages. \n\nI have decided, based on that appointment, that for now, I will not have them tested. I have talked to my children about it and explained why. They have been informed all along and I told them that at any time, if it was their wish, we could book a test. \n\nHad I been diagnosed with Nf1 prior to our move to Australia, I would have failed the medical screening and been denied the visa to move here. Not based on my physical health at that time but on the probability that I would get sick at some point in the future and be a cost to the country. \n\nSeveral conditions come with cafe au lait spots, there is even one called Nf1-like syndrome because it looks like nf1 but it totally benign, it is called Legius syndrome. \n\nWhat I would say to your parents, is that at 13, you want to be involved in your health. That you understand that there might be reasons why they have gone against testing, but that you would like to know which they are. Maybe they could book you for a chat with a genetic counsellor, both my children had this conversation. \n\nIt is a matter of balancing harm and benefit. What benefit would you get from the testing, what harm could you get from testing. Maybe your father wants to wait some years until genetic testing can be done anonymously. \n\nMy children did not have any bumps and lumps, so their CALs (not many) could just be skin pigmentation. IF they were ever to develop skin tumours, I would not hesitate to confirm the diagnosis because Nf1 has indeed several health related conditions for which we need to be vigilant and have regular check up. \n\nBottom line, it is a complicated dilemma to test or not. It must have been very scary for you to found those papers. I am very sorry", "My girlfriend has NF type 1 and has a couple of these spots on her body. She is a bit concerned about them, they are like indents in the skin as opposed to Cafe au lait spots. Has anyone seen these before? ", "is it bad to do contact sports/martial arts? I was told that people with nf should not participate in martial arts like judo/ jiu jitsu, due to sensitive bones?\n\ndo all people with nf have more sensitive bones than average or is it only a minority?", "Every time I feel like I am getting ahead in life, NF always finds a way to sneak up and trip me. I have been working at my dream job\u2014or so I think it is my dream job-- for several months now. In almost every aspect, it aligns with my values and what I always imagined myself doing post-college. It is prestigious, challenging, and I have health insurance for the first time in my life. \n\nBut\u2026 \n\nmy NF1 has been getting in the way of things. I am in excruciating pain daily, and I find myself struggling to keep up. I am finding it more and more difficult to be present, to get things done, to feel like what I am doing is still worthwhile. Getting out of bed is so exhausting that most mornings I worry about being able to safely drive my commute. I have to fight the urge to call in sick.\n\nNo matter how much I exercise, eat right, meditate, sleep, or ask for accommodations in the workplace, I feel like things keep piling on. The pain is still there; nagging me, taunting me, and interrupting basic tasks.  It is there when I am trying to enjoy a night out with my partner, it is there even after I have soaked in a hot bath and laid down for bed. It is just always there, and I cannot seem to work through it. I have tried talking to others about it, but no matter how I word or phrase things, it is invisible to them. My words are lost in translation. I feel like a burden. \n\nI only recently got into healthcare as an adult and I am working on addressing all the things that my parents neglected. I have had MRI\u2019s of my back and my hand\u2014per my medical summary, I have \u2018innumerable skin lesions\u2019 in my back, one larger plexiform neurofibroma, and dural ecstasia of my sacrum. The enlarged tumor in my palm is inoperable\u2014removing it would render my hand neurologically useless because of how it wraps around my nerves. The plexiform neurofibroma in my back would require a large incision, possible skin grafts, and weeks of recovery. \n\nI did not even know that I had been living with tumors in my back until a few weeks ago. The pain had always been this ambiguous thing that followed me around. I attributed it to scoliosis, doctors would say I lacked iron. My mother told me recently that she did not want me to get too involved in treatment for my NF as a child because we could not afford it, and she did not want me to seek pity or use my condition as a crutch throughout life. I cannot help but resent her for that. I guess it is her way of trying to save face for the neglect. I have been noticing more and more caf\u00e9 au lait spots in the mirror lately- more fibromas showing up on my neck, my arms. I blink and there is always more appearing.\n\nI am on the fence about going through with the surgery on my back\u2014on one hand, it could potentially ease up some of the pain I am in. On the other hand, it could potentially *not* ease the pain and I would have to live with the scarring, the weeks of recovery, the opiates that make me purge and burn my chest. Even though I have been living independent of my parents for years, I still hear my mom tell me we cannot afford it.\n\nI have a job interview lined up in a few weeks. I talked with my partner about it, who said I should at least entertain the idea. It is only part time, no benefits. Six-hour variable shifts, doing what I do now but in a different setting. I would make less. It is closer to home. I do not know if my new set of bosses will be keen to accommodate me. It would probably give me the time and space to go back to school and work on my Master\u2019s like I have always wanted. Things seemed to fall in place when I was in school-- I was more diligent, organized. I did not have writer\u2019s block like I do now. I do not really know where I would begin to pick up the pieces if I left my current job. I am tired of organizing every waking moment around NF, consciously and unconsciously. Every time I try to get ahead, NF is always there to trip me. I am sorry about your pain. Have you spoken with your doctors about possible pain medication? I have two pain medications that I take, I also back in June was put on Koselugo, which is a drug that was approved last year to help shrink tumors. It is the first actual medication to treat Neurofibromatosis, but it was only fda approved for children. My doctor had to get special permission for me from the fda to take it. It might be something to look into after being on it for four months, I am noticing a decease in pain.\n\nKeep you chin up and take things one day at a time. I wish you the best. I have had to get a tumor removed from my small intestine.  They failed the first surgery and took 3 inches of my intestine the 2nd time around.\n\nI am about 99% percent sure I will have to remove the 2 that are touching my spine. 1. I do not really feel much, but there is 1 that I definitely feel. It makes it hard to work... a few of my other ones do as well. It is causing pain and I do not want to have surgery when I am 50+ years old. Its better to do it now so I can recover easier and quicker. \n\nThere is a story I have about the one that was in my intestine It was scary. But that cost me a job... so I know how it feels to lose a job due to it I am sorry to hear about your pain. I feel like I am in the same boat. Whenever things start to look better my NF ruins it all. I have had so many surgeries and had to basically cancel my life because of it. I have done everything I could, ate healthy and exercised but still these nasty tumors grow and come in the worst places. Thank you for your kind words, can you tell me more about your experiences with Koselugo? Have you noticed any side effects? I have only recently heard about it. I still cannot seem to find a provider that knows about NF1 or how to treat it, perhaps this is something I can look into. I have had some of the side effects, some nausea and diarrhea not much though, I have had more so with the acme and some redness on my face, some itchiness on my back and then some swelling on my feet and ankles  especially when it is really hot out. Other then those I have not had any of the other possible side effects.\n\nIf your in the United States this can help finding a doctor that treats Neurofibromatosis \n I am sorry about your pain. It is hard being a young adult (post-college) living with Neurofibromatosis, while many of your peers seem to be moving on with their lives. I, too, have NF1 and I feel like NF1 is holding me back from my so-called career/educatonal ambitions. \n\nI just started a MEK clinical trial for my inoperable plexiform tumor in my airway. (Just found out I had tumors on my spine, too\\~ causing ambiguous symptoms). Dealing with a lot of pain as well, so I can sympathize:\u2019)\n\nDo not give up. Slow and steady. You\u2018ll get your masters degree. Hoping you will have understanding bosses.", "Mortality Risk? Just to preface I am a chronic worrier lol. Anyways my girlfriend has NF1, and I am constantly worried about her. I do not know a ton about NF, but what is the overall cancer risk/ mortality risk? Will she live a full life? the cancer risk is a little higher than average if I recall but most people with nf1 live normal lives Finnish study says that the risk of getting cancer whit nf1 in lifetime is 60%\nAlso we die more likely to all cancers. \nEspecially to MPNST which is the most common cancer with nf1 Still most people whit nf1 will live full lifes. \nIf she do not go to regular check ups you should try to go whit her to get check ups if she then would go to them. That would help to catch anything that would indicate cancers or other problems early on. Sorry my english :X Like many (or few perhaps), I like data and not comforting slogans.  I once found a study about 12 years ago (no link) mentioning NF1 patients average lifespan is cut short about 20 years.  Yet, I have met NF1 patients over 70 years of age.  Any doctors I bring this up with deny any data exists on this subject. Most people can live a full life with Neurofibromatosis. It does effect everyone differently. I myself have had tumors turn cancerous in both 2014 and 2018, I had surgery to remove the cancerous tumors and was good within a few weeks. If you have other questions let me know. You are right. Since the Finnish study from 2016, our cancer risk has been corrected on many fronts. We have - as you rightly said - a 59.6 % lifetime risk of cancer, getting cancer at a younger age and not a great prognosis. \n\nData exists. Many countries have included the new figures in their NF1 guidelines such as the French ones  here \n\n( \n\nThe data is also included in the new NF1 book which all of you can find on ( (use a VPN) . \n\nIt is important to understand what NF1 is and once and for all go beyond the skin tumours. Nf1 is a way more complicated multi-organ disease. We must know how the NF1 gene is crucial for so many cellular processes including but not limited to abnormal cell proliferation and take action. \n\nA preventative approach is recommended even if the health recommendations still follow the \"wait for symptoms and we will deal with those\"  . \n\nI was shocked by the imbalance between research and medical care, the ignorance and passivity of the so called \"nf1-clinic\" in Australia.  There are resources out there we can use to educate ourselves. Like this 2013 great video (  10 Things Everyone Should Know About Their NF1 made by the NF Network. \n\nSome NF1 doctors are great, amazing. Others have no clue, and are quick to dismiss with a \"it is genetic, nothing can be done\" , when it is not true. So we have a high risk of cancer with shitty prognosis, ok, let us adopt an anti-cancer way of life and regular screenings;  we have done density issues, let us just check were we are with a DEXA scan and then supplement with calcium+K2+Vit D and do some weight bearing exercise, and so on....\n\nWe do not have to be passive just because our doctor is. I have NF1- and I get that you are worried and by all means you are allowed to feel worried! But I can let you know and reassure you there is nothing major to worry about in those aspects. NF1 does increase the chances of particular things EG- blood pressure and few other things\n\nMe- I have had some bone defects, and I get muscle and bone pains from it. Everyone has it differently and on differently levels \nOver all, nothing to worry about there buddy \nBest thing to do is sit down with your partner let her know how you feel, and in some extra time jump on google and do some reading about it all :) \n\nBest of luck, any questions feel free to ask me If she sees a doctor on a regular basis she will have a long life (lord willing) so try not to worry so much. When I was a child, the doctors told my parents I would not live to see 16 and now I am 46 so they no nothing. I am glad she has you since it can be rough for us who have it. Thanks for all the responses guys :) it sucks that the statistics for NF1 are all over the place, some say normal cancer risk and there was one mentioned by people abovethat said 60% get cancer. I plan on marrying her and the thought of her dying in like our 50's makes me sick :/ someone sent me some stats from St. Judes hospital and showing that they are not too much more than a normal person's, im going to go with those just for the sake of my anxiety if anything. Luckily she gets regular checkups and lives a relatively healthy lifestyle Thank you for your response. She goes to yearly checkups with a specialist, do they screen for common cancers at those? With all my years and check ups I never had a cancer screening, and my daughter ( 7years old) has NF1 aswell and she has not had a cancer screening \nIt is good to have these check ups, but it is nothing really to be worried about :) \n\nJust have a chat to her, let her know your concerns and just jump online and read things Aboht it all.. \nyou will learn a lot about it", "Happy Cakeday, r/neurofibromatosis!

Insignificant to most but pretty special to me.  I am 20 years old (F) and I have NF type 2. I have a brain tumor, a spinal tumor, occasional seizures problems with my leg and a few other learning/mental issues doctors believe are related to my NF. And plenty of cafe au lait birthmarks. \n\nI have always felt pretty fortunate that my problems were mostly internal, and I have not been affected my skin tumors. However, growing up I was teased a lot for my learning disability. One day when I was 10 I wore a two piece bathing suit and was teased mercilessly for my cafe au lait spots which are most abundant on my back and stomach. \n\nEver since I have covered up with tankinis and one piece bathing suits. Only my boyfriend had seen my stomach. Well, today I went to the beach with my friends and I wore a bikini. I decided to stop caring about what kids said when I was 10. They are just bithmarks, and they do not make me a monster. Most girls are terrified to be in a bikini because of weight but for me it was my skin. It was something that bothered me and put me in tears as a kid. I finally got over that and I am so proud.  ", "Pooing blood Anyone have blood in their poo? I would suggest you speak with your doctor or find an urgent care. It may not be anything related to NF. There can be several reasons to have blood in the stool, ranging from hemorrhoids to something more serious. Pay attention to how much, frequency, and what type of stool you have. Your doctor will be able to help diagnose. Yeah , you definitely need to go to the doc. This can be symptomatic of a lot of different GI issues. Please seek medical attention. You should contact your doctor about this. Your doc will likely ask about what kind of blood (bright and flowy or dark and clotted), how much, how mixed it is with the stool, consistency of stool, how long this had been going on, etc. I would also recommend you make a log (dates and times) with the foods you eat and bowel movements you have. Will help with diagnosis tremendously. Thanks buddy Digested blood or blood from internal bleeding looks like coffee grounds. If the blood is red its coming from elsewhere, like a torn sphincter. Blood in stool is a \u201cget an appt today, or go to the ER\u201d type of thing.", "What is the point Not really NF related but I am sure you will understand more than others.\n\nSo I have NF and kyphoscoliosis,\n\nAt the moment I am having breathing problems, mobility issues, pain all the time, now I need two teeth removed one of which has fell apart and cannot get an appointment for a week, root canal, mental health (depression has hit me) I also have a infected in grown toenail. And today I receive a letter about an operation I know nothing about.\n\nDoes anyone else with lots of medical issues ever just want to give me. I just cannot anymore.\n\nThen there are others who go through live with no problems it is just not fair.  NF affects everyone differently. Unfortunately, some people have it worse than others. You just need to try your best to be positive. I know it can be difficult when you are experiencing several different issues. NF can be frustrating to deal with sometimes. Many of us in this sub have had lots of medical issues. Some things can be managed and can improve with medical care. Life in general can be unfair, whether our not someone has NF. Some of what your experiencing will get better in time. Hey, have you had any sort of surgery or treatment for your scoliosis? Yes full fusion years ago. Still waiting to see where the pain is from but no one knows Unfortunately life is not always fair, all you can do it the best you can. I too have Neurofibromatosis, I have had cancerous tumors removed twice, along with other surgeries to remove problematic tumors. I have a lazy right eye which I too was born with, I have high blood pressure and I live with daily pain. \n\nI do not have many friends. I have a my parents, siblings and other family members which is great and my dog, but I do get lonely and board and wish I had people to hang with who liked watching movie, playing videos games and card games. I spend most of my weekends at home. I have not really been out of the state of Michigan other than to go to doctors appointments in Chicago, which all I do is go to my appointment and go home.\n\nYou have to look a the good things you have, even if they seem small. That is what I do. I could have it a whole lot worse, I could have no family, be on my own and living on the streets. Just hang in there. Who is your main contact for NF1? A neurologist?  Have you spoken with them about MEK inhibitors? I feel this on a never deep level. I recently got a lot of cativies filled and i have been doing it for my entire life. I know the pain of this I am with you on the teeth thing. I barely have any back teeth left and what is left is in pieces. I have brushed my teeth daily since childhood and yet they rot. I would have went to a dentist but did not have insurance and still do not. I am kind of just dealing with it as it goes but they hurt and are super embarrassing. \nI am over 10k in medical debt and my tumors are getting worse. They are visible and there is no way of hiding somethings \u2018wrong\u2019 with me. I do not know what the future holds but I am not optimistic about it to say the least.\nIt sucks and I definitely feel like giving up most of the time. Sometimes that gets very hard to overcome. \n\nWhat helped me is looking at it this way.\nPicture your 8 year old self but as a separate  individual. Would you tell that kid to just give up because it does not matter? That they should end it all because their future is meaningless? Most likely not. You would probably tell them to keep going and try to live life the best they can. Why would you tell yourself any different? \n\nIt is immensely hard at times, so much so you can feel like the entire world is collapsing on top of you but you are not holding it alone. There are so many people going through similar things and we are here for you! This world is filled with hardships and even having someone to talk to can help lift that weight a little bit.

I have seizures which may or may not be related to NF. I recently started taking a calcium supplement at the direction of my PCP,  This combination ended up effecting the absorption of lamotrigine. Which lead to my first seizure in 13 years. Had 3 more over the past few days until levels got back on track. \n\nJust a word of caution, be careful with adding any additional supplements or medicine if you take other drugs. Especially if you take any meds for seizures.  I am usually very careful but did not think a supplement would have an effect. My Gabapentin said to not take within 2 hours of calcium. I am not taking for seizures so less of a concern for me all the same try not to", "Yearly Checkup I am bored and wide awake my pain killers not working so have bad chronic pain.\n\nIt is my yearly checkup in a few weeks and I am sat making a long list of questions and new problems I have had since last year.

Honestly it was not that bad, but I played it up so hard. \"Ohhhh my tumors\" and bullshit along that line. Basically I was playing the \"sick card\" to gain the sympathy of the authority figures. He was suspended, and I was happy. \n\nHave you ever done something like that.  I used to use it on really cold days during gym class to stay in the warm. \"OH I am in so much pain today\". I had a permanent sick note on my file about it. Nope, that would be wrong.  No mine dident truly start to appear until my early  20s glad I never had them in school was bullied enough as I was back then.

They are growing rapidly, and more are growing, but I only have a few dozen. \n\nTwo on my chest and one on my forehead, each somewhere between the size of a peppercorn and pea, have become, over the past year, actually painful. I have had ones that were irritating, annoying, itchy, but never actually like, painful enough to make your day worse. \n\nSo this is new for me. I see a dermatologist next month. First appointment so hopefully they can razor them off. I have actually had the ones on my chest removed before...\n\nBut the question is: is it normal for them to actually feel worse as you get older?

One person mentioned it could be NF1. I was never diagnosed so I am not sure if it is a NF. I am seeing a doc next week. \nJust wanted to ask if this sounds like it. The bump is very small in size, a bit hard to pin point from afar but it is noticeable - about 1cm in size. It is also quite soft and moveable. I do not have the light brown spots that everyone mentioned with NF1, no other bumps, or any other health complications. \n\nMy questions:\n1. Are people usually diagnosed as children?\n2. If I had this would it manifest more obviously?\n3. What should I look out for? Most likely you would have had more spots earlier in life.  However, I have them on my nipple also and mine are a lot larger.  As a female, I will let you know I was fully able to breastfeed my child.  Try not to worry until you talk to the doctor.  I would also get into a dermatologist office to check for other tumors. Not to be insensitive... but looking at your profile, you have been posting a lot about finding things all over your body. You have gone to the Melanoma subreddit and asked if something is melanoma, Lichen Sclerosus subreddit to ask if something is Lichen Sclerosus, Interstitial Cystitis subredit, Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, subreddit and now here. Why is everything you find possibly something? If you dont have any other symptoms it cannot be NF. Looks like they deleted their account. Good job calling them out.

It is weird. I understand.  I feel slightly better now. I also have them on my face.

Hi all,\n\nI have only been in this community for two days thus far, but I have had such a positive experience thus far. You are all very kind and knowledgeable people, and the camaraderie is great. :) So, onto my question/new obsessive thought that will rob me of sleep for the next month and a half...\n\nI realize that people with a diagnosis of NF1 have a higher risk for developing cancer at some point in their lives. However, does this risk scale with the severity of their symptoms? For example, if someone were to just look at me fully clothed, they could never tell that I do indeed have NF1. I mostly have CAL spots and tiny fibromas on my trunk. I was only very recently diagnosed, and NF1 has never really affected my quality of life. I would say, therefore, that I have a very mild case. Does this mean anything for my overall cancer risk? I am a bona fide hypochondriac and have OCD and anxiety, so since I discovered this potentiality, I have taken it and run with it, and now I have made myself a worried mess, lol. I know worrying will not do anything, but still... \n\nTL;DR: Does the risk for cancer with NF1 scale with the severity of one's NF1? It is hard to say, as everyone with Neurofibromatosis is effected differently. I have had cancerous tumors twice, in 2014 in my upper right leg and in 2018 in my upper right arm. The one in my leg was a higher grade cancerous tumor than the one in my arm. Both surgeries were a success and the extreme pain I had from them went away after those tumors were removed. I still have the every day pain I have grown used to, but the pain medications I take hell with that.\n\nWhile it would be difficult to say who has a higher chance at developing cancer depending on the level of Neurofibromatosis they have. There are ways to take note that something is going on and you should inform your doctor/specialist to any changes.\n\nIn 2014, I knew something was wrong because I was having intense pain in my leg. It hurt to drive and I never drove that much to begin with. I was not able to enjoy going out to eat with my parents and siblings, because I was in so much pain and was not able to get any relief. I would also sometime get stick right after eating, it could be a bowl of cereal, a sandwich, just about any thing. I would feel this pressure build up in my stomach and have to throw up. And the weird thing was right after that I would feel fine and be able to eat like nothing had happened. After the cancerous tumor was removed from my leg both problems went away.\n\nIn 2018, I was having similar pain issues, only this time it was more of a burning pain in my arm that would wake me up in the middle of the night. The burning pain would last anywhere from 15-30 minutes. After the tumor was removed just like with my leg that pain went away.\n\nIf you have any questions, let me know. Well not really but also yes? Someone smarter correct me if I type something wrong. Sorry about my English beforehand :DI\n\nIf you have plexiform tumor or internal atypical tumor you have higher risk of cancer and usually these types of tumors may be painful so you have it more severe but you can have subcuntanous tumors in your spinal cord or somewhere else that can be painful too but those tumors do not turn cancer and do not make the risk higher BUT you would have it more \"severe\"\n\nThere are also microdeletion of nf1 which  makes cancer risk higher and symptoms usually more severe. If you are a women you have higher cancer risk.\n\nOver all we have 60% risk getting cancer. Some of us have lower risk than that some of us higher. Its better to slowly try to tell yourself that yes you have higher risk and accept that fact.\n\nYou can still life full live. You can still live old and most likely you will live long.  Or not but that does not really matter. What matters is this moment. Do what you love. LIVE. Do not let cancer scare you just live your live! You can die today!! Or tomorrow or when you are 100 years old.. you do not now. Remeber you cannot lose \"future\" future has not happened. So make this moment enjoyable. I have been scared too when I read about our risk but I am slowly accepting it.Even if you get cancer that does not mean you will die. No no no. Not long ago many of us died to things that today can be treated. My son is currently having chemo for rhabdomyosarcoma (paratesticular) and we had the tumour genetically tested, it came back with an NF1 mutation however he has no observable signs of nf1. We have been referred to a genetic specialist to test his blood. He is 2 years old so maybe his symptoms will show as he ages?", "question about lack of sleep I have NF1 and lately I have been having issues sleeping. I will be exhausted but by the time my child falls asleep, I cannot lay down and sleep. It is very bothersome. It is almost 2am and here I am up awake as an owl while my child went to bed almost 5 hours ago. could this mean there is something going on with my brain? like a tumor? I am really concerned now. my doctor did ask if I had issues sleeping, but at the time, I thought it was the excitement and joy of Christmas for my child. However, I am beginning to think that is not the case. I took melatonin almost 2 hours ago and here I am.. awake.\n\nI should add that I have never had an issue sleeping before. Your body may be developing PN in a new area. My adult daughter has aggressive NF1 and her neurologist has her taking warm epsom salts soaks and tylenol PM to help her to rest. (She also takes prescribed cannabis tablets for pain) I am sorry but what is a PN? I have a mild case and never had any issues really. plexiform neurofibroma Take a moment. Be kind to yourself and your body. Times are stressful with the pandemic, holidays are busy and hard alone...this year even weirder, and being a parent takes a lot out of you. I would say it sounds like exhaustion. But mention it to your doctor of course. Remember to make time for yourself. Could it be a brain tumor? Having lived with NF all my life, and actually having had a brain tumor and had an operation for it, personally I think it is unlikely that is why you cannot sleep. But I am not a doctor. You should follow up with your general practice doctor to see if it is something else or if you need to see your geneticist. I have always had issues falling asleep, so I take Melatonin and that helps a lot thanks. I was told I do have one of those but I do not see any currently. how long does it take to show up? I sent a message so I will see what she says. I doubts she will send me for a MRI since I have been asking for the last x amount of years. That depends of the place in think. I had one on my leg but i can not remember how long it took. I had a brown/blue/ purpleish  pigmentspot on my leg. And a little enlargement that looked a little bit fatty. Sorry it is hard to explain.\n\nIf pain is getting worse or you feel like somthing is changing, you should let a doctor check it if that is possible. Brain tumors probably would not cause lack of sleep.  I recommend you ask your doctor about fatigue and see what they say.  In my case I had thyroid problems that had nothing to do with NF. no worries. I got mine when I was in grade school so I never really paid attention to how long it took to appear. I emailed my doctor and I am waiting on a response. I have this bump on my head but a few years ago the doctor said it was something related to NF but I forget what she said it was. something cutaneous or something like that. its popping out not in but I feel like it is getting bigger. not sure if that is concerning or not? How old is your child? If you gave birth recently, it can be something unrelated to NF, like all the hormonal changes that your body goes through or postpartum", "Life with NF As another Redditor had mentioned that she is unsure about the future of life with NF, I too have started to feel the same way. I do sometimes wonder what I will look like in the next 10 years. It is quite unfair that we were dealt with such uncertainty in regards to our futures. I have come to the conclusion if this disorder gets \"too real\" by the time I am 30, I will just cut my loses; call it a day and throw myself in front of a train. Recently I have felt that I do not have the mental strength do deal with this anymore. I have been \"handicapped\" socially in a big way due to this issue, and quite frankly I would do it now but I just do not have the balls.", "Does anyone else have sensitive skin?

Since january they popped up,... They are more under my skin, and in bad light you can see them very good... It is not that you really feel them but you feel that my skin is not smooth... Do you guys have An idea if they can be removed? The ones I have on my face sound similar, I have talked to dermatologists that say a CO2 laser would help. I did see an episode of Dr. Pimple Popper where she used a CO2 laser on a lady with NF, I do not remember what the results were... What has stopped me is the healing time, I do not think I would want to go out in public with a big scab on my face, and I worry that it could turn out worse. I had a different type of doctor tell me that the CO2 would not really work on mine as there is not enough difference in the pigment of my skin and the bumps for the laser to 'see'.\n\nThere was also a gal on the Doctors TV show that had a bunch removed, I think hers was more successful. Talk to a dermatologist. I have had a few substantial ones removed from my face, but each are a case by case basis. I have had several removed from my face, lips, and the inside of my mouth.  I am now covered with hundreds upon hundreds, mostly in my chest, torso, and back but also my neck and face. I have had around 20 removed, the majority of which were causing pain.  I have a surgery scheduled for January where I will be having about a dozen removed from my neck and chin.  I am seeing a dermatologist for those.\n\nThere are different kinds of fibromas, cutaneous, subcutaneous, and plexiform.  Some are easier than others to remove.  I would suggest seeing a dermatologist for superficial fibromas but a neurologist or neurosurgeon for the deeper ones, preferably someone with experience removing them. Keep in mind that instead of fibromas you might trade them in for visible scars. If they are under the skin, they have to be cut out. I live in the USA and no dermatologist will even see me when they hear I have NF.  I have two on my face I would like to have removed.  They CAN be removed (my father had several removed from his face, he even made it into a medical journal), but healthcare here is shoddy and nobody will see me because of the insurance I have. :( You can get them removed by a plastic surgeon. \n\nI had it done for free in the UK by one of the best surgeons available. \n\nThe first photo is what it looks like now and the second one is pre and post op done about 3 years ago. \n\n Have tried looking at this ( it has a network of Doctors who specialize it might be helpful in being able to find a dermatologist that in fact can see you. Hm is it always that when you remove one,it come back worse? I had some removed years ago at my arms, chest,belly,... Do not seem they are coming back,had new ones yes.... Pfff why OH why Sorry to hear health insurance is sobad in USA... Do not really know how about Belgium... But had some neurofibromas removed years ago and i could afford it, and stay a night in hospital... So guess or healt secure pay it half on half or something...  I am far from rich so willen ok here i guess Are you covered with 100 because you removed some? Or had you already had lot'sof them? Good luck in january I know... It is a diffucult to choose what is better... But i guess scars are less worse :( WoW looks lot better! I have just small soft lumbs ... Looks like pimples or something,... But in bad light or lot's of sun it is really really ugly .... My only wish is that does not grow and just stay line it is know.... Then yeah i Will or can live with it... Otherwise :( i do not want them in my face... First People see so ... My arms, chest etc i can cover... My face not... Or i need to change religion and become muslim and were a burqa I have some of them too but it seems like that you are a bit uncomfortable with how it looks.\n\nYou should just go out and enjoy life, and I am sure that your wonderful personality will shine! I already had hundreds when I had some removed. I try to get the painful or highly visible ones removed. Thanks turtleattacks, i know i need to enjoy life i go out... But it is since now half year very noticeble in my face (for me more maybe then for other i do not know).... And it is really hard for me...

Do not know if you man or woman lol Mine or not that painfull, sometimes  they toch,it is also when i eat something not that healthy...or when i 'm with a dog ... You would have to speak with your specialist and also have some MRIs done to see if they can be safely removed. I have I would say a marble to ping ball sized tumor on my forehead.

Thank you for sharing about your child. It is so positive! Best wishes. Can I ask you a question? Is the lazy eye somehow related? My daughter has CAL spots and the freckling but has not received a diagnosis yet. However, she has lazy eye and ptosis. I have always wondered if this could be another sign, but I have never found anything mentioning it. It is possible, but my mom was also born with a lazy eye, but when she was a baby she had surgery to have it corrected and it was for her. I also had surgery as a baby to fix my lazy eye, but they were not able to correct it. They do think that because of me having Neurofibromatosis that could have prevented it from being fixed.  I was diagnosed at 10 but my doctors knew since I was a baby I am sorry you guys are joining this club. Our official diagnosis was around 18 months. My son is 5 and has an optic nerve glioma and small fibromas on his trunk. CTF.org, children's tumor foundation is an amazing resource. There is a Facebook page called Nf moms rock!!!!  All parents are welcome. You can also find as local groups like we have a Los Angeles NF group. CTF does walks in every major city throughout the year to raise awareness, called shine a light walks. We are involved in the walks and it is a lovely way to meet other families. We fundraise to fund research to end nf too. Feel free to ask any questions I am always happy to chat. Best wishes. I have NF 1! I am happy to answer any questions you may have. If it is any reassurance, I am 25 now and am loving life! If you are seeing proptosis a speedy Neuro-Opthamologist appointment is VERY important.  Could be optic glioma, which is OK if caught and treated early, but potentially very problematic if not.  It does not matter whether or not you have a firm diagnosis.  Make the appointment immediately. Wow.  My sons timeline sounds identical to yours. Officially diagnosed around 18 months. He is 5 years old has optic nerve glioma and small fibromas on his trunk.  To the OP. I am so sorry for you. It is a hard diagnosis, but an amazing community. I as well as so many others are here to help you along. We all try to lift each other up. Thanks for the comment, so simple yet so reassuring. Thank you Thanks! Thanks for your response. I will definitely get her checked out. She is had a couple ophthalmologist appointments when she was a baby where they dilated her (she was born with the ptosis and lazy eye) and an optometrist appointment where she was also dilated. She also had CT scan three years ago as a precaution after a fall. Would a glioma have been caught by those assessments? You are welcome I was diagnosed very early on in my life and have been able to live a - more or less - \"normal\" life. I wish your child and your family the best of strength - You will make it through this.", "Post surgery bruising Hi, \n\nLast week I had five small tumors removed in an out-patient setting (plastic surgeon\u2019s office) and one of my five scars has bruising around it. Is this normal? I return next week to get my stitches removed. Has anyone else dealt with this? I had some  fibromas removed off my skin recently. The one I had stitching on bruised a bit as well. The surgeon told me that particular one needed a stitch because it was a bigger fibroma and deeper down to begin with so healing would take longer. That, combined with the stitch in general is likely responsible for the bruising. Even just having them cut out I am sure can cause bruising since the tumors were attached to the nerves. As long as the wounds themselves do not seem infected I am sure you are fine. Ok thank you! That makes sense You are welcome! Hope you heal fast. Thank you! Btw, did you use any particular scar cream once your wounds healed? I have been trying a couple different things. Still using since I only got them removed a couple months ago. My doctor recommended using something silicone based though. I have silicone patches, regular scar cream, and bio-oil. My scars are not too bad (but they are also usually covered by clothing). I am going to get a silicone based gel soon. So I would suggest something with silicone. ScarAway Silicone Gel is a popular one. Yes, it is normal to have some bruising. I have had four surgeries related to Neurofibromatosis and have had bruising after surgery. Thanks! Did you use a scar cream after your wounds healed? I think I might have in 2001, but it might have been some different type of cream,  because we found out I had a slight allergy to surgical tape. With my next three surgeries different tape needed to be used and I did not use any type of cream. I do have scars on my right arm, right leg and back of my neck, but it is like whatever, not a big deal. hey is it possible to show what your cutaneous fibromas look like ? i have NF and also new skin tag-like things on my skkin and you can feel a bump under my skin, its painful to touch Hello ! yes very normal! I had 5 removed recently and they all bruised but are healing nicely. Here is a pic of the bruise. .( Great! Thank you : ) Did you use scar cream after? I am wondering how long I have to wait post-surgery before I can start applying it. I am about 12 days out Yes! You can start now, I used scar cream as well as cerave healing ointment before bed! Okay! I bought Mederma but I am afraid that will not be powerful enough. Do I need to pull out the big guns and buy the one from my doctor\u2019s office? I have never used a prescription. I honestly think it depends how big and where the tumor was removed! I had 1 removed my face about 2 years ago and you can barley even see the scar! ( here is what my arm looks like now ( about 8 weeks old) ( Just give it time and also use SPF! Oh wow! Okay. Good to know. My scars are on my neck, knee, chest and bottom. So ideally I would like them to disappear asap.\n\nYour results are amazing! ", "For those of you who take opiates for your pain, do you have a have difficulty dealing with the itchiness all over your body?  while i do not take pain killers i itch as well Pain killers may very well be the cause of your itching, but many people with NF have itchy skin and need help to get it undercontrol. I am one of those people, might be worth looking into. I had itching way before I got on gabapentin. I still itch like crazy. Itchiness is an effect (of her NF1) that my daughter has always had. I am always itchy. Occasionally I scratch until I bleed. I take two different pain medications and do not have any itchiness. It is possible you may be allergic to the medication and might need to try a different medication. I would speak with your doctor about it. Itchiness can definitely be caused by opiates especially long term use.  Try taking Benadryl at the same time.  Singulair may also be helpful especially if you get drowsy from Benadryl.  Singulair is a prescription Med for allergies that is very benign; no side effects.", "Infant with possible nf1 I have a 4 month old that is starting to show large light brown spots in random places across her body. Looking things up it seems that may be related to nf1. We are going to talk to her doctor at the next checkup, but really just worries and wondering what other things to look for with an infant? No one we know has had this so in the dark and online is not much help with this age You can look for any spinal issues I guess? Or developmental delays. They also almost have lisch nodules in the eyes (not visible to the naked eye) . That is usually the two criteria for diagnosis First, do not panic.\n\nOur newborn had cafe au lait spots at birth, and more as he got older. We suspected NF1 early on but it was not until he was maybe 2 that he met enough criteria that he was confirmed (cafe au lait spots and small fibromas were the 2 criteria he ended up meeting). He had some developmental delays as well (delayed first steps, delayed speech, etc).\n\nNF1 was further confirmed with genetic testing later on. You can ask for genetic testing but it can be expensive, and generally NF1 will confirm itself as time goes on anyways.\n\nNot much to do with an infant except keep an eye out for things. If it does end up being NF1, worth researching if there are any specialists / children's hospitals nearby to you. We are lucky to have a good Children's Hospital near us (Denver) that has a strong NF practice. Thank you, just hard seeing these and worrying about it and what it might mean for her going forward It is hard to know with such a young infant. Our little guy had a few Cafe Au Lait (CAL) spots around that time, but not enough to warrant a diagnosis. When he was around 7-8 months I noticed that his head circumference had gotten a lot bigger, from around 50th percentile to 90th. That is not a sign of NF but often seen amongst children with NF. He rolled over early and crawled at 8 months which is on time, but some kids with NF are delayed. \n\nWe did the genetic test and he tested positive. Try not to worry, Google brings up the worst of the worst. A nurse noticed my daughters spots when she was 11 months old but we did not get a diagnosis till she was 5. So far birthmarks have been her only symptom though we are struggling with mental health now (depression and anxiety) but to be fair, it is 2020 too. I did not know I had it till I was 34, also just birth marks and also migraines. Everything varies so much with NF it is best to take it one day at a time Not OP but, may I ask how old your daughter is now? Hi OP, I am in a similar situation with my 3 month old.  I have already brought it up to her pediatrician and she was the first to mention NF1.  She tried telling me not to worry about it, that other symptoms do not really show up until about 18-24 months and to just enjoy my baby in the meantime.  I had no idea what NF1 was so I took her word and went home.  After I googled and panicked and cried all weekend long, I phoned her again and requested genetic testing.  She said the best she could do right now was refer my daughter to a dermatologist.  The dermatologist then referred us to a neurologist.  The neurologist was a Godsend and seemed to be very knowledgeable in NF.  At our first appointment she swabbed my daughter for a genetic test.  We are awaiting results. \nSo far, my little one only has the multiple spots.  The neurologist does not suspect lisch nodules or any other eye problems but, I am going to request a referral to the ophthalmologist.  \n\nIn the meantime, I have really tried to just enjoy my baby.  Also, I am trying to educate myself about NF to mentally prepare myself for what is to come. \nLet me know if you need someone to worry with or talk to.  You can message me directly.  \n\nGood luck to you and your little one. Thank you! I am just hoping that I am overreacting but I will reach out when things hit the fan. Most stats say that it will be all right, but it is still scary 7, so crossing fingers puberty does not trigger anything but doing well now Hoping that it does not!  \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffc.  Also hoping the depression and anxiety is COVID-related and that it will resolve itself once things ease up and get better. You are welcome.  I am also hoping the same - that I am over-reacting or thinking worst-case scenario.  Our neurologist, who ordered the genetic testing, also mentioned my daughter will be tested for Legius syndrome, which is similar to NF1 but with a lesser likelihood of there being tumors or growths throughout the body. If doctors find the need to test your little one for NF1, perhaps they can test for that too.  Keep us posted on how things go! Good luck mama. My daughter had 2 CALMs at birth. By 3 months of age, she gained 4 more, so I suggested my pediatrician recommend us for genetic testing. We got blood drawn on Oct 13th (for NF1 and SPRED1 testing), waiting for results (though I strongly feel she has it). Studying about rare diseases in grad school is one thing but having a child with it is something else. I keep telling myself there are worse diseases than NF1, but I would be lying to myself if I say I am not suffering from depression and anxiety over her possible NF. No she was right on track for everything and has been doing well in school. The only things I have noticed is physical stuff seems to be slightly more difficult for her than her peers like riding a bike or hanging from monkey bars. Is your daughter very fair with red / strawberry blond hair or your and her father from different ancestry?  In this statement on his website, Dr. Bruce Korf - a legend in the NF1 world says : \n\n\"We do see occasional healthy children with as many as six caf\u00e9-au-lait spots, though usually these spots are usually relatively indistinct and have irregular margins. Often these children have fair skin and red hair, or have parents of different ancestry, with one having darker skin than the other.\u00a0 These children tend to be healthy and do not have any underlying medical problem as far as is known.\" \n\n(\n\nA diagnosis based only on the old 1980s criteria which requires two to make a formal diagnosis is useless at such a young age because most manifestations and symptoms are age related. For this reasons, a group of experts have been battling since 2014 to change the old criteria, include a far longer range of common signs and push for genetic testing since it is available and easy to do . \n\nThere are several other condition that present with Cafe au lait spots, one is called Legius and often referred to as the NF1-like syndrome, because it only presents with the skin spots, but none of the tumours. \n\nYes cafe au lait spot are a sign of nf1, but many with nf1 do not have them (I do not) and many with them do not have nf1. \n\nInstead on living in doubt, see a doctor, have the genetic test done, now you do not even need to take blood, some labs can do the NF1 test with a cheek swab and in weeks you will know. Actually what very little hair she has is a strawberry color for sure, I will bring that up to the doctor as well ( \n\nI believe this is the study that justified his statement. Hey so you have NF1 but zero cafe au lait spots? How did you find out about your NF1? Our daughter\u2019s test results came back from UAB. They suspect my daughter has a low level deletion (some blood cells are normal, others have deletion). They want to do a RNA based test to confirm mosaicism in her NF1 gene. Genetic test after I had one of my many \"cyst\" removed and pathologically analysed. Was not a cyst but neurofibroma.\n\nAnd yes, not a single caf\u00e9 au lait spot My 11 month old was recently confirmed NF1 and she is ahead of all cognitive and motor milestones \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Are Brain Haemorrhages common?

Never had issues except minor pain and headaches. I had some tiny tumors cut out of my skin for cosmetic reasons but that was my choice. Havent had an MRI check since i was like 15 as i cant afford one and parents wont take the time to pay the rest.\n\nHowever, i always get nervous im going to drop dead and destroy my family from a brain aneurysm because of the tumors in my brain.\nPlay it to me straight if i have brain tumors, is this more likely to happen to me then to the average person?

My wife (31) has NF2. She has bilateral vestibular Schwannomas. Left side is 11 mm, right side is 2.5 mm. We are torn between wait and watch and moving forward with surgery on the left side. I read somewhere that surgery can cause other tumors to grow? Is this a common theory? Has it been proven? Also any insight or advice on whether to wait or move forward with surgery would be helpful. Thanks!  Hello. I am 25F and just recently had most of the vestibular schwannoma on my left side removed a little more then a month ago. I was urged to have surgery sooner rather than later in order to prevent the tumor from pressing on my brainstem and to have a better chance at preserving facial nerve function. The bigger the tumor, the more complicated that can become. My understanding is that the procedure itself involves severing the auditory nerve completely. I was already deaf due to the bilateral tumors prior to surgery, which ultimately helped me meet the criteria for the procedure (i.e. no risk of any hearing loss since it is already gone). I also received an ABI on that side after the tumor was removed and it will be activated soon.\n\nAs for surgery causing other tumors to grow, I honestly do not know. I thought I would provide some insight based on my experience, however.\n\nIf you have any other questions, I will do my best to answer/share what I do know.\n\nThank you for sharing! Have you looked into Avastin? Hey, im 29M and I have had 4 surgeries and a CyberKnife treatment. I honestly do not really remember everything I have been told because it is always so overwhelming but I do not really remembering ever being told that it may cause other tumors to grow. I had my surgeries done at NIH and my Dr. there was very informative and passionate about his job. He did tell me the CyberKnife treatment was not the best idea because it may shrink the tumor for the moment but if it does grow back and have to do surgery it will be more complicated. All I really have to give message for any questions I may be able to help with. I have NF2 I am currently on Avastin. So far my tumors are stable.  NF1 here. I have been told by my docs that surgery kind of makes them \"angry,\" and that they can grow back, possibly more aggressively. Such has been the case for glomus tumors in my hand and various neurofibromas I have had removed, but every case is different.  I was on Avastin for five years and nothing shrank or grew but it damaged my kidneys a bit. \n\nAxitinib might be better I have NF2. I have had two different radiotherapy treatments, two cervical spine surgeries, and five years of Avastin. None of my procedures have caused new tumor growth. \n\nDoes your wife still have her hearing? I would highly recommend trying Axitinib (a new pill based therapy) or Avastin before doing any kind of surgery. Hearing loss has ruined my life/made it exceedingly difficult and with any of the other procedures you face a risk of losing it.  How did your treatment go? I was unfortunate in that I did not have access to that during my second radiotherapy and it shot my hearing terribly CyberKnife did the same thing. Well it did shrink the tumor but hearing still shot so main reason im not the fondest of radiotherapy. is not avastin extremely espensive? Yeah, likewise. But I guess surgery is just as bad, if not worse I mean not necessarily. I have vestibular schwinommas or whatever the hell it is called and got CyberKnife on my right side and completely lost hearing. My left side had 3 different surgical procedures to take MOST of the tumor out but very small piece left to conserve the nerve for my hearing. Let me note DR. said it would not be guaranteed that I would wake up with my hearing but I did. It may indeed grow again to a point it needs to be treated or even if it grows the smallest amount it could damage the nerve and I go deaf overnight but im grateful that one of my ears hearing is preserved, a lot due to my Dr's. advice.   Depends on what country you reside in. So I will preface this by saying I am not going to provide any NF2-related sources but I have done a ton of research on NF1 plexiforms - the knowledge, or theories at least, may apply analogously to NF2 tumors.\n\n\nMy understanding is that an inflammatory environment causes existing tumors to grow more aggressively.  This is why many with NF1 adopt an anti-inflammatory diet or take curcumin/turmeric supplements.  ( but take it with a grain of salt due to sample size.\n\nIf you are worried about surgery causing brand new tumors to form - I would not worry about that.  Many doctors subscribe to the ( for NF1 tumor formation.  Meaning a second mutation to the healthy NF1 allele is required for a tumor to form.  Unless your surgery is using large doses of radiation then there is no risk of extra mutations forming in your healthy cells as a result. Yes. But it does appear to work.  No that is wrong. These tumors will continue to grow regardless and new ones can always come about, while old ones can grow.  Ohh okay. I had no idea about the surgery. I had radiation on both nerves. Gamma Ray knife on my right and daily radiation for 28 days on my left. My right ear is the better one now 5 months ago i had a small plexi removed from my face. For now, my face is worst than before, the inflamation just does not go and now have a more intense and constant pain in the area, plus my doc never answer me about this :(. Maybe its just a matter of time, and this will be better, but i do not know.\nThat Is my only experience whit surgery, there are my 2 cents.\n(Sry bad writing, not a native) Just a heads up. Turmeric has shown to have good correlation with good effects in many studies. I saw a meta-analysis of the results for turmeric which showed that the positive results were likely down to how difficult it is to get accurate result with turmeric due to interferences it has like colour. Not saying there is nothing in it; just a word of caution. :)", "5 year old with NF1 Hey all! Brand new to the group. My daughter is 5 years old. Born with cafe au laits starting around 6m and officially diagnosed by 3 years old. We do yearly eye exams to check for optic tumors and thankfully have not had any but just this year formed the lische nodules (cafe au laits) in her eyes, which just further confirms her NF1 diagnosis. Upon diagnosis we were not given any follow up information other than year eye appointments. This drives me NUTS as I so want to be proactive but doctors say there is no reason to see NF specialist unless she is having and issues with symptoms. Anyone have any advice or experience with this?

I have heard it could even result in permanent paralysis of the arm. Maybe I am panicking a little excessively, but this is not something I was expecting to have to go through at the age of 20.\n\nI know it is a real long shot, but I was wondering if anyone else has experienced something remotely similar, I would appreciate any comments really, I am just losing it a little..\n\nThanks, I hope anyone who reads this is well. I have had surgery twice on my right arm. The first time was in 2001 to remove tumors on my lower right arm. The second time was in 2018 to remove cancerous tumors in the upper right arm. Both surgeries were successful and I have full use of my arm and hand. Thank you for your comment :)\nI am trying to maintain a more positive outlook You are welcome. Best to stay positive and keep your mind at ease. i have one on my eyebrow and my doctor told me not to go since i could loose sensation in half of my face ( also not something you want at 21). \n\nI got one off in my neck and it went really well! idk if this helps If removing thyroid gland with risk of damaging vocal chord nerves end swalloving nerves is similar...I would thyroid gland removed last year. I knew the risks and chose one of the best surgeons I could reach. Everything went fine. I had neuroma removed from my right chest approx 5 years ago and has been good so far... How ever I do have another neuroma on my left arm but the surgeon advised me to disregard it from the time being till it gets worse... \n\nI do not think you should be worried too much but have good faith in doctors and surgeons who has been specialising in these fields for their whole life. \n\nAll the very best :) Thank you for your reply :))\nI think they want to go ahead with surgery due to the fact that the initial biopsy failed so we dont know with 100% certainty that it is not something nasty.\n\nI am considering asking for another biopsy attempt but this time when sedated, before taking the leap into the 'unknown'. We will see, either way thank you for the reassurance :) You are mentioning a biopsy but what about  imaging?  have you done an MRI? \n\nIn your shoes, I would prefer a neurosurgeon to perform any surgery involving nerves , because it is a very tight space with he tendon flexor and depending how embedded the tumour is, sometimes they need to recess a section of the nerve and in this case you want someone who knows how to do this without losing function.\n\nAs others have said, sometimes we have to do risky surgeries, and the most important factor is how good the surgeon is. Maybe get a second opinion with a neurosurgeon. I had surgery twice on my right arm as well. Inner Elbow the first one was done 20+ years ago under general anesthesia and they did not get it all.

I am here because I am upset. My youngest has NF1 and has two tumors in her head from initial MRI readings last year, and we found a new one around her collarbone. . Insurance denied coverage this year unless there are physical changes. Why are not the MRIs considered preventative? Going to doctor and I am trying not to assume he will say his hands are tied or it is your insurance.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyone else going through this? My son gets them every 6 months or so for optic pathway gliomas. We have not had any problems with insurance (yet), although we have high deductible health insurance so we are paying out of pocket until the limits are reached.\n\nAre you working with a hospital or specialist, or are the MRIs being ordered through your primary care physician? We are working with Children's Hospital and they have a dedicated person who deals with insurance haggling. Thanks for replying. We are scheduled to see the NF doctor at Cook Childrens in DFW at the end of the month \u2013 the same doctor who ordered the MRIs annually. So we have to go to him and maybe we will get a haggler to force choke my insurance company into submission.\n\nYesterday was checking for any more or new  lisch tumors on her optical nerves. So I was taken back that insurance denied the second part of the annual checkups. \n\nWork insurance... They can put me through all kinds of ditch digging work until my girls' health is subjective per insurance company. That is where I draw the line. Yeah it is bullshit. If you talk to insurance company yourself, I would recommend that you calmly let them know that your daughter has tumors in her brain, that the follow up MRI requested by her doctor has been denied by them, and then demand to know the specific individual who rejected the claim, along with their medical qualifications and their reasons for denying, so that you can pass that information along to your attorney. Last July year my insurance refused to cover an MRI because it had been more than 6 months since I would last seen my specialist. He squeezes me in, and then insurance refused to cover the appointment because it had been less than 12 months since I would last seen him. There is no winning. \n\nI also once had genetic testing done on a biopsy because the alternative was to remove my entire thyroid, and insurance decided not to cover it because it turned out not to be cancer so \"it was not actually necessary\". \n\nI have no idea how or what was covered when I was a child, as my parent shielded that kind of thing from me. My only experience as an adult is to say just keep trying to appeal. That is what I getting. I have to wait 12 months to see him. BUT he authorized it last year and the eye doc before we see him so he has all the tests when she has her checkup.\n\nI am a bit alarmed due to the new tumor the doc needs to look around her collarbone.\n\nHR here at work is getting more info for me. My son has been on annual scans for several years now.  Our process, all handled by the hospital, has been that insurance denies initially then the hospital requests a peer review (which i believe to a communication between my son's doctor and a doctor for the insurance company).  We have had to reschedule once because the peer review was not completed prior to his appointment.  Over the years, this has been more streamlined with the hospital starting pre-approval 3 weeks prior to the appointment and we normally have pre-approval codes several days before the appointment. We thought we had it pre-approved. That is something I will bring up when I see him. I go through this every few years and it is a pain in the neck. I have to call and explain that I have had this for 40 plus years and it is an ongoing problem. You can your doctor can file an appeal with the insurance. It helps if you doctor write a letter and insist that these MRIs are important, because of your child condition. I had an issue back in 2018 where I needed surgery to remove a cancerous tumor and my insurance did not want to cover it. I filed an appeal, as did the hospital. I also have my primary care doctor along with my Neurofibromatosis specialist each of which wrote letters to the insurance company. I was able to have my surgery and the insurance paid for it all. Ditto on filing an appeal. I had to fight a denied PET scan charge because it allegedly was not an applicable diagnostic for NF, but turned out that was just because the fairly generic list of conditions the insurance company was using as their approval basis did not include more rare conditions.  I lucked out and got a really great appeal rep that walked through exactly what to write and send to counter it and get covered, hopefully you can get someone similar! Mine are considered preventive. It is really based on insurance, tru to have a specialist get approval via letter If in the US of A please check the NIH website for studies for people with NF1.

I definitely cannot wear some of the things I wore a few years ago not just due to being an older person but because the plexiforms do not allow me to without great pain.\n\n\nI do not think we are disgusting but I know it is what people think when I am not able to hide the plexiforms I do have. We have probably all seen peoples comments online about how we look an articles and whatnot about NF.\n\n\nIt is just so frustrating the limits there are towards removal and Medical treatments in general. Like someone could go and remove these hundreds of little things but clearly something is happening in my body where the roots are just spreading. Everything is so poorly understood that I worry about finding even a surgeon to handle it if I did go that route and there is a point where the scarring would be just as bad and  be just as uncomfortable. I am angry and sad and I want a better life than this.\n\nI know I am smart and creative, but NF takes my energy, really does cause me to lose a lot of my overall capability to be strong and useful.  I am sometimes too tired to feel passionate about things I care for just because of my aches and pains and that is frustrating as hell.\n\nAnd especially here in the United States I feel so limited to my options for my future be  Disability or ????.\n\nI just want to go outside and look like everyone else and where whatever I want with comfort. \n\nThis is not how I wanted to leave my twenties behind. I feel like I never got to experience being young.\n\nForgive any strange wordings.  I have been tired and using voice to text for the first time this week as an alternative and it does not quite understand my speech patterns. I understand how you feel I am 36 male with plexiform on my ankle, buttock and back. I have manny many small bumps that are very visible under sun light. My body is cover with thousands of spots. I will never go swimming with shirt off. The medical world is behind on NF sad I know. Chin up. I am 37, I know it can be hard, but you just take it one day at a time. I myself have had four surgeries related to my nf and three of them were pretty serious, but I do not let them get me down. Life is too short. If you ever have any questions or anything, let me know. I am 23 I do not have many and worry about this often. I feel my girlfriend may leave me if it affects my face. \nI do not have any right now most of my spots are on my body and she says she loves them because they make me unique, which honestly helps a lot. How old were you when you had your 1st surgery if you do not mind me asking I was 16 or 17. I do not have the answers.  But I can share a little wisdom.  Literally everyone has something about their body with which they are unhappy.   Everyone.   So, you are no different.  None of us chose the bodies we live in.  We just choose HOW we live with them.  You can be thrilled with all your body is capable of, or you can focus on its imperfections.   Up to you.  \ud83d\ude18", "doubt does anyone w lot of birthmarks( say 5 )has this genetic disease? Only birthmarks is not enough to diagnose, there are more criteria.  Cafe au lait  spots is just one of them I second that. If someone has 6+ cafe au lait spots as well as freckling in the armpits/groin, that could be enough. But lots of birthmarks in general, no. The Children's Tumor Foundation has useful info about diagnostic criteria. ( Genetic testing is the only way to be 100% sure. It is not just any birthmark, it is a type called cafe au lait. I would follow up with a doctor if you have concerns. It is more than just birthmarks. You will need other traits/symptoms along with the birthmarks. Thank you for replying Thanks a lot for this Okay thanks for letting me know", "One step closer to the cure ", "I am really scared that these months will be my last... I am a 21(M) and I have a myriad of health problems. Severe NF (1) along with many plexiform neurofibromas which are not visible on the skin. All tumors are deep within my body. Anyway, because of my NF (1) I developed skeletal deformities that caused severe scoliosis, restrictive lung disease, failure to thrive, etc. For most of my life NF was not a primary issue. Most of the surgeries were for my scoliosis. I have had a near total spinal fusion with three titanium rods along my spine and over 20 spinal surgeries( I have had an additional 20 procedure, but due to other reasons). I went through extensive chest reconstructive surgery in 2013 and because of that now need to use a bipap at night to assist with breathing. I always struggled with putting on weight, and I am very skinny (constant nausea does not help). I needed a g-tube and TPN up until 18. Despite all these obstacles I managed to stay in school, never got left back, and excelled in my classes. I even went through radiation therapy for an MPNST during my senior year in HS, yet I still loved every minute of the last year in high school. I was really hopeful that as I got older my health problems would be less severe and easier to handle. I was wrong. It all start 1.5 years after I started college. I was never in any condition to live in a dorm far away in some college somewhere, but I managed to get into honors society in a college in the City, and I commuted everyday to and from school by myself. I even got a part-time job at my local library. I was so happy. Finally, I gained some form of independence and made a life for myself! Well, things suddenly began to fall apart in mid August of 2017. I do not know what happened to me, but I remember waking up that day and feeling like something was, \u201coff\u201d. From then on the mild yet manageable symptoms that I had my entire life got much worse. I suddenly had much worse back-pain and bad neuropathy in my legs. I felt too weak and fatigued to garden for the rest of the summer. Despite these issues I pushed myself to continue going college that fall. I was hoping that a routine spinal surgery that I was getting in February of 2018 would set things back in track. My spinal surgeon at Johns Hopkins is amazing. I really believed that the surgery would help since he saved my life before, so why not again? Well, the surgery came and went and I continued to get worse. My walking got really bad and my pain and weakness continued to degrade. I am in no way blaming the surgeon. I just thought that the surgery would put me back on the right path... The worst part was that it was my idea to have the surgery. Before the surgery my spine doc said that it was not 100% necessary to replace my spinal rods and that I could wait, but I was so hopeful that I went with it anyway. Now, more than a year later I am in the worst shape I have ever been in. I take methadone, nurontin, and dilaudid daily for pain and it barely helps. I still scream in pain all day, mostly from my bed. The worst part was that I had a chance to get better in August of 2018 when I started the experimental MEK inhibitor called, Selumetinib. It apparently has been successful at shrinking neurofibromas in 70% of patients, and supposedly 100% of people who tried the drug did not experience any neurofibroma growth. Well, I guess I am a medical anomaly since not only did my tumors not shrink, but they sprouted up faster than weeds in a spring garden. I am terrified. I am skinner than ever before and rarely feel well enough to get out of the house except to see doctors or do physical therapy. This lifestyle is killing me. I was such a social person, and I used to never sleep in late or stay home all day, but now I do. My life has gone upside down and does not seem to be getting any better. My doctors at NYU and MSKCC no longer can help and have zero answer or suggestions. I just went to the NF clinic at the Mayo Clinic hoping that they would know something that my current doctors have not thought of, but based one how my appointment went today they do not seem to have any answers, and they only seemed to be fascinated with my very clear and \u201cbeautiful\u201d lisch nodules that dot my iris. I have no more hope and frankly do not feel like I have much life left in me. I am drained both emotionally and physically. Based on my readings on NF it seems like late teens &amp; early twenties is when NF issues flair up, and from what I read a lot of NF sufferers pass away around this age (Gillian Anderson who starred in X-Files had a brother who died of NF (1) at 21). It kills me that things did not turn out differently for me. I sometimes stay up all night thinking about what my life would be like without NF. What would I look like? Would I be supper smart. Would my family be happier? Would I have a girlfriend?  I even just wish that my NF symptoms did not get worse since that late summer day in 2017. If my health did not degrade I would have been graduating college next semester. I know only one or two people will read this to the very end, but I guess just need to vent, and maybe in someway I am writing this to leave some kind of trace and story of my existence. My parents are very supportive and caring, but after two years of dealing with my worsening health issues they just get frustrated and upset when I tell them how scared I am or how shitty I feel physically and mentally. Also, I have totally changed my diet and I am now a health freak, yet that has not helped me either. I am at wits end. I feel like I am stuck in a dead end of a giant maze. I do not even see the point of living anymore yet I am too scared to end it because I fear that there is no afterlife. I really do not know why I writing this since I am not asking for answers or even support; I guess I just need to get all this BS off my chest. it is really hard to read this as it is a giant wall of text my eyes are getting worse and I do not have glasses yet would you be so kind as to break this into paragraphs so it is easier to read? You know what? I know that you are hitting a low right now, but you must be one of the most resilient persons that I have read about. I do not know many people who would have gone through what you have been through while maintaining the ambition that you have. You wrote your story with the eloquence, grace, and emotional intelligence of somebody who has the deep understanding that can only come from experience. You would not have that ability without going through the challenges that you have faced. I am sorry that you are going through what feels like the end, and I wish there was something that I could say to help bring you reassurance. I am grateful that you shared your experience, and I genuinely wish that your health and hope for the future improves. Sure. Sorry Thanks. You are really kind. NF is such a difficult disease, and it also hurts me to know that others experience similar issues. I wish you the best, and I hope that a real cure is around the corner. thank you I appreciate it. I do not have it as bad as you, and I am sorry you are going through this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI deal with back pain and leg pain also due to scoliosis and plexiforms, but it is't as bad as you.\n\nyou are a tough SOB and there is no denying that I hope you get better and make it through this as from what I have read if anyone can it is definitely you Is there a support group in your area that you can share your experiences and have the emotional support. Speaking to people like this form is very helpful but doing it in a IRL setting allows us to understand that our experiences hard and grim as they can be for us , we are not alone nor isolated.  I believe you would have greatly benefit from speaking with a counselor hopeful a one that has experience with treating patients with NF or Chronic pain issues.  Please reach out not all is lost. I am so sorry to read this :( .... Reading this makes me feel guilty that i have it so diffucult with my nf1 and it is not that worse as you.... I feel you,... And i really really hope you Will feel better and your health Will go soon much better... You are not alone....i know that does not help... But maybe a little... Big hug for you. Keep fighting! As a parent of an NF1 child this was really hard to read. I admire your resilience and strength. Your parents are probably getting frustrated when you mention your feelings because they are scared and dont want to imagine their lives without you. Please vent on here as much as you want, this is what this sub is for. I am thinking of you and I really hope things get better for you. I have been to so many psychologists and even did a specialized NF group therapy for two months. I find that therapy no longer helps since all my anxiety and depression is because of my worsening health. I feel like I will never emotionally feel better if I do physically feel better. I do try to see friends as much as a can though, but since I rarely feel well enough to do anything I pretty much just talk to them over the phone. Sending you hugs and I am hoping that you have hit the bottom and will only get better from here. They just said that I should stay in Minnesota at the Mayo Clinic a little bit longer. I was supposed to leave today, but I am going to stay until the ens of the week so they can do some imaging of my back. Yes, you are right, they always have an issue with artifact on the MRI, but this doctor thinks he can find a way around that and get a good image of my spine. I really do not want to go back on the feeding tube because it caused a whole bunch of issues; plus, the doctor said it is not so good to get a feedtube put in again since it would create a lot of scar tissue and weaken the lining of my stomach. Well important you do what you and I understand the need to be physical well leads to better emotional health. Sometimes talking in it out is not always about getting better it is all about letting it out and not doing it alone.  I hope you are able to find a way that works for you. You are not alone in this and sharing could in the long run help. We want to make all of your pain and suffering go away and yet cannot.   The colors of humanity's great quilt bleed under the tears of her suffering. I add my tears with yours to this great quilt as I ache with sadness tonight at not being able to free you from all of your pain.  We all suffer some, but some are born to a crucible of suffering.  I am not convinced there is nothing waiting for us.  I have great hope that their is something to come and that those who suffer in this life will be wisped away to magnificent halls of beauty, serenity,  perfection and love where they discover they have become swans in that holy realm, exalted above the mountain they climbed on bloodied hands and knees. Those of us who wander the low lands in life, grasping only frivolousness and gratuitous selfishness, often without depth of soul, may yet have our own crucible waiting for us in the next realm, a necessary growth stage before our own ascension where we finally join you.  May it be so for you friend.  May hidden angels wipe away your tears, sustain you and bear you up as you carry this terrible burden.

But do you guys have some advice?", "Do most people develop neurofibromas with NF1? My husband was diagnosed with NF1 as a kid and later had some genetic testing done to confirm the diagnosis. He never developed any neurofibromas. My daughter (age 4) was diagnosed with NF1 this week based on her cafe au lait spots and having a relative with it. \n\nMy husband had short stature, large head, ADHD, and some other behavioral issues, but that and the cafe au lait spots are all he ever had. This is what my daughter has so far, too. Is it rare for someone with NF1 to NOT get the neurofibromas?  I was t diagnosed until I was 15. I have numerous tumors throughout my body. In the last twenty years I have had four surgeries. 2001 to remove tumor in my lower left arm, 2007 to remove tumors pressing against my cervical spine, 2014 to remove cancerous tumors in my upper right leg, 2018 to remove cancerous in to upper right arm.\n\nI have difficulty walking for long periods of time as well as sitting, I need to be able to get up and move whenever I need to. I do walk with a slight limp, some days are better than others. I am limited to what I am able to lift. I also have a lazy right eye, high blood pressure and dyslexia. No one in my family has neurofibromatosis, though it is a possibility a distant cousins father on my moms side may of had it, but no one know for sure. \n\nI have MRIs yearly and see my neurofibromatosis specialist at least once a year if the 2-3 times a year, just depends. I take two pain medication for neurofibromatosis.\n\nIf you have any questions let me know.  I am 29 diagnosed very early with NF1 confirmed by a genetic test when I was 25. After my first pregnancy I got a couple neurofibromas. I have lots of the spots. My mom does not have spots but has tons of the neurofibromas that she got after pregnancy. Nf varies from person to person. But hormones can affect the NF.  My cousin was just diagnosed at 25 and she only developed neurofibromas a few years before her diagnosis.  Apparently I read only 50% of people with nf develop neurofibromas and it can either be sub-cutaneous or cutaneous.  I will have to edit my post. My husband does have a few of them near his armpit. I never noticed them and thought he did not have them. That is good to know!  Yikes those pregnancy hormones. I know this does not compare of course, but after my own pregnancy my hormones went crazy and I had over 100 small skin tags pop up all over the place.  Damn I am sorry you have so much pain. &lt;3 Thank you.  Thank you and your welcome, I hope all goes well for your family. I also got a couple skin tags.  I was diagnosed at 31 and only have plexiform neurofibromas, no cutaneous ones.  We are currently trying to conceive and I have NF1. We went to a geneticist specializing in NF as well as a perinatologist prior to trying. We have also seen an IVF doctor so explore options of testing embryos before implantation. All have said that NF1 has extremely variable symptoms even among family members. I have fairly mild symptoms but the doctors have all said symptom severity is evenly spread from zero symptoms to mild, moderate, and severe. And symptom severity does not really surface until puberty. That is basically all I know. I know some people have zero symptoms or just cafe au late marks, so never even get diagnosed. But I do not think they even really know what those statistics are because how could they if they never get diagnosed? Where did you read that? Ive talked to a lot of doctors about it recently and they all said it is extremely unpredictable and they do not have good numbers on how many people have symptoms.  I currently go to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in NYC for a research study on Selumetinib. I have a ton of subcutaneous neurofibromas, but no cutaneous ones. I brought it up with him and another doc at NIH and they say they do not know for sure, but research does indicate the people with NF usually have one or the other. Rarely have they seen NF patients with both subcutaneous and cutaneous neurofibromas Interesting. I definitely have cutaneous ones but I think I also have a tuner deep in the back of my thigh because I have had mild pain there for years. I will get an MRI at some point to determine but the pain has not changed so it is not really urgent. When I told the NF geneticist I saw though she said she thinks it is a fibroma. But maybe it is a different kind of it is deep in muscle tissue. Generally speaking though I have mild symptoms.  I have a single cutaneous fibroma and the rest are small subcutaneous ones (maybe 20).

Is this the nerves coming back again?  I can also feel the ridges where my skull was removed. I would love to hear from others. Thank you Yes, several at this point. Sometimes they grow back if the surgeon leaves some of the initial tumor. You should get into an MRI to confirm growth. Also consider Avastin or another clinical trial drug. Boston University has a few ongoing trials if you are interested.  Do you know if there are any MEK inhibitor trials for brain tumors? Selumetinib has been shown to be effective for plexiforms and is also bring trialed for cutaneous neurofibromas and optic glioma.  Last MRI in March was clear. The whole tumor was removed.  What do those drugs do? Depends on the drugs. Most of the -mibs and -nabs work by blocking certain proteins or other neurochemicals from binding with the NF receptors, they basically starve the tumors.  I am not certain. Try searching in the NIH database, you can usually find good info there and in PubMed.  What are NF brain tumors typically called?

I recently had a minor surgery to remove a tumor as I have had done many, many times now. Except when the results came back, the doctor (just the GP, not specialist) said that everything was fine (as always) but in passing said it was a schwannoma. Now, every single tumor I have had removed was a fibroma. He really could not explain it in layman terms, and googling only brings me to very confusing terms and explanations that is hard to understand because English is not my native language and medical terms are hard enough to understand as is.\n\nAlso, I have NF1, I know Schwannomatosis exists. From what I understand it is closer to NF2 than it is to NF1. So I probably have been misdiagnosed all these years?\n\nSo, could someone explain this to me in dumb words?

His most significant contribution to biology is considered to be the extension of cell theory to animals. Other contributions include the discovery of Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system, the discovery and study of pepsin, the discovery of the organic nature of yeast, and the invention of the term metabolism.\n \n^(( | )( | )( | )( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5) Both are tumors of the peripheral nerve sheath, and both are primarily comprised of Schwann cells. However, fibromas can also be composed of connective tissue, blood cells, and other types of cells. \n\nThe more significant difference is that schwannomas are not as loose and can push and compress nerves. Neurofibromas are loose and have a \"bag of worms\" appearance grossly. They will typically just surround a nerve. Though in some cases, they can compress the nerve if they are near bones and such. \n\nAdditionally, neurofibromas are associated more with NF1, and schwannomas are associated more with NF2 and schwannomatosis. Keep in mind though, a person with NF1 can have things like vestibular schwannomas. \n\nA pathologist is a person who can easily distinguish between the two under a microscope. thank you! this made a lot more sense than anything I have read. As much as i know one important thing is that schwannomas usually have no tendency to turn into cancer, while with neurofibromas there is  a risk that this could happen, however its rare.", "Transitioning and NF1 Hello reddit, I am posting on behalf of a friend of mine, and we need advice. I am considering x-posting this to another subreddit, if anyone has a suggestion for one that may help, please let me know!\n\nNow let me start this off by saying I do not know very much about NF, specifically NF1 which is what my friend has. This friend happens to be a transgender man (ftm), and wishes to start hormone replacement therapy, or hrt, but according to his doctor (as he told me), doing so may aggravate his symptoms and may cause even more issues, as this would be similar to inducing a \"second puberty\". I have googled this, as I am wont to do, with very little success. Does anyone have any advice for us? I want to support him the very best way if I can, especially if it turns out he may not be able to take hormones. I can also contact this friend as needed, so if anyone wants me to ask him something, please ask.\n\nThank you for your time, I hope that was comprehensible.\n\n- Sai \nI am also trans (ftm) with NF 1. None of the doctors I have talked to are sure, but one suggested it may benefit our weaker bones.  I am planning on taking low dose T and doing once monthly checkins. \n\n\nAFAIK, there are very few of us, and not really any research.  I would very much love to talk to your friend to connect about the complexity of it.  I have heard (mostly anecdotal) of estrogen therapy causing increase in tumor growth in individuals with NF-1, but I have never heard anything testosterone therapy causing this same problem.  Sadly I think a lot of these types of things have not really been studied. I believe that the tumors mostly react to progesterone, but make an appointment with an endocrinologist or geneticist to be sure. This is correct. Estrogen seems to be okay, a study they did with women taking Birth Control, they noticed tumor growth when they were on HIGHER dosages of progesterone. \n\nI would just talk to the doctor about the amount of estrogen/progesterone in the hormone replacement and see if theres one with lower dosages....  I have NF1 and im FTM. It shouldnt complicate much if anything at all. Thought i was alone.", "NF1 and my toddler My 2 year old got diagnosed with NF1. She has the birthmarks all over. The doctors have not been helpful. Is there testing she can do to see if she has tumors? The doctor said they cannot do anything until she is older. She has speech issues, hearing issues, and developmental issues. Any advice or info would be much appreciated \ud83d\ude4f MRIs are generally safe for people of all ages. It is not uncommon for children to be sedated for a scan as they need to stay still. Speak with a specialist to see if they recommend having one done. The manifestations and symptoms of Nf1 are age-related, meaning they appear at different stages over the course of life. \n\nSome issues are visible from very early, before children reach the age of 1, and they are bone issues such as tibial dysplasia,  or plexiform neurofibromas, in addition to the obvious Cafe au lait spots. (CALs)\n\nWhen we talk about tumours, we have several kinds of tumour that **might** occur in children. \n\n1) Plexiform are congenital. One is born with them. They might not be obvious straight away, but they can be felt even if not seen by the age of 2. \n\n2) Cutaneous and subcutaneous neurofibroma only very rarely occur before puberty and in those very rare cases, it is around the age 4-6. \n\n3) Optic pathway gliomas (OPG), a benign tumour on the optic nerve. They usually occur before the age of 6 and they are asymptomatic in 40% of cases, meaning there is no impact on vision nor any clue there is a tumour. It is important to say that in many cases, an OPG will be left untreated if there is no risk of vision loss. \n\nBecause your daughter has speech and development issues, paired with hearing issues , and given that an OPG is asymptomatic in a good number of cases, I would push for an ophthalmologist visit and /or an MRI to rule out an OPG. \n\nI have a question for you. We do not have hearing issues in NF1, but several NF1-like syndromes do come with hearing issues. Was your daughter diagnoses with NF1 with a genetic test or based on clinical observation only? Nf2 comes with CALs , even if fewer than nf1 and another condition called Noonan syndrome has CALs with sensorineural hearing loss  in about 20% of patients and intellectual disability, usually mild in 30%. \n\nThis said, one might have NF1 AND hearing issues in the same a child without nf1 can have hearing issues, but it raised the doubt on the diagnosis. \n\nBottom line, if you have had a positive genetic test for NF1, you need to push for a brain MRI. If you have not done the test, you need to push for it and at the same time  request the test for the NF2 gene and for the two genes implicated in Noonan, PTPN11 or RAF1. \n\nI share your frustration about the lack of concern, interest and often knowledge in the medical professionals, at least in Australia where I live. This is why I educated myself on our condition. \n\nI hope you get the answers you deserve. \n\nBest wishes. My son was diagnosed last year (he was one) due to the fact that I have medical training and I recognized the CALs. Our road was: I contacted a geneticist and had a genetic diagnosis. From there, we went to a pediatrician, a dermatologist, a child neurologist and ophthalmologist. The neurologist sent us to a cranial  MRI to check for ophthalmic nerve tumors. He was sedated throughout the process. He does not have any cognitive impairment, so we did not hurry to get a psychiatric evaluation, but it is recommended. He is really tiny, he has a very mild scoliosis, something that might be a fibroma on his forearm, other than that he is ok. Trust your ability's to do your own research and decide on your own schedule of MRIs to watch for tumor growth.  Not all NF1 children will show tumors at a young age.  Sometimes they come much later.  Your comment about your doctor is often heard from parents of NF1 children, sadly.  My NF1 son is 17 and his issues with tumors started in his teen years.  Yet he also had delayed speech, learning disabilities, etc. Have you taken your child to an NF clinic? My husband's parents took him to one every year growing up and they did all kinds of testing to monitor him. He stopped sometime in his teens and we found one close to us when we started thinking about having children. He is back to having yearly checks with this team. \n\nHave you been referred for the other issues you mentioned? I would definitely ask for referrals from your doctor if not. If you cannot physical see tumors pressing out then the best way would be with X-rays and MRIs. Just be aware that with Neurofibromatosis tumors can continue to grow in both size and number of time, but how they develop and effect the person in question can very. This condition effects us all differently.\n\nIf it is possible I would seek out a Neurofibromatosis specialist. If you ever have any questions let me know. My son had cNFs at 10 months and have spoken to many other parents that echo my experience... I think the data surrounding cNFs in children may be out of date. I did not know plexiforms were all congenital. Does that mean that since I had none when I had a full body MRI at 7 years old, that I still do not have any at nearly 34? They do not tend to do scans without symptoms but you definitely can and should be seen by an nf specialist. Go to ctf.org and look for nf clinics near you. You can also search children's hospitals near you to see if they have an nf clinic. We have seen genetics and neurology as nf doctors depending on where we lived. \n\nMy 6 year old has developing fibromas and an optic nerve glioma, asymptomatic. \n\nNf moms rock!!! Is a fb group. You may also find local fb groups for nf. Children's Tumor Foundation is an amazing resource and they have yearly walks in many cities to meet other families and raise awareness. I have not had any testing or monitoring done. I am so frustrated. I would definitely look at the Children's Tumor Foundation  if you are in the USA and see if you can find a hospital with an NF clinic within feasible travel distance. My husband did need a referral from his primary doctor and we did have to wait several months to get in. I imagine each clinic has some kind of waiting period. We started by seeing the genetic counselor and having blood work taken to confirm. They ended up doing some heart testing to rule out Noonan syndrome due to the genetic markers that came back. \n\nIn terms of the other delays you mentioned, I think most states have an Infant to Toddler program for developmental delays. When a child turns three they switch to the preschool setting of the school district that you live in. You can request an evaluation from the school district without a doctor's referral. They offer educational help, but also physical, occupational, &amp; speech therapy. They also usually have hearing impaired and vision impaired services too. Every state has different qualifications for these services, but it is definitely worth looking into.", "when does NF show up? when does NF show up in a child? my friend has it and her child is 6 and shows no signs of having NF. I just wanted to see if it can show up later. there are no indicators of NF with her child so she thinks she got the pass. I think it varies from person to person. If I remember correctly I did not start showing signs until I was around that age. I did have spots and freckles in the general areas. \n\nHowever the migraines did not start to come until I was around 6 or 7. After some consulting, and CAT scans it was determined that I have NF. I hope this helps! Your born with nf, if one parent has it then there is a 50% chance of them having nf and a 50% chance they do not have it. I was born with nf and doctors always thought I had it because of the birthmarks and freckles, but it was never able to be 100% confirmed until I was 15, as previous time they tried to test me was inconclusive. Neither one of my parents have it. did the spots and freckles show up early or when you were 6? when did your spots appear and freckles? I was born with them in some cases people do not find out until they are older because they do not show until then. In my case I was diagnosed when I was 5 when the doctors found a neurofibroma on my neck and found 2 tumors in my brain, I am not sure how long the tumors were there beforehand but my neurofibroma did not form until around 5. After that I started getting more spots and it is been getting worse ever since. is it wise just to get some blood test done to rule it out? or is that not good? Most times doctors will look for physical signs such as spots or check the brain or bones but blood testing is another way of diagnosing too her parents told her they knew early on so she is happy at the moment but did research and saw it can appear up to 10. so she is having a hard time. her child is smart so is that an indicator that the child will not have nf? well it depends. I was fairly smart as a kid but I still struggled with math and had a IEP (individualized education program) for extra help in school. It seems a lot of people with NF1 have varying learning disabilities but it varies though so I do not think smartness has anything to do with it, but I am not a professional so I would not be 100% sure \ud83e\udd72 I was able to be diagnosed at birth and started getting migraines and seizures around 3 or 4 years old. I do not remember. Sorry I do not have any CAL or freckling. If a doctor had looked at me at the age of 6, they would have misdiagnosed me as not having NF1. I have a positive genetic test. \n\nMy first manifestation appeared at the age of 12, large hyperpigmentation patches, quickly followed by kyphosis and subcutaneous neurofibromas. My first cutaneous neurofibromas appeared around the age of 19-20. I also have the Lisch nodules but unsure when they appeared. \n\nThe genetic test is way cheaper today than it was only a few years ago. Invitae does it for $250 (+  $ 125 if you do not have a referral and need to use one of their doctors) . I would not want to stay with the doubt. \n\nThere is no difference in intelligence between Nf1 population and general population. That myth comes from when Nf1 patients were recruited from mental institutions and hospitals decades ago. Some of us have learning difficulties which can be often overcome with proper intervention. The type of mutation also play a role with this with microdeletionshaving more significant learning difficulties. \n\nWith a very few exceptions, there is no genotype-phenotype, meaning the way the mutation manifests itself in the mother might be very different than the way it will present in the child. \n\nThe genetic test exists, it is a great tool and with all we are learning about Nf1 in the recent years, if one has it, it is good to know it early on. My daughter is very intelligent (straight A\u2019s, third grade) and was born with CAL spots. She was diagnosed through a genetic test. Up until now, she has had no issues with the NF and had no other symptoms. I have been told that there is absolutely no way to predict how it will affect my daughter as she grows up, but that finding a good physician who is knowledgeable in NF is key. I was not diagnosed until my 30s, when my son was diagnosed with it and had severe complications from it. I literally came out of the womb with spots is having freckles on the body an indicator of NF for a 6 year old? freckles are on the back and hand and leg. no spots though. the child probably has about 5 freckles. not sure if it is because this child plays in the sun a lot. It is different indeed! I have had some struggels with school butt some subject I was really good at but I really hear from doctors it is different for every person indeed nf1 is something soooo wide and different Hearing this is promising.  My 14-month old was diagnosed at the beginning of this year.  So far she is okay and her neurologist is pleased with her development.  She does however, have many CALS that she was born with and that have come up throughout the year. Cute", "Neurofibroma in my mouth? Well, this has been an unexpected turn of events. For most of my life (I am a man in my late 40s), I have had a relatively mild case of NF1. Some cafe au lait spots, bumps under my skin here and there, mild scoliosis. I had what doctors said was an unrelated benign brain tumor in college, but other than that, not much to write home about.\n\nNow, in the past few years - and especially in the last month - it seems like things are breaking down. I had a fibroma grow on the roof of my mouth (that is weird, right?) that they removed a couple of days ago. I am waiting on test/biopsy/etc results. But it will likely grow back, right?\n\nI have not talked to anyone about next steps, if any, etc. Since my NF has been so minor, I have typically just monitored it with my primary care doc, MRIs, etc... and do not have a neurologist I trust. That, of course, needs to change.\n\nAnyone else later in life have increasing symptoms? Yup...49 developed foot drop from a neurofibroma on my lumbar spine and my right arm is getting all weird due to one on my cervical spine. Seeing a specialist in Boston next week. I am sorry this is happening. I am in my 30's and things have been okay since I had brain surgery about 15 years ago.  I hate that something like this can happen so quickly. I think i have one on my mouth too, on the inside of my right cheek. I havent been checked out in a long time, i think ill try around late October. I will be 29 on Monday and my NF has not really effected me much\n.... Hopefully it does not. There are a few under the skin that bother me. I had one that grew to about the of s kidney bean on the inside of my cheek. I bit it half way off once and ended up in urgent care to stitch it back in place until I could see an oral surgeon to have it removed.\n\n\nIt sucks. Fuck! 31 here. Have not had any particular worsening of symptoms/presentations. Case has been mild thus far. Have had a few removed over the years - first one was at 24 years of age. Mostly cosmetic.\n\nDoes anyone have symptoms of pain all over their body from these effed-up nerve endings presenting wherever and whenever they want? Sometimes I have mild pains that do not seem entirely attributable to one cause (a sprain or a knot in a muscle or whatever). Does the one in your mouth hurt? I know what you mean about the others being a bother but I am able to live with them. They re-attached the severed neurofibroma?!? Why could not they excise the whole thing right then and there? Because I live in an extremely rural area and have what I call a \"bandaid hospital.\" They basically bandage you so you do not die and then ship you off to somewhere else.  The Dr who stitched me fully admitted he had to leave the room to look up What NF even was. It does not, but i bite it every once in a while.... i did not realize I had one until about a month ago. I did not think it was possible to grow inside my mouth. The one on my jaw hurts a little. I think they can happen literally anywhere that there are nerves", "For those of you that have family who are always asking how you are feeling cause they of course are concerned, do you ever lie and tell them you are feeling ok even though you are really suffering?  Yes.\nI do not need their worrying and/or nagging I always try to be honest personally. They can sense when you are down, so no point lying about it. I feel guilty for being sick sometimes All the time. I lie cause I do not want to upset them and I feel guilty that they worry and/or stress over me I perfectly understand. However, having this condition is a lot to bare on your own. Do not feel guilty about needing someone to share the load. Even here. You are not alone. I know, but if I complain to my parents that I am not feeling well, or even just tell them that I am not feeling well, I know they really worry about me and stress over it. And my sister tells me that the fact that they stress is my fault, because I \"make everything about me\". I really think she is been jealous her entire life that I have been sick, and I have always received a lot of attention over it.  I have also been forgiven by my parents for my past drug problems that steamed from pain pills after my surgeries. She is never done a drug ever Both situations need to be addressed. It is possible that she felt left out. Many siblings of children with conditions do. Not to mention that parents can feel burned out or insufficient. Consider talking to them, getting it all out in the open. If not, counseling is always an option. More and more NF centres have specialized therapists or counselors that have experience.", "Greetings to everyone Currently living in NYC im 26 Male, I have been diagnosed with NF type 1 since I was child back in my home country. I also suffer from Scoliosis.\nGrowing up everything was alright until I hit my 20s when a tumor grew on my back and caused a high pressure on my spinal cord in my Cervical area that caused me the inability of walking, few months later I was able to perform multiple surgery to remove the tumors ( C3 to C7 ) and adjust my scoliosis ( C2 to T11 ) to release the pressure, and gain back my walking \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd Hello, I also have NF1 and scoliosis.

I wore a back brace from ages 5 to about 12ish. I have been lucky enough to avoid any kind of back surgeries besides some spinal tapes that were done as a baby. I was in a very similar situation, tumors on C2-C7, could not walk. Had surgery a year ago and have been doing well since!

I have a question for the people who had already the vaccin. Is it safe? In my country they say it is and do trust it but I am curious like did you get ill or not at all? I know it is different for every person but I wanted to know how it was for you people. Hello, I had the two doses of Pfizer and was absolutely fine. My arm hurt a bit on the day of the first dose, but a very low pain, no need to take painkillers. \n\nI was told the second dose might make me feel ill, but this was not the case at all. That was weeks ago and I am doing great. Got it months ago. No issues. I had no problem with it No problems here at all, nor for my son who is your age also with NF1. I do not believe there are any reported complications that could be traced to NF. You will be safer with the vaccine than without! Got moderna soar arm on 1st dose, mild fever for few days on the 2Nd. That was to be expected . No complications taken months ago I got my second one from Pfizer in februari,  nothing but a sore are and a little fatigued ( totally normal side effect) My husband got his in April and had no problems with either dose (Pfizer). 2x Astrazeneca for me and absolutely zero side effects. Not even a sore arm Hi there, I had the 2x doses of the Pfizer vaccine. I am feeling fine. One side effect I did not expect is a large reduction in anxiety. I asked my Neurofibromatosis specialist and he said it was safe, so that is the only reason why I got it. I was very hesitant as well. I can tell you, it will likely be the only Covid shot I will ever get. I would however talk it over with your doctor and see what they have to say, I do not know if you have any other conditions aside from Neurofibromatosis. My dad has a very rare autoimmune condition that attacks his kidneys and causes all sorts of issues, he was really sick back in 2019. His doctor told him not to get the Covid shot, because of concern of it triggering one of his episodes. \n\nYour doctor should be able to answer any question or concerns you have. I had some body aches the following day, but nothing bad enough to affect my work or anything. You might want to stay home the next day just in case, but any effects likely will not have anything to do with the NF. It is 100% safe. I had Moderna, and apart from the usual side effects that everybody gets, I was fine. Got that moderna..did not even get sick from the second shot\n\n(unlike pretty much everyone I know)\n\ngo get stabbed by that needle.. I have had both doses of the Moderna vaccine. I felt a little sick after the second but I was also less than 4 months since my last Radiation treatment from lung cancer caused by NF.\n\nGet the shot. I received the Moderna shot. The first round left me with a soar arm. The second shot left me with a mild fever but fatigued the next day. But after that I was fine. I had both doses of pfizer and had no issues at all. It is completely safe. I had both doses and had no side effects other than sore arm. Just hydrate a lot, both before and afterwards.  Also, NF alone will not impact your response to the vaccine. Its fine. I got Pfizer #1 and the worst I had was my arm feeling heavy about 10h later. By morning next day it was over. It is 100% safe. I had the AZ one and no issues at all.", "Disability pension Is anyone in Australia on the disability pension due to NF ? Just curious", "Nervous I have NF1 and was diagnosed pretty much at birth. I have  A LOT of cafe aut le spots. I have a lot of Migraines that cause absence seizures. I am working on the migraines. Anyway, I have a coffee colored fibroma (maybe?) Or tumor on my belly. I have had it my whole life but in the past year it has doubled in size (used to be dime- nickel sized now bigger than a quarter). It also used to be one spot now it looks like 3. I finally got it looked at and its scheduled to be removed in June. I am nervous because its my first one being removed and my first surgery. The doctor is confident in being able to remove it all to prevent it from growing back. \n\nI just dont know what to expect after removal. I have never really had medical attention for my NF before. I have had four surgeries related to my Neurofibromatosis to remove tumors. In 2001, 2006, 2014 and 2018. They were all successful. Recovery time varied for each of them as they were different types of surgeries in different location and done for different reason. I had not had any done on my belly. All mine were done on my right lower arm, cervical spine, right upper leg and then right upper arm. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. The only one I had removed was from my belly, a few inches below my belly button. That was 15 years ago and it is never grown back. I just have a scar that is 2-2.5 inches long but not super noticeable, definitely less so than the fibroma was. I got it removed purely for cosmetic reasons and I am very happy I did. I never had spots removed, but plenty of tumors. everything is locally anethesized.  \n\nYou should not feel anything other than the prick from needle, and the doc touching you where he cuts. They may prescribe you painkillers to take for when it starts to awaken. They will also give you instructions on how to clean and change your bandages your newly acquired scar.  \n\nI know it looks scary, but there is very little to be afraid of. One thing that happens is that the MRI does not show the true size of the tumor. Often the tumor is very very compacted and swell once they are removed from the body. \nTumors often grow back but, depending on your age, at a slower different rate. They are just not as noticeable.", "For anyone who is curious of what it looks like once you have had a fibroma removed. This was done by a plastic surgeon, on a small fibroma and the scars will obviously vary due to how big it is.

As a future treatment for nf1 I would check with the nf network  There is a drug that was approved by the fda to help shrink tumors. Right now it is only been approved for children, but for adults a persons doctor may be able to get permission approval to be used with their adult patients. That is what my doctor is doing, I do have to have some tests done which will all be done in January (minded nothing in my state gets shut down again) Koselugo can be approved for payment benefits. Can you post the info on said drug here? Would like to pass it along to my mom to see if her doctor can get her on it.  Thank you! Best wishes for your treatment; this is a fucked up disease.

Since then (4 years), he is grown into it a little more (dropped to 90th percentile). I do. I call it my fivehead, because it is bigger than a forehead.

My focus was better and things were just easier. I had 5 AP classes senior year and I did fine with them.  Did you do have any medications during school that you changed or are not taking any more?  My son is in second grade and I would love more information about what he might struggle with. I did not take any medications while in school. Has your son been tested for any learning disabilities? Has he mentioned anything he might be struggling with? This is a great subreddit if you are looking for peoples experiences as nf can vary significantly from person to person.  For sure. I have been half lurking for years. He is been being seen at the nf clinic for several years. He was diagnosed at three and he is almost nine now. No tumors that we know of yet but definitely has trouble learning although he is been getting better. Communication has been hard for him, he has always known he knew what was going on but he just did not speak and now his speech is finally getting better. He is has a adhd diagnosis but I am not sure how much is due to misdiagnosis on the nf side plus just being a boy. I had trouble in high school but only with some things as I have gotten older it is not as much as a learning disability is a emotional detachment I just do not process things the same way I used to I do have a tumor on my brain which is probably the cause my biggest issue is my knee I have a whole bunch of the tumors on my knee and a huge birthmark and it retains fluid sometimes it is really hard to walk or it just starts hurting for no reason Wish you the best of luck hope your son has a light case they can be rough I was diagnosed when I was 9 with a learning disability and 15 for neurofibromatosis, I am 35 now, but I feel my learning disability has pretty much stayed the same.

I had a small pea sized neurofibroma removed from my scalp, my dermatologist thought it would be a pilar cyst but it turned out to be a neurofibroma.\n\nI have had what I thought were swollen lymph nodes in my neck for a long time, however, i am now thinking they might be more neurofibromas. \n\nMy doctor ordered a CT scan to check if they are cysts/tumors/lymph nodes/etc. Should I avoid the CT scan and opt for an ultrasound or MRI or doing it this once for diagnosis purposes should be fine? You should do what the doctor feels is best. Different areas of the body, require different scans to get a better image of what is going on. I have had MRIs and CT scans. get the scan.. \n\nits not going to make anything worse. Get the ct scan, it is quick and noiseless.

Is a non invassive technique. \n\nI am not from US, Maybe is very expensive? I do not know what is the reason that makes you doubt  but the neck is an area that I would keep an eye on. Specially if the technique is safe and harmless CT scans expose you to a lot of radiation (more so than MRIs and Ultrasounds) so that is probably where the concern lies. Yeah, but this is not dangerous. Is not a every-day-test. Is like women that refuse  mammography because the radiaton. Is more dangerous do not scan that scan. Even if you go every year For sure! CT scan is not that harmful. Its radiation (electron) is less than a day exposure to sunlight. CT scan will show bones, I do not think it will show anything for Neurofibroma (soft tissue). Doctor might want to see if there is any bone deform (only reason I could think of if my doctor asked me). Ultrasound will show everything. This is completely wrong. CT scans of different regions have different doses of radiation. A head CT gives a dose of radiation equivalent to about 8-9 months of background radiation (the level of ionizing radiation you are exposed to by being on the earth for a day). A CT abdomen and pelvis gives about 3 years of background radiation. These are not trivial doses. Comparing doses of ionizing radiation to a day of sunlight is not a common standard.\nCT scans can image large tumors, or identify areas with calcification (tumors often have such changes).\nUltrasound has many limitations and will not \"show everything\". \nMRI is the best modality in most cases for finding or monitoring neurofibromas, but this is a more expensive imaging study. Can you cite the source ?\n\nAs I have said earlier soft tissue will show up better with ultrasonography than in X ray (2D) (CT scan use the same technology , but one can get 3d view)\n\nI have worked in medical field for few years. I will cite sources for the estimates of background radiation from imaging.\n\nRadiologyinfo.org/en/info/safety-xray\n\nNcbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4635397\n\nIt is odd you ask me for sources, but then you reference your previous comment as if it is equivalent. Can you see how had I done the same, knowledge would not advance? You asked me for additional labor, but provide no sources of your own. \n\nI also have worked in the medical field for at least a few years - as a physician.

If a parent has NF1, will their kids only be at risk of inheriting NF1, or could they instead have NF2 or schwannomatosis? \n\nThanks for any insight you can give me. If a parent has NF1 their children will have a 50% chance of also having NF1.\n\nA parent with NF1 can not \"pass on\" NF2 or Schwannomatosis, likewise a parent with a NF2 will not pass on NF1 to a child. All three are geneticly different disorders with similar symptoms. Ctf.org will be a good place to start Okay, thank you. One doctor thinks my aunt has NF2 (my mother has NF1) but I was not sure it worked like that. No one else in our family has NF. We are from a small town and my mom is the only NF patient doctors have ever seen here. Both forms NF1/NF2 are autosomal dominant which means they can be passed on directly from one parent to the child, there is no such thing as a \"carrier\" gene, nor is it possible for it to \"skip a generation\". As previously mentioned the two are completly different disorders both resulting from mutations on two different chromosomes so its not possible for one to change into the other or for a parent with one to directly pass on the other to a child.\n\nI am repeating myself a little here mostly just to emphasize that one of those two diagnoses are almost certainly incorrect.\n\nThat said, there are a couple of ways for it to be possible for your mother to have NF1 and your aunt have NF2.\n\nObjectively speaking and not to imply anything about your specific family, but the first possibility would be the revelation that they actually are not related (or are half siblings) and each had their respective disorder passed on from the unrelated parent. This would be a pretty crazy and unlikely coincidence, but technically not mathematically impossible. Unless there is any other reason to think that they are not related I would not even given this possiblity much  thought. The second option is that not all cases of NF are inherited from the parent. A large number are spontaneous mutations in which neither parent has the disorder and the child ends up with it anyway by genetic lottery. That is my case, neither of my parents have it, but I do. It would again be highly unlikely and an almost unbelievable amount of coincidence, but it is possible that both sisters spontaneously mutated different forms, completly unreleated to the other. (Also possible, but highly unlikely would be that one of their parents had it but was never diagnosed passed on one form to one child and did NOT pass it on to the other sister, but she had a spontaneous mutation of the second form)\n\nThe simplest and most likely explanation is your aunt actually has NF1 (or your mother has NF2) They are half siblings lol. But my mother definitely has NF1. There is no question there. She is a textbook case of it. When I saw my NF doctor she said so so many parents came in with a kid that had a \u201cspontaneous\u201d case and then the grandmother was sitting there covered in lumps and turns out she was just never diagnosed.

But it is not a brain tumor in the way people generally think or relate to brain tumors so I do not think it is useful to classify them that way. My son has optic pathway gliomas as well; in NF1 they are generally pretty stable. Yes it is a brain tumor, my son has one as well. **TECHNICALLY** yes but its considered very low grade and in most cases does not change. My daughter has one, its been stable for 4 years. It did cause some damage to the nerve but has not grown or changed since we found it in 2017.", "Did /do I have NF? I am 23. When I was a hit 6, I had a brain MRI, it said no findings, according to records, but I was also taken to an NF clinic. From what my parents said, they said someone said something about it, and ordered the MRI, and I just went for a follow up. I never knew what this was until I checked my medical records. I have no symptoms of it, but I am wondering why they tested me for it. After that follow up from the MRI, I never went back. My parents really do not remember much since it was so long ago, so I am assuming it was not anything. I have zero symptoms, except for being near sided, which everyone in my family is. Idk man k man Go to a doctor for a follow up, that is the only way to be sure.  I have NF type 1, if you have type 1 you will usually have cafe au lait spots and neurofibromas on various places on your body. Yeah, I do not have any of those. Like I said, the MRI said no findings at all. Bro if you do not have symptoms you most likely do not have it.\nSomething probably happened when you were a kid to make them think you had it but obviously got the all clear.\n\nDo not stress To my knowledge an MRI would not be used to diagnose NF, only to determine potential severity/effects of the disease. You will not know if you have it unless you get tested for it. No one in this sub will be able to diagnose you. If you really want to know, talk to your doctor and go get tested. To get a definitive answer, you need to get a genetic test. I would talk to your primary care doctor. You need to go to a doctor to determine that. I myself was not diagnosed until I was 15, but I was tested before that and results were inconclusive. I think you are letting Dr. Google get into your head, see a doctor bud we cannot diagnose you this is not meant to sound condescending, what do you mean \u201csomeone said something about it\u201d if it was a Rando they are assholes who should not repopulate.

I honestly have no idea what to do or say to her. \nCan someone tell me how to cheer her up, how did you deal with such news?\nAlso I understand different types of NF can have different consequences, so to what extent will nf2 affect my niece?\nFinally, can nf2 develop into nf1? NF2 cannot develop into NF1. It does not work like that. They are different conditions.\n\nUnfortunately there is no good way to predict the severity of her progression. It could be mild her whole life or it could be very severe. Just know that there are lots of great specialists out there, and there has been a lot of recent progress with drug therapies. Can you provide more information about recent progress. Unfortunately my family does not live in a developed country so we have to go abroad for her treatment and information is difficult to get. Unfortunately if you have nf 2 it can develop backwards into nf 1. I was diagnosed with nf 1 when I was 15 and will always have Nf1. All you can do is be there for her and be supportive. Neurofibromatosis is not easy and unfortunately it can get progressively worse, some will have a light to mild case, while other like me will have a more severe case. If you have any questions let me know, This is not true, I am sorry. It is possible that you were originally misdiagnosed, but NF2 and NF1 are completely different genes. I have asked a medical professional about this. I would check out the CTF homepage, which has a whole section dedicated to research. Again, it will be completely individualized, but in general many cancer drugs have been shown to also work on benign tumors of NF2. Sorry that was a typo, I know it cannot. The cases of NF2 vary so widely (much like NF1). I was diagnosed with NF2 at 12 (23M now). I have had about 20 surgeries and lost my hearing (I now wear a cochlear implant), majority of use in my left arm. Not to scare you but I am kind of in the middle of the extremes. \n\nI know of some people who have mild cases and severe cases. \n\nI took part in the clinical studies of Avastin to treat NF2 when I was 13. It is not a cure but has been shown to stop tumor growth. I recently got back on it (it is a form of chemotherapy btw) \n\nAs for dealing with it, that is a tough one. I seem to deal with my circumstances better then my parents/family have. Mine was a spontaneous mutation and there was nothing they could do. My parents have a lot of anger but I have found peace in acceptance and gratitude. \n\nI have had many times in my life where my family admitted defeat and did not push me to do better because they did not think I was capable. Please do not do this. Always tell her she CAN do it because when you tell someone they cannot, the mind stops thinking of ways to overcome it. \n\nThere is a NF2 clinic in Massachusetts (if you are in the US). The head doctor is Dr. Plotkin. I highly recommend your sister reach out to them, I traveled from STL to them. This is how I have found my doctors in St. Louis and it is so important to see people who truly understand the condition. My first brain surgery was a bust because I had not been under the care of people who knew about such a rare disease.  \n\nThere are a couple groups on facebook that are for people and family members with NF2. \nNF2 crew &amp;\nNF2 crew - Just us\nThese groups are a wealth of knowledge and any questions she has they can answer or recommend doctors who can answer it. The groups can be raw and a lot of sad stuff but she needs to be strong for her daughter. \n\nDo not hesitate to DM me. \nMuch love At first she got a cataract in one of her eyes. We took her to France for further investigation. They did an MRI and the diagnosis was NF2. There are about 3-4 different drug trials going on that can reduce tumor growth by 20-40%, but unfortunately many of these trials do prefer that patients in the trials live close to where ever the trials are taking place, because of all the extra tests (blood work, MRIs and xrays) they do along with the drug they give each patient.  Unfortunately I cannot help with how to deal with the emotional and such parts.....we have had to deal with these things in our family and it is not easy. You do what you have to do.\n\nOthers have answered the NF1 question. \n\nNo, NF2 is completely different.\n\nI am going to make an assumption that you came here for the truth - what you pass on and how people deal with things is another subject.\n\nIF, and that is a qualified IF, your niece was diagnosed fully (DNA) and it was done due to symptom (as opposed to accidentally discovering it), then that is usually not a good sign. That is, cases which are diagnosed early (&lt;20) tend to be more severe, which is why they are expressing early.\n\nI am not a doctor but this information is available in the studies. BUT, you need to know more. ...even from afar they should be able to tell what type of NF2 is present. There are differences in the aggressiveness of various types. Well, that is slightly good news. That is  - I asked this on my post above. You see - many people WOULD be diagnosed early (even at 5) but since major symptoms often do not show up until later, they are not.\n\nThinking back,  our family member had a lazy eye and had to wear a patch for 6 months when she was 7. Likely it was related but we never knew....because no MRI was ever done. \n\nIt may be - that once they figure out the \"type\" that the best course of action is to do nothing for a couple decades! I am glad we did not find out until our family member was 22 since it only would have caused worry and maybe intervention which would not have done anything!\n\nGood Luck! My niece also was diagnosed with neurofibromatosis and my sister is taking it hard. The only I can do is help with a go fund me page to help with medical and travel expenses and I go with her to help keep her calm and she calls me all the time and I let her vent so she has a release. The only thing I know to do is just be there for her. I am trying to move closer to her but financially cannot right now but will bettors be there to physically help her out.", "My NF is getting so complicated no \"regular\" doctors will touch anything without word from an NF specialist That is all.\n\nGod it is annoying!\n\nMy spine has so many tumors that my pain management doctor is super hesitant to do anything more, and said he will not do an epidural until he has full details from the NF clinic It is for good reason. These tumors are complicated and a doctor who is not familiar can make big mistakes.\n\nMy first surgery to remove a nf tumor when I was in high school actually lied to my parents and myself saying he had removed nf tumors and was very familiar with it, but when he cut open my arm and saw how bad it was... Anyways after the surgery he told my mom he would never again do surgery on me again. For six months my arm was numb and turned a shade of green.\n\nSince then we have only used surgeons recommended by my nf specialist who diagnosed me when I was 15. I had tumors removed from my cervical spine in 2006. I spent about a week in the hospital and two weeks resting at home.  Now for pain my specialist prescribed two pain medication, but now he is only in charge of one of them, while my primary doctor has taken over the other one. If you have question, please ask. I understand why they do it.  It is just exhausting having to play racquetball with my health! \n\nIt will not be until the beginning of December that anything can be done about my pain beyond rest. Have you tried icy/hot patches? I know those helped me with severe pain I was having from a cancerous nf tumor until I was able to have it removed. It might be worth a shot to try those. I think each patch last for 6 hours and depending on where the pain is coming from you might be able to cut the patch in half to help save on cost. There is a prescription for those, but I know my insurance did not cover them. I was able to get a couple samples from the hospital otherwise the ones you can get from the store work good too. I have lidocaine patches and menthol creme that helps a bit, but it is hard to massage the creme into my spine LOL Yeah, rubbing cream on your back can be difficult especially when there is no one else around to help you. One other thing aside from medication that can help some is soaking in a hot bath with epson salt. \n\nI hope that your able to see a nf doctor soon to figure things out. I guess I was lucky that my parents with the help of my pediatrician we are able to find one when I was 15 and he is continued to see me ever since he diagnosed me. \n\nI do understand your pain though with the whole system. While my problems are not really doctor related. My doctors have my back, my problem has been with my insurance. They like me to stay within my state and not go out of state even though I have been seeing this doctor for years. They even denied my last surgery back in 2018 the day of even when my surgeon explained to them over the phone the importance of the surgery. He told my mom and I whomever he spoke with was pretty much being a jerk. I ended up having to appeal it and did win and was able to have the surgery a week or so later.", "what to expect? Hi! Im F18 and at a doctors visit today for a knee injury my dr saw my large amount of coffee coloured birthmarks and has referred me to a hospital to get tested for neurofibromatosis, the test is not for several weeks yet, but i would like to know what i can expect to be told. I have several of the symptoms of it, like obviously the birthmarks, i get frequent unexplained pins and needles, often my entire leg or the back of my head and some others i cant recall right now. But if anyone can provide me with some advice/experiences that could make this potential diagnosis less upsetting that would be awesome I have NF1 and probably severe scoliosis because of this.. A lot of caf\u00e9 au lait mark and a lot of nerofibroms on torso. I live a normal life as anyone else with scoliotic surgery. If you will see me fully clothed you will recognise nothing about me being NF1, maybe medical specialist may have some suspicion. Neurofibromatosis can effect everyone differently. I myself was not diagnosed until I was 15. I am 38 now, for me I have tumors all throughout out my body. I do have some balance issue, pain in mostly my legs and back. I have had four surgeries related to my Neurofibromatosis to remove tumors. \n\n1. 2001 to remove tumors on my lower right arm this was removed as a percatioun \n\n2. 2006 to remove tumors that were pressing against my cervical spine. Had these not been removed I could have woken up one morning unable to move out of bed.\n\n3. 2014 to remove cancerous tumors from my right upper leg. The tumor also caused a lot more pain than I was used to.\n\n4. 2018 to remove cancerous tumors from my right upper arm. The tumors like the ones in my leg ago caused a lot of pain.\n\nIf you have any questions let me know. When you say \u201cremoved cancerous tumors\u201d does that mean you went through chemotherapy or did you remove them early enough not to have chemo?\n\nDo you see a neurologist? \nI am seeing an epilepsy specialist currently, I was officially diagnosed at 23 but my old neurologist told me \u201cit is nothing to worry about\u201d when he saw the bump on my foot and me telling him \u201cdoctors had a suspicion when I was younger, but I was never fully tested for it\u201d I had surgery to remove them. I have been told by my specialist who is a neurologist (his thing is Neurofibromatosis) that for the types of tumors I have that chemo and radiation can actually make my condition worse and I would only ever have it if there was no choice and I needed to have it.\n\nWith my last surgery there was some thought that I may need to chemo done, but they would not know until they opened up my arm to remove the tumor. They could not tell by the mri scan, whether the tumor was wrapped around my sensory nerve or my median nerve. Thankfully it was my sensory nerve. Had it been my median nerve, then I was told I would likely need another surgery to help get movement with my hand and then may need chemo. Since it was my sensory I did not need any of that and I was actually able to go home hours after my surgery and not stay at the hospital.", "Koselugo and Covid Booster shot I am a 47-year-old male and I am lucky enough to take Koselugo. Since we are still in the middle of a pandemic, I decided to get the covid vaccine shots. My doctor suggested that I get the booster shot sooner rather than later. I walked into my local CVS and got it with no problem. Yesterday evening, my body started to ache and I did not sleep well. I am resting today and going back to work tomorrow. If you are an adult and using Koselugo be mindful of the covid vaccine and ask your doctor first. The aching is a side effect of the vaccine. A handful of people I knew had it so I do not think it is tied to Koselugo", "What now? Soo I know I have posted here and have gotten MULTIPLE replies and havent responded to all of them, I have been so busy it is not even funny, but I cant shake my thoughts.\n\nSo my visit with my neurologist ended with me feeling empty and mournful. The conclusion of my recent full spinal and brain MRI was that I basically have a severe form of this disorder. My neurologist said that in his time working with NF2, I take part of the cake for having one of the most severe forms. I asked him questions like, \"Am I in danger of becoming a paraplegic? Quadriplegic? Feeding tube? Trach?\" And the list went on... Basically, the answers were yes all around. I have spinal tumors as big as 5cm, filling my spine. Some compressing, displacing or widening my spinal cord. The doctor doesnt want to even touch them UNTIL they start causing major symptoms. Which pisses me off because I do not want to lose a major function that I happen to LOVE doing before they decide to do something. One is growing in to the bone in my lumbar spine. I have one behind my pelvis. I am hardly worried about my brain tumors anymore. \n\nI will begin Avastin as soon as I establish an oncologist in Springfield, MO, home base. I am also looking in to John Hopkins and Mass General for a second opinion. Does anyone go to these hospitals? Any success with spinal tumor shrinkage with avastin? (Long shot hope, I know they are meant more for vestibluar schwannomas) Does anyone else have a severe form of this? My son has been taking avastin for NF1, optic pathway gliomas. Goes every two weeks or so, infusions last about half hour, no major side effects. Most recent MRI shows some shrinkage (I think they said the tumors look \u201dless puffy\u201d, but he is also on a MEK inhibitor that his team seems very excited by (Trametinib/ Mekinist), so it is hard to say what is doing what. Mass General is great. I was the 2nd person with NF2 to go on Avastin (back in 2007). It helped with my VSs, and they have been making improvements since then. Dr. Plotkin is one of the best NF2 doctors in the world.\n\nIf you are looking at JHU, I know Dr. Blakeley is very very good, although I have never seen her. She might be at NIH, right near JHU. I am so desperate to get on one of those drugs, it is terrifying that doctors want to wait till something goes wrong. In 2006 I have two tumors pressing against my cervical spine. I was told if they were not removed I could wake up one morning and not be able move my legs, so the tumors were removed. \n\nThere are a few different trials going on that can shirk tumors, they are showing 20-40% shrinkage, but if the tumors are pressing against your spine. They really should be removed. If I were you I would look for a second opinion on a surgeon who is familiar with Neurofibromatosis and works on the spine. The surgeon who did mine at the University of Chicago was awesome. I would absolutely ask for a second opinion. And a third. Maybe a fourth. I go to MGH and it is a wonderful hospital. I see Dr.Bradley Welling who I cannot recommend enough. And absolute amazing doctor both medically and just a wonderful person. Best of luck to you unfortunately, we have lots of experience (20+ years with our family member) in most all matters of NF2. Been there and done that....most of it.\n\nListen. Carefully.\n\nMGH is probably the go-to place for getting your entire case managed. You can probably do some remote appointments (send MRI's there, etc.). There is no need for a \"3rd opinion\" if you get the combo of MGH docs to look at your case (Plotkin, Curry, etc. if surgeries are indicated). \n\nWhen it comes to actual surgeries, they should only be done at one of a handful of places - MGH being one. House Ear in LA may be another and Johns Hopkins may be good also - but some of the best docs come and go, so you may have to keep up on things. All in all, MGH is probably the one to have if you are going to have just one go-to for everything.\n\nNow, onto \"cures\". There are none. The trial drugs are shots in the dark. Sure, they have to try things....in order to put them in the \"does not work\" pile. But, please, do not consider anecdotes and personal experiences as facts. If anything truly worked, it would be approved for such.\n\nThe truth of the matter is that no surgery should be had before its time. This is a very basic part of NF2 management. It was explained to us long ago as \"those tumors could be as big as a baseball or bigger and if they are not hurting anything else, do not touch them\".\n\nSo, your doc is correct about no operations (usually) until symptomatic.\n\nAs far as \"worst cases\", this usually depends on the type AND on the age when it is first diagnosed. Those who exhibit symptoms in their early teens are often sad cases if they have the aggressive form. On the other hand, those who do not discover tumors until their 20's (maybe losing hearing, etc.) often go for many decades without having many of the problem you mention - deafness being perhaps the most common effect and then balance issues, walking issues, etc. - but many of our cohorts from the old NF2 lists (1998) are still around.\n\nOur family members has those hundreds of tumors - spine, brain, etc. - but still is considered not to have the most aggressive type.\n\nWow, so much to type...but one little story. When we first found out about it we went to a well known national hospital that claimed to know all.  The surgeon there wanted to operate and he listed out ALL the stuff you did that would likely be the result (problems!). We left....and found the NF2 lists and ended up going to LA for one surgery, to NYC for another and to MGH since. Now it is 20 years later and despite all the surgeries and problems our family member is still swallowing....no life support systems, etc.\n\nThe real moral of NF2, IMHO, is not to be too active in trying to \"fix\" it. There is some indication that certain hormones might spur tumor growth...so be careful with your body (a female may want to think hard about BC pills or getting pregnant).\n\nNote - I am not a doctor....but my track record has been very good based on all the help from the top patients (NF2 lists, etc.) and top doctors. We were lucky enough to have the \"original\" - Mia from MGH and also some of the \"stars\" like the folks from House Ear and Fred Epstein (RIP) in NYC.\n\nGood Luck. The Docs are giving you the correct advise since surgery is both more dangerous and almost always has lasting effects (neuropathy, deafness and more). It is hard to change your mind from a \"got to get rid of it\" type of outlook like when you have cancer....to this, where tumors are totally benign. I visit Johns Hopkins every 6 months and both Dr. Blakely and Nurse Practitioner Shannon Langmead are very good. Neurosurgery at JHU is rated #1 in the country.", "I have a son with NF1 Decided to join this sub-reddit since my son has NF1. \n\nHe was diagnosed at the age of two in 2010 and has since received treatment for a brain tumor on his Optic Glioma. \n\nI remember how overwhelming everything was when he was diagnosed so I figured I would make this post just to answer questions or be here in support of any parents going through the same thing.

Im kind of dumb so can someone explain to me how this works lol  If you get a donor egg and sperm from someone who does not have NF. You can have genetic testing done, which allows the doctor to know which embryos have it. They do not use any that have it. That Is awesome. Ive always dreamed ive being a dad and thought a few years I shouldnt because of my nf. Hearing this is like a dream come true. I completely understand. My husband has NF and we  are just starting the IVF process. It is a little bit daunting because there is no guarantee that we will end up having a child (some people go through multiple cycles), but we are hoping it will work. I am 32 weeks with an IVF baby. The process is called PGT - Preimplantation Genetic Testing (sometimes called PGD - D being Diagnosis). After fertilization in the lab, they let the embryos grow for 5-6 days and then biopsy a few cells from each. They test those for the mutation and then can put a healthy embryo back in. I had no idea this was possible! \n\nThis means my main rationalisation for not dating has now been debunked for all eternity. That is *one* way to avoid it. But you would not need to use donor cells for both. Just for the person that has NF. I had it done. My son is 5 months old and NF free. Congrats!! this comment made me happy &lt;3 Big congrats and best of luck to all of you! Thank you! Can this be done if the person who has NF is male Genuine question, if you know you have a genetic condition like this, why not adopt? Especially if you are not actually going to carry a pregnancy. There is so many kids out there ready made who would do anything for a home, surely helping one of them would be the greatest amount of good you could do with that decision, right? I understand where you are coming from, but for me I would find it difficult to keep up. If he/she ended up enjoying sports I could not help train, ect. But a biological kid could be the exact same. I want to adopt as well. But it would be nice to have a kid of my own. Im a male btw and the last person to carry on the family name so that is important to me Which is where my reluctance in both comes from And that is another big problem for me. I would feel terrible if I was the reason a fully healthy woman had to give up her dreams of having a fully healthy child. That is basically adoption. This is a major reason I am for genetic testing. I have very mild symptoms of NF1 but I worry that if I had kids they could get it worse than me. This would eliminate that risk. you can still date even if it were not possible. there are plenty of people out there who do not feel the need or desire to have children. myself and my wife are childfree. Yeah, perhaps I am just paranoid. Ok but if you have a birth certificate then your country already has a HUGE amount of data on you. You have a state-assigned number. Privacy from your government is a myth.\n\nBio kids personalities are not reliably predictable either. I am the oldest of 5 and we could not be more different from eachother, all we have in common is our nose. You have a better sense of an adopted child's personality because they are already here and you can hang out with them. Any kid can be rotten, so why take a gamble on a new one when there is millions already here who need love?\n\nAdoption is expensive but so is IVF, pregnancy, birth, and parenting.\n\nIt just seems immoral to me to bring a new life into the world when there is already so many lives who are in need of love and support, but there is people who decide it is too much hassle and too much cost to help them. ", "Do you consider your NF to be a disability? I know we have such a wide range in how NF impacts our lives.\n\nFor me, my NF makes fine motor significantly worse than \"normal\" to the point where people take notice and judge.  I just developed a hard lump in my thumb that when touched, causes my hand to become numb.  Unfortunately, it is right where scissors rest, and I worry I may need to relearn everything left handed.\n\nNF also causes pain along my spine and joints, where most of my plexiform tumors have taken up residence.  \n\nHeck, I am even starting oncology appointments in a few weeks...  I am terrified.\n\nBut even with all that,  I am not too sure where I stand.   NF is certainly causing me to struggle, but if I were to able for SSI disability, who knows.  I guess in the end, I do consider it to be disabling.\n\nHow do you feel about it?\n I have NF1 and I do not really see it as a disability. I hardly even think about it. I have had 27 brain surgeries but I do not get stressed about them. How has the recovery been from your brain surgeries? The recovery has been quick. I had two 9 years ago. I had a blood clot the Friday after surgery so I had another one that day to fix it. Went home day later and was back to normal activities a couple days later. No pain. I could have gone out that weekend but decided it would be best to stay home.  Not my NF, but I definitely have some complications that are. I would consider my nerve damage from a past surgery and scoliosis to be related issues, but they are the disability not the NF. From my understanding NF by itself is not considered a \"disability\" but you can list all of your issues caused by NF....but that could just be how it is in my state.  For me, I would not consider it a disability, it is a hindrance and another hurdle I have to jump over. But I think everyone has something they have to overcome and this is mine. \n\n I am fortunate to have a mild case, I have come to realize. But even this can be highly anxiety producing which is itself a disability. My dad died from complications to his NF when I was nine so that did a number on me. \n\nAnd so you all do not get too stressed it was more to do with a post-op infection that NF itself. \n\n Yes, I would.  More mentally though, I have dyslexia and a learning disability. I also have poor body coordination and balance.  I live a normal life but it has its own challenges.  With my balance and pain. I do  It limits me. I have weakness in my legs that makes it difficult to stand and sit for long period of time. I also have weakness in my arms. I have two cancerous tumors removed in the last four years, first in my right leg in 2014 and then this past April I had one removed from my right arm. In 2007 I have tumors removed from my spine that were pressing against it, if those had not been removed I could have woken up one morning and been unable to move. Thankfully they were able to remove it, I was however told I may need to have the surgery again in 15-30 years. And unfortunately I am starting to have some of the same symptoms that led to my doctors finding out I had tumor on spine. I am in the process right now of making an appeal with my medical insurance to be allowed to see my doctor who is in Chicago who has treated me and diagnosed me since I was 15. I was supposed to see him two weeks ago, but my insurance denied that request. \n\nI do walk with a limp, some days more then others and have pain and weakness, but I would prefer to be able to use my legs for as long as I can even limited.\n\nBecause of my Neurofibromatosis I have never been able to have a real job to earn a real living, I do work three days a week for three hours each at an after school care at my old elementary school. It sucks, I did try to get an actual job, but no one ever hired me. I even did a program where they did some job training it was supposed to last 10 weeks, but that program ended up getting canceled even before the 10 weeks were up. I did however learn I am not able to be on my feet for more then an hour and half, after that I would start to feel a pull in my leg and this was a couple years before I had surgery on my leg. I have NF2 and do not perceive it as a disability. I was diagnosed when I was 15 and have had multiple operations. In and of itself, it is not a disability as everyone is different. My father only has superficial nfs and he is fine. In my case, yes (chronic pain, migraines, two giant Optic gliomas that have made my vision so bad that if I loose my glasses I cannot leave the house, LD...) I did not think about that question at all until my work boss asked me if my NF1 was contagious.  Now, I pause.  I personally do not since my case is mild, but I worry that it may affect how people see me in the workplace. So you are saying that if you have NF there is a huge chance you may have or also develop anxiety? Oh god yes. My dad had it worse and a rather uncommon severity, but it was still  my benchmark. And you google it and see how bad it *could* get...pretty damn anxiety producing. \n\nEven after you push past the existential dread the inevitable question comes to mind: will anyone love me like that? Well I made zero effort to try for a long time. And once I finally did I learned that yes, someone will.  It very well could just because of it is side effects. I had no idea throughout school that all of my learning disabilities were attributed to it. It is just not a common disease which is the problem.

Thank you everyone and also if you want to join our discord group lmk! I have two different pain medication that I take twice a day. Now if this pain is new I would let your doctor know, they may want to do some MRIs, to make sure a tumor is not pressing against something it should not be. In 2006 I was having some issues with my back and some tingling in my feet, had an mri done and that showed that I have tumors pressing against my cervical spin. I am actually having an mri being done tomorrow of my cervical spine, to make sure all is okay. I was told that I would likely need surgery again as the tumors could grow back, in 2006 they said that it could be anywhere from 15-30 years. Hello!  I do not have advice for you but I would like to join your Discord group, please! I second on seeing your doctor. About two years ago I had really bad back pain. Like I could not even walk or sit. Turned out I have tumors wrapped around the bottom of my spine. I am on medication now and the pain is only mildly discomforting  I would like to join the discord too. And I did.

I know I am able to have ivf, but I also do not want to risk anything that may come with pregnancy. I am afraid of passing it on, but I am also afraid of what may happen to me during pregnancy due to the hormonal changes. \n\nI was just wondering for any advice or support to those who are feeling the same, felt the same or went through this before. You are not alone! I feel the same way.. scared to have kids. I am with a committed partner but I have the same fears as you. I never planned on having kids. If I had not had my first oops kid I would still be childfree to this day. Now we have two. So far no signs of nf in either but we will see i guess. There are methods of IVF that eliminate risk of nf in your kids\nDepends on your outlook and view on those methods. I ended up without having children for many reasons. My plan was if it came to question and I decide to become pregnant to go trough IVF with either testing the eggs or the embryos. I want kids but I do not know what my future boyfriend/husband wants because of NF Do you mind me asking if pregnancy caused your NF to flair up?\n\nAlso, sorry if this is personal but did your insurance cover IVF? I heard some people from Facebook groups were able to do that but I am not sure if that is common (I am in America). \n\nCost hopefully will not be a issue for me if I ever do get to the point where my partner and I want to have children, but it is still a worry in the back of my mind. My Fiance,now wife, before we got married, discussed this. I have NF1 and just based on my experience, the pain I suffer through everyday, the finger pointing because I have bumps on my arms and face. I decided, I did not want to take the risk and want my child to go through the same thing. My mother had NF1 and had thousands of visual tumors on her face,arms, etc... It did not really dawn on me, why people would always stare. I love mother who is now in heaven (1999) Congenital Heart Failure with NF1 the secondary factor.\n\nI chose to get a vasectomy at the age of 39 to prevent from having kids.\n\nSorry so long winded. I have never been pregnant and I will never be. I am getting too old now. (not old old but too old to want to get go trough pregnancy)\n\nI do not live in USA and I live in country with universal healthcare so, under some condition is most of the IVF costs covered. One of the condition is to be at least one day younger than 40 y/o. Some of the costs are not covered, I do not know which exactly but what I gathered it is \"better\" drugs, better growth medium for embryos and such. And only certain number of cycles is covered, I think 3 or 4.\n\nNumbers would not make sense to you, since living cost and incomes here are really different, let us say, that 1 uncovered cycle could be around 4-5 full average month incomes before taxes, maybe more depending on what kind of treatment and test is needed. It is not cheap for us even for you it would probably be for you insanely cheap.\n\nTo get some perspective, if I would pay in flat I live in the market rent (fortunately it is my parents's flat and I pay way less than market rent in exchange for upkeeping and paying for every repair and so) would be half of my month income after taxes and I have income slightly above the country average but under the capital city average and I live in 1 bedroom (+living room with attached kitchen) flat, which would not be enough for family with children. There are even more expensive. Estates got insanely expensive, like two bedroom 70 sqm flat on the outskirts would be for me more than 13 years of income before taxes and like full incomes, no food, no clothing, no transportation, nothing except this, after taxes it would be somewhere around 17-18 years. I am choosing to not have biological children and I am tiring my tubes this October. I did have a failed pregnancy that was not viable and I was only about 10 weeks along. I did not have any changes to my NF that I know of. After my mom had two kids she had flare ups. My biological sister also does not want kids. I would recommend talking with a genetic counselor, your partner, and a therapist. They can help you with you decision.  :) I absolutely share your views that we should avoid passing it to our children and we are lucky to have the options of IVF which will ensure that only nf1-free embryos will be implanted. \n\nFor a long time, it was believed that pregnancy would increase the number of neurofibromas. Well, a study looked deep into this, and the conclusions are that yes, we do increase them, but so do non pregnant nf1 women. \n\n\"Growth of plexiform and cutaneous neurofibromas in pregnant patients is not significantly different compared to non-pregnant patients. Cutaneous neurofibromas show a significant increase in growth over time in both, pregnant and non-pregnant patients and NF1 related clinical symptoms do not significantly aggravate during the course of pregnancy.\" \n\nThe passing of time is to blame Could Nf1 contribute to heart failure? Me I am I am scared that I will put myself at risk and possibly my child if I do decide to have one I think that your concerns are completely valid and way more common than you may think. I certainly have the same concerns; I am scared to be the direct reason for a potential offspring's suffering and am scared to make life hard for a fully healthy woman by making her a mother to a sick child.   \n\n\nI am much more comfortable and open about my condition now than I was many years ago, but I am still scared to even start dating because I am afraid my condition will be a deal-breaker (honestly, I would not blame a woman for thinking it is).   \n\n\nI would like to recommend journaling since it has had very positive effects on my own mental well-being.

I am pretty happy to see this sub actually exists! \n\nI am a (almost) 21 year old female and was diagnosed with NF 1 when I was really young. I am blessed to have a pretty mild form of NF, however, It was really hard for me to deal with as a young kid. I definitely have learning disabilities as a result of the condition and when I was younger I felt devastated over how hard it was for me to learn compared to my peers. Some of my worst memories involve math classes thought elementary and middle school. My learning difficulties were also compounded by the fact that I was not in a school that was able to accommodate my needs well at all. To be honest, I am still terrible at math but have managed to avoid it since high school. Honestly, I still am immensely insecure over my learning capabilities but have come a long way with my mindset and try to remember that I am indeed intelligent in a lot of ways. Another thing that I hated growing up were the cafe au lait spots. I genuinely thought that nobody would ever find me attractive because of them. Luckily, I realized how silly that was. I have even been complimented on them before by a partner! But I digress :) \n\nAnyway, I noticed I have been harboring some anxiety recently over not knowing if my condition is going to worsen as I get older. I am really scared I am going to develop tumors, cancer or other issues as a result of NF. I think I am just looking for some reassurance or personal experiences with mild cases of NF either getting worse, or remaining pretty docile into late adulthood.

I hope it is okay that I have a rant. I never really ever talk about it in detail because 99% of people have no clue. I have been in so much pain mentally and physically lately. The last couple months have been hell. I have not felt this lonely since I was at rock bottom of my drug addiction. \n  I am starting a pain patch and physical therapy soon but I am so tired of this NF stuff I am tired of the doctors. I am tired of being stabbed with needles and being put in tubes. I am tired of being scared that my scan is going to show cancer.\n  I am the only one in my family with NF so I have only met one other person with NF. I hate it! It is taken so much from me... My dermatologist told me it would be selfish to have children which I already decided I was not going to risk but that was the hardest thing to hear. I am a woman I wanted kids but I never will. I want friends I want to quit hiding from this world. It is not selfish. Do not let anyone tell you that. \nNF is not what should determine what you do or who you are. \nSure it sucks. \nPain sucks. \nLooking different sucks. \nYou know what does not suck?

It is really difficult for me to talk about with other people as well, luckily when people ask about it they just play it off as no big deal (I have a fairly mild case). I do not really bring it up to other people because what do I even say? It feels really isolating so have such a rare genetic disease. I have not been stabbed with needles or anything of the sort, I assume that is something that comes from having the cutaneous fibromas? \n\nIt was wrong of your dermo to tell you it would be selfish to have children, not really their place to say. Though I decided a couple of years ago I do not want kids of my own either because of it. The amount of teasing I endured because of my NF... there was a lot of it growing up... it would break my heart to hear my child was being bullied for something like that. That was extremely unprofessional of your dermatologist, it is not their place to say and they definitely should not have done.\nI have fears about having children in the future but I met someone in my  college class who also had nf1 (small world) and she has had two beautiful healthy babies which has eased my anxieties somewhat. I am so sorry that you are hurting. I want you to know that you are not alone. Feel free to rant and rage. Nf sucks. You have every right to feel the way you do. I also want to add that your dermo is an asshat. He has no place telling you that. On a side note I raised a nephew. I love him as much as any person could love a child. I have 3 bio children and there is no difference in how I feel about them all. Being his mother has been one of the greatest joys of my life.

Have many questions Hi,\n\nMy world was shattered last week when my otherwise completely healthy six-month-old son was diagnosed with NF-1.  We took him to the hospital for an unrelated matter (that turned out to be nothing) but while there, the ER paediatrician noticed he has 8 CALS.  We knew this but did not realize it meant anything.  The genetic testing comes back in February but we have been monitoring since and it looks like his spots have grown, so we are pretty certain he has it.  Neither mom or dad have ever shown symptoms so at the moment we are assuming it is a spontaneous mutation.\n\nMedical articles are a tough place to find answers, especially since modern medicine is continually improving. I have a number of questions I would not trying to find answers for, if anyone here has the time, experience and current knowledge.  I understand the disease is totally unpredictable and some of my questions will be un-answerable but I thought I would ask anyway.  We are of course going to consult with our paeditrician but we do not have any appts soon (in the process of getting one as a result of the diagnosis).\n\n1.  The biggest question is that of plexiform neurofibromas.  It looks like if he does not have any structural issues by school-age (will be getting an x-ray to check for tibial/orbital dysplasia) the biggest potential problem are PNs.  It is difficult to find stats on PNs - what %age of patients get them, where do they usually appear, do they always grow to a disfiguring size.  If we catch them early can any preventative procedure take place? The biggest question in regards to PNs is how treatable are they?  I have found sources that state we can use chemotherapy and radiation to treat them and others that state PNs are totally untreatable.  Looking for any answers in regards to PNs here.  Have there been any recent advancements in PN treatment (&lt;5yrs)?  ( German study seems to imply if caught early enough, PNs can be completely removed without further complication.\n\n2. What is the difference between a plexiform neurofibroma and a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour?\n\n3. Is having 8 CALS at such an age a bad sign?  We see numerous stories of people that were not diagnosed until they are 5-6 because it took so long for their CALS to appear.  Does having CALS so young indicate a severe case?\n\n4. Can you predict severity or types of symptoms based on which mutation he has?\n\n5. Many sites say that the severity of symptoms \"can\" differ from parent to child (assuming it is inherited), but they do not say which is more likely - similar or different expression? my son is 5 and was just recently diagnosed with NF through genetic testing.  he was born with the CALS so we were immediately referred for NF monitoring.  1st thing we asked was is not there some kind of blood test for this, the dr said not at this time.  fast forward 4 years and there is a blood test, pretty crazy stuff.  \nanyway, he wears glasses and was being patched for a little while for vision correction.  I think that was only noticed because he was being monitored for the lisch nodules, so far none.  \nhe had an MRI 2 years ago and they found a mass on his brain, indications have it as benign but he needs to have followup MRIs to make sure it does not grow. \nI was always worried while he was growing up that something was off, the way he walks, runs, general kids climbing around stuff.  he was more than just clumsy.  he goes into kindergarten this fall, hes in full day pre-k and doing great relative to his peers.  the only positive to all this is with the diagnosis he will be entitled to a bunch of extra work in school.  \nwith the recent actual genetic diagnosis we are going to start going to CHOP and meet with the Drs there.  the only thing left to do is hope it does not affect him at all.  good luck, youre not alone. Thanks for your story.  Things have actually progressed since I posted this.  His genetic testing came back positive last week (he is 9 months old now)... this is something my wife and I were prepared for; all of our research led to us hopeful for a mild case, as all of his doctors so far had ruled out sphenoid wing and tibial dysplasia just by looking at him.\n\nUnfortunately, also last week I noticed that he has a pulsating exophthalmos.  This implies he actually does have sphenoid wing dysplasia, although you would never know by looking at him... his face is still perfectly symmetrical and his optic nerves/vision is totally healthy.  We will have an MRI to determine the extent.  We can live with some mild sphenoid wing dysplasia but as a result of this I am terrified that there is a plexiform growing behind his eyes.

I do not plan on having any children(I am also asexual lol) I take about 8 pills, 2 Inhailers, and 3 nasal sprays. \n\nI have gerd, asthma, depression, psychosomatic anxiety, TMJ, scoliosis, enlarged thyroid, protruding disc in my neck, RLS, and probably some others. \n\nBut I enjoy anime, movies, tv shows, video games, Greek mythology, loom knitting, ceramics, puzzles, d&amp;d and other nerdy/geeky activities. \n\nIf you think we get along send me a chat message! Hi, I just wanted to let you know if you do get denied for SSI, do not let it get your hopes down. They typically deny everyone, I had to get a lawyer who then helped me get SSI. The good part about this is you only pay the lawyer if they win your case and their payment is just a percentage from back pay that your owed from SSI. Also this is a little known fact, if either of your parents has filed for retirement through social security, you are able to apply off of them for Medicare, as well as more monthly payments. It also helps big time having your doctor on your side with all your medical reports and documentation of how your condition has progressed.\n\nThere are Neurofibromatosis specialist, I have been seeing one since I was 15, he is the same one who diagnosed me. I have had a total of four surgeries, the last two were to remove cancerous tumors, but I am doing good now. This might help you locate a doctor near you.\n\n\n\n\nIn June I started a medication called Koselugo, it was fda approved last year for children, but my doctor was able to get special approval for me. \n\nIf you have any questions let me know. I live in Illinois, and my mom does not want to go to stl or Chicago for the nf doctor. So I am not sure where did we go... I see the doctor in Chicago, he is one of the top doctors, back before I was diagnosed my pediatrician called the nf clinic in grand rapid, but they told her to have my parents take me to university of Chicago. He is been an awesome doctor, I have full confidence in him. He knows exactly which surgeons I need to do my surgery and they are also very familiar with Neurofibromatosis. Tonsgard? Yes I had him if that is who you mean but then I moved and well my mom wants to avoid places like Chicago and STL for ..a variety of reasons Yes, that is my doctor. Sorry that your mom does not want to go to Chicago.

Absolutely loved him. Anyway there is one in Indianapolis so my Dr will probably do that one. Just depends on who will take my Insurance Yeah, that can sometimes be an issue. I wish you the best of luck in finding a doctor who will be able to help you. You can dm me Sorry to hear about everything. I am only 18 but I would love to talk since we seem to have similar interests. Do u have discord?? Yes I do I have it in another post pinned on my profile(do not want to say it in comments) Ok!

(We\u00b4re still friends but we don\u00b4t talk) in high school i had a lot of crushes on girls. And every girl kind of rejected me. They said \"Ah. I don\u00b4t want a boyfriend right now...\" \"Oh. You don\u00b4t have anything wrong, but i would like to keep being single\" and a lot of stuff. And everyone kind of lied to me. A week later or even days, i would see them with boyfriends and stuff. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne day, because of some things, i found a group of people in my school who were kind of cool and nice. The group had... 2 males, and 4 females. With me in with we were 3 males. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a time the group kind of lost people. And in the end, we were 2 males and 2 females. I had a crush in one of the females. But she kind of rejected me in the past. So i told the male who was my best friend in that moment. (In has been like 1 year when we were friends with him) And after a time well. He kind of started dating her, at my backs.\n\nMy best friend and my crush.

How did you meet him/her? \n\nI have a lot of deformities, and i think people kind of rejected me because of it. (I had surgery 2 times because of scoliocis.)

Looking for anyone who has or has had something similar. Or just a general outlook on having NF1. Hello everyone, I have apparently gone my entire life not knowing I am NF1. I am a thin, active, otherwise healthy 30 year old male so finding a tumor that large was a shock to me.\n\nThis all was found out 3 days after my wedding , about 3 weeks ago, when I was hospitalized for extreme pain. I wish I could go back to the wedding chairs being the largest drama in my life.\n\nI have what the doctors believe is a large plexiform Neurofibroma growing off the lower part of my spine and into my pelvis. It is wrapped around my colon and multiple other organs. From the additional MRI's it does not appear that I have any other fibromas or tumors of any kind yet. But the one I do have could be cancerous. And because of it is location, surgery is definitely a massive question mark. As it could cause permanent  incontinence, both fecal and bladder.  \n\nThis has been quite a journey because my very first diagnosis was a Cordoma or Colon Cancer. So compared to that, things are better!\n\nThis whole world of tumors is pretty new to me. I have just been referred to MD Anderson in Houston and it looks like I will soon be headed down there for more to come.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience in this hospital or working with the Doctors down there?\n\nDoes anyone have experience with fibromas located in a similar region? \n\nI know that all tumors are a bit different but I am just looking for more of an outlook from someone who is been in my position. \n\nThanks. Hey man, I have NF1, known about my whole life. I have a similar sized plexiforum between my shoulder blades. Im a bit younger than you (21) but feel free to dm me with any questions. My case is pretty mild and I have no problem sharing my outlook and shit like that Me too I am 21 and loved my whole life hating it and feeling ashamed of it (especially being asian) I have a mild case but people always used to point out my spots or plexiforms. If you need someone to talk to I am here Hey! I have a fibroma tumor in my bladder that is also in my uterus and upper part of my vagina. It is definitely changed my life a bit. I am 28 and have been dealing with it since I was 6. Feel free to message me and we can chat about it I do have tumors in my pelvis, I have had them for years. Right now my doctors have been keeping an eye on them with MRI scans. I am not sure about the size of it, but it is a good size an when I have needed surgery  both 2014 and 2018 they have been unable to put in a catheter. I have had cancerous tumors in both of those years remove, mine were in my upper right leg and upper right arm. My surgeries and Neurofibromatosis doctor are all in Chicago. I am 37.\n\nIf you have any questions let me know 41 here I have one about that size removed from my buttox that was causing extreme pain.\n\nThere have been great strides in NF lately\n\n My situation sounds similar. Are your doctors saying you are unable to remove the tumors in your pelvis? \n\nAnd how much pain are you in if any and do you require any daily medications to handle your situation? I do not really have pain in my pelvis area, at least none that bothers me. The pain is mostly in my legs, arms and back. We haveant really discussed removing the tumors in my pelvis so much, my specialist does not like doing surgeries unless it becomes necessary, because of how difficult the surgeries are and that the tumors can grow back. I am on two different pain medications that I take twice a day. I was diagnosed when I was a baby. I have had a plexiform removed around my appendix/hip area when I was 16 (I am 31 now). I cannot remember the size of it to be honest cause everything happened so fast. It started with a awful pain. Walking was impossible. I had to quit my sports, and went to Boston Children\u2019s  to be looked over. Three days after that appointment I was in surgery getting the tumor removed. I did not have cancer and as far as I know it has not done much growing. (I get yearly MRI scans on my head, spine, abdomen area and neck) With NF1 and plexiform tumours like that you need to make sure you speak to a sarcoma specialist especially if they are questioning malignancy do not let anyone other than a sarcoma specialist biopsy the tumour.  I am a MPNST (NF1 cancer survivor) patientthis knowledge is key. Feel free to message me good luck Thank for the reply. \n\nI just had a PET scan and there isnt a sign of malignancy. However they want to be absolutely certain. Because this is taking up a lot of my presacral area, and wraps around my colon, they are especially concerned about a malignant transformation.\n\nI am now headed to MD Anderson in Houston Texas in 2 weeks to talk with a specialist. \n\nDo you live in the U.S. and if so do you have any suggestions on who to see? I do not live in the US but I think if I remember correctly ( I run an mpnst group on Facebook )some members use  MD Anderson in Houston. So they should be able to discuss as an MDT with a sarcoma specialist alongside whoever you are going to I appreciate the help. This is all very new to me.

So overall I am glad to have caught this now rather than later.\n\nThere is a fibroma in my spine.  I am being sent to a Neurosurgeon.  They are concerned that my it is been impeding my movement, which to be honest, would make a lot of sense.\n\n  I have a lot of good people in my life but it is weird, with NF, I have been expecting it eventually.  I am scared but also just rearing to go, get planning etc. Get surgery, or  a cane, or that new medication, or something. \n\nI do not want to give up, I have such a shitty job and I am so ready to move forward towards a career and future I will love, but if I am out of commission all the time for surgery, it is not going to happen.\n\nMaybe they read the scan wrong and I am overreacting, but it is still lonely either way.\n\nBut yeah.  Thanks for the place to ramble.  Feel free to use this post for your own too.\n\n\n\n Try to find the positive. We have this technology that can help us. Imagine if you never got the MRI and were going about your life and only realized something was wrong much much later. Surgery will put you out of commission but I do not know your current situation with job or health care.\n\nAnyway, my own fallback has always been either \"at least I know\" or \"it could be worse.\" I know how you feel about expecting something to go wrong. I have got headaches all the time. And I always worry that they are going to find a tumor in my brain or something, but the scan has come back with nothing. I still worry that something is wrong even with a clean scan.\n\n\nI wish you a quick recovery post surgery. Things are usually better than they seem like they will turn out. 6 years ago, I had to have my gallbladder removed, from the issues I had starting pre-surgery to the surgery itself and recovery I dropped out of school, owed the school money so I could not go back, and lost my job. It was a terrible job but it definitely set me back, I thought that things would never improve. I am back in school now progressing towards a degree and I finally have a job that I love and is putting me towards my career goals. So even if things look bleak now, they will get better.  My son has an optic glioma from NF (he is 3) and our neuro oncologist has us just watching. Admittedly it is different than a fibroma in your spine but he has said those are pretty common. \n\nI am very sorry because it must be so scary and upsetting. I hope that if they need surgery it is quick and easy recovery and you are back to your normal life. Best wishes :) Look into MEK inhibitors first. My mother had one on her spine and lost most of her mobility afterwards.  Yeah, that is definitely my biggest concern.  I can rock life in a wheelchair, I am sure, but I would rather not. \n\nI am scared I will be unable to write or dance, I guess Our son (4) has optic pathway gliomas as well. Hoping the next MRI shows them stable so we can take a break from MRIs for a while. Please get a second and third opinion on surgery and look into their track records. Do as much research as possible.  I will :)  Ive had a number of surgeries for my Neurofibromatosis \n\n2001 - to remove tumors in my lower right arm\n\n2007 - to remove tumors on my spine\n\n2014 - to remove cancerous tumors on my upper right leg\n\n2018 - to remove cancerous tumor on my upper right arm\n\nJust stay positive and hang in there.  Thank you  Your welcome, if you have questions feel free to ask I would look into a MekInhibitor they have had such great outstanding results. I am sorry to hear that. I have a neurofibroma in my spine that wraps into my neck. They found it when I was around 5 (I am 26 now). I had multiple surgeries for it as a kid because it was pressing against nerves and obviously they were scared I could have become paralyzed as i was older. They could not remove it completely but \"debulked\" it and fused my spine. I know other people in the NF community who have spinal tumors that have not had to have as extreme surgeries as me and they are fine. Either way, I am sure they can do something for you! I wish you luck and I am sorry for the bad news.  Yeah, I have always had a neurofibroma on my neck, right next to my spine, plus another next in my mid back, that ate away muscle.\n\nI am definitely scared, but it is nice to not be alone.   \n\nHow has fusing your spine changed things? Yeah, they were already thinking about putting me on one for a tumor I have in my heel and ankle.  I have some issues walking because of it on bad days.\n\nHave you taken them?  \n\n i am about to! Yeah, that is rough. I have neurofibromas other places as well. Fusing my neck has not changed a ton for me but I was young when it happened so I dont really remember much else. Growing up I could not do anything high impact or participate in gym in school but my circumstances were a little different than some fusion patients. It was a little more difficult learning how to drive and sometimes I have to turn my entire body to do things like look at people but overall my quality of life is the same. I imagine it would be a more difficult adjustment for someone older, who is used to moving their neck. So far my only symptoms have been increased back pain and some minor bladder issues.  Both of which I am not sure if they are related yet.\n\nI am definitely concerned about a few other things, but those are also potentially related to a dozen other things Yeah, everything could be related, but also could just be something else", "Has anyone found success in Cannabis killing these cursed tumors? I am ready to give up on doctors and just use cannabis products.  Has anyone found success in using Cannabis or am I just going to make this crap worse? Also curious. Cannabis will not cure anything. At best they can provide some pain relief, but the tumors will keep coming and growing. Exactly not a cure for anything. I have been smoking a decade it has helped with things from anxiety to pain and I believe that has helped in other areas. I know stress and anxiety cause my tumors to grow and sometimes triggers seizure due to my epilepsy, but so it is not a cure for anything I do believe it helps slow or prevent things. Also might just be a pot head. try getting the oil but ive heard of cannabis working miracles after doctors have given no hope.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nplacebo is also a thing Cannabis might help with pain, but it is not going to do much of anything else to tumors. You should talk with your doctor about being put on Koselugo. Cannabis helps relieve a lot of my symptoms, but there is nothing in it to shrink tumors. There are several drug trials going on for that though. Do not give up hope! Why would cannabis shrink tumors? That is magical thinking No wonder I am getting so damn many I am so damn stressed out. Kiaser will not cover it. That is unfortunate. Aetna does not cover it either, which is one of the reasons why I switched back to priority health (the state had auto enrolled me to Aetna, shortly after Priority Health had approved me for the drug). Thankfully the hospital where my specialist is at was able to temporarily enroll me into a free drug program through AstraZeneca, where every month they send me my prescription. I am good through until August 22nd, after which the hospital will either need to try to reenroll me or reapply again with my insurance since now I am back on priority health, who originally did approve me for it with a copay of $4. Man it is hard not to be when this is the hand we are dealt. That is not true. Some strains have been known to have anti-tumour properties.\n\n Limiting the growth is in my opinion not the same as downright stopping or curing. Touch\u00e9 Cannabis by itself it would be difficult to reach a dosage level to cure. However there are stronger extracts think rick simpson oil and cbg extract (not cbd)  that have been show to shrink tumors.  Rick Simpson cured his cancer with his extract. \nI have been taking cbg extract and will continue.", "Help with future with NF2 Hello NF community!

I am still afraid of my what will happen in the future but there is nothing I can do about it (I got diagnosed about a year ago and had surgery last summer so it is all still a bit new). I was pretty much already deaf in my left ear before the surgery so not much changed. I will most likely go deaf in the future (even with surgery or radiosurgery, due to the location do the tumour it will still happen).

It is located on his lumbar spine, is large and diffuse, and, other than some de-bulking, probably inoperable.  It did not bother him until about 2 years ago when it became sensitive to touch and to pressure from his pants, etc.  His NF doc suggested we start with vitamin B12 because it has been shown to help.  It has actually helped!  I could not believe it!   But, he is 12 yrs old and the puberty train is moving out of the station.   I am concerned about how things may progress with this PNF.  For those of you who have one, what change have you experienced over time?  Did puberty initiate any change?  Have you had PNF operations?  Thanks in advance for sharing what you can. I do. I had more tumors grow during puberty and increased nerve pain. I have had debulkings. It is pretty low key and did not/does not disturb life too much. I was not diagnosed until I was 15. They tried to disguise me when I was baby and again when I was nine, but back then it was all inconclusive. So me unfortunately puberty was like the on switch for things to take off. If you have questions please let me know. I am 37 now and I have had four surgeries related to my nf. 28/F here. I have several plexiforms, mainly on my trunk. Some did grow during puberty and I have had some removed at the dermatologists office, but never full on operation. I know as a female, getting pregnant can aggravate it, as any hormonal changes can make matters worse. I honestly cannot remember a huge change when I went through puberty, but I also have a milder case. \n\nSince I was 18 my pain has gotten a lot worse. Not as much from the fibromas but from NF and fibromyalgia in general. Did not know about B12 helping, so I will definitely have to give that a try. I have a few on my wrists which are incredibly easy to knock into things and cause a lot of pain when I do. \n\nI was diagnosed at 14, but have had tumours since I was a baby, my parents did not want the biopsies and tests being done when I was so young so waited until I chose to have them done. Puberty did not have any effect. Thank you to those of you who responded so quickly.  I just like to be prepared for what might happen.  He is already been through a lot with NF...1 yr of chemo, multiple surgeries, Blinded in one eye, etc. you know the drill!  I have always assumed this PNF would be problematic at some point, and hearing your experiences is really helpful.  So, again, thank you!!! If you have not responded yet, please do. I want to hear your story too! How have you managed any pain you have experienced? How are you managing your pain? How are you managing your pain? At the moment just over the counter pain medicine. I have a wrist brace I wear to try and \"protect\" it. I have another appointment coming up in a few months to talk about solutions. I have two different pain medication that are prescribed to me. I just deal with it at this point since no meds really helped me. I will put on an IcyHot on particularly bad days and my heated blanket is my best friend. Yes I have a plexiform. - I will reply in full tomorrow still recovering after some tests. Hope you feel better soon! I do. I was diagnosed as a baby since my dad has NF also. I have a big tumor in my neck that branched out into my spine. That one was debulked (in the spine) when I was young with multiple surgeries. My neck is now fused. The tumor is is still there since it cannot be fully removed. Also have prominent tumors in the back of the head, behind my ear, sciatic nerve, and in my shoulder. There are various tiny ones in my spine, vagus nerves, etc that doctors are not worried about. \n\nPuberty did not change anything for me. I have had my biggest tumor since at least 5 years old, maybe before. I do not believe there was any noticeable growth. I believe it puberty can be of some concern to doctors when it comes to tumors but there is no study that show the plexiforms will grow excessively.  \n\nMy main tumors do cause me pain and a few years ago I was told they were growing slightly. I was lucky to be put on a clinical trial though and that helped. That has been a few years however. Treatment is starting to look up for helping neurofibromas as drugs are being approved. To treat pain myself I honestly just have pain meds for when it gets really bad. Do not like taking it that much though, so I try to relax and sleep. Also, I have a medical cannabis card which helps and putting a heat pack where it hurts. Some specialists say turmeric can help with inflammation so many people take turmeric everyday (I do) to try and help the tumors/nerves not inflame as much. I also have spots located on my lumbar! I was not diagnosed until 26, so I do not know how puberty affected them, but I can tell you 2 pregnancies did increase the size of all of them, and the biggest by about a centimeter.

It is tough man, people just assume we are all the way healthy if we look it. I am very grateful for having a mild case, to the point of guilt. What pains I do have are occasional and I learn how to make do (do not touch my right big toe!). Never feel guilt, you are one of us even if your case is mild. I am a lot more mild than many as well, I can still work full time and take care of myself. Some cannot do that, does not mean my struggles are not real. Thank you. What state are you from?

What is your struggle in getting it in Iowa? \n\n-sorry for my lack of Iowa medical cannabis knowledge You have to go through a primary care doctor with an established history to qualify.

Here is her beautiful and frustrating story\u2026\nBirth was great she was huge and healthy! 10.5lbs and 22inches long. She was born with 14CAL spots and 3 huge port wine stains. I was a little thrown off but thought they (the dr\u2019s) are not worried it is okay. \n\nWeeks go by and she does not sleep but in our arms, outside, or maybe if she is finally tired after being up for 8+ hours. The CAL\u2019s continue to multiply. I know sometime is off. I have raised 3 babies. I know something is off!! We ask the dr if it is colic, gas, or something we can treat anything. \u201cShe is just a baby\u201d is all she said or \u201cYeah sure it could be that\u201d\n\n6 months we do not sleep more than 2 hours. CAL are 32+ now. She does not talk make sounds. She is behind with every mile stone. She screams all the time. I ask the dr if there is anything she can think of that maybe wrong. \u201c She is just the youngest child, this is common\u201d. I am at this point ready to lose my MFing mind!! I am sure I have at this point! \n9 months I get the dr to give us a referral to dermatologist for her port wine stains because they are raising when she get hot or warm. \n11 months and 4 days we are at Seattle Children\u2019s and the dermatologist walks in with a resident and 2 interns. His eye lit up and he asked each one of them what they thought it was after I spill my story. One got it! An intern! They leave us in the room for 45 Minutes. Then came back in with NF1 Information. Told me no goggle and that we needed to wait for testing. \nAfter test came back she has NF1 and our kids and us get tested. It is a fluke gene!! \nShe has speech issues, social issues, physical issues, sleep issue, learning disabilities, testing for Asperger\u2019s an autism, motion sickness, fear blisters it temps over 85degrees, and 100 + CAL and 1 neurofibroma. But she kind and smart and she does not let it break her or define her. \nWe have some of the best drs on our side now! Still, I am a mom a freaking lose my mind constantly at the thought of every pain, head ache, squint  or tummy ache is something else! \nBut we make everyday beautiful and survive. Keep you head up and never stop fighting! As someone who has NF and has grown up with it, I want to say that you are amazing. The way you fight for your daughter reminds me so much of what my own mum has done for me and still does. You are daughter is very lucky, unfortunately doctors can be blind to certain issues sometimes unless it is obvious to them. I have no doubt that whatever your daughter faces she will be okay with a parent like you fighting her corner for her how could she not be.\n\nIf you ever need someone to talk to who has first hand experience with NF or just another perspective this is a good place to ask, you can also message me directly if you like. I thank you to the bottom of my soul!\n\nI think that dr\u2019s get complacent with their jobs and do not advance with the time either cause of a personal perspective or being overloaded. I gladly went back to her 1st pediatrician and explained how upset I was with her and that she could have done better for my family. But she is human and we all make mistakes but I hope she was humbled and advances. I walked out a proud mom that day! \n\nI work in healthcare and see this issue a lot but I also get to see the other side of caring so much and investing in patients and the toll it can take.

Thank you for the support! Your mother is a brave woman as well and you a brave human. Not many of the NF community speaks out and it already so unheard of. But I hope to slowly change that. Thank you again. (P.s. I will fix all my grammar errors lol) thanks for not judging!\ud83d\ude0a I have been told he has nothing (no development delays, just around 10 cal spots, and him not growing properly and screaming a lot) for an entire year. The coolest thing was when a pediatrics professor that I payed for a private consultation told me my son's diagnosis is that his mother reads too much. When he turned one, I just looked up a geneticist, payed for the test myself, and after I got the results with the NF1 mutation, I could find proper care for him. It is frustrating, because we are in a city where there are excellent teaching hospitals and very good doctors, me and my husband have both healthcare from the state and private one, and still I had to go to these lengths to get him diagnosed. Finding the best care for him is still a struggle And yes, there is a lump in my throat every time he has any complaints. The best one was when I had a panic attack when he slept on his arm so it went numb and could not properly use it for half an hour. Central motor deficit and brain tumor and surgery were the first things that popped in my mind. Way to stick with it!! \n\nMy brain gets the best of me sometimes because I have medical back round. I have accepted that I may never have to leave her side. Her strength gives me hope that one day she maybe able to live alone. \nKeep up all that hard work!! I can definitely relate to your story! My daughter was born with a bunch of CALs as well, and doctors told us it would eventually go away on their own. This was our second child and we knew in our gut something was wrong. Our daughter was also a horrible sleeper!

He has NF1, and luckily it has never interfered with his life as an adult. Last week he finally decided to go to the doctor for these headaches.... they gave him a shot of some migraine meds and sent him home with a prescription as well.  Neither of these has done anything for his headache.  I really do not know a whole lot about NF1 in particular.  I know that he has it pretty mild, but any time I try to find info it seems to be about more severe cases. Do you think there could be a possibility of his NF1 being the cause of these headaches?  The fact that the headache meds did not work have really kind of freaked us both out.  He went back to the doctor today and is currently at the ER getting a CT scan as he has not had one since he was in high school.  He is 26 now.  I know that after puberty things with NF1 tend to die down a bit, but he has a lot of trouble with his eyesight, to the point to where he will likely need surgery soon and maybe glasses on top of that. But I have no idea how or if NF1 plays any part in that.  I am far from an expert, so other than just a very general knowledge and understanding of NF1, I really do not know much about it.  Does anyone have any info about NF1 and headaches?  Thanks in advance!", "Can I get Top surgery if I suffer NF1 This is just a general question, I have been thinking about having top surgery for a while, I need to speak with my doctor and psychologist about it.

Right now I work as a paraeducator for special education, but I have taught English abroad for 4 years  For me, it is been hard, especially being abroad, but I have learned to walk into situations looking confident and letting people see my personality. Though, since children are more likely to have no filter and can be scared of me, I tend to avoid teaching them and have stuck with college and adult age. I did visit elementary students last year to speak to them about the country I was living in. When they asked me about my face, I said that I look different, and I am ok.

Good luck to you.\n", "Nf type Hello people hope everyone of you is healthy and happy. I am 29M from India. I have several cafe au lait spots all over my body some are big in size and some are small, but I have not had any health issues as of now. It was only last year my dermatologist told me that I have nf syndrome. Is it common that these spots does not develop and underlying problem or should I be worried and consult general physician. Any help regarding this would be great help Neurofibromatosis can effect everyone differently, some have little to no issues, while other have either a mild or severe case of it.\n\nI was not diagnosed until I was 15. I see my Neurofibromatosis specialist at least once a year, sometimes more and have MRIs pretty much yearly. If you do not mind my asking, what other factors led to your diagnosis? Family history, tumors, bone deformities, etc.? Cafe au lait spots alone are not enough to diagnosis someone and multiple conditions can present with them.\n\nAdditionally, parroting what /u/Wolflmg said. There is a wide spectrum in how people with NF are impacted by it. No family history.\n\nDoctors always believed I had it when I was born, but test results were always inconclusive when I was nine, I always had the birthmarks, as I got older I started having bumps (tumors) mostly on my head. It was not until I was 15 that I was fully diagnosed, which mostly included test of blood work, MRIs and other X-rays. Oh, I was asking OP since their dermatologist told them they have it based on cafe au lait spots, apparently. \n\nOn MRIs though, I have had an eye MRI. Most frustrating thing ever My grandma had few spots and even my father has  one or two but other than that no other serious health issues in the family. I have a twin brother and he do not have any of such spots. As a kid I only had one or two spots but with age they started appearing more. It was recently when I went to my dermatologist because the ones on the face keeps bothering me and then he told me that its a type of NF. Not even any pain when I press them Oh I got the notification that you replied to my comment. I believe if you want the OP to be alerted you need to comment to their post and then they will be alerted.\n\nI have never had an eye MRI before. I have had other eye test done to measure eye pressure and other things. You were notified since I added your username, I commented on the post itself.\n\nYou cannot move your eye at all for the duration of the scan. They had to restart like 4 times since the smallest movement would make the imaging messed up. 0/10 do not recommend That would drive me crazy. Hopefully I will not ever have to do it, I have enough issues with drops being put in my eye. I have a lazy right eye and my eyes sort of do not open fully, so they are kind of sensitive to certain things. I did not have any idea about it up untill now. I was looking about on the internet I have spots under my arms also but I do not have any bumps on the skin like the one I was seeing on the internet. Do you think it could be just cafe au spots with bo underlying condition of Nf Ah, so you have cafe au lait spots alongside neurofibromas. That makes sense then, thank you Sometimes people do not get underlying issues. At 29 you have already gone through puberty and had your hormonal growth spurts so I believe you may be in the clear for any serious health concerns but of course remain vigilant to any changes. There is a syndrome called Legius, also known as NF1-like syndrome because it looks like Nf1 based on skin manifestations - so the cafe lait (CAL) spots - but it is another gene and it has none of the tumour complications. \n\nThere are a few variants which genotype-phenotype has only CALs without neurofibroma. \n\nI would ask for a genetic test, because Nf1 has several complications one needs to be aware of and which present differently than the normal population. \n\nIn addition to that , m most importantly, you might want to be a father one day, and since Nf1 is a dominant gene, you need to know. It really depends, one girl that I know had just one above her eyebrow, and removed it. I have bone deformities, and can feel the tumors under my skin. I also know there are some in spine, which are detected by MRI. Can you see a neurologist Thank you so much for the much valuable info. I would soon book a genetic test. Thank you so much for your response I will soon book an appointment with the neurologist. Tbh I am bit scared what if the reports does not come right I cant put my family through that I really hope that it is not NF1. But even if it is, you are 29, gone through puberty, so ''the worst'' has passed. And you also do not have visible tumors, or visible other symptoms. I have them, and I am happy cuz I know it can be worse. Some people really have severe symptoms. Others, can have almost nothing", "EMG Electromyography? Hello everyone, tomorrow i have an EMG and I am pretty scared because I get little needles in me? I read that and now I am a little scared just because I do not know much. Did you ever had and EMG and how was it? I am 20F I have had it (not for NF though). They are like little electrodes with needles but they are very small. When they give a little shock, it is very minor. It is to see what your nerves are doing. Honestly it is no big deal. I had them up my arm into my neck and I cannot give you more detailed information because it was so uneventful that I barely remember it. You will do fine. I hope you get the answers you need from the test. I had this test as a child. What I remember is that it is kind of uncomfortable but nothing not endurable. No big deal. Sound much scarier than it is. The test looked good, it was not that scary as I was prepared for so that was good :) Way to go! Let us hope for good results \ud83d\ude42", "I am seeing my backside with specialists now. For 3 years they have been looking until the high probability that my son has nf1. At first we were constantly kept in the loop with everything going on. Not by the nf1 Dr's but the optometrists that were just checking the backs of his eyes every 6 months. \nMy son had an mri. The specialists did not bother to call or write about it. But the eye specialist was able to go through it a bit with me and said it had shown a brain abnormality consistent to nf1 and looking at it they were going to be sending him for another blood test. Then the first lock down happened. We finally had a letter about a karyotype blood test for last July. We went and heard nothing. In December I called and got told no results had gone back but they would chase it. A week later I had a call off a paediatric Dr. Who said she could not discuss anything as she knew nothing I asked what the point of the call was and she said just to check in with us. I asked about the bumps on his skin and she said she had no idea and speak to a Dr....I asked wtf she was and she said not his Dr!! I have since had another letter for us to go for a proper application and honestly I am ready to explode at them. Surely this is not right. I am sorry you have not had good luck with your sons doctors. I myself was not diagnosed until I was 15, though doctors always suspected I had it including eye doctors (I was born with a lazy right eye) and even my pediatrician. My pediatrician was so sure I had it that she referred me to see a specialist at university of Michigan, but the results were inconclusive. So she kept it in the back of her mind when ever she would see me for a checkup. Then when I hit puberty, she was seeing things that were making her even more sure, so she first called a nf clinic in Grand Rapids, but they told her I should go to University of Chicago based of the information she told them about my last checkup. \n\nSo my parents and I went to Chicago, they did an exam and some blood work. Then the last week of my freshmen year of high school, I went back to Chicago where I spent about a week in the hospital to have more tests done. It was sort of a trade off since the majority of my teachers did not have been take my final exams, though at the time I much rather had been taking those tests.\n\nSo then after all the tests and the doctor went over the results, I was diagnosed with Neurofibromatosis at 15. I have continued to see this doctor over the last 20 plus years. \n\nIf you have any questions let me know. I am really sorry this happened to you. NF can only be confirmed through a genetic test not a blood test, although I guess you can do a genetic test with blood. If you want you can PM with some questions, I am NOT a doctor but may be able to answer some questions. Daaaamn! Where do you live to have such a mess up system and no communication or reports back from Doctors... If they suspect NF1, I wonder why are they recommending Karyotyping? If there is a small mutation(point or small del/dup), there is no way karyotyping would detect it. If you are in the USA, please do a thorough NF1 and SPRED1 testing at UAB if you can. Sometimes trying to fix something or make sense of a jumbled situation is harder than starting all over again. \n\nMake an appointment to your practitioner and declare that there is enough doubt to justify a genetic test. Have it done and start from afresh.  There are many labs now that perform this easily, even with a salsa swab test ( \n\nIn alternative, make a appointment with your son's doctor and ask them to sort the issues you listed. \n\nYou do not say how old your son is or what his symptoms are. Up to the age of 6 , it makes no sense to look to Lisch nodules as they rarely appear before the age of 6 and even at 6 , they are still pretty rare.", "4 Days left to write an email to YOUR Senators asking for their support of NF research.

Things you will need a passport, medications for 2 weeks (maybe a little longer) I am working on getting RV\u2019s donated for the journey, and Be yourself. That is all I ask and a willingness to open up a little and understand that we will be discussing some things that could bring back some past trauma I know I have PTSD from what I have been through. Just out of curiosity who would be interested in taking part? Really not a good time to be traveling. I am talking once travel is a little safer I get that there is a plague/pandemic but lm looking at my life changing drastically in the near future due to NF and am suddenly up against a clock to do some things that are important to me. If you feel like coming to Alaska... I mean we could end up there, it is not really set in stone where we will end the road trip I am not opposed to starting it wnsjnf there That is pretty cool, I would not be able to do it, even though I always sort of wanted to do a road trip.

However, I tried Marijuana like 3 or 4 times, so im not a regular.\n\nI know that studies about Marijuana are still relatively new, but I was wondering if someone is a Marijuana smoker or Edibles consumer, does it affect you negatively? Is it a dangerous combination with the fibromas ? If you have eating problems related to a fibroma then it can be a huge benefit. I have not noticed any negative side effects specifically relating to NF. Well I dont know if it answers your question, but Im skinny and I have a relatively fast metabolism that make it hard for me to gain weight. That Is why I try to eat more and gain weight so I could do some muscles gain afterwards I have smoked almost daily for the past 9 years. And have not had any problems related to NF and Weed\n\nIt helps my depression and sometimes helps the pain I experience. \n\nOf course the docs do not recommend smoking due to lung damage, but that is the norm for every one. It is massively beneficial to me, edibles are better if you know how to dose properly. Overdoing edibles, while not dangerous will make it hard to function.\n\nAlso if your in an illegal state, delta 8 has worked wonders for me. Yeah, my lungs are not the best! But I guess I can smoke occasionally. It wont hurt. Also I guess Edibles are a good alternative, eventhough some hit harder than smoking! Im in NYC so I guess we Gucci now, yeaah edible  are very tricky Edibles are good, I perfer smoking tho, bc I feel like I can better control how much I ingest and how high I get I started taking edibles a couple months ago. No negatives. Helps me get to sleep faster and takes the edge off my pain. Kind Of pricey, but worth it on bad days. Have you tried oils? The concentrate seems to be more effective for inflammation and there is no smoking involved I have never heard of eating issues due to fibromas - can you please explain? I should try that then!! LMFAO Thank you for your input.\nYeah personally I still dont use Marijuana or Cannabis, I was just wondering and thinking what if I do it like once or twice a week, just to give some chill vibes ... you know I personally do not anymore and likely will not again  for many reasons but NF is not one of them! Cannabis can offer a lot of help with a lot of life's problems. I have been using edibles for a few months now. I buy a combination of edibles. One with high CBD content, this helps with my anxiety and depression. And I take a THC / CBN mostly for sleep. I think I am also feeling less pain associated with my fibromas.\nAlso, I am trying to read scientific literature on NF and cannabis when it is available. Hope more info comes out soon. I have tried edibles several times and felt no negatives. But it is different for everyone so I cannot be sure. Sorry, I worded that weirdly \n\nIf you have got one in/around your stomach it will cause eating issues. I do not have NF, but I do have schwannomatosis. I love weed. I avoid actually smoking it except on rare occasions, but I usually use a dry herb vaporizer which heats and evaporates the cannabinoids and terpenes in cannabis without combusting it, so no carcinogens are inhaled as there is no smoke - just a light vapor.\n\nI am a fan of the (heating and evaporating the cannabinoids and terpenes in cannabis without combusting it) for the past year or so. A+ product.\n\nI do edibles sometimes, but generally as I get older I find that I have less and less time to dedicate to an edible. Ah, makes sense. Thanks for clarifying \ud83d\ude09 I have only smoked the oils. Never taken thc oils, just CBD oils, since I work at a health food store And if there are plexiform tumors in or on the intestinal walls. weed absolutely helps with it in my opinion. i have tons of physical pain from my tumors, and weed is just about the only thing that helps the pain stop I have weed and I smoke NF1 all the time. \ud83e\udd23\n\nYes, I did it on purpose.\n\nI smoke because I like it but now it is becoming more and more about fighting the stress and pain from NF1.\n\nNF must stand for No Fun, because that is what it is!\n\nI am Canadian. I was just about to say, is this guy HIGH ?? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I am now.

Hey all - my brother has NF and just announced his engagement. He has significant fibromas all over, including his hands. A particularly difficult one is on his ringfinger.

Maybe silicone?  Congrats to him!  maybe also search rings for arthritis as that can mean large knuckles skinny fingers Or search hinged wedding rings  Silicon rings are great. You do not need anything fancy.  The important thing is that it means something to them.  What about a tattoo ? I am not sure how it would feel being tattooed over it though .  What about rubber rings I know there not as cool but I honestly think there is no reason really for rings anymore maybe I am just weird ", "NF1 Hey everyone. First time posting on here. I was diagnosed with NF1 probably around the age of 3. Luckily all I have are the caf\u00e9 au lait spots all over my body. I kind of feel bad posting this because I know a lot of people on this reddit are dealing with MUCH more serious issues than the spots. I have always felt pretty insecure when I take my shirt off because people stare and all that kind of stuff. Also got called scooby-doo in middle school and that kind of just added to it. My question is, how do those with many caf\u00e9 au lait spots, walk around confidently without really caring what other people think. I have been hitting the gym to get more fit and try to ignore the looks but I still get them.  It is tough. I have it relatively mild and most of my spots and fibromas are on my stomach and back. It is why I do not wear bikinis (27F) or shorts because of the ones on my leg. \n\nHow I look at it is that we see the spots when we look at ourselves because we are self-conscious about them but very few people have brought mine up. I just try to keep them covered when I can, but if anybody asks I am open with them about what it is.  Pretty much same here, back and stomach. I have not really had anyone bring it up besides a few close friends of mine when they first saw me without a shirt. Usually just some stares.  I have had a ton of caf\u00e9 au lait marks my whole life (24F). I also have these reddish/purplish small round dots all over my body but mostly concentrated ons on my stomach and breasts. They started appearing when I was about 13. According to my doctor, \"I have never seen this before but I am pretty sure it is just related to your NF1.\" I have been very self-conscious of them lately and am really struggling with my body image. \n\nI wish I had advice for you. This sub has helped me realize that this is definitely mild compared to most, but it is still hard. The fact that you posted helps me to know that I am not alone, so thank you!  I am really surprised I was able to find a subreddit for this. I know what I have is minor and I am blessed for that but I was just wondering who else out there is dealing with the same thing as me. Glad I am not alone! I guess we just have to learn to love ourselves for who we are and forget what other people think of us  It took me til my early 20s to not really give a shit what anyone else thought...it comes with age I have known I have had NF1 pretty much all my life, I was diagnosed at 6 months. I have it quite mild, like you it is mostly cafe-au-lait patches and a few purple dots, so of which I have had removed so there is small scars. \n\nI have grown a tough skin, but I do not actually find many people actively looking. I am sure to many they just look like birthmarks.\n\nSchool was the worst though, since I did not play any contact sports, and I had a few questions from classmates, who then did not believe me when I explained NF... but yeah, just keep your head up :) Yea some kids are pretty ignorant. When I start to feel insecure I think how much worse I could really have it and I am lucky I am very fortunate because mine is mild, and the spots are light. I have always used it as a conversation starter when asked, and an educational moment.  Not many people realize it is due to a genetic disorder. From my experience, just think it is a bunch of regular birthmarks like other people have. Good on you for educating them  I wish I could tell you how to be more comfortable in your own skin. I am not and have never been. I have cafe spots and fibromas all over my face and body. I cannot even get a date. I am 23F and I have the same thing! I barely have any bumps that protrude from the skin, but rather a lot of flat/intented purplish ones on my ribs and breasts.  Oh wow! I got a biopsy on one of the first ones that showed up. It left a weird looking scar. But when the NF specialist saw it he said he never saw it before and it was probably just my NF.", "Anyone with facial paralysis, swallow difficulty, eye lid closure problem after surgery?

I was diagnosed with NF1 when I was a kid, but my parents only decided to tell me couple of years ago. I am 28 now and I have never had any complicated issue as a result of my nf1. I do not have any plexiform, just a couple ordinary ones hidden and a bunch of hidden cafe au lait spots. On the learning side I also consider myself lucky since it has not been a problem.\n\nI do not want to sound like I am bragging about my life, so here comes the hardest part which is the part of my brain that constantly reminds me of my nf1 and tells me that I am always one day away of everything going downhill. That I might start having pain and plexiform everywhere. The mental toll of not knowing what to expect health wise is terrifying. I feel like I am in a constant roller coaster.\n\nThank you for being such an amazing support group. I have always been a lurker here and now I decided to share my story Let me reassure straight away. One is born with a plexiform. They are congenital, present since birth. They might be deep into the body and not visible in the first years of life, but if you had one, you would know at 28. \n\nSo you can strike that off your fears list. \n\nNext, let us look at the future and why we do get worse as we age. To understand why (and maybe reduce the degeneration ) you need to understand what the Nf1 gene is. It is one of the good guys, a tumour protector gene, one of 65 we have. When it is mutated, it does not work very well. A functioning Nf1 gene will down-regulated (slow down if you prefer) a cellular pathway called RAS which regulates cell life cycles such as growth, division and programmed death. \n\nMutations and DNA damage occur constantly, but so do DNA repair and other defence mechanisms of the cell. Other the course of the years, more and more mutations occur as we age, so the degenerative condition of nf1 is linked to ageing. Adopting a longevity lifestyle which boosts defences and reduces attacks might be an adjuvant to controlling your NF1. The worsening of NF1 can be seen as an accumulation of errors. \n\nIf you have reached the age of 28 without any major complication such as bone dysplasia, plexiform, optic glioma, you have drawn the lucky card and chances are your NF1 will stay as it is. \n\nIf you were diagnosed as a child, you might want to confirm the diagnosis with a genetic test. Skin manifestations only, especially at your age, might not be unique to Nf1. Several other diseases, such as Legius have cafe au lait, without any of our complications. The cheapest way is to look for Lisch nodules in the eye. The most irrefutable way is the genetic test. \n\nYou should book yourself a visit at an nf1 clinic, because a yearly check up is a good idea with nf1. At that appointment, I would recommend you ask them to confirm the diagnosis, with a proper examination. Once nf1 is confirmed, you should educate yourself with what it is and what to look for. \n\nDo not ruin your future living in a fear fed by ignorance. First confirm, then educate and you will find out that the future does not have to be black nor bleak. Hey! Fellow NF1-er here.Well, first off, I think your reaction is very normal because you have only just learned of your condition. You have not had the years of adjustment and acceptance other people have had. Most people have the same worries, so there are lots of people in the boat with you right now.\n\nI just turned 36, and I was diagnosed back when i was around 18-20 when i had 3 subcutaneous tumors removed. So far, I have had a mild case. So mild that no one knows I have it (i have no visible tumors outside of normal clothing areas, and the ones I do have are really small and look more like flesh-colored moles). I have had some surgeries to remove the more troublesome ones, but they were all minor and cosmetic in nature. And while I do not know what the future holds for me, I would say NF1 has had very little impact in my daily life. I am considered conventionally attractive despite having a few bumps here and there and people do not really notice anything.\n\nWhy am I saying all this? It is because 95% of the stories of NF1 you will see online are from those who have been particularly significantly impacted by the condition, but scientific studies show that most people (around 60%) who have NF1 develop only mild symptoms, ranging from minor cosmetic nuisances to virtually no detectable symptoms. Some do not even find out they have it until their offspring is diagnosed. But these people are not online seeking support because they do not need it. NF1 has no bearing in their lives. So the stories you do end up seeing online are mostly just the particularly troublesome cases.\n\nTo give you a realistic view of the condition, I am going to say that it is very unpredictable, and also progressive: Most people who have nf1 will develop more bumps and other symptoms as we age (I have had an increase in bumps in the past few years, but most of them are not visible unless under particlar lighting). I cannot predict how your case will go, when you will start showing noticeable symptoms, or if you will show more symptoms at all. However you do have to keep in mind that most people who have it are only mildly affected, and remain mildly affected well into advanced age.\n\nNF1 is relatively common. It happens in 1 in 3000 births, and that is far from \"rare\". You would think if it was always going to be bad, you would see more people with very visible symptoms, but you do not. That tells us that despite the high incidence of NF1 in the general population, plenty of cases are not particularly impactful and people go on to live perfectly normal, productive and happy lives.\n\nI am in no way minimizing the potential problems NF1 could cause, as it can be severe for some people. But, at the same time, worrying about something that might not even come to pass is just a waste of energy. Live your best life now, with the body you have now, and worry about problems when they come along IF they do come. All you can do is take it one day at a time. I unfortunately have not been as lucky as you, but I am luckier than others. Yes it possible the on switch for your nf could be turned on, it also possible to be hit by a bus or a million other things to happen. That is why we should live in the moment and take things one day at a time. The last thing any of us should do is dwell on the worst things. That is not good to anyone.\n\nIf you ever have any questions, let me know. Are you the same BooksAndCoffee from Inspire? Either way I am glad you are here! Busted! Yep, it is me :) I try not to overthink it. \n\nI have had plenty of operations and so on because of it, and I know I will have more eventually. If you overthink this illness, you will just begin thinking about the worst possible outcome.\n\nAlso, do not feel ashamed to be concerned about your NF1, no matter how minor your case appears in comparison to others. We rightly should consider our future, but take it in strides.", "I am new! Help Hello everyone, I am a 29F and had NF since birth starting with about 15 cafe au lait marks. Note NF does run in my family. \nAs I grew older I could you could see the tumors growing under my skin.

I typically have full MRI scans done once a year. I have had four surgeries related to my Neurofibromatosis over the last twenty years, 2001, 2006, 2014, and 2018. The last two were to remove tumors that had turned cancerous. \n\nThere are a number of clinical trials going on that are showing 20-40% tumor shrinkage. My doctor is looking to get me into one. \n\nIf you have any questions, let me know and I will do my best to answer them.

", "Question regarding NF and passing it down to children. We all have a 50% chance of passing NF to our children. To my understanding even if they have the recessive gene they can still pass it as dominant or recessive. Which leads me to my next question can the gene be spliced out if we choose the artificial assimilation route? Or is it impossible to not pass the gene if we wish to have children? This has been something that is been on my mind for a while. I figured someone here my have more answers. Thanks in advance! It sounds like you are asking if your children can \"carry\" the gene but not have the disorder, who h could then cause them to pass it on to their children, essentially \"skipping a generation\"\n\nIf that is your question, the answer is No, there no such thing as a carrier gene or receive trait for Neurofibromatosis. NF is autosomal dominant. This means having a single copy of the gene is all that is required to have the disorder. You either have it or you do not, no middle ground. NF is autosomal dominant trait. You either have NF or you do not. There is no recessiveness to it. There only needs to be 1 copy to have NF. So, if you have a child that does not have the gene, then they do not have NF and cannot pass it on. However, they do have the same chance as everyone else of spontaneous mutation in their children. We tried to do that and ran into other complications, but the Dr. did say that what worked well was to get a batch of embryos going in the lab, and then test them when they get to the 8 cell stage.  At that point, you can see which ones have the NF mutation and which do not. From my understanding NF is a mutation in the gene, so it has a 50/50 chance to pass to a child but it is only passable by people with a confirmed diagnosis. For example my dad has it so I got it, however as my brother did not get the mutation his future kids do not have any risk at all. Where as I would have the risk to pass it, which is my number one reason for not wanting it having biological children. Right, I am the only one in my family who has it so I gathered that I got it from the mutation. I have been worried about what it might do to my children if I decide to have any. Thanks for the info! I will be sure to keep that in mind later down the road. Ok so it is 100% 50/50 if the future generations will have it or not. Thanks for the info! If you want to do in vitro fertilization, preimplantation genetic diagnosis can be done on the embryos to test for specific diagnoses, like NF. When I was alot younger I wanted kids but since I was around 16 (I am 23 now) I realized what it would mean and how I could not live with myself having caused them issues like me ( I have had alot of health Complications). I also realized that as I would carry the child, it would fuck with my hormones and cause more lumps and tumors to grow on my body. Which I already am extremely self conscious about, i came to the conclusion it is not something i want to risk, but should I settle down with the right partner I would adopt or look at alternatives. \n\nBut everyone has a different experience and view but if you want someone to chat to I am happy to offer my perspective Hi.

He has an optic glioma which has not affected his vision, and a spinal neurofibroma which caused scoliosis which had to be corrected by surgery back in December. Otherwise he is generally fine and his NF is not a big factor in his day-to-day life.\n\nRecently, however, we have noticed a couple of strange dents in the upper rear of his skull. They are each about the size of a plum and arranged symmetrically with a gap of about an inch between them. We do not recall them being there before, but since they are symmetrical it seems like it could just be the shape of his skull.\n\nWe plan to have a doctor take a look but with the pandemic we are not sure when that will be, so I thought I would ask you fine folks; does this sound NF related? Have any of you heard of anything similar? NF2 here, and with lots of brain surgeries...my skull is lumpy as fuck. Is that due to the surgeries or despite them? I am just back from the appointment with my son. His primary co-ordinator for NF issues is the oncologist, who is apparently very respected in his field but his bedside manner is... lacking. He was already having a bad day because his phone line was not working, and when we got in he discovered he was also locked out of his computer! So he felt around on my son's head, looked at the articles on calvarial dysplasia my wife showed him and said \"Yep, that is what he is got alright!\"\n\nSince he was not able to access his computer he could not look at any old scans to compare to what he could feel. He said he would take a look when he gets access and let us know if he thinks there is anything unexpected, but in the mean time not to worry. Just wear a helmet when cycling.\n\nWe are seeing his spinal surgeon in a couple of weeks so we are going to request that the scan/x-ray for that includes the skull. How frustrating to be waiting for an appointment only to be dismissed and mistreated. I hate that. \n\nI would send a follow up email, an appointment recap if you want, very polite, thanking him for his time (do not mention his rush or distracted manners more focused on phone/computer issues) , saying it was reassuring to hear from him that the dents are most probably calvarial dysplasia and that you will be looking forward to hearing from him what the next steps are, such as a confirming x-rays and were he to recommend a review in 6 months, it would be a pleasure for you to see him again.. Regards, bla bla . Feeding a doctor's ego . \n\nYou need to know something else. Doctors HATES being handed information and print outs from google/pubmed, ....so next time, memorise the terms, and first wait for the doctor to have a go and if he is clueless, say that in the NF1 book you have at home, it mentions this sign could be xyz , does it look like it to his eyes.  But going to the doctor's office with sheets will turn most appointments sour. \n\nCalvarial dysplasia does not require intervention in most cases, and the doctor did not appear shocked at their size, so overall this is what you should take from that appointment . Another NF1 random thing that looks strange, but carries no danger or issue.", "More and more tumours? Has anyone experienced having  more and more tumours show up lately??\n\nI never ever had this many tumours when o was younger. But all of a sudden, I have got about 20 or so on my back and mire popping up on my legs and arms. \n\nI have not changed anything except mostly cutting out sugar and eating more healthy (lost 15lbs) \n\nBut I do not know why all these tumours are now popping up. \nIt is painful and frustrating How old are you? I had just a few when I was a teenager but once I hit my early twenties and went thru a pregnancy, it is gotten worse but about 100%.  I am in my early 30's now and an completely covered on my back, stomach, chest, and neck. I am 25, will be 26 at the end of the year. It is been probably the last 6 months or so that they are popping up more rapidly. I just had four removed in September You should speak with your Neurofibromatosis specialist about any changes in your health. I too have Neurofibromatosis and have seen an increase over the years, unfortunately this condition can effect everyone differently and these types of tumors can increase in both number and size over time. When I saw him he was not concerned because they are not big. They are small ones. Which was frustrating If they are staying small consider it a good thing, I have large massive in my leg and several other large ones through out my body and then in both 2014 and 2018 I had some turn cancerous, thankfully they were removed.\n\nJust be sure to be honest with your Neurofibromatosis specialist about any changes,  new tumors, any size increase and of course any changes in pain and make sure to keep up with MRI scans. I typically have mine done yearly and go to Chicago to see my specialist about 1-3 times a year. Yeah I have my MRIs once a year and see my neurologist every 6 months That is good. I have been meeting more and more people who say that the tumors really started showing up in their 20s and 30s. I was always told puberty, pregnancy, and menopause, but so far this is true to my experience. I have had a lot show up in the past ~5 years or so (currently 28). I know it is vain, but it is been something to grapple with after thinking I would not have to worry about it for a couple of decades. Here als in 30's and more and more popping up :( i would do everything if i could stopped them from growing ... Even stop eating my favorite food   or do not know... Weight loss can make deeper fibromas appear more visible.\n\nI lost almost 40 pounds over the course of 6 months due to some non NF related health issues. Went from having ~5-7  subcutaneous fibromas close enough to the surface to be visible on each thigh to having 15-20. Regained most of that weight and they are not as obvious anymore.\n\nThat said NF is progressive and there is always a possibility for increased number /size of growths. Another important reason monitoring of growths is important. On the plus side this means we can all have our NF, and eat our cake too... 25 here as well, and yeah they have started coming a bit faster, but nothing too dramatic. I am getting maybe 3-8 new ones a year that I notice, and often times they are too small to where I do not end up noticing them (read: adding them to the mental list of fibroma locations) for months / years (I am not constantly poking and prodding every inch of myself in an attempt to locate them) I am in menopause and have noticed more. Trying to stay positive. Never had kids. I also recently lost 15 or 20 pounds. I had lost then gained it back a few years ago. I feel like when I am thinner I can see the bumps more than when I am heavier.  I am 5\u20195\u201d and 129 pounds. When I was heavier (about 150 or so) I did not notice them as much. Can I ask why you did not have kids? Was it related to your NF? \n\nIm at the point where my partner and I have talked about possibly not having kids due to my NF1 and wondering others reasons. It was a big reason why I did not want to have children. I had an older brother (now deceased) who had a brain tumor that was related to NF. After surgery he was mentally restarted. He had the capacity of an eight year old.\n\nI decided when I was very young that I did not want to pass on my genes and possibly have a child with NF. \n\n It is a difficult decision and I wish you the best of luck. I noticed since the last 10 months more popping up... Do not know why they come up ... Maybe the age in my 30's... But wish they could go away.... They are also in my face , you see them in some light very hard and in other light not that much. But for me it is all i see,cannot see anything else... Do you guys now if you can remove them if they are small by co2!?", "What information can treat NF1 coffee spots abroad Hello, I am from China. It is nice to meet you. Now China has also conducted a number of studies on NF1, including drugs and gene therapy. I hope to share information about NF1 disease with you in the future. Would you like to ask if there is any treatment for needle coffee spots abroad? Our domestic non-governmental organizations are studying in this direction.", "making a discord hello! i was thinking of making a discord for college students with similar interests. (ex: anime, manga, games like genshin impact, omori, rhythm games, etc). it is hard to make friends with my anxiety. i do not know how to use discord well, so if anyone would like so start a discord with me, that would be helpful! here is the link: ", "Has anyone read any books on NF? I have been looking for books on NF, mainly NF1, but my library does not carry any on the subject and the only option on Amazon is *Neurofibromatosis: A Handbook for Patients, Families and Health Care Professionals* that is $92. So expensive! And may be a bit outdated, being from 2005. Any recommendations? Start here..... I will keep adding books as I find them.\n\n Thanks, Mom2MandJ! So far I have been able to download two articles from the first 50 or so links. It seems my local libraries do not carry most of the books, though, unfortunately. I really appreciate your help. Any book is likely to be out-of-date, especially with the advent of cheap and fast genetic sequencing.  For example, when my son was first diagnosed last December, half of websites still said that there was no genetic test for NF-1 (which is obviously false).  Every single website that mentions genetic testing as available qualifies it by saying that there is nothing that can be known from which mutation you have.  However, the genomics lab at UAB has just identified two mutations which, if you have them, you are guaranteed to NOT get cutaneous neurofibromas.  See the last paragraph (\n\nWhat is your motivation for looking for a book, as opposed to reading journal publications as they appear on pubmed?  Is there any information specifically you are looking for?  I have been doing a ton of research into current therapies and research as my son was diagnosed last December. I was hoping there would be a compendium on the subject, perhaps, or books written by a foremost expert of NF, or even books detailing personal experiences of those with NF. Someone very close to me has NF1 and I would like to gain a better understanding. \n\nThe two areas I am most curious about are cancer prevention, as it seems NF has a high lifetime incidence of cancer, and any breakthroughs on genetic testing. \n\nThanks for the link and suggestions. I will continue researching more online, too. Dr Korf is one of the foremost experts on the condition, he updates his blog monthly and his work is often cited in academic journals. \n\nThe current area of anti cancer agents being studied for NF1 are protein kinase inhibitors. They are a new class of drug that target specific genes. The promising inhibitor for NF1 are MEK inhibitors. There is a study published in the new England journal of medicine last December where over 70% of the population saw &gt;20% reduction in plexiform tumor size. Prior to this, no drug was able to even halt tumor growth. Not chemo, nor radiation. \n\nAnother interesting area of study are read through drugs - they tell the body to ignore premature stop codon mutations, responsible for ~25% of NF cases. PTC therapeutics is the company leading the way in this class of drugs although NF is not currently in their pipeline. Dr Korf's lab is working on read through therapy for NF1. ", "Acne...? Does anyone with enough experience bad acne? I have been seeing a flare of break ups recently on my face primarily and scalp sometimes and they can get pretty bad. What is your hygiene routine? Do you use only soap? Products? I use a couple different face washes and cleansers I assume you have tried several kinds for different types of skins? I had some acne when I was but a wee redditor, but I got it under control with clearasil.", "I need advice So I went on a date with a coworker today and he asked me to be his girlfriend I accepted. The thing is my NF has not come up. Should we do anything he would certainly see or at least feel a large tumour on my leg. It is not obvious in any of the clothes I wear. How do I bring this up to him. have you been in a similar situation how did it turn out Be honest about it. Most people try to understand. It is better to discuss early on instead of later once you get attached. It could be a deal breaker, especially if you have decided against having children.  Just be honest with him. It is not your fault that you have a tumor on your leg. That is one of the things that comes along with NF. I also have the disease and I do not let things bother me. That kind of positivity is one of my strengths. If he truly loves for who you are, he should look past those kinds of things. My wife has NF. Could not have cared less after she told me.  i told my boyfriend soon after i moved to be with him, he said i almost gave him a heart attack because he thought it was going to be something bad. he said he did not care at all/never noticed. when i had surgery to remove some of then he tried his hardest to be understanding and was there for me as much as i needed him to be. if this guy truly cares about you/likes you, it will not matter :)  As everyone says, just be honest. I would advise doing so in a more casual setting, not waiting til you are both naked. It is a vulnerable position to be hit with so much seriousness but being told before would not matter.   \u201cHey I have some I want to tell you. I feel really comfortable with you, so I feel like opening up. You notice I have a bump on my leg. It comes from this genetic disorder called NF1. Feel free to look it up and we can talk about it later. Or if you have some, which I totally understand..ask me now.\u201d\n\nThen just be honest. Relationships are about being open and honest with your partner.  Thank you all for your advice it really helped.  He said it did not matter to him and he was pretty cool about it. Thank you all :)", "Hey! I am not disgnosed or anything like that but i have noticed more cal spots apearing around my body and a lump on my thigh. I have about 6 cal spots.\nIs this something i should see a doctor about? You can speak with your primary care doctor about it, I would until then avoid googling stuff up, that will only drive you crazy. do not be googling shit. its just going to cause you stress. \n\nAlso try to go see either a geneticsts or neurologist.\n\nkeeping my fingers crossed for you that its not NF. Definitely go see your doctor. Redditors will not be able to diagnose you, only a doctor will.  What im worried about is that my doctor wont even know what NF is its super rare in my country only about 3000 reported cases That is unfortunate, I am sorry.", "Constipation Hello, this is rather embarrassing to ask about but my whole life I usually only have a bowel movement once a week. I drink enough water and eat right but no matter I do my body does not expel much. Occasionally I might go twice or three times a week but it is rare. I have my doctor's prescribed laxitive but It does not do anything for me. Does anyone have any ideas? Those medicines \u2014oxy and koselugo, especially\u2014can cause bowel problems. I have taken miralax and also Metamucil to help with that. \n\nIf prescription laxatives do not work, I honestly do not know what to tell you. \n\nMy doc suggested the miralax and that is safe enough to take daily. Take Miralax. I am also on Oxycodone and Gabapentin for nerve and cancer pain.  I have the same issues because of the pain medication. It works. I now go at least once a day. I do exactly the same as Summer fun. Miralax + soluble fiber. The key is to be consistent. For me it is key to keep my stool well hydrated and moving. \n\nAnd in talking to my doctor, she said bumping up to Miralax 2 times a day is doable for a period. Just really got to drink tons of water.\n\nMay I ask what your stool consistency is? Like how dry is it? Is it more ferm and dry? or Like a Hershey bar you left in your car on a hot day? While it could be the medication, it is also possible something else maybe going on as well. I know one of the things my nf specialist always ask me is if my bowl movements have been fine. Mine always have been, but it is something I am questioned about. Do you have MRIs regularly? If you Google image \"poop chart\" I would be between a 3 and 4, so it is mildly mushy but not dry Every 6 months for mri Okay, that is good. Full body? Full body except for head That is good. If there was some sort of blockage causing the issue that should show up on the mri. The only things I can come up with as to why you are having constipation issue is either do to medication or something with your diet. I know many years ago, my brother \n( does not have nf) had an issue with constipation and it was because he was not getting enough fiber in his diet.\n\nI would definitely talk with your doctor, as something is going on. I hope they are able to figure out what is going on. I am the opposite. Although since my last operation, it now can be both.  \nMaybe ask your doctor for a different kind of laxative? There has to be one that works for you. \nHow is your diet? Try pure Aloe Vera Gel. It assists in keeping the stool soft and live raw probiotics to help replenish the bacteria in your digestive system. If you have started taking the Miralax wean your body from it or your intestine stop absorbing fluid.", "Hands are getting worse. Has anybody had a problem with their hands? Just within the last month or so, my hands are burning and they feel like they are being stabbed with needles, especially my joint on my right pointer finger knuckle. I have tried Advil and nothing helps the gabapentin does nothing to help it. I cannot get in the see my pain management doctor until next Monday. What is scaring me is that this is getting worse and worse, and my arms feel extremely heavy all the time.  I do have tumors in my neck and down my arms. I feel like my body is completely giving out on me. Things stayed steady for years, but it seems like as soon as I turned 40, everything is going downhill. especially when you have over 100 in your body.  Every part of my body is riddled with tumors.  The only good part is that almost none of them are visible That is good. I too have them all throughout my body. I just looked at Facebook memories and it was exactly one year ago today that I finished my treatment. Wow. Time flys tell me about it I spoke to my neurosurgeon about that last year, he said, I will need it removed sooner or later.  It is at C-6 on the left side.  He told me that should not be what is causing the problem in my right arm and hand, because it is on the left.  The problem with my left arm is that from my shoulder down the arm feels really weak as if I just lifted weights. What scares me is the fact that I helped take care of my elderly parents at 79 and 75. I am scared that if the surgery weakens my arm more, and if I am going to have a recovery, I will not be able to help my parents out. I am sure you know it is a very stressful situation. I do not want to worry them.  \n\nMy bitch of a sister thinks that when I talk about my health with my parents, I am making everything about me and that my situation is stressing my parents out and making them sicker.  I just do not know what to do I really do not You REALLY know what your talking about, and I thank you for it.  I am going to have to really talk to my neurologist and neurosurgeon and ask a lot of questions. I am at a desk job typing all day too. Going through what I think is similar.

She has NF and her finger beds are getting worse and worse. It is like a dull pressure pain underneath her finger nails at random times. Sometimes she will lightly tap her nail on something by accident and it will put her in crippling pain for minutes.  When she was younger the doctors thought it was tumors under her nails so they took off her nails but there was nothing. She does not want to go through that again and she cannot find a doctor to tell her why she is feeling this pain or give a solution to the problem. \n\nSo my question is, has anyone had anything similar and are there any remedies to ease her pain? She already takes medical MJ for other NF problems she has but says it does not help with her fingers. \n\nThank you so much for reading. Hi there, my mum and I both have NF, and my mum suffers through this too. \n\nShe probably does have tumours under her nails. They are called Glomous tumours, they are *very* hard to see, often as small as a grain of sand and up to a grain of rice. Their colour can make things difficult, as it can be the same colour of the skin. MRIs do not often show them, but an Ultra Sound will. \n\nGentle warm running water helps for when the pain strikes. \n\nWe cannot recommend any doctors as we are in Australia, and she was not able to find a doctor to look into things until we moved back from the States. Thank you for replying! I will definitely look into that type of tumour tomorrow. Sorry, you are saying you were not able to find a doctor in Australia or in the states? Hi there!\n\nYou are welcome! My mum was not able to find a doctor in the States, and it took a long time for our doctors here to do anything. The MRIs showed something, but they eventually had to do an ultra sound. \n\nShe did have surgery to have the removed, but since they are so hard to see, we do not think the doctor got them all, though he did do a good job. She still has pain in her fingers. Oh wow that is rough. If you do not mind me asking how old your mom is? And how invasive the surgery was? I ask because my mom is getting older and I am not sure how she will fair with a rough surgery. There is pain in all her fingers except her thumbs. Fingers are obviously important but she loves to do her crafts and we would not want anything bad to happen where she would not be able to do those anymore. Mum was 55 when the first one was removed, and it took a couple of times because the first surgeon could not find it. After surgery, she has lost a nail, but it always grows back. On one finger (the pinky), the nail now grows split, due to damage, but it does not stop her from doing anything. (\"It just looks ugly\" she says).\n\nIt is done under general anesthetic, and mum said it is not invasive. They sometimes need to remove the nail to get to the tumours.  She has never had to stay over night. \n\nIt is best if she can find a hand surgeon that knows how to deal with fingers and has worked with Glomous tumours before. \n\nI am assuming that you are in the States? Where abouts are you? Thank you for the info. Yeah I am by New York. You are welcome. I hope everything goes well! The best natural remedies for my pain which was chronic and debilitating (I mean days in bed at a time, every week)! I drastically reduced my consumption of sugar &amp; inflammatory foods.

I am only looking for a friend with benefits and I thought this would be the best place. I have had two previous hookups from craigslist  they were both good and a few first meetings that were ok.

The last two guys that I did hook up with that kind of how it went down and awkwardness because we both knew when we were there.\nWell this time in the ad I posted looking for more long-term friends with benefits situation somebody I have a good sexual attraction with and that I can push boundaries.\nWell I got 100 messages at least and quickly narrowed it down to one...

Definitely the potential is there.\nSo the problem is my neurofibromatosis. I am not disclose this to him because if he googled it the images of it will fucking freak him out. I do have noticeable small lumps on many areas of my skin I am completely self conscious of this.

She has a mole in the middle of her right armpit, and has 5 cafe au lait spots over her body of various size. She definitely has some ADHD issues as well. Only thing is that all her cafe au lait spots are extremely faint. So faint that I only noticed her first about 6 months ago and it was not until I did a full exam of her body recently did I realize she had more. All the Google images and NF1 info shows pretty typical darker cafe au lait spots. While we wait for a doctor appointment just wondering if it is normal for cafe au lait spots to be so light in color. 100%. Cafe au lait spots can come in a large variety of sizes and color fades. I have got multiples that are close to my skin color, and others that are almost as dark as moles. Everyone is different! Seconded. My son is blond and has extremely light skin, and his CALs are all barely one or two shades darker than his skin tone. He also has one that covers most of his back, and honestly looks like a (light) tan until you start tracing the outline. I believe all shades count as far as cafe au lait spots go. On another note, are ADHD and NF related? I have had NF1 my whole life (I am now 31) but I was never tested for ADHD. My son has several dark spots but many that are so light you can barely see them. Yes, a lot of mine start to disappear with tan. they can vary. I have some very light ones and some very dark ones. nf is different for every person I have one on my foot that is almost the color of my skin (and I am VERY pale), one on my side that is pretty dark (almost as if you added a teaspoon of milk to coffee) and some that are tan. They are all pretty light now though because they are on my belly and have stretched due to being pregnant.", "For those of you who have had surgeries to remove tumors from your spine, have you ever had to have spinal bone fusion? I am having this done next Tuesday.  I have not had it done but I hope you have a save surgery. I have tumors on my spine and I fear one day I am going to have to have surgery I had spinal fusion when I was 7 for scoliosis. May I ask what led to this? I to have NF1 and have tumors all in my spine, the pain is getting worse trying to get my scans and move forward but seems like doctors do not want to help or believe me. I have been getting weaker and on worse pain. After my pain management soc saw my last MRI he said \"it is not going to get any better, it has to come out\".  My neurosurgeon feels confident doing the surgery I hope it helps and hope the surgery goes well. Being in pain daily sucks. I was advised against it by my neurologist. She said: \"the areas above and below may have worse problems after fusion.\" My wife had a fusion done in her neck area. Wedge around C3-C4, and we have a second surgery coming up to have her tumors removed and have rod placed. She will retain some movement in neck,  and her curvature will be nearly corrected. Best part, she should recover most of her mobility. I have recovered most of my ability as far as movement. I have lost a little bit of strength in my left arm and my right hand. I have some loss of sensation in my left fingers. I know as you well as know that I am going to have to be careful of my neck for the rest of my life.

But isolating your self and hoping some redditor will give you some magical arrangement of words that will fix it is not going to help.... Most places have communities you can reach out to...

While NF may be contributing to the issues you are facing mentally, you need professional help in the form of counseling to work out your mental health. Nobody here can do the work for you or fix it, it is up to you. Keep your head up.\n\nMost people do not know what NF is. Do not assume that you are an outcast just because a majority of the population does not even know you are going through something medically. I know life might seen rough for you right now but a lot of us have been in the same situation.

", "Cafe Au Lait spots on toddler led me to NF... I currently have a 16 month old girl who I have noticed has developed multiple cafe-au-Lait spots\u2014one large one on her arm, 2 small ones on the same arm...and was born with a small one on her forehead. I was looking up these spots on google (I know, shame on me) because i was curious if having multiple spots was normal...which lead me to reading about NF. I am pretty nervous that she is going to have it (she is developing normally, smart, active, social and verbal little girl) we are in the US with military health care so I am not sure what it would be like to do the testing or how to go about it but I plan on bringing up my concerns to our pediatrician. Any parents here who have gone through the process? I am so nervous for her...Should I get tested? Is this something caught on genetic screenings done in pregnancy that they missed? Talk to your pediatrician and go from there. WebMDiagnosing is not alway helpful. Your ped will know what to look out for and if she needs to see a geneticist. Will do, hoping my pediatrician will be more attentive at this next appointment \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb I wish I did not google birthmarks now so I would not be stressing until this appointment! Do not stress. It is something we know a lot more about now. I am in my 30s and have lived with NF all my life. I had great doctors and live a fulfilled life even having multiple surgeries. \nOne step at a time. Hope the appt goes well. I would get the test and go from there with your pediatrician. I was a military brat and when comes to NF my experience was very good in diagnosis and treatment. This was almost thirty years ago and just when NF was really being studied and diagnosis were being developed. I am sure treatment protocols and access have greatly improved since then, and you will be put on the right path if your daughter is diagnosis. I would speak with her doctor and do not jump to any conclusions until a doctor checks her out. Her pediatrician may need to do a referral if they determine there is good cause to get further testing. I myself was not fully diagnosed until I was 15, even though when I was born because of birth marks and my eye it was believed that I might have it, but result were inconclusive. I was tested again when I was nine, but with the same results. For now I would stop looking things up on the internet, that will just drive you crazy. \n\nBest of luck to you and your family Lots of people have cafe ole spots and do not have NF. I am ~30 years old and multiple family members have Cafe Ole spots and they have never developed another symptom of NF1. I am the only one who is now met a clinical diagnosis because I started experiencing pain at 30 which led to the discovery of a Neurofribroma.\n\n I lived 30 years not knowing a thing. My grandfather has the spots he is 80, no issue, my father and aunts are in their 50s and 60s no issues. My brothers are in their 20s no issues. They all have spots, Nothing has come up.\n\nSo it is good to be aware of it and keep an eye on everything. Talk to your pediatrician and make sure they are aware of it. Theres no need to jump to assuming your child has NF1. And remember pictures online are many of the most extreme and visible cases. They do not take pictures of the people who have small, completely benign fibromas hidden inside their body. They take pictures of the visible and extreme cases. It is very unlikely your child will end up with many visible fibromas covering their skin. It is more likely your child will have nothing. \n\n If you looked at me you would have absolutely no idea I have NF1 or have a very large tumor growing inside me. (I am a normal height and skinny) \n\nI started experiencing pain at 30 years old and it was discovered I have a fibroma that is causing the pain. I took a genetic test and it came back negative. So I am sort of in a really odd spot. Where we are not even 100% sure that I have NF1. \n\nSo again, the Cafe Ole spots are just something to watch for. They could mean nothing at all. Keep in communication with your doctor, monitor the size and number of spots, it is unlikely that other signs will show up soon.\n\nYou do not need to take the test, because although it is genetic,  very often this can occur as a random mutation. Meaning only your child has this gene pattern. So getting yourself tested does not rule out everything. \n\nIf you do need to get tested, I just did it 3 weeks ago. With insurance it cost 100$ without I think it was ~200. All they do is collect saliva. \n\nGood luck and stay calm. Talk to your doctor and continue to monitor everything. Hi the only one who is now met a clinical diagnosis because I started experiencing pain at 30 which led to the discovery of a Neurofribroma, I am Dad\ud83d\udc68 I am not a parent but I have nf1 myself.  I have had it reasonable light.  I have had a couple tumors and I am blind in one eye, but I do not have any mobility issues or developmental issues.\n\n50% of cases are new cases so it its a possible that you have it but based on the fact you do not have multiple symptoms, I would say it is unlikely that you have it but it is good to be informed.  But it would probably be wise to have your daughter tested to be able keep an eye out for more symptoms that may develop.  Talk to your  pediatrician and take it from there.\n\nFrom my own experience do not worry too much for her, know what to look for and do not scare her about this disease, it will not help anything and could make things worse. Thank you so much! I am hopeful that our pediatrician has NF on her radar and does not just write this off as \u201cnormal\u201d without at least taking into consideration that this could be NF\u2014I want to make sure if my kiddo has this that I am on top of it\u2014I have read posts with moms saying their kids do not have NF but do have multiple CALS (we are at five right now but I cannot measure them so I am not sure if they fit the criterion). Keeping my fingers crossed. I have some family members that have one CAL spot and I have an identical twin sister who has 3. I myself have none that I am aware of (I do have lots of freckles and moles so who knows what is hidden among them!). We are sitting at five spots but I believe one (without being able to actually measure) fits the size requirement even though it is fairly jagged. She is still too young to understand why mom keeps checking her skin over. I am not concerned about myself, just her and I am hopeful she is just in the category of \u201cspotty, but no NF\u201d. It is hard to say, for some people it can be hard to diagnose and things do not really take off until puberty. That is what happened with me. Hopefully your child\u2019s doctor will be able to help you out, I know that my pediatrician always believed I had it, but it could not ever be confirmed until I was 15, but she always had it on her radar and was keeping an eye out. Cafe au lait spots are very common in children. Especially in children who have fair skin and red hair, or have parents of different ancestry, with one having darker skin than the other. (  Is it your case? \n\nIn Nf1, the spots are quite distinct. The second a child removes his top, the doctor can see them. If you have to move the child under a certain light, or a certain angle and point it to the doctor, it is just hyperpigmentation. Another characteristic to note, is that in NF1, cafe au lait spots do not usually appear on the face, but mainly the torso, buttocks, and lower extremities.  They are round or oval with very smooth borders. If the borders are teeth like a saw or spikes or even any other irregularity, it is not a typical nf1 one. \n\nThe Nf1 gene is not part of the pregnancy genetic screening so nobody missed anything. \n\nI am sorry for you and all those parents who go through terrible anguish because of a google algorithm. \n\nI hope I was able to reassure you a bit before your next appointment. Thank you so much for this info, seriously. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffbHers are pretty jagged and faint so I am hoping it is like you said and just some hyperpigmentation with no underlying issues.

So I was finally able to get my daughter to a specialist, and he basically confirmed that she had enough to confirm a NF or Legius Syndrome diagnosis. He was leaning towards Legius because he said one CAL spot was freckling in a specific way that seemed to be more of a Legius characteristic. However, he said that the only way to know would be to test, so we did. We are getting results this Friday. He made it seem as though if she has Legius that it is no big deal and that she will not need a specialist. Is that correct as far as you all know? Anyone with Legius that could give me some info about your experience? Thanks so much! I am on pins &amp; needles awaiting the results. I had to look it up. \nThe description is that it is an NF1 like syndrome. The genetic testing gives you more clarity.", "Neurofibromin as a suppliment. So I just had a thought. If neurofibromin is a protien that we are unable to produce in our own bodies, would it be possible/ beneficial to take it as a suppliment? Similar to taking whey protein for muscle growth could taking a neurofibromin protien suppliment reduce the effects of or possibly prevent the symptoms of NF entirely? I asked an anatomy &amp; physiology professor friend this a while back. He said the way proteins work in the body does not work like that. It takes protein in, breaks it up, and builds it back into what it wants/needs. So, if we take a protein that is built in the structure of neurofibromin, our body will break it down into its pieces and redistribute/rebuild the proteins it as it sees fit. \nSorry if this is not the most accurate explanation, I am recalling a conversation from about 4 years ago when I had the exact same question. Whey protein is literally just the protein extracted from cow milk. It is not specifically for muscle growth. Muscles are mostly made of proteins so eating more helps you build it faster, presuming you are also exercising those muscles. \n\nThey would have to be able to build neurofibromin in the lab. Proteins are not just like a vitamin. They are incredibly complex molecules. They are made up of sometimes hundreds or even thousands of amino acids, building blocks of proteins which are smaller molecules. And then even if they could build this synthetically, you could not take it orally because your digestive system would break it down into individual amino acids. Because our bodies cannot do anything with any of the proteins we eat. Firstly they are too big to even enter our bloodstream from our digestive system. But also, what is our body supposed to do with protein made by a broccoli plant? In theory getting it through an IV would solve this problem but I am guessing neurofibromin is not a protein floating around the blood and is instead a protein that lives inside nerve cells. If that is the case there is be no way to get it into the cells it needs to get into.", "My spinal tumor is choking me out. I am desperately trying to get someone to put in the MRI order, but everything has gone batty. \n\nThe Urgent Care doctor did what tests they could and told me there was nothing they could do outside of pain medication.\n\nIt started with hip pain and now it is my full lower back. A week and a half.  \n\nPeople do not understand and either overreact (ie: the \"all tumors are cancer\" alarmists), assume it will be easy to take out with surgery, or think I am lying.\n\nThe vision of a future without walking is flashing in my face, and while in the end, that is ok, I currently have a lovely second floor apartment, and daydream about my years as a ballet dancer.    No doctor has said it directly, but I know it is highly possible.\n\nI just want  a quiet  warm back rub and kindness. I am a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:\n\n-  (\n\n&amp;nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and do not vote in the other threads.) ^\\((/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^(/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))* I have tumors removed from my cervical spin over 10 years ago, but a great surgeon in Chicago. I also have Neurofibromatosis. If the tumors were not removed they said I could have woken up one day unable to move my legs. The tumors on my cervical spine were not cancer, but I have had cancerous tumors both in 2014 and 2018, I had those tumors removed in my upper right leg and upper right arm. All very successful.\n\nHang in there. If you have questions let me know. The neurosurgeon I saw over a year ago when the tumor was first noted said it was inoperable due to how close it is to my spinal cord.  I am terrified but at least there is a chance of the MEK inhibitors working if I get put on a trial.\n\nOr maybe these symptoms are something unrelated, but Urgent care did a bunch of physical exams and felt it was near certainly  tumor related If they refuse an MRI again, tell the doctor to put your request and their refusal into your chart. \"I need you to add your refusal for my MRI request into my chart, and I want to see you do it, so when I talk to the insurance I have everything documented.\" That will get them to do the MRI quickly. I work in healthcare, and also have NF. The amount of patient advocacy you have to do for yourself can wear on you, and it is already enormously stressful when you have something chronic that you are dealing with. I am sorry you are going through this right now. \n\nIn the meantime, are there any positions that help with the pain? Something like laying down with your feet up the wall to flatten your sacrum? Sometimes doing that relieves pressure on parts of my spine, and is calming while doing my deep breathing. I know it helps when I start spiraling with my health anxiety, it might bring comfort to what you are going through. Thank you.\n\nI am putting in a request for a care manager to be added to my team for that reason.  I am running out of energy for self advocacy and the brain fog from whatever mystery thyroid disorder I have.  I have no person I trust to assist me, and I do not need someone to take over- just be my metaphorical balance aid to keep me going.\n\nI am icing and heating it as I can.  Adjusting my sleep position day to day until I find the one I wake up in without immediate pain.  \n\nI will try that stretch. Tonight, I am trying having my legs elevated My doctors been looking into getting me into a trial as well. I hope for the both of us that it is the miracle people are hoping for Yes, let us hope. Sounds like a plan! I know having a plan can be reassuring, even if you do not know the outcome.\n\nKind of a coincidence but, in addition to my NF, I also have Hashimoto's! The two can create some really weird symptoms. Having both made it hard for the doctors to diagnose, especially with the autoimmune side having a tenancy to swing to both extremes. It can make it extra difficult for doctors to try to figure out which direction to go. One thing really helped me, and might hep you, has been to make a journal of everything going on, and then try to see if your labs match your symptoms in the journal. Confirming what is going on, to what the doctors could actually see and understand (labs), helped legitimize my complaints. Showing that you know what you are talking about will give you the validation that is hard for the doctors to give, and it will help them understand your unique situation to better help you in the future. \n\nBest of luck! My regular doctor is wonderful when she is available, and my brain is fuzzy, but I think she ran the tests for Hashimotos  on my request and it came back negative.  But no one can figure out my thyroid. Everything test comes back low, even the ones that are supposed to be if x is low Y is high, so my PCP theorizes it is related to my rathkes clef cyst.  I am gaining weight rapidly and have constant dark bags under my eyes...\n\nBut God right now my spine is burning.  My hip feels like I skinned it.   First thing tomorrow I call in for an emergency appointment and park my ass there.  Maybe print out the forms I need for record transfer at the community center.\n\nBut right now I am miserable and cannot decide if sleep, food, or pain is the priority They ordered the MRI (after I made it clear that I was not happy with another \"well your bladder is not failing so it is fine\") and sent me with lidocaine patches.\n\nThank you I had an intraspinal ependymoma in my C2 brain stem/spinal cord removed 6 years ago. It was done by (a now retired) Robert Spetzler at Barrow here in Phoenix. He saved my life because the tumor was *inside* the cord and they had to partially sever it to remove it; I was told there was a very large possibility I would die, and totally be paralyzed without question. But I am neither.\n\nSearch for someone who will order those MRIs and have them sent to a Dr. Lawton at Barrow at St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital in PHX. He is Spetzler\u2019s protege and who I now see. They will fix you up nice :) Oh bless you, I will make sure I do.  \n\nI just officially got a care manager to help me send records around, and I will save this name just in case my NF team/etc is stuck", "New optic nerve Glioma developed as an adult (29F) Hi there. Has anyone here developed an Optic Nerve Glioma as an adult? I know it is more common for it develop as a child\u2026I have had many MRIs in the last 10 years, the latest MRI (a month ago) revealed one on my right side. I would say that I have had an increase in visual disturbances (floaters, flashes, eyes going out of focus easily) and headaches. I also need to wear glasses for reading/driving now (I have always had perfect vision). The wait list to see a neurologist in Ontario is at least 3+ months. My doctor does not really know much about the condition and wants to hear from the neurologist on next steps. I had them as a child and am currently blind in my left eye. I believe there are also some on my right eye but they have not affected my vision; I have 20/20 in my right eye with corrective lenses. \n\nGood luck with the neuro! Also in Ontario, although it is my son that has them. He is followed by a neurooncologist and an ophthalmologist at McMaster for his gliomas and gets MRIs every 3 months (currently post treatment) . Let me know if you have any questions even though I do not have experience with an adult glioma. My daughters ophthalmologist told us they are less likely to occur as the years go by..and we should not expect them after a couple years. \n\nIs there any chance that they were missed during the  MRIs? Yeah, that is what I thought to\u2026 I had all my old MRI reports transferred to my family doctor and she reviewed them and said the Glioma was a new finding. I guess it is still possible that it was just never picked up on previous scans\u2026 I have had 9 MRIs done in the last 10 years though, so I would have thought at least 1 of them would have caught it. I am hoping I get in to see a neurologist soon! I might call and ask my doctor to refer me to an Adult NF specialist in Toronto as well.\nThanks for your reply! Thank you for your reply! Hope all goes well for your son, that must be hard as a parent! What kind of symptoms did your son have before requiring treatment? Actually none, really. He has sphenoid wing dysplasia so he was already having quarterly MRIs to follow that progression and from one MRI to the next the gliomas just kind of appeared. He was only 2 so a visual test was not really reliable so even though the ophthalmological exam revealed healthy optic nerves we went with the \"better safe than sorry\" approach.\n\nThe default treatment in Canada for NF1+ gliomas at the time was low dose vinblastine monotherapy which did not have many side effects (he still had a good appetite, did not lose hair etc) and kept everything stable.\n\nI think now they are 50/50 on vinblastine vs Trametinib and running trials to see if MEK inhibitors should now be the first line of defense against gliomas. I know many hospitals in the states now use Selumetinib before traditional chemotherapy (depending on your insurance down there obviously) I believe there is a NF1 clinic at North York General. All the best! 28 M i had the exact same thing i believe it is a new tumour behind my right eye aswell.\n\nI have noticed my vision has gotten poorer over the years but when i saw a surgeon they said they would not attempt to remove it as it is too risky.\n\nmy main concern is how it is drooping now which causes me a lot of self esteem issues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthat is something i want to get fixed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIm from Australia so our treatment options are different Thank you for your reply. Hopefully something can be done soon for you!

I sleep only in my boxers and in the morning my bed sheets and blankets would be soaked. It is pretty cold here too (from Canada). Always thought that was cuz of me being a bit obese. Never thought it could be related to NF1. Man based on what I am reading so far. It just gets better and better does not it lol ..heck I am guessing me having bigger head than normal where I can find a right fit baseball caps is related to this NF1 too eh. *SMH..*FML ..

I have gone to consultations and disclosed this info and surgeons who did not seem to be concerned. Anyone know if me getting a BA will increase my risk even more? I do not have a history of breast cancer in my family. Women with NF are advised to get mammograms after 40 due to the increased risk. So although breast augmentation might not increase the risk, it may interfer with detection as implants interfer with mammograms.  Article for info. \nWhere in the world are you? Have you got a doctor not connected to the person performing surgery you can ask for advice?in the UK I would suggest checking with a GP.  The clinic performing the surgery might not give unbiased advice. I do not know if you have a typo or if things are different in the U.K vs U.S. but here in the U.S. mammograms for women with NF are recommended BEFORE 40. It is recommended we start them at 30. US healthcare is an oxymoron. We are lucky to see a doctor yearly if that. We have people go bankrupt from childbirth. In UK we are told 40 :-) I had breast implants. Please check out BII.  Not NF related but implants can have serious effects on many people. Yeah the increased risk is mostly for the early onset breast cancer. Per my breast specialist the ongoing risk for cancer normalizes to that of the typical population at 50. We have known for a while of the increased risk of breast cancer. In 2012 researchers from Manchester UK raised the concern Nf1 women should have breast MRI from the age of 30 (  At the very least a mammogram from the age of 30. \n\nThe new NF1 book recommend early surveillance as well \n\n\u201cOther studies have shown up to a fivefold increase in the risk for breast cancer in patients with NF1, mainly occurring in women younger than 50\u00a0years, with mortality rates higher than those for women with breast cancer in the general population \\. Based on the increased risk of early-onset breast cancer in female patients with NF1, annual breast screening with mammography should begin at the age of 30\u00a0years \\. Screening with breast MRI could also be considered.\u201d  \nExcerpt From: Gianluca Tadini. \u201cMultidisciplinary Approach to Neurofibromatosis Type 1.\u201d Apple Books.  \n\nHow would implants affect surveillance? You need to read this article ( \n\nHowever you can have breast MRI with breast implants. \n\nI assume you talked to a plastic surgeon, not an oncologist, so maybe you could have an appointment at a hereditary cancer department and talk to an oncologist on how to best manage your need for surveillance with your wish of a breast augmentation and what it means long term and if there is an increase in risk. \n\nThe article I linked reports women with implants are usually diagnosed with more advanced cancer. In addition to cancer in the breast , there  might be an association between breast implants and the development of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) . \n\nIs this something women with nf1 should be more concerned than non-nf1 women? Again a question for an oncologist. \n\nI would say, take the time to talk to a doctor specialised in cancer-predisposing genetic syndromes and ask them the question, so you can make an informed decision. Agreed. Healthcare (or rather how it is funded)\nin the US is atrocious. I was commenting on the recommendations. Good luck with that. Even when you have a doctor that knows that it is the new recommendation, if you are under 40, it is VERY difficult to get the insurance to cover it unless you already feel a bump/mass, and even then you need the doctor who is willing to write the referral with the proper wording. Thanks so much this is really helpful My insurance has been covering my mammograms since I turned 30 with no question. And my PCP puts in the order every year without me even having to ask. Plus since it is considered preventative my copay is a total of $0. I have decent insurance (however I DO I pay a lot per month) but it is not a super high end plan. I am glad your experience was easier than mine! I had to fight every step of the way with my decent insurance. It was not a great feeling finding a lump in my breast, only to have to settle for a ultrasound because I was not 40, and being told that my \"risk was low for someone so young\" even after explaining to them my situation.", "Brain tumour surgery Hi I am Amy, I had surgery 5 days ago.

I would check out the hospitals in your area and see, I know one close to me has programs for uninsured or low-income individuals. They also offer a payment plan (even with insurance I have taken advantage of this). I would also talk to your doctor, they may have some ideas and cold advocate on your behalf. I will give it a shot. My regular doctor gave me a referral to the mayo clinic but they want a $5,000 deposit because I am uninsured. Are you able to get on Medicaid or disability? If so I would do that ASAP. I would also call 211/United way to get resources for you area. :) I make too much to qualify for medicaid but not enough to afford insurance. It is a bitch. I will give them a call though. I live in a different state and am unfamiliar with Florida and their ACA/medical expansion. But please look into getting some state funded insurance if it is available to you. Check on healthcare.gov to see if you qualify for insurance through the open market NOW. Depending on your situation you might. Best of luck to you! This countries pathetic excuse for \u201chealthcare\u201d is shameful and abhorrent. Go o line and check for an NF study.

I am learning that NF presents in different ways and it is hard to predict anything, but was wondering if anyone had ideas on supporting a family member? \n\nAnything I should avoid talking about? Anything I should be doing?\nHow can I be an awesome uncle?\n\nI guess I am just looking for general advice here.\n\nThank you! I think the best way to be an *awesome uncle* is to treat your niece like the individual that she is and not like the diagnose she happens to carry.\n\nAs for the relationship with your sibling and their partner, just show them that you are there for them. Really appreciate the advice. Maybe I am overthinking this a bit. I am sure I would adjust the tone of this post. Thank you. Treat them the same way as you always have. I was diagnosed when I was 15 and my family and extended family treated me no differently. Give them your full support and find out some food hospitals or doctors in the area the specialize in NF and who can help your niece. Also, tell them to give her vitamin D since people with NF cannot produce their own vitamin D. Bio 30 Bee Propolis from New Zealand has also shown to help people with Neurofibromatosis. Hope she stays in good health. It is a difficult disease to live with, but if she is surroundes by good doctors and a good family support system, then she should do well. I cannot make vitamin D? When did this happen? This is the only advice. My 7 year old was recently diagnosed with NF2 and while I am still trying to navigate my own feelings about it, my kiddo is still just as happy and bouncy and doesnt have care in the world. This is the case even after a 9 hour brain surgery. I want to encourage that happiness and hope and faith for as long as I am alive, and that is all I can do. My brother-in-law earned a special place in my heart by never treating my son any different after he was diagnosed. That being said he also became our biggest support by just educating himself. He learned everything he could. He does not bring it up unless we do but he never tries to change the subject. He goes to all the NF fundraising stuff with us and makes our whole family feel supported and loved. Yeah, children are very strong and manage to stay happy and positive even through the hardest times. Us adults are not nearly as good as they are. Your worries are understandable and completely legitimate. Stay strong and help your niece stay strong too. One thing you can do besides what has already been said, is to keep in mind that this is a lifelong chronic progressive disorder. Nobody will know the amount it will progress, or how little things may happen. That being said, it might feel like one continuous complaint when your brother is venting. Keeping in mind that each development is new to them, and means a different impact on her quality of life, will help you not develop empathy fatigue. When your niece gets older, normality will be something that she craves, and as the awesome uncle that you are, you will be one of the few individuals who can provide that. I think that you looking up her condition, and asking about it here, shows that you have a caring heart, and that you will be a wonderful part of their support team. I will follow your BIL's example here. Thank you. Thank you for the kind words. I just chatted with my sister on providing a source of normality and mentally preparing for what will be many discussions. She is currently wondering how she might introduce this to her 7 year old and 4 year old. As you say, this is lifelong, so we have got time to work out the best way to support our niece, our brother and his wife. Thank you for the pointers. I know I will be keeping up on NF research for years to come. I think I could learn something from both of you. Really appreciate your perspective. Thanks for sharing. You are already an awesome uncle, if only because you thought to ask. Pat yourself on the back", "How to best tell a child Hi, I am a mom with a 6 year-old diagnosed with NF1 since 6 months. We get annual MRIs (thank god sedation is no longer needed) but we have never really discussed why. I am scheduling her next MRI and thinking this year she will want to know why.\n How did your parents let you know? what advice do you have for me? how do i not scare her? \n any feedback much appreciated! ", "Does anyone else get shocked from their fibromas? I have had NF-1 since I was a baby, but since 2017, since I was 20, my fibromas have been shocking me. One on my side has been so bad it is driven me to tears. The shocking ones are all over. Sometimes it feels like a stab or a burn. It hurts. My bumps are starting to hurt me more and more and recently on my left arm one made me spasm and I felt like I literally lost my nerves! I have it happen upon occasion, it is been doing it since I was a teen. I am 38 now, it comes and goes, sometimes it causes my arms and legs to jerk on their own, Some of the ones on my fingers do that. My genetics doctor said that its the fibroma crushing the nerve. But he also said removing them from fingers can be tricky, hence why I still have them. Have you ever had problems at jobs or anything? Causing you to drop something? It is the fibroma crushing the nerve?! What? O.o\n\nWhy the hell have not my doctors told me that? Now I am even more stressed. If it is so frequent and everywhere then am I going to just become paralyzed one day?\n\n\n\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d I have had things fly out of my hand before at home, like food or a plate. But because of my limitations with strength and balance and not being able to be on my feet for extended periods of time, I do not have a \u201creal\u201d job. During the school year which will be starting up on the 23rd of August be heading back to work, to work at the after school care at my old elementary school. I typically work 2-3 days at week from 2:30-4:30/5. Last school year because of Covid and not having as many kids as we normally do, my hours changed a little and I was not always needed three days a week. Time will only time if we will have a repeat of last school year.\n\nIt is not much, but its something for me to do and the woman I work with totally understands and really appreciates me being there and the help that I am able to offer. Yes. Almost constantly.\n\nI have a mosaic case of NF1 - it only affects the left side of my head, as far as we can tell. I have a bunch of small subcutaneous neurofibromas around my left ear in particular. They are extremely tender to the touch and all day every day I get attacks of nerve pain. When it is at its worst, I am scared to drive. It feels like I am getting stabbed in the head/ear with an ice pick. I have a new Fibromas at the back of my head, sometimes I get these terrible stab pinch feel then they go away. I got another one on my arm which sometimes burns but nothing major. It is something I have to get use to for now. I spoke to my G.P he said to leave them alone and not much he can do about it. I Yeah, that really sucks. I do not know how I am going to go through life with my whole body shocking me. Well, I hope I can find someone just as understanding. I do not doubt it feels like that, I feel like I am being tazed or stabbed. I have some that are tender to the touch and make me yell in pain, or want to, when it happens. There is one on my leg and a couple of years ago I could not play with my niece and nephew in the tiny pool they had because of my leg. I have also been scared to drive, and I do not even drive. I am behind on that, but now I do not even know if it is worth it. I am waiting at the moment for my official diagnosis (got a genetic test at the hospital in Rotterdam). \nYes, I also have a rather big bump in my right leg (partly visible) near the muscles and some big nerve (?). That one also hurts, certainly when there is pressure on it of any kind. Thus, I always wear long jeans and prevent it getting hit (in bed, while carrying stuff etc).\nBut rarely that it hurts for 'no reason'. But that has happened yes. Since I am from Australia surgery is free provided if it get's to serious they can remove it, but have to be on a waiting list approx 6 months. I had a surgery on my right chest approx 5 years ago which has helped. What country are you from ? Canada. Have you tried using some cbd oils ? I have heard it can reduce the pain. Plus it is natural and very legal in your country. No, I have not. I will have to look in to it. I do not now about paralyzed, my finger function fine. My doctor did offer put nerve blocks in but I declined. You may want to ask if that is a viable option for you. I know some NF docs prescribe gabapentin to deal with nerve pain as well. I will ask about that stuff, too. My NF doctors had mentioned a medicine, but when I talked to my family doctor, she mentioned that it had withdrawal symptoms, and I declined. I do not know if it is gabapentin, but I will see. I have some on my fingers. Accidentally hitting my hand against anything is excruciating. I have got one on my leg that hurts if touched. I could not play with my niece and nephew in the little pool they had at my house when they lived with my family because of it. I did not want them hitting it. Have you had any of your tumors biopsied?  I have NF type 3 (schwannomatosis) and most of my tumors (30+ tumors) are painful.  I had to see an NF specialist for an official diagnosis. I have had MRIs and CT scans. I do not know how many before the shocking started, but I had a few MRIs after the shocking started and I have had to postpone 2 or 3 of them because my left leg would ache so badly because of fibromas on my leg that I had to stop the MRI. I had to get my family doctor to prescribe me sedatives, and even those did not help that much. Two or four of them.\n\nNow I am just waiting for the NF Clinic at Toronto General to open again so I can make sure they got all the recent MRI stuff and to book an appointment because the shocking is getting worse, it is stressing me out, and now ones on my arm have made my arm spasm slightly and I felt like I lost feeling in my arm temporarily.\n\nI do not have it nearly as bad as people with NF 2 or that one. I have never heard it referred to as type 3, but I guess if someone who has it says that, that it is not incorrect. I have just always read it with that different name.\n\nI am caught between feeling like shit and feeling like I should stop whining because I do not have it that bad. A balance is okay, right? I want to be upset, but I do not want to complain if I do not have it that bad. Balance is good, but it is also ok (imo) to validate your pain and feelings.  Someone is always going to have it worse somehow, but that does not negate what you experience.  Sending positive vibes your way, OP! Thank you, I really appreciate it. Right back at ya! I wish you the best. I am sorry you have this kind of pain also. It is so awful.\n\nI have had similar experiences to yours - the pain affects my life in so many ways. It is really difficult/painful to wash my hair. I avoid getting haircuts because it hurts. My husband has to be extremely careful hugging/touching me. It hurts to put that side of my head on a pillow and that makes it hard to sleep.\n\nMeds have not helped a ton for me. I had three of the tumors removed for biopsy 18 months ago (that is how I learned what they are and that I have NF), but they all grew back. Now I am having a diagnostic nerve block in a couple of weeks. If it'ssuccessful, we will do a nerve ablation to try to help the pain. I am hoping so much that it helps.\n\nCould your neurologist refer you to a neurological interventional pain management clinic, or something similar? You deserve relief! I do not know what that clinic is, so I am not sure if they could. But I suppose I will have to look into it.\n\nI am sorry that you go through that, that sounds awful.  I hope that stuff helps for you, too. I think if you asked about a referral from neurological pain management your doctor would know what you are asking for. Just a thought. I have had this pain for many years and my neuro never even mentioned this kind of procedure as a possibility. The only reason it is happening now is because a different doctor was covering for her while she is on leave, and he immediately said I need to see these pain management folks instead of just telling me to take more Gabapentin which is all my regular neuro does (she is not the best- if my town had another neurologist I would switch, but alas). Unfortunately sometimes it is up to us as patients to be persistent and ask for things.\n\nBest of luck. Another person on here mentioned gabapentin, so I will tell them about that too. But yeah, I will definitely look into that.\n\nIs that the drug that prevents the shocking and has withdrawal symptoms? The NF Clinic had suggested something and then when I asked my doctor she talked about it, but when she said there are withdrawal symptoms, I said no.\n\nI do not remember what it was called so I will have to check. \n\nI just wanted to send you that. \ud83d\ude01 Yep, that is Gabapentin. The withdrawal symptoms are why I have adamantly refused to increase my dose. If I ever stop taking it, I am already going to have a hell of a time tapering off. I tried to reduce my dose once by just a little and it was terrible.\n\nYou might ask about Tegretol. That is the other med I take for nerve pain. It does not have those atrocious withdrawal symptoms. Tegretol sounds familiar, but maybe the word just resembles other words and my brain is doing a weird thing. It kind of sounds like a Pok\u00e9mon, to be honest. \n\nI will ask about that and the other thing you mentioned.\n\nThanks, and I hope things get better for you and everyone on this subreddit or any NF group. And people who do not have NF as well. I hope everyone on Earth gets happy. But some people's happiness contradicts other people's happiness? How do we solve that?\n\nAnd now the planet is so hot that it is basically going to be FUBARed in the next 50 years.\n\nAnd all we have done is war against each other because of location, race, skin colour, sexuality, sex, gender, sports teams and noses!  And plenty more! And people just keep want to keep separating people further.\n\nNow I am just ranting about the world. I am going to go now. \ud83d\ude05\n\nTake care. You take care too. I feel the same about the world... I wish we could all just be cool to each other and the planet we all share. Oh well, it is a nice fantasy I guess. I cannot even begin to tell you how comforting this post is to me \u2764 I have a dark-colored spot on the inner side of my left thumb that shocks me/causes me intense pain a few times a day and a few days a week. The pain is often sudden and causes me to stop what I am doing and either double over, or just shake my hand vigorously to get rid of the pain. For some reason, the pain has extended into my fingertips. I always have to be careful to not bump it, and it sometimes causes me to fling anything I am holding across the room haha (I am left handed)\n\nI am not sure if this is a subcutaneous neurofibroma, but it'suseful to know that this is most likely what it is. I never fully knew if it could be related to NF, and MRI scans led to no solution, so it is reassuring to know that it is possibly related to NF, and I can mention that when I see a neurologist next.\n\nEdit: the spot is also sensitive to cold?? I guess it has to do with its affect on specific nerves I am glad to know I have helped someone so much \ud83d\ude01", "Would I be considered disabled? I have neurofibromatosis and scoliosis, I have had a full spinal fusion, tons of painful tumours in my arm, spine and back. Idk if I am allowed to use that label or not I would say you are. Of course. Either one of those would qualify you. Jessica Kellgren-Fozard *just* released a video about disability and imposter syndrome and struggling with feeling whether or not you are \"allowed\". It really got me thinking because I often say that I have a disability but do not ID as disabled because I do not feel like things are/were \"bad enough\".\n\nCheck it out!\n\n What are your surgical options to have the tumors removed? I would say yes. I got a disabled parking permit because of vertigo and fibromyalgia with no problems.....sometimes I feel bad taking a disabled spot, but will usually pull in one further away unless I am having a bad pain day....if you are going to do anything at least get that permit....it changed my life I do not really know I am seeing a doctor about it soon so I hope they can  do something Good luck It is possible, you will have to apply, chances are they will deny you the first time around, but then you can hire a lawyer. And you do not pay the lawyer unless your case is one and the pay for the lawyer is taken out of back pay you would receive. If your conditions cause you to have difficulty functioning, that is a disability. There is no gatekeeper who can tell you you are not sick enough or disabled enough.\n\nDisability is a spectrum. Some people are more disabled, others less. We often have bad days where we really struggle to function, and better days where we may function normally or close to it.\n\nNo one else gets to say whether you \"count\" as disabled... you know your reality best! I do not know why people are beating around the bush lol. 100% you are disabled. There are people on disability for depression alone(not downplaying) I am willing to bet if you have all those issues you are depressed as well. Think about it like that. I wish you the best. It may be tough. Usually, these conditions need to be severe enough that you cannot work. Here is a link that explains the scoliosis aspect. \n\n Disability is not a label.  You can remove a label. If it limits your ability in any way it is, by definition, a disability.", "NF, pregnancy and birth control So I have heard a lot about how NF changes most so during periods in your life where you go through hormonal changes, like puberty.\n\nI know pregnancy can have an effect on it as well.\n\nWhat about birth control? Since it tricks your body to think it is pregnant through hormones. Will it change how the NF affects your body?\n\nI have been on the nuva ring for 10 ish years and I kind of want to get off of it because I do not know what this hormone is doing to my body and if my natural body chemistry would be better for it.\n\nDoes anyone have any insight or experience here?\n\nI know I should go to a doctor. But with covid still being a heavy lockdown/mandate where I am it is difficult to see a doctor fast. It is on my list to do. Just wanted to discuss with individuals and their experiences. I was on the pill for 15 years+ and it did not impact my neurofibromas. Given how it effects everyone differently it would be best to speak with your doctor about it, some people can be put on it temporarily if they need to help reset their period, others can be on it long term with no issues, some do not have the option of being on it long term, because it can cause issues. Most doctors before putting you on it for any reason generally would want to do blood work before hand. Everyone is different. I was on Nuvaring for a couple years without issue. I have preferred the IUD though, also no issue but no periods has been amazing.", "Pain I am writing this while in pain. I am so sick of this pain! \n     I am taking so many different painkillers and they seem to alleviate my pain for 3 hours at best. This is so unbearable I can barely get up to walk to the bathroom. \n     The painkillers that used to work well are less and less effective after only 2 months of the effects of this condition becoming known to me. \n     Am I just unlucky that my body does not respond well to opiates or what? Is this common with NF? Pain management keeps increasing my meds but it seems to make no difference for me. \n  They have given me Norco, Morphine, and Percocet but none of it seems to work for more that 3 hours at most. I just want to sleep.  I Deal with a lot of pain too, I think I eat about 8 pills daily,  and they dosnt even work.  \n so I feel your pain, I think in general when people eat pills daily the body get used to the drugs you intake, the worst part of the all is probaly a lot of people get addictive to the painkillers that dosnt work,  :-/   \n Depending on where the pain is coming from, it may be time to consider surgery and excision.  I am just trying to make it through my mri tomorrow so they can figure out what exactly is causing this extreme pain. I am considering surgery now lol. I can barely walk and this all came up so fast.  Hopefully it is just a neurofibroma on a nerve sheath. I had one on my back and even a breeze in a loose shirt would make me feel like I was getting stabbed. One quick outpatient procedure later and I have a small scar to remember it by a am pain free. Hopefully things turn out well for you. I always advise people to get second opinions. Well worth the extra cost.  I am working on that second opinion. The new neurologist will hopefully find room for me in his schedule(he is super busy) and take a look at my MRI. I am trying to keep a positive outlook but it is hard when I am in so much pain.  Yeah addiction is a real problem and that worries me, but I cannot think about that now. I am currently taking morphine, Percocet, Norco and Gabapentin.... none of it is giving me any lasting relief. 2 maybe 3 hours of relief at most.  Staying positive can be tough. Once you start the process of getting treatment it gets easier. Keep your hopes up and do what you can to help yourself too. Between my sister and I, I eat right and exercise all I can. She eats junk and is lazy. He symptoms are 10x what mine are. I really cannot recommend strongly enough how much a healthy lifestyle is worth for us.  Weed. CBD or THC. Whichever one works for you. I do not have any access to that.  I believe CBD is nationally legal now. You can buy CBD online with no real worry.", "Hello Just joined reddit glad to see there is a page like this had NF since i was 3 hope more ppl share. Good Evening!

Hi guys! :)\n\nI have NF1 and I am so glad I found this subreddit. I was curious as to if you guys have had doctors genuinely interested in your cafe au last spots. \nI went to the dermatologist a couple of months ago to have a mole looked at and he was honestly captivated by mine, because he had never had a patient with NF before. He even called his PA to look at my freckling on my back and in the armpit area.\nHas something similar ever happened to you guys? ", "Nf1 and viagra? My husband had a spinal tumor removed 2 yrs ago. He lost some feeling in his right hip down so had to learn how to use his right leg again. He is doing great with walking. However....he has some difficulty in bed and as a result we have sex once a month now, maybe once every other month. We are in our early 30s. He has mentioned taking viagra but it worries me since from my understanding nf seems exacerbated with hormonal changes and I do not want to ever risk him having another tumor. Anyone experienced this? No, but you should talk to your doctor if you have concerns. Better that than risking the advice of some random shumck on Reddit. Best of luck to you though! Tumours will crop up out of nowhere, viagra should not impact him at all. Yea of course. But doctors do seem to make a lot of mistakes, just looking for some thoughts from others on this that we could also bring to a doctor. Nf1 could get worse when your body is going through hormonal change as a teenager. I do not think Viagra  will make this worse. But ask a doctor first and do not take my advice. Viagra is not a hormone or hormone related. It allows a greater level of blood flow.  It is intial use Pulmonary hypertension. If it is depressive sexual dysfunction, it may be beneficial. As always, talk to your doctor first. Go with him and remind him that you love him, no matter what. That Is helpful, thanks. I will bring that part up as concern as he also had a stroke a couple years before the spinal cord tumor (he has had it really rough) so should be taking baby asprin daily. Ill remind him to ask about how these all correlate.", "Neurofibroma diagnosis and no follow up So about 5 years ago I had a painful hard lump deep in my neck, a lot of doctors brushed me off, a dermatologist decided to have a go at it and remove it as a suspected cyst. Turned out to be a nerve tumor, was cut/yanked out of my neck as I was fully awake and it was the most painful thing I have experienced in my life, blacked out for a few seconds. It came back as a neurofibroma, no follow up, or anything since then, just left with questions. I actually has to call the office about the results because I never got a call back. After looking into it, I think its a Schwannoma as it was connected to the nerve itself by just one fiber versus a bundle of fibers, and it was a deep tumor versus something on top of the skin.\n\nAnyways, I have come to really dislike going to the doctor now with how much I have been brushed off and then charged an absurd office visit fee. \n\nI have 4 other lumps - one in my arm, been the same since I was a kid, non painful. One in my eye socket, very small, painful if touched, has not really grown. One at the base of my neck, feels deep, non painful and not very big. Last one is behind my ear - irregular in shape, has always been soft and non painful. Today I noticed it was hard and doubled in size, and is tender.\n\nI scheduled an appointment, but have since canceled it. I just do not want to go through this process again. I want an MRI or something but I do not want medical bill debt. I want to be okay. You should see a actual doctor who is familiar with Neurofibromatosis. I would seek out a neurologist. My concern is if you have another surgery done, by a doctor who s no familiar with removing Neurofibromatosis tumors more harm than good can happen. \n\nYears ago with my first surgery back when I was in highschool, a doctor had lied to my parents and myself about having removed nf tumors before. When he opens up my arm and basically saw the maze he had to deal with, he decided within those moments of still performing the surgery that he would never again do another surgery on me and told my mom so. For the next six months my arm turned a shade of green and felt numb. Ever since then all my surgeries have been done by surgeons who know what is Neurofibromatosis is and we are referred to me by my Neurofibromatosis specialist.\n\nI hope your able to find a doctor to help you. It is very important to keep tabs on these types of tumors.", "NF and anemia?? A few months ago I was sent to the ER because my primary care told me about my blood work that my hemoglobin was very low and I had signs of anemia.  I had three pints of blood transfused that weekend and felt better afterwards.  Lately I have been so extremely exhausted and have no energy whatsoever.  I had blood work done last week and it looks like I am definitely anemic.  I am going to start taking iron pills and vitamin c.  I read that vitamin c helps you with the absorption of the iron. \n\nMy question to you is I looked online and sore there are some articles about NF1 and anemia but from what I was looking at it looks like it is rare that there is a connection.  \n\nDoes anybody have any history with this situation? yes i took iron pills before to help and i eat more red meat so i dont have to take any pills (mostly because i forget lol) I have not been diagnosed with anemia but my ferritin level has been low enough my doctor was concerned. I tried iron supplements but they did not seem to help. Yes, the Vitamin C helps with the absorption, some iron supplements have Vitamin C in them too. I would talk with your doc about the type of iron supplement some are better than others, they can also cause tummy problems.\n\nI have not had any symptoms, my primary care fix was surprised I could get out of bed with my ferritin level, even met with a hematologist who seem led surprised by my numbers. She recommended an iron infusion (the drug name escapes my brain at the moment). It did improve my numbers. I did not feel any better after (but did not feel too bad to begin with). \n\nThe hematologist and I kind of figured I must not absorb iron well through diet and therefore supplements. We also ruled out other diet things like celiac.\n\nThe infusion and other causes might be worth a discussion with your doc.\n\nI tried to do some research about a correlation to anemia and NF but it was not very successful. I have always been told I have very good iron Actually, there seems to be correlation. \n\nWe already know that somehow NF1 cause unexplained nutrient depletion. We are low on several nutrients and even our poor diet is not enough to explain it. \n\nIn the case of iron, there is an apparent correlation with neurofibroma growth. \n\n\"Neurofibromatosis I and unexplained iron deficiency in two patients: is iron depletion related to neurofibroma growth?\" ( \n\nthe unlocked paper is here \n\n( \n\nThe conclusion of the paper: \n\n\"\" In this paper, we have reviewed several current topics connecting iron and tumor growth. Iron is an important growth factor in the cell and has important roles in the cell growth cycle. A variety of tumors experience growth retardation secondary to treatment with iron chelators or metals which block the action of iron. Patient pop- ulations with certain tumors demonstrate consistent evidence of otherwise unexplained iron deficiency. Thus, we suggest that neurofibroma growth might play a role in iron depletion. \"\"\n\nAs some of you know, a clinical diet trial that involved curcumin was successful in reducing both the size and number of neurofibroma. What many do not know, is that curcumin is an iron-chelator, it removes iron from the cells. I wonder if one of the reasons,  the trial was successful could be linked to the iron chelation effect of the curcumin. \n\nFor those who do not know the study , it is here. ( The pictures are quite impressive. It is from a lower GI bleed I have ulcerative colitis  Oh, I has hoping you were check for internal bleeding. Hopefully you are on the mend. I was in the hospital earlier this year with a lower GI bleed.  They had to give me three pints of blood.  Now I have to make an appointment to see the hematologist and follow up with him.  Was probably going to happen is I will have to go every two weeks for an iron infusion And he gave me a vitamin B12 shot to help me with the energy When this happened to me it turns out I had a tumor in my small intestine and it was making me bleed internally. I had to go to thr E.R. after a 10 day headache and feeling like I sprinted up a hill... even though I just walked 30 feet. It was definitely not normal.", "Prognosis negative? Whelp, I am posting again. Quick background:I am a 30 y.o. male and I have NF3, had a T12-L4 Laminectomy and five tumors removed from my spinal cord about 3 weeks ago with no fusion. PT says I am doing well and I have passed all the tests necessary to be discharged from home health (in Home PT). I can walk without a cane for a fair distance and stand for about 30 mins unaided. Sounds pretty dope right? THAT IS WHAT I THOUGHT!\n    \n     Here is the problem. They are telling me I cannot go back to work. My orthopedic back doc says it is not realistic to go back to my job as a cable tech. What is a boy to do? He says I am disabled and need to lawyer up and file for disability. My family\u2019s sympathy for me ran out about a week ago. Wife said I am \u201cwallowing in self-pity\u201d and that \u201cI need to stop acting so helpless\u201d, but she is on board the disability train. \n\n     I feel like absolute shit. I have no friends. I have 3 children to support and Im physically worthless. I have never felt so trapped and helpless. I do not feel loved by anyone except my children. I have already been through so much other shit besides this I just cannot handle it!! Am I really supposed to sit around the house the rest of my life cleaning up behind my wife and kids and getting bitched at? I guess I AM wallowing in self pity but it seems a fitting response to my 30 years on this earth. \n \n     I could go on and on about my many misfortunes but I cannot imagine what good it would do. I am trying to get a therapist to have someone to talk to as I have been feeling so much anger and sadness for many reasons.  Any advice for me would be awesome. Anyone have this big of a lamenectome? Anyone on disability for nf? Anyone just want to hear me complain? Literally anything at all is appreciated.\n   \nTLDR: Broke and broken, what gone do? Hopefully your condition will improve so you will be able to walk for longer periods of times.\n\nAs for your job... That is unfortunate to hear. The doctors did say you could not return as a cable tech. Did they say anything about other jobs? Maybe you could be retrained as something else. A desk job perhaps? Maybe part-time (depending on how the disability works in your part of the world)?\n\nHaving no friends is not an easy fix. Do you have hobbies? Normally I would suggest volunteering, like at an animal shelter, but given your current situation with your back, that might cause you too much pain right now. Maybe you could join Facebook groups for those with NF? Oh man, I am so sorry to hear that you have been told you cannot go back to work.  I would get that in writing from your doctor, and definitely consult with a lawyer familiar with disability cases.  \n\nAs far as the rest, I think you are on a good path as far as searching for a therapist.  Mine has been invaluable to me in helping me deal with my illness.  I hope that your PT increases your strength and mobility so you can get back to some of your regular activities. Thanks for your response. I am going to ask my leaders to consider me for other work but I highly doubt they will. The last guy who got sick and could not return as a tech was terminated. I am trying to stay positive but it is hard with everything going on. Especially with the medical bills coming in now.  Yeah it is tough. I just cannot believe I am 30 and disabled through no fault of my own. So much for my dreams of building my own cabin to live in. But the worst part is my 3 month old son will only ever know me as a disabled weakling. My father was distant at best and I promised myself I would do better well now what. I am sorry for puking all this on you but thanks for replying again! \\&gt; But the worst part is my 3 month old son will only ever know me as a disabled weakling. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhoa whoa whoa. I am going to repeat TheJunkLady's suggestion of therapy, depending on your insurance of course.\n\nHaving a disability does not mean you are a weakling. Your disability is not *who* you are. A facet of you, but not an all encompassing label. \n\nYou imagine that your son will see you as a cripple, as weak or emasculated. But imagine a different reality. Imagine instead of your son being ashamed, being inspired. Instead of saying, \"Ugh, my weak cripple dad\" he is going to think, \"My dad went through so much, with so little support, but he is still here and he is done so much for me\". Would not that be a much better lesson and ideal for your son to strive for? Not the dad who can build a cabin with his bare hands, but the dad who suffered and is still here, doing the best he can as a husband and father. Teach him that that is what REAL strength is.  Thanks, I was wrong it is actually 4 levels. T12-L3 I keep forgetting exactly what happened to me. That still seems like a lot to me. Most folks it is just 1 level. Anyway I want to do pt but I am broke. I am out of work and already owe so much money to these blood sucking people. I may still do it but idk. The bills are just outrageous and everyone expects 50/month payments after already allegedly receiving thousands from insurance.  Thanks I needed to hear that.  Both my father and his brother had Schwannomatosis, although they were incorrectly diagnosed, because this was in the 80s.  My father was paralyzed when he was 43, and I was 16.  Before that, however, he was as active as he could be with my siblings and I, and I have many fond memories of the time we spent together.  Your children will not see you the way you are seeing yourself right now, believe me.  And just because my father was paralyzed relatively young, does not mean that is what is in store for any of us going through this right now, although it is a very real possibility.  Surgery techniques have advanced so much, as well as imaging that can identify tumors before they cause paralysis.  I know it is rough to be going through this right now, but it is not as dire as it seems.  Trust me.  Is it going to be easy?  Probably not.  But at least it is possible. How much was you out of pocket maximum? I have already paid for so much out of pocket and I have the best insurance plan offered at my company (UMR) I had to pay for my first MRI outright to meet my deductible. The hospital is sending me weird paperwork saying my insurance requests more information before approving any payment on certain things. Honestly insurance is rape.  I probably have no business being in this sub. (my wife just got told she may have Neurofibromatosis and I am trying to research what that might mean)\n\nBut I wanted to second that previous comment. If you raise your kids right, they will know that character is way more important than physical ability. Show your kids that life can be tough, but you can be tougher. My father pretty much gave up when hard times hit. He was distant, like yours. *That* is how you lose your children's respect. By giving up. \n\nFind something you can physically handle, commit to it full tilt and you will have nothing to be ashamed of. Especially if that means being a stay at home dad. Think of it as the perfect opportunity to be there for your kids and wife.\n\nSorry this is completely unsolicited and a week late, but I know how exhausting a 3 month old is and I know how easy it is to doubt yourself when it comes to parenting. Just thought I would say I think you can overcome all this hardship and be a great dad. Good luck!", "Tattoos and nf2/1 So im a 21 year old male who suffers from nf2 so this is directed more towards people that suffer with this condition. I was thinking about getting a tattoo but was worried if it would affect my medical condition or MRI scans. Any information would be useful thanks \n\nEDIT: thank you to all for sharing and helping me out much appreciated  I have several. They do not affect mris that I know of. Ink is not magnetic.  Yea ive read some reports that were saying if your tattoo is older than 20 years then it might cause some pain due to magnetic ink but that isnt the case for new tattoos. I was more worried about a distorted image. Do you get MRI scans done? And also are you nf1 or 2 i understand if your not comfortable sharing \n\nThanks for your reply :)  I have 7. It has not affected anything.  Awesome. Do you have nf1 or 2\n\nThanks for the help :)  Nf1. Have not had mris in a while. My sister has tattoos and mris, but hers were kind of shitty to begin with. You will get more distortion grin with change from what I understand.  The MythBusters are your friends  I have got 22! I am covered! Never had it effect me. I have nf1, and I do not have any,  But i think they will not allow tattoos because they might can be seen on the MRI picture, so if it is a HUGE tattoo you want, I think it would be a problem, but if it is a tiny one, i dont think it can harm at all, good luck with your tattoo  How do your MRI scans show up im more worried about that. Thanks for sharing :)  I have nf1.  I have got 6 tattoos and Nf2 and they have never shown up on scans never caused me any issues whatsoever.  That Is awesome.  I wanted to get my left pec done but i get my brain and back scanned and was worried if it wousld affect the back scan in the MRI since the tattoo is placed on top of the back.  If you are worried talk to your docs but more than likely it will be no issue at all.  Completely normal. Nothing shows up on them and it does not effect them at all! I even have piercings, and I just have to remove those for the duration of the scan!  Actually I am pretty covered. My legs are completely tattooed I have half sleeves on both arms and my back done. I have never had anyone tell me I cannot have an MRI done because of tattoos.  What would if they tattooed over one my \"bumps\"? Has anyone done this or do you tattoo around that spot? I have by nf1 and have had many many mri. my tattoo looks exactly the same", "Overcoming ones voice I am new to Reddit, so I will keep this short. \n\nI am 21M college student, with NF1,  other than my loss of vision in my R-eye, and a dozen bumps (on chest, and some on arms) the biggest impact is my voice. Despite being above-average intelligence my voice is that of *\"mentality handicapped*\" (hate that phrase,but it was best fitting). \n\nI am very lonely (some days hard to get up) and am curious how many of you have voice \"problems\" and how you came to overcome them. ", "Struggling after surgery today...no support people and lonely. Just need a place to share ", "Gabapentin What has your experience been with Gabapentin?  I take 600mg 3X daily and it does help, but only a little.  It works better if I take 1,200 mg when I wake up and 600 in the evening.   I take 300mg 2x a day, and while it does not get rid of the pain completely, it does make it more manageable.  I could take more, but it makes me too sleepy and foggy headed, and I cannot concentrate at work.  Sometimes, if I know I am going to be doing something active, I preemptively up my dosage, and that seems to work.  I think that if the 1200mg in the morning and 600mg in the evening is working for you, you should keep up with that.  My doctor told me that gabapentin dosage can be a bit of an experiment with yourself. I had 6x 500mg pills daily, it didnt really help, and they made me really high,   \nbut I recommend you  take your pills right before  you eat, :-) When I take the 1,200 at once I do feel a little high, similar to an opiate Yea, when it comes to any type of pain med that is prescribed 3X daily I normally take 2 when I wake up and the other 1 in the evening.  I just do not see getting up in the middle of the night to take a pain meds when you are most likely sleeping I am at 900mg three times a day, but am working to go down to 600 now that I have had a very painful neurofibroma removed.  It helps a bit.  I am still in some pain, but I do not want to find out what would happen if I were to go off. It never worked for me Lyrica worked wonders through it is a similar medicine just a little stronger ", "Sleep problems Hey guys, I know i dont have it bad as many of you guys here, as NF1 does not really affect me in my everyday life. But for the past year I have been having a problem with my tiredness during the day.. No matter how good the quality of my sleep is, I will during the day feel very tired, physically and mentally. So my question is could this be related to my NF1?\n\nCheers guys Apparently NF1 is linked to a melatonin deficiency in some cases. My son would not go to sleep for hours so we were prescribed bio-melatonin and now he is out like a light. I believe it is available over-the-counter in the US and many other places. yeah but im having the opposite problem, no matter how long i sleep, i just feel always tired.. Could that also be linked to melatonin? It is possible, perhaps, that you do not get a good quality of sleep. The best thing would be to talk to a doctor, I wish I could help more. I also have NF1 and constantly feel tired as you described. I am not sure if it is related/caused by the NF though. Have you been checked for anemia? I am 22 with NF1, and I had always had a sleep issue, both not being able to sleep and also not feeling well rested. I never thought of it being linked to NF, but it very well might be. I take prescription meds for insomnia. I have been checked for anemia, and I do not have it I found numerous reports and research findings that say that people diagnosed with NF1 have a larger probability of developing some kind of sleep disorder, but its usually insonmia and not enough deep sleep, but with me I have no difficulty in falling asleep, and I do not wake easy, so that is why i turned to this subreddit for help. As i mentioned in another comment on this thread, its very likely that your insomnia might be due to NF1. I am no doctor tho, just a person interpreting people's findings.. ahaha I sometimes experience what you describe, but I also sometimes have a hard time falling asleep. I would definitely ask your doctor, I think it could be related. I have also seen some studies that link NF1 with higher incidences of depression, which could also cause fatigue/sleeping too much and hard to wake. What about your diet? I am normally exhausted all the time, but I find myself less exhausted when I limit  my sugars/carbs/junk food.  ", "Problems opening closing hands Anyone else have problems with their knuckles , mine lock up frequently. Mainly on my left hand I had this happen to my left arm, and it turns out it was a neurofibroma on my left radial ulna nerve. I just had it bulk reduced February last year. I also could not put weight or my elbow, or grip things for too long, arm felt weaker. \n\nI highly recommend you go and see your doctor if you can.", "Feeling Hopeless ( Long and winded....sorry) I have NF1 as well as my mother, sister and daughter. My effects so far have been minimal other than a birth defect in which my ulna on my right side did not grow completely and my elbow is dislocated. It never caused much issue growing up except that my wrist broke more easily. I have broken my wrist 3 or 4 times and had had to have surgery every time. I have a metal plate in my arm to hold the bones together.\nAround November of last year, my face started breaking out. It seems to be cystic as a lot of times, they are painful and hard and sometimes I cannot get anything to come out. Sometimes, pus does come out if I apply heat beforehand and others clear stuff will come out. And other times, nothing.\nIdk why but when it started I immediately became terrified that the NF was progressing. I have a couple bumps on the back of my neck, and one on my scalp but I am not sure if they are neurofibromas or just moles or warts. They do not hurt. They have not grown. In fact, sometimes they feel as though they have gotten smaller but I am not sure because I do not monitor them very closely. \nI have had a glomus tumor for about ten years now. I cannot afford to get it removed and I have read that a lot of doctors do not even know what they are and I cannot afford to be doctor-jumping just to find one who will listen. \nI did try to talk to one doctor about it and asked her if I would see an orthopedist for it and if I would need a referral. I mentioned the long history and the symptoms and she just seemed to dismiss what I said and told me (nonchalantly), \u201cI would actually refer you to an oncologist because it might be skin cancer.\u201d \nI do not really know a lot about skin cancer, although I have read several different articles and searched several medical websites, but I do not think that I would go ten years with no other symptoms. Plus, it looks nothing like the pictures on the websites. It just looks like a purplish reddish spot under my nail, not a black streak. So, I gave up. I cannot have an MRI to diagnose because of the metal plate in my arm. Besides that, I cannot afford $8,000-$10,000 for it either.\nI have also been having issues with thinking and concentrating. That could be due to depression and anxiety, but idk.\nI am just tired of living in fear and apprehension. I am tired of doctors not being educated. I am tired of feeling like there is not more research and I am confused as well because NF is supposedly one of the most common hereditary diseases and yet doctors do not know about it. Cystic Fibrosis is less common and all doctors know what that is. Granted, CF generally shortens a person\u2019s lifespan significantly more than NF does, but it is still important.\nI went in for birth control removal and reinsertion last month, and while there they did a \u201cwell women\u2019s\u201d exam. This was done by a midwife and she thought she found a lump of some sort in my left breast. I cannot feel anything but whatever. \nI told my husband that if it ended up being anything, I was not going to do anything about it and he got angry and told me that yes I was. \nI told him that we cannot afford it anyway. And tbh, I do not care. I have frequently been thinking about suicide, but I cannot do it. I do not want to mess my kids up. I do not know if they would really care much or not, but somehow I feel like if I died \u201cnaturally\u201d that it would mess them up less than if I killed myself. Plus, I am not really religious but I believe in God (though my faith is starting to waver a bit sometimes) and I do not want to go to hell (I do not think that people that commit suicide go to hell automatically but I think I would).\nMy mother is covered with neurofibromas and I really wish I could be more like her. She does not seem to let it bother her. I have never liked the way I look anyway and if that happens to me, it will just make it worse. I hope I am not offending anyone. That is not my intention. It is just that I have already had to deal with stares, questions and ridicule my whole life due to my arm and I hate it. \nI have read in this subreddit that they are developing new drugs that seem to show some promise to help with NF tumors but I still have to try to find a doctor who will know what I am talking about and who would prescribe the drug. And again, I cannot afford that. \nI just turned 30 and I just keep thinking about how I do not want to live another 20-40 years or more like this. That is honestly what scares me the most. If I was in my 50s and just developing symptoms, I do not think I would care as much. I do not really want to live a \u201clong life\u201d, but it seems that the universe or God or whatever you believe in wants the exact opposite for me that I want for myself. \nI see people in here that are so positive and I just wish I could be too, and not really care about what others think. \nSorry for the long post. I have wanted to post in here for awhile but did not know what to say or how to say it because I do not want to hurt anyone\u2019s feelings or piss them off. I am just feeling really hopeless and depressed about all of this. First of all, you matter and you are not alone. NF manifests in many ways, and it is a lot to deal with physically and emotionally for most of us. You have not hurt my feelings; this sub, I believe, is one for reaching out, asking questions, and just a space to be with NF. PM me if you want.  \n\nI am in my latter 30s, have many tumors all over, including facial disfigurement. It is tough every day. It can take all my energy just to get through a day--but I try to focus on the joys in life. Good friends, good wine, travel, running...these all bring me back into focus. Perhaps instead of focusing on what NF does, find what gives life for you. Not going to lie. NF sucks. It sucks partially because it is so hard to explain to people. I get that. \n\nBut you are so worth it. You have a family and people here who love and support you. B Actually it is not common, it is a rare genetic condition and in some cases can be a mutation that happens in the womb when there is no family history. Many have never even heard of nf before,\n\nI was born with Neurofibromatosis (I also have a lazy right eyes, high blood pressure and a learning disability), neither one of my parents or even siblings have it. There is a small chance a great grand parent on my dad side might of had it and also a possibility that a distant cousin on my moms side of the family had it, but no one knows for sure.\n\nI have had four surgeries related to my Neurofibromatosis. My last two were done by a orthopedist, who was very well informed and had done surgeries on others with Neurofibromatosis. These tumors that were in my right leg and arm were cancerous. Thankfully he was able to get the cancerous part out. \n\nI understand having this condition sucks. I do know a little bit about the drug trials my doctor who is a specialist in nf diagnosed me when I was 15. He is been trying to get me into one of the trials. There are about 4-5 different ones, these drugs have showed to shrink the tumors. It is not a cure, but it is something. \n\nIf you have any questions let me know. I did not say it was common. I said it was one of the most common genetic disorders, which is noted on almost every website I have ever come across when looking for info about NF.\nI have it so I know a bit about what it can do and how it comes about. I am not for sure, but I think my mother\u2019s may have been a spontaneous mutation. She does not talk about it at all and her mother and sister died before I was born. I also never knew either of her grandfathers, but her other siblings do not seem to have it nor does her father. And neither of her grandmothers did either. \nIt would be great if I knew of any doctors that are familiar, but around here they are not. It seems like a lot of the pediatrician are, but none of the doctors for adults seem to know anything.\nThere is an NF clinic in Overland Park, KS which right now seems to be the closest.\nHowever, idk if I need a referral and I do not have insurance. Insurance right now kind of sucks anyway and I do not see the point when I cannot afford to go to the doctor NOW when I am NOT paying for insurance. Especially when that insurance covers nothing until you pay, I think $2,000 out of pocket.\nI do not live in an area where the drug trials would be available to me (I live in Nebraska). I looked awhile back on a website, maybe a link I followed from the Inspire website? Not sure. But, there were none in my area. I would be more than willing to try any of the drugs available to be tested. I do not really care about the side effects or the risks.\nI am really glad you have found a doctor who is informed, understands and is able to help you. \nIdk if I have any tumors or not (other than the glomus tumor in my finger) because I do not even know anymore how to start a conversation about it. \nI honestly am at a point in my life where I do not really care. Whatever happens happens and the way things have been going(luck wise), the only thing medical care is going to do is leave my family with a lot of debt.\nThanks for the offer to ask questions. If I ever come up with one that I cannot find on the internet, I may take you up on that. I am happy you have found things to help you cope. I lost most of my friends after I had children and went through a rough patch with my husband. \nAlso, most of our money goes to just trying to live and to my daughters medical bills. She has a small tumor in her brain and has to have MRIs every 6 months in Omaha which is about 3 hours away. She also sees an ophthalmologist in Omaha every 6 months.\nI love to travel as well so sometimes those trips to Omaha are like a little vacation for us as the tumor at this point in time is not serious. They just want to monitor it. \nLast time we were there, they thought it might have actually shrunk. But, they are waiting for it to grow (if it does) before they remove it because it is so small.\nAnyway, it is hard for me to really find joy in anything anymore anyway, so idk if it would help. Anything that does make me happy is temporary and I lose interest fast. \nI am just not really a good person right now. I feel like I am being whiny and coming off intentionally negative, but it is just how I feel.\nI am still very happy for those of you who have found ways to cope and can enjoy life no matter what. That really means something. Thanks.\nNot really sure my family cares that much. The only family I really have that seems to worry or care about me at all is my husband, kids and mom. My dads side of the family is kind of complicated and that is another (Long and winded) story for another day. \nAnd, the only reason I worried about upsetting anyone is because I know there are others who have things way worse and I felt a little guilty and stupid for essentially whining, but I would been thinking about posting for over a week because I really have no one else to talk to. My husband listens but he does not understand and my mom does not like to talk about the NF. I think she feels guilty. \nI was so excited when I found this subreddit because it seemed like a big step since people do not really know what NF is and I was honestly surprised it was on here. I was always told by my specialist and anything I read that Neurofibromatosis was a rare genetic condition, I did not mean to offend you about the common thing.\nAnyways \n\nHave you tried applying for Medicaid? I do not know your working situation, but if your unable to work a job with meaningful income you can apply for SSI or disability. You likely will get denied first time around, but then you can hire a lawyer and the way that would work is. You do not pay the lawyer a thing unless your case is won and the payment would come out of backpay for the SSI or disability, never anything out of pocket. With SSI you automatically are approved for Medicaid, the only down side with SSI is you can have no more than $2000 in your bank account, but it helps a lot with medical. With disability there is no set limit to what you can have in your bank account.\n\nAlso some hospitals do offer financial assistance for what your insurance does not cover, many years ago I had a bunch of MRIs done, my insurance did not cover all of it. I informed billing I did not have the funds to cover the bill and they sent me a form/application that I had to fill out and provide information. It was approved and they covered the bill and any other expenses for the rest of that year and I never had to pay a penny. I do not know if all hospitals have this, but it might be worth looking into.\n\nTo help find a doctor this might help you \n\nI hope that you are able to find a specialist who is able to help you out and help keep you informed about the drug trials You did not offend me. I was just stating what I would read; that it was a rare condition but one of the most common. I guess maybe the way I worded it was confusing.  \nI am still able to work so I cannot get Medicaid. \nMy daughter was on SSI for years so I kind of know how that works.\nAs of right now, I am still able to work. My deformity limits me a bit but really only in terms of lifting. I am weaker on my right side. \nThe hospital here are assholes about billing. I have a friend who can attest to that and they are the only hospital in town. \nI am a pharmacy tech in a vet pharmacy and pretty much just type all day. It is a small local company, so they do not offer insurance but it is decent pay for the area, and they are SUPER flexible so if an emergency comes up, they let you leave to take care of it, no questions asked. The only jobs that pay more are factory jobs and I cannot pass the physical due to my deformity. Plus, I am not sure I would like that environment. I do not take kindly to nasty, pervy comments and my mouth would probably get me in trouble.\nI have a degree in Medical Transcription but that was pretty much a wasted effort as most companies want you to have at least two years of experience before they hire you. So, I am kind of stuck where I am at.\nIt is what it is. Hopefully, someday I will get something figured out, but for now I am just trying to accept and deal with it. It seems like a super small group but there are people here. I find myself comparing myself to others and feel bad because \u201cit could be worse,\u201d but do not let that take away from your reality. \n\nAre you on Facebook? There are several groups on there\u2014by region, by age, family, etc. Just a suggestion. Seems to be more active than this subreddit, but this does have the benefit of anonymity. I am on Facebook and had joined a couple groups but I keep \u201csnoozing\u201d them because people post pictures and stuff and it scares me. I am a big believer in what you think about manifests and those pictures stick in my head for days on end so I try to ignore it. Maybe a little stupid, but it is helping me a bit for now. Follow me on facebook, Scot Monroe Inman. NF has had a big impact on my life and I always try to stay positive I will go do that right now. Thanks. All any of us can do is take things one day at a time. Start small. Is it a sunny day? Does the smell of rain make you happy?  Or a flower or succulent? Maybe a particular color or smell, a picture, a memory, or even a tv show or book.  \n\nNF can suck time, money, energy, and thought. But your life is so much more than NF and what it does. Which drug are you trying to get? I was able to get on trametinib, been taking it since June...it is actually having some positive effect on some of my tumors, but it is been an adjustment with side effects. Also, possible new growth too.  \n\nOP, I can answer questions too, on the tumor shrinking drugs. btw, OP are you on the NF Registry? It is a portal for patients to input information about how NF manifests for them and a place to learn about what clinical trials are ongoing.   \n\nThere are ongoing trials in resiliency training for adults with NF. They are all about coping with NF and done over video conference. Something to think about. I do not think I am. I will look into it. Thank you!! I am sure the same of it. The issue I have is my doctor who is in charge of the trial at least as far as getting patients is in another state then I am. I am on Medicaid through SSI and we have difficulty with my insurance that is through Medicaid with approving my appointments, because I am out of state. Even in 2018 when I had a cancerous tumor and was at the hospital to have my surgery, the surgeon was on the phone with some big head from my insurance trying to explain the importance of my surgery, but the big heed did not care. So it had to go through a while appeal process. Thankfully I my primary doctor back home was able to make enough noise and my surgery was approved. \n\nThe concern is that some of the trails are picky about where the mri and blood tests are all done and with all the issue we have with my insurance, were concerned it would not work with the Medicaid. I was back in April had a medical decision approved for disability, but the judge. But it seems someone over him is reviewing that decision and it is been pretty much in limbo ever sense. \n\nSo it is been a waiting game for me.\n\nMy doctor did explain some of the sides effects for the drugs though that some have had. I have heard hair loss, rashes, stomach aches and drowsiness. They might be other ones, but these are the ones I remember him bring up that others in the trial have had. I do know at lesser one dropped out of the trial because of the hair loss. Hey! You kind of just described my situation with my family. I think it is perfectly fine to post here, no matter what you are venting. Every once in a while I read responses that could use a little more empathy towards the OP, but in general people seem pretty understanding. Even though there is such a variance in the severity of NF, there is also a sense of camaraderie. Especially because you are so right about people outside of our disorder not being as informed about it. Everyone has their issue. Ugh! It is so frustrating. I think about my family quite a bit and wonder how different I would be if I had not had to always fend for myself since I was 7 or 8. I would probably be happier but I do not know if I would be as able to stand up for myself. When I get really angry, fear goes away and I pretty much say whatever pops in my head ( with some filter). Still, it would be nice to feel I had some sort of support system. \nHope you are able to find what you may be lacking in your family situation here. \ud83d\ude0a That sounds stressful dealing with insurance, and waiting is hard. Good luck to you and I hope it works out.\n\nI live in an area with a good clinic and neurologist who knows about NF. So I was able to get trametinib (selumetinib is another of the drugs). I am actually on an individual patient program rather than one of the other ongoing clincial trials...kind of like my own clinical trial. And by some miracle my insurance company approved it after they denied it at first. The side effect that I have experienced is primarily rash and acne, but I think my hair's thinned a little too. Other effects can be diarrhea, nausea, among others. Sun sensitivity made the Summer a bit of an adjustment, but none of it so far has been bad enough that I would stop taking it. However, trametinib has to be refrigerated, so it means travel takes a bit more thought on logistics.  \n\nI am really nervous right now, because I am going to have to change insurance providers soon and I am hoping that I can continue getting the same care. Hopefully you will not run into any issues with your new insurance. The refrigeration of that medicine sounds familiar. I am not sure if that was the one he was thinking of putting me on, once and if were able to get this whole Medicare thing going. I do have an appointment coming up at the end of the next month, but if we have not heard anything from the state of Michigan, my mom thinks he would be a wasted trip and she probably would be right. If I do not end up going I am sure my specialist will order some MRIs to make sure no big changes are going on and I will be able to do those here at home. It does not make sense put my insurance is fine with an out of state doctor orders scans and having them done here in my home state, but they get all up in arms about me going out of state for an appointment or surgery.\n\nYears age before I was diagnosed and was a minor on my parents insurance. My pediatrician always felt like I had it, but could never give a 100% diagnosis. When I hit puberty, things seemed to take off and she felt like it was time to try again to get a diagnosis. She called Grand Rapids first, but they said no have me to Chicago. And that is where I have been going ever since for my Neurofibromatosis. Though there was a minute when my parents tried to have me go here, I think it was during my senior year of high school, a new neurologist had come to out hospital and we have head doctor friends who worked at the hospital, so they thought it would be good to have a doctor closer to home. Well long story short, after all the tests, that doctor freaked and called my dad saying I needed to have my leg amputated. That did not go over well. My parents called the doctor in Chicago and well I still have my leg to this day. Well I do walk with a limp and it still has large masses of tumors in it and then the whole cancerous tumor in 2014, I still have it and though I walk with a limp, I am still able to get around okay. \n\nSorry, I can be long winded. I hope the medicine is helping you and that you will still continue to get the same care or better with your new insurance. Lol. I understand and know this. It is rare and that is why nobody k owe what it is. What I am saying is that it is ONE of the most common HEREDITARY disorders with 1 out of 3,000 people being born with the condition. I am not confused, and I did not mean to confuse or upset anyone else. I can provide a couple of screenshots showing you guys the articles that I have found that say this. \nNot trying to sound bitchy or irritable, but we have already established that it is rare. I knew this before posting and I never once told anyone they were wrong.\nIt is great that it being rare is helpful when it comes to pharmaceutical companies, but I really wish DOCTORS would at least have heard of it. I live in a small town in Nebraska and around here, it seems most of the doctors (aside from pediatricians) do not even know what it is and have never heard of it. Nope. At this moment in time, I cannot afford to treat anything, and tbh when it comes to antidepressants, the side effects are not worth it for me. Only one I have found that I like and has no side effects is Bupropion. I was using a discount card that was helping significantly. The issue is (and I really should have mentioned this in my first reply. I am actually at work and my brain is kind of fried right now) that my RX expired and I needed to go back in for a follow up to get it renewed. That is the most expensive part of it for me. I only offered to provide screenshots because it seems I maybe worded things wrong and am being misinterpreted. I am only citing what I have read from several different sources. Again, was not trying to be bitchy or rude.\nI am hoping the new drugs coming out will help. It is frustrating when they have not heard of it, but more so when they dismiss what I am saying (like the doc in my OP) BECAUSE they have never heard of it. That is why I am upset that there is not more known about it. I do not have the time or the means to be going from doctor to doctor to try to find one who knows about it and who will listen to me. \nI really do hope that this new drug will maybe bring about new interest and knowledge. I am just impatient. That would be great. Unfortunately, the hospital here is pretty money hungry but would not hurt to try. I may call them when I get a chance and see what they can do. I never heard of expanded access. I have united health care right now, the issue I run into is they want me to stay within state and not out of state to see my specialist. \n\nI do see an oncologists here locally though, I have since 2014 when I had the cancerous tumor removed from my leg. The surgeon said it would be a good idea to see one locally to help keep an eye on things, as the type of tumor I had in my leg can show up in the chest. I have chest X-ray about every 4 months, along appointments every six months with the oncologist. Thank you, I will look into it", "How long does facial tumors take to develop?

Most people on my dads side of the family has it. I never really had any issues with tumors. Growing up I only had the spots. The tumors started showing up on my skin when I was about 16. And I have very few but I am noticing newer ones every once in a while. I suffer now with migraines, fatigue, and endometrial-like symptoms. Had an MRI recently that showed I have two spots in the right side of the brain that are undefined and an arachnoid cyst on the middle left of the brain. I never been to the neurologist before and my appointment to see one will not be until December. But I was told by my primary doctor that I might need another MRI done but with contrast and possibly a spinal tap. Honestly I am nervous about what will be found. My cousin had brain cancer caused by the NF1 and passed at 22 in 2013. Just so you know this is not a very active group but I support you. Let us know what we are able to do to help you or any questions you might have. Always feel free to DM me as well. NF1 is in my family.  Did your cousin go through cancer treatment for brain cancer?  I ask because sometimes the cause of death is from treatment and not the cancer (although this is very controversial, I am sure.)  Sorry for your loss. I have never had a spinal tap, I have had multiple MRI both with contrast and without over the years ever since I was diagnosed in 1999, but a Neurofibromatosis specialist, who I have been going to for 20 years. I typically have appointments with him 1-3 times a year and have MRIs done yearly.\n\nI have had four surgeries related to my Neurofibromatosis, the last two which were in 2014 and 2018 were to remove tumors that had become cancerous. \n\nIf you have any questions let me know. Unfortunately chemo and radiation can make Neurofibromatosis tumors worse. My Neurofibromatosis doctor confirmed this as did the surgeon he recommended for me who did two of my surgeries. They would only do chemo or radiation if it became absolutely necessary. The last surgery I had in 2018 there was a moment when they thought I might need to have it done, thankfully the surgery on my arm was a success and I did not need to. This is not always helpful advice, but my dad always says not to worry about things you cannot control. You cannot control what they will fine, but you can find coping mechanisms to help figure things out. It might be time to see a therapist and talk about your worries.\n\nThe good news is, once they do the next MRI and possible spinal tap, they will have a better idea of what is going on with your body and then can figure out a way to help you. You should mention the endometrial symptoms if you have not already because that could mean there is an issue there. Everybody's NF is different, and honestly, NF turning into cancer is rare.\n\nI am not going to say there is nothing to worry about, because your concern is genuine but it might be good to find a way to channel that concern in another more positive direction", "picking bumps. lately i have been picking at what i think are bumps growing on my face and they eventually scab over and never come back (i continuously put lush\u2019s greased lighting on it. ) anyone else experience this. it is also happened on my back and stomach as well. i would rather have a light scar than an ugly bump.

I have talked to my doctor about it but cannot quite places a finger on what is wrong.  \nDoes anybody else experience this?  I have had a similar thing with random pain in random body parts (often elbow or toes/fingers) never particularly bad though This sounds very much like a Glomus Tumor. It took me ages to be properly diagnosed. I had sensitivity to cold temperatures and if I knocked it. The pain level can be extreme and at times I wanted to amputate my own finger. A high quality MRI scan eventually showed this up and subsequent surgery has completely eliminated any pain.  Was this MRI any different from your regular scans? If not I will get my doctor to add it when I go back for my next MRI Also was there anything you could see on the bare nail?\n You should get a scan of your right hand and arm, I had extreme pain that would go down my lower right arm near to my thumb. I had a large tumor on my upper arm, it turned out that tumor was cancerous and was pressing against my sensory nerve. I had it removed in April and the pain stopped. It was my second MRI scan that actually showed it up which I believe was from a higher resolution machine as the first one did not show anything. \nI did have a purplish blemish by the nail bed. \nThe way you described your symptoms totally resonated with me and if you have not done already Google 'glomus tumour'. I had it in exactly the same place as you are mentioning 'right ring finger'. It took a few years for them to diagnose the problem and I had tests looking if the issue may be stemming from another area of the body. I can never forget how painful it was and am so relieved they finally resolved the problem. I hope you can get answers soon as I really feel for you and the discomfort it must be causing.  Late to the party but I just had a glomus tumor removed from my right pinky. Your symptoms sound exactly like mine. Mine was not visible from the outside, no bump or discoloration under the nail, but it showed up on an MRI which they did both with and without contrast I have extreme pain behind all my fingernails it is like a stupid amount of pain from light knocks etc.\nIs that what your experiencing?  I have isolated pain in my pinky. Reacts to cold and pin pressure. Had it for about 9 years, my doctor dismissed it a few times until i came prepared and insisted on further examination.

I did a copay plan this past year which was nice, but I am just anxious also about future medical expenses. This past year I did not bat an eye if I wanted therapy or to see a specialist but when I had a high deductible plan the year prior I did not usually go to the doctor without weighing pros and cons. HSA imo... I hate paying for insurance.. always feel like i am throwing $$ away.  i get why we need it and all just sucks.  HSA .. that $ is yours forever.  You can even invest a portion.  It is pretax so it also helps lower your taxable income ..\njust my opinion however It all depends on the numbers. The HSA plan at work was cheaper in all spending scenarios unless my family needed something like 30+ specialist visits. I am late to this but\u2026 Run the numbers. Consider all the factors. \nDoes your company give any HSA money? What are out of pockets/deductibles? What are the premiums? \nI am on an HSA plan. Try to pay out of pocket for things so I can build my HSA and invest it. Being able to invest your HSA is a huge benefit. I have paid for a couple of appointments with what I made in interest. \n\n\nIf I know I am going to have a \u2018big\u2019 expense year I have switched back to the copay plan. It is all a big game/gamble though which sucks. Yeah, I crunched the numbers last year and went with a copay plan for that reason. I had a comprehensive exam at Mayo in Minnesota who has providers who specialize in NF, I saw three providers and the visits costed 3000, but with copays it ended up being 90. I will not (hopefully) have to do that again. \n\nMy company does give HSA money. 800 for incentives/health coaching and 600 at the beginning of the year. \n\nThey have not come out with premiums yet, that will come out on the 18th of October. I have an HSA plan with my insurance plan. I have high deductible insurance through work which sucks but every year work contributes to the HSA which makes it easier to have enough saved for the deductibles.", "Has anyone lived a normal life and not really been affected by their NF much?  i am a 30 year old female, my NF has not really effected my life too terribly. i have spots (most of which i have covered with tattoos, some bumps (most of which you can only see in good lighting), and had a few removed. anytime i fell someone they are surprised and say they have never noticed any of those things. My mother and sister do.  I try as much as possible to not let it affect me. I am a 21 year old female and I have been impacted by NF1 very little. I am very fortunate because a majority of my challenges are more related to the side effects of NF1. (migraines, learning disabilities, etc.) Probably the biggest challenge I will encounter will be the decision me and my boyfriend will have to make when we are ready to have children. Well yes, but actually no.  \nMy NF does not cause me a lot of problems so far. I mean, I do have the occasional pains here and there because they itch or are located on an annoying place. (I had one on the top of my foot, just where the rim of my shoe was so it kept irritating it).  However, I suffer vastly more from the mistreatments and complications thereoff I received over the years. You can screen for it, so it is not entirely out if reach. 25F. Never had any complications other than migraines and occasional pains in legs hips and arms (these pains are never bad, the migraines are another story though) that is about it. I have a lot of viable nuerofribromas on my stomach,back, chest and bum but they are all places I can easily cover up.\nI am due to get my first removal in the upcoming months due to pain and where it has decided to grow. I have got a fair few spots and I have had a couple of big moments and serious operations (had to learn to walk again at age 21). Despite this I am working full time, engaged to be married, tarting IVF for a baby (personal choice to avoid NF - it is not made me infertile) and renting a house. So although it is affected me I have still managed a normal life I am currently doing IVF with PGD to avoid NF in my future children. It was a bit of a journey to come to this choice but the one I feel is best for me. Hopefully you will manage to come to something both you and your partner are happy with when the time comes I am sure there are some out there, unfortunately I am not one of them, but then again it could be a lot worse too. I am in the same boat. Have not had any complications with it. I have a single fibroma removed and that was an elective surgery. Doctors always tell me I have a very mild case, and for that I am very thankful for. When I was a kid I got a lot of questions and stares. Now at 30, no one really mentions it anymore. Sometimes I mention it. I have a very large spot covering my back and neck. If I wore my hair down it would not be noticeable, but I wear it up all the time. \n\nI have a plexiform on my stomach that itches like crazy sometimes and is very pain sensitive - I always wear a form fitting undershirt to apply an even pressure to it and provide some barrier. \n\nMy arms are covered in tiny little bumps that are still under the skin and can only be seen in certain lighting/angles - my fear is they are going to be more visible as I get older. \n\nThe biggest impact I feel is the anxiety towards what is going to happen. Knowing I can wake up one day and have a new plexiform come in.  That I can get cancer (dad died from it - he was ~15 years older than I am now). It is a large factor in why I do not want kids - even if I wanted kids, and screened for it, I would still be afraid of dying with a young child. i am always fearful for the future though, my mom has thousands of them, but i feel like part of that was from having 4 kids. I hear hormones/pregnancy can make it 10x worse. I do not want kids unless I can conceive through IVF to ensure I do not pass the gene onto them. If you do not mind me asking/if it is not too person, how steep of an expense is this? My boyfriend and i are no where near ready for children but it would be nice to start saving for when we are ready, if we chose to have them and being 30 years old i would like to be prepared. IVF is around $30k a kid. Not at all. I am VERY lucky that I live in the UK and IVF with PGD is free on the NHS (for 3 rounds) as nether me or my partner have children. Unfortunately if you are out of thr UK or already have kids I cannot help you with how much it will cost Ah. I am a guy so pregnancy is not a worry. I am also 24 so I should be done with hormonal changes. I am in the same boat as you with IVF. you are very very fortunate. i live in the US with no children so far wow. i knew it was expensive but did not realize it was that much. that is heartbreaking to hear how high the cost is. I am 43F very little impact from NF. Have 1000+ itty bumps overall that can only be seen if the light hits just so. \nHave freckling but noting too bad \nI passed NF to my son and he has some issues but nothing life altering. \nI did not have a second because of a few reasons not specifically because of NF. I am a 24 year old woman. So far I have two pea sized fibromas on my forearm and chest, three brain tumors (I have shitty memory and balance and chronic migraines), and one tumor on my trachea (I cannot eat thick cuts of steak), small spinal curve and thinning tibeas, ADHD (much milder these days), and silent seizures (they are rare now that I left the stressful home life that caused them to spike). All that aside, I am a licensed cosmetologist working near full time in a salon. Oh, and I am going to try to get my driving license now that my seizures do not prevent it from being a possibility! When I was at the height of severity in my symptoms I never would have imagined I could hold down even a part time job in an entry level position, let alone have a career in something I enjoy. So never let that spark go out, stay positive! I am 18, and a freshman in college. My NF is luckily minor enough I only suffer from side effects like ADHD and nearsightedness. My mom was the same way until she got pregnant with my sister and her hormones got wild. I have cafe au lait spots and freckling under my arms and groin. Thank you for sharing! It is definitely an option we will have to consider. :) I have had over 10 surgeries over the years (I am 32) and while I have had some obstacles over those years I finished school, college and grad school (2x) by the time I was 25. I have a good job and a strong support system.  I would say that is pretty normal. \n\nDo I feel life could be easier if I did not have the disorder absolutely but, I would not change my struggles because it make me who I am.  \n\nIf you ever need to chat shoot me a message. You planning to have kids? Appreciate you! I am an aspiring law student so I admire your post grad education! I am glad life is working for you! i am 50/50 i want them but i do not, I would only want them if i knew i could not pass my NF onto them...and even then i know my NF would get worse with pregnancy (or so i have been told) and i do not know if i could handle that. Adoption is something i would consider as well. No doubt. Keep working hard and you can do it. I have NF1 (Male) and we are just in the process of doing IVF in order to have a baby. \n\nSo it is possible! that is great! best of luck to you! I was diagnosed at 33 following my daughter\u2019s diagnosis. I had never heard of NF. I thought birthmarks were normal and maybe I had just a bit more or bigger ones than the average person. I stared getting migraines around 18 and figured those were fairly normal too. I noticed my daughter\u2019s birthmarks right away when she was born, since I thought it was normal I never said anything about them. A nurse noticed them when she had a cyst removed at 11 months old, so fast forward and now here we are both NF1. She is 6 now and still just the marks and she gets headaches, so overall we are both very mildly affected. I do worry what puberty may bring for her and menopause for me. Pregnancy as well is a worry for women with NF. I have had 2, I have gotten 2 small fibromas I think from them. We had already decided 2 was enough but the NF diagnosis certainly sealed that decision. Not sure if I would have had kids had I known what I know now, not that I regret having my kids...but I hate to think about the risk I have put them at. Find an NF specialist in your area as well as a neurologist who is familiar with it. Your kids will most likely have 2 MRIs every year until about 10 and go for biannual eye exams as well. After that, I recommend continuing MRIs and eye exams once a year to track tumor growth and cancer possibilities. The disease can very in severity. I hope your kids are the lucky ones. Best of luck.

If she has those she has NF sorry for naiive question - but by Eye Doctor do you mean Optometrist or a proper Eye Doctor as in Optomologist? For getting a diagnosis I would go with Optometrists but obviously ask her pediatrician for whatever they recommend. Kids should have eye exams for school anyways so they should have some on file. Also if you have been googling please know a diagnosis is not the end of the world and your kiddo can probably still live a perfectly normal and long life I would go with the Optometrist, that who originally told my mom that I might have Neurofibromatosis. I was born with a lazy right eye so I was seeing eye doctor pretty early on. Other doctors, like my pediatrician also thought I had Neurofibromatosis, but test results were always inconclusive.

NF can vary from person to person, so I would avoid looking up too much, it can be a dark hole that scares you. If you have ever been to an eye check, lisch nodules (tiny bumps on your eyes) are one of the hall markers of NF1. Scoliosis seems like a likely indicator too.

Anything would be greatly appreciated, get it in the press where you live, complain to Sam Piri, ITAE productions in the UK. It is his idea, he thinks this is ok! Please, anything to stop this abhorrent, disgraceful. disrespect of us, people with genetic conditions, thank you so much xx. I could see a mock dissection being done for educational purposes, but they seem to be purposely invoking an age where rich folk paid to watch dissections of people who where considered freaks. That is awful Found it and signed. So terrible and disrespectful of them to do this for entertainment! Signed. This behavior is absolutely atrocious, and I totally agree with Ruby. I say this as someone who has taken part of autopsies for education purposes within a medical background. Even then, there is a certain unspoken rule that demands respect to help set a standard among the students, and to remind those who are studying that we are learning about the human body, and life. This is a disgusting display of body shaming disguised as entertainment. The people who came up with this should feel shame, but if they were capable, it would not have even been an idea in the first place.", "Unexpected area of pain after surgery My husband has NF1, and just got 7 fibromas removed a few days ago. It is his first time getting any surgery, and some of the ones removed had been there since he was a kid. One of the fibromas was in his ankle, and now he has pain, not just in the incisions, but also along his achilles tendon. Is this normal? Could the fibroma have been pressing on his ankle-bits, and now they are resettling in a painful way that will get better? Or should we be worried that maybe they missed something or messed up his ankle in the surgery? It has only been a few days his body is settling in to the difference that has happen with the removal of the fibromas. I would monitor and keep track of the pain and how the pain appears : is movement related, weather, pressure from wearing socks, shoe , etc, and then let the doctor know on the follow up. Keep meticulous documentation because if they did mess up his ankle you want to keep very excellent track of that info if you wish to purse anything down the road.  Thank you. The nurse told him to stay active to prevent blood clots, so he is been doing a little careful walking with a cane. It may just be related to that,  but it is hard not to worry. They did not seem to think he would be in enough pain to have a hard time walking. It is definitely not socks or shoes, though - he is been wearing sandals the whole time since the surgery. Worrying is good because it allows you to be cautious and that is something you need to be after a surgery. Sometimes these things take and other times it is really is something. With this disease it is important to be of both minds just we cannot allow ourselves to go over board or will miss be able to do things we want but more important; yeah I am actually recovering from this one little bit I have defeated. Nerves are weird, I had tumors removed from around my kidney almost 8 years ago and my right thigh is still messed up and I get a shooting nerve pain up my spine that started after the surgery. Yes pain in areas not operated on is normal. Thank you. If it is not too personal a question (I completely understand if you do not want to answer,) do you ever regret getting tumors removed, or do you feel like it has improved your life enough to make up for the added pain? I did not really have a choice, if I did not have the surgery I would have lost the kidney. I would not be willing to go through the pain I have dealt with for a surgery that was not absolutely necessary. Nerve pain can be completely unbearable on bad days and has been enough for me to not even consider an optional cosmetic surgery on a tumor on my lower back. Ah, his were more ambiguous choices than that. These caused him pain and discomfort but were not major health risks. He was considering some cosmetic removals when we can afford it, but maybe I will advise him against that. I really appreciate your advice. Thank you. A lot of people have little to no issues as well, just make sure he is aware of the possibility of nerve damage.  I have had four surgeries since 2001. \n\n2001 - was to remove tumors on my right forearm. After the surgery it did turn a shade of green for a while and I had weird sensation. Most likely because this surgeon lied to my parents saying he had removed these types of tumors before, but he lied. He never did and he said he would never preform surgery on me again.\n\n2007 - I had surgery on my spine to remove tumors that were pressing against it. This time in Chicago by a doctor who knew exactly what they were doing. Surgery was a success, do it did take a while for me to heal. It was numb for about half a year. But the first week or two were probably the worse, because I would feel dizzy. I could not sit up for more then a half an hour at a time.\n\n2014 - I had surgery to remove a cancerous tumor on my right upper leg. It was causing intense pain. Right after surgery I was up and walking around with no problem. It was a little sore, but none of the intense pain I was having before.\n\n2018 - this passed April I had a cancerous tumor removed from my upper right arm. This was causing intense pain much like my leg had been years prior, but this was worse. Thankfully that pain is now gone. My arm was sore for the first couple of weeks, but nothing compared to the pain I had before.\n\nIs your husband taking any pain medication? That helped me. Otherwise if the pain seems abnormal you should call his doctor. It is been a week now, and he is down to one pain pill a day. I got him a cane to use for a while, and we have taken a couple short, careful walks around our neighborhood. It does seem to be getting better. He has a couple other spots that are healing even more slowly just because of where they are, like a couple on his left arm (he is left-handed).\n\nWe are tentatively optimistic that the ankle pain has been everything moving back into place after being pushed around by the fibroma for so long. He has medical leave from work for another week yet, which helps.\n\nThank you for sharing your experience. I kind of want to fight your 2001 surgeon! Omg. You are welcome. Do not worry about the surgeon from 2001, my dad gave him a piece of his mind and refused to pay for my surgery. So that was all good. The three surgeries I had after that were all done in Chicago by two awesome surgeons. \n\nI hope he starts feeling better real soon. ", "NF has ripped away everything from me Life in all its beauty and frality.. still I love and dream.  \nInbetween, where we break, where we fall.. \nwhere being fearless shines.\n\nThe very large intrathoracic meningocele mass as you may or may not know, cannot be removed. My lungs are failing in direct effect.\nIt sucks. My spine is fused from C2 to T12. A bilateral mastectomy from aggressive breast cancer and sarcoma in my hip. My toes on right foot had to be amputated.\n\n This disease has taken everything from me.\nFUCK YOU NF\nfuck everything you have done to break me since birth. You have made everything single aspect of my life difficult &amp; frustrating. \n\nMy pulmonologist already informed me I would probably be back in the hospital, sooner than later.\n\nI share my experiences so maybe, just maybe my journey, my strength, my pain, every ounce of love I have to give, will help others.\nThe saddest part for me.. noone to hold onto when tears are falling I am sorry it is been so rough.  We are here for you I am thankful every day for what little hearing I have left, for my mobility, for my freedom that I know will someday come to an end. I think about people like you, often. People who are severely effected by NF, in ways I can not even fathom. I wish there was something I could do to take this never ending burdon off of you. Be strong my friend. Us NF'rs are some wild ass crazy fighters! We fight battles muggles will never understand, small, big, and most often all of the above all at once. You got this! My heart goes out to you. I am sorry that you are going through this. If you need someone to talk to, feel free to PM me :) hugs Stay strong buddy", "Any experience with tibial bowing? My 10 month old has been clinically diagnosed with NF1 due to CALS and we suspect his father has it. He has some tibial bowing and turn out of his right foot, but he has never had any issues. He is already cruising across furniture and has recently started jumping. He saw ortho and his X-ray only shows anterolateral bowing at the tibia, no thinning or deterioration of the bone and he is going to have AFO braces in the hopes of protecting that bone so it can get stronger. Does anyone have any experience with this? I made the mistake of googling, and all I see is amputation and no improvement so I am a little lost. It really depends on how severe the bowing is. I have minor bowing and did not really have issues, but it is bowed enough so that when I broke it in my 30s on an accident, I was not eligible for the tibial nail. I had plates and screws. That is the big difference for me. If the bowing is visible without xray, that may be a different story. Each case is unique so my experience will be completely different from others. Some, with more severe symptoms may need amputation because the bone literally looks like a bow from a bow and arrow or even C shaped.  If it is relatively straight, get the braces and let the kid play like any other kid. Keep your worry in your pocket, but do not let them see it. They pick up on that real quick. What you have read probably refers to tibial pseudarthrosis, which is the technical term for non-union of the tibia. Not all individuals with NF1 who have anterolateral bowing of the tibia progress to fracture and non-union.  The fact that your son is standing on his leg and has not had a fracture yet is a great sign. Severe cases will break their leg even a babies before they are even able to stand. You son is standing, cruising and jumping. Great, it is not a severe case. Bracing of his  lower leg will protect the dysplastic bone from fracture and progression to pseudarthrosis. \n\nSo do not jump ahead, but try to be seen by an Nf1 orthopedist specialist  because management is different based on whether or not the tibia has sustained a fracture without union versus a dysplastic bowed tibia that has not yet fractured. You need a specialist because a functioning NF1 gene plays a fundamental role in bone homeostasis and bone development. In addition to bracing, there are pharmaceutical protocols that are sometimes prescribed. Here in Australia , Zoledronite Acid (ZA) infusion is given as a preventive treatment. \n\nThis must have been quite a shock, and internet usually presents only the worst case scenarios. There is a lot of research happening but between research and change of protocol there is a gap of 10-15 years, so you must make sure your specialist is familiar with Nf1 otherwise, travel to find one.\n\nFor now, know that your son is not a severe case and that in addition to bracing , there are other options. I have tibial bowing and my tibia and fibula are completely fused. It was likened to a banana when I was younger, but it has straightened out quite a bit as I got older without braces or any other intervention. However it is bowed enough still that it is visible when you look at my leg. I am 24 now and apart from some bad growing pains and being told I could not take part in contact sports because of the two bones being fused I could not risk breaking it, it is never caused me any major issues. Thank you so much! I am planning on calling the NF clinic this morning to get him seen I am NF1 with pseudarthrosis.\n\nI broke my leg right before my 2nd birthday and broke it two more times in the future.\n\nIt is a very long and hard treatment and I think it is something you cannot avoid. In my own experience it is not painful, you can trust me. I had to use those lizarov* in my leg countless times, but it does not hurt at all.\n\nidk if this is what you are looking for... I am rly awful with words.\n\nmore info: I am 25, so when I was little a lot of doctors offered to amputate my leg and my parents always refused it.\n\nI think maaaaaybe I would have a better quality of life if they indeed had amputated my leg, but that is MY case.\n\nJust a quick edit: This is really serious, so do not take an internet stranger experience as a rule for pseudarthrosis. \nI wish you and your child the best. I hope you find a nice orthopedist. Did you ever have any breaks? Somehow missed this and have only just seen the notification! No breaks until recently. I have a stress fracture in my hip but nothing throughout my life in my leg. My parents where strict though. I could not do contact sports or roller blading/ice skating, could not climb trees etc which probably helped a lot", "Questions for the experts Hello all! First of all, I am inspired by the resilience of this community. I came here to selfishly ask a question and I spent almost an hour reading all of your amazing stories. Nonetheless, I still figured the best place to come for answers are from the experts, the people who actually have this condition. My story is a convoluted one. About 2 and a half months ago I had some lymph nodes flare up for no reason. This obviously caused me anxiety and I had them checked out at my doctors who said they were nothing. However, I also felt great fatigue, malaise, and overall sickness for about 2 weeks after noticing that. I had neurological symptoms such as twitching and tremors which have persisted today and have had an EMG and NCS done to rule out diagnoses. The last couple of days I have been on edge feeling my body and I have noticed that when I pinch skin together I can DEFINITELY feel fixed nodules almost. They ache when I squeeze them. These are all over my body including inner arms near biceps, under chin, and on lower jaw, and on inner thighs. Of course I looked this up and I was directed to a diagnosis of NF. However, I do not know anybody in my family who has it. I am 18 years old just FYI. I am not sure if this is even worth asking but I would figure I come here first before doing any sort of genetic testing in case anybody here had a similar experience. Thank you all! It is totally normal to have what is called a sporadic mutation, where there is no familial history on NF1/NF2/Schwannomatosis.\n\nThis is what I have. After having a schwannoma removed (that was confirmed via pathology), my neurosurgeon had me meet with a genetic counselor. Blood testing shows no known mutation. Geneticist said it could be sporadic, or even a genetic mutation they have not yet discovered or know how to test for yet.\n\nSeek out a neurosurgeon with knowledge of schwannomas and fibromas. They can help you figure out exactly what is going on. You want to see a Neurofibromatosis specialist or at the very least a doctor who is actually familiar with the condition, it would also be a good idea to have an MRI done, especially of the area causing you issues.\n\nIf you live in the US this should help you\n Before I say anything else the most important thing you can do is talk to your doctor, describe what you are feeling and even suggest the idea of NF1 if they have not already.\n\nHow large are these bumps and when you pinch your skin are they fixed to what feels like under your skin? And when you pinch both sides of your skin together you can feel them?\n\nDo you have Caf\u00e9-au-lait spots? Has a doctor brought up or suggested NF1 or was the painful lumps you are finding what led you to that?\n\nAnd is very often mutation that just you have and was not necessarily inherited. Although there are lots of people with NF1 who have it and really do not even notice Because their symptoms are so mild. \n\nSome of what you are describing does not fit With NF specifically (fatigue, malaise, and overall sickness for about 2 weeks). Those sound concerning, especially with the bumps you are describing. and if you have not already you should absolutely continue to follow up with your doctors. I am seeing my doctor next week. It has been a miserable and very stressful past couple of months. I have been following up with my doctor throughout, the first and foremost procedures I did were an EMG and NCS for the twitching and tremor. It was not even until a couple days ago I noticed them. I would say these fixed and hard lumps are around the side of a skittle (some are a little bigger). My only problems is I have them literally everywhere, inside of thighs, side of face, under jaw, and on inside of bicep. You CANNOT see them from the outside and I do NOT have the spots on my armpit or groin that you are referring to. I am wondering if maybe they are just normal, but of course I looked up lumps under skin and was brought to NF. I have an MRI of my brain scheduled for the next month for neurological purposes as a final test. I should also mention I am going to an ENT, so I should be able to ask if these are lymph nodes. However my lymph nodes have swelled before and they are usually soft and movable, not like these new lumps. Now I am concerned that some of my neurological symptoms could be related to this condition, but an MRI should give me some clarity. Ugh, thanks so much for the reply I appreciate all the support Good luck with everything you are going through.", "Looking for a friend here Hello! I am a 21 year old from the US Midwest. I was diagnosed with NF2 when I was 9. My father had it and sadly passed when I was 5. And unfortunately, I was in that lucky percent in which this disease was passed onto! \n\nAnyway, I have recently had my 6th craniotomy on my acoustic nerve. Which means I have gone from \u201csort of being able to hear\u201d, to well, nothing. I am hoping that I can find someone on this sub that has experienced,is experiencing, the same thing I have.  \n\nPlease, feel free to PM me! 30, but was diagnosed at 25.  Mine was a new mutation, so there is no family history with the disease.\n\nI am completely deaf now, although I still retain use of one cochlear implant in my left ear.  Currently on avastin with the hope that it slows down progression of the tumor a bit.  I have only had one tumor extraction surgery so far, but if avastin does not work I will probably be needing surgery within two years. 24 F with NF1! DM me! Hi! \n\nIf you have not already I would definitely look into the foundation \u2018Neurofibromatosis Midwest\u2019 they are a part of the NF Collective. Depending on where you live you can also check out the Littlest Tumor Foundation which is mostly based in the Appleton WI area. They both do several events that are great opportunities to meet other young people with NF. \n\nIn January they send a group of young adults to DC to talk to congress members about getting medical research funding. I went this year and made a lot of great connections.", "NF1 and Noonan Syndrome? Hello everyone -\nMy daughter was diagnosed with NF1 at 4 months, through genetic testing.  Her dad and I have been super vigilant and taking her to see her specialists since then.  She is 10 months old now and thus far the only signs we see have been the cafe au lait spots.  Well, now I am noticing that she might have developed some strabismus - where one eye appears to go inward more than the other.  Also, I am noticing that her ears are low-set and not level to where they should be.  She also has some extra folding in the back of her neck, which already appears to be rather short - I have a short neck so perhaps it is that?  Anyhow, after googling my life away, I came across Noonans syndrome, which she seems to meet some of the facial characteristics for it.  Does anyone on here have NF1 and NS? I have read that it can be a thing.  I am going to take my baby yo her specialist but I wanted to see if anyone in this community has any experience.  Thank you in advance. My son has NF1 with Noonan\u2019s phenotype. The only difference in his treatment from other NFers so far is that he sees a cardiologist, as Noonan\u2019s most often can have cardiac complications. Thanks.  Has your son had any cardiac complications,  or is the cardiologist just as a precaution?  I do not know much about Noonan syndrome other than the physical characteristics, the cardiac complications and some possible development delays.  \nAlso - excuse my ignorance, but what does Noonans phenotype mean?  And how was your son diagnosed with this? Thanks so much in advance. No cardiac complications as of yet. More just precautionary. He does have pectus excavatum though too. (Sunken rib cage)\n\nThey way we were explained is that my son genetically tested positive for NF1, but also has the physical manifestations of Noonan\u2019s. However he did not genetically test positive for noonan. So it is NF1 with Noonan phenotype (just means he has all the physical characteristics of Noonan\u2019s).\n\nNF-NS, as this is known by some docs, is rare and understudied. My son was diagnosed by Dr Cohen at Akron Children\u2019s Hospital about 8 years ago. How? I have no idea. Dr Cohen spent about 3 hours completely looking over my son and asking questions, as my son had a lot of things that were not explained by NF alone. \n\nHere is some info Thank you.  I spoke to our neurologist and she put things into perspective.  This is helpful!!  Thank you! ", "Help Is it normal for hair to grow out of the bumps?(sorry I do not know the proper term for it. For me yes it is. But For someone else with NF it might not happen. NF affects so many people differently it is hard to give a yes or no answer. Yes. A hair or even a blackhead ! Very normal on one of my bumps near my forearm I have 3/4 long hairs growing out of it. not so much the other ones", "Would anyone want to be interviewed Hello I have to come up with a doco idea for my assignment, nothing would be filmed or anything but I am looking for a few people that want to answer some questions.\n\nIm looking to interview 6 people\nA teen\nSomeone over 60\nA trans person\nA young Adult\nParents whos child suffers from nf1 but they have no family history\nA family with multiple people in the same household suffering it\n\n\nPlease let me know if your interested.

He also has pseudarthrosis of the tibia and an optic glioma due to NF1. This is such a weird feeling is not it! Just a fluke is what I was told\u2026 some fluke!", "I am starting Koselugo tomorrow!! I am incredibly excited. As soon as I learned about this medication from this sub last year, I was dead set on getting it. It took a while and a few different specialists and referral after referral after referral to finally get to the right doc, but he is local and familiar with the drug. I do not have cancer, but seeing an oncologist for it at a learning hospital. He has a few adult patients on it AND he got insurance to cover it!! \n\nI am slightly concerned about the nausea, diarrhea and potential rash. Rash is most concerning because of the surface fibromas, mostly on my tummy. I am thankful that I work from home!! \n\nHas any adult females in this group taken it? Curious how you are doing. I take it. I have been on it since June 1st. I have not had too much diarrhea, just a little. I did have some nausea where I did get sick a few times, but since I was put on Ondansetron 8mg Tablets that has helped big time and I have not had any more issues with nausea for a month now. \n\nRash and acme on my face was the one I had the most and that took some time for my body to get used to the medication, at least 2-3 months for the acme and rash to clear up. I would recommend getting a face cream and lotion and my doctor also prescribed me Tretinoin 0.025% Cream 20gm for the acme, which has helped. For the face cleaner and lotion, it was recommended I get \nVanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser and Vanicream Moisturizing Lotion. Both worked well for me.\n\nOne other side effect I had was swelling on my feet and ankles. It was also probably worse because when I first started the medication, it was during the summer and it got pretty hot where I live. So that likely did not help, but I have not had too much swelling as I was during the summer.\n\nIf you have questions, let me know. This is great news. I am very happy for you. Please keep us updated! Not OP; but are you already seeing the effects, other than the side effects? Are the fibromas showing signs of reduction? I cannot confirm 100% as I have not had any MRIs/xrays, but I do feel I am noticing a few have shrunk. Over 40F here. I have been taking it for almost a year. It has been successful in preventing new growth, but the target plexiform neurofibroma is large and quite complex. So far it is inconclusive as to whether there is any shrinkage happening. Nevertheless, my neurologist concurs that as long as I am not experiencing major side effects I will continue taking it. I have not experienced diarrhea, but have had rash. It comes as increased itchiness and acne on my face (especially after sun exposure), and dermatitis on my hands. Thank you for the response!! I am not looking forward to the rash, especially if it gets itchy on my stomach where I have the majority of the skin growths. I already scratch them sometimes and they are painful! (Too many to remove, but the dermatologist has sliced a few.) I will look into those face creams! I have gotten a pretty good facial routine and do not want to loose what I have got going on. I am 37F, so acne would suck. Thanks!! I am 37F, so we are about the same. I am hoping for minimal side effects like you. I am vainly worried about hair thinning, I love my hair! Luckily work from home so any emergency poops will be less terrifying. I have one largish fibroma in my knee, maybe a squished softball or two. It kind of blends into my thigh so it is not super noticeable to others but pushes on my sciatic nerve and causes pain. Because of the sciatic, they would rather not operate on it... if it shrinks and still causes pain he said they could look into surgery. I am so thankful to have found an oncologist who actually understands NF and cares. I am 38, I was still getting acme even before the medication. 24F here. I recently started a MEK inhibitor clinical trial (so maybe a little different than Koselugo), but works by the same mechanism as Koselugo. Everyone responds to the medications differently, so I do not want to scare you away from the medication. From the literature on the clinical trials, this drug does work in shrinking plexiform neurofibromas. I assume as you take it you will adjust. We will adjust to the side effects (?)\n\nFor me each cycle I had one side effect that was more bothersome. Cycle 1 was nausea and loss of appetite. Cycle 2 was the rash. Cycle 3 (current cycle) was diarrhea (but in general I have IBS, so I do not know if this is an IBS flare-up). But the overarching side effect is fatigue. Fatigue has been the most difficult side-effect as I am trying to be a functional young adult in society heh. My daughter, 29, has taken Koselgo for a year. Her main side effects are skin breakouts but if she takes her doxycyclene anf her skin remains clear of bumps. She first took cabozantinib and then Mekinist. Koselugo has been the better of the three medications. I had bad constipation and horrible breakouts on my face and scalp. I (doc) reduced the dosage. We want to try to go back up, if my face can tolerate it. It was horribly painful. I took doxycycline as well. Glad you have a good doc. That is so important with things concerning NF. Good luck! As an adult male, I can tell you that the first few weeks are going to be interesting. Make sure you keep a list of everything that is going on with you. They changed my dosage because of it and I am glad they did. Constipation is interesting since diarrhea is so common! I am starting at 25mg to see if I tolerate it and going up if needed. They are starting me at a lower dose , 25mg. And, Kosegulo sent a symptom journal so I do plan to use that!! I am glad it is working for your daughter! Yes!! Well, I have it scheduled in about a week with an eye doc who is familiar w NF and this medication, she works with the oncologist. Doc called yesterday to let me know that, while I was receiving the prescription yesterday, I am to wait until after the eye appt to start taking it. I was just watching a presentation on MEKi by Dr Christina Boull , A/Prof of dermatology and paediatrics and this is what she has to say on the adverse side effects of MEKi and how to minimise them and especially try to prevent them: \n\nTo prevent dermatitis and rashes, frequent bathing is recommended with gentle cleanser such as cetaphil gentle cleanser, vanicream cleanser or unscented Dove.  Avoid natural, organic, plant - based product as often less gentle and more prone to cause allergies. Baby products are often irritating despite the name, so avoid those as well. \n\nRight after the bath, and no longer than 5 min, you should moisturise from a **jar**, not a bottle with a pump or other similarly liquid form.  These have more irritants. Amongst the products recommended, coconut oil, cetaphil, cerave, eucerin original, aquaphor, vanicream.  Mosturize head to toes, everywhere and generously, even if no rash present to make skin the strongest possible barrier\n\nAvoid all type of wipes, including make up remover wipes, anything with fragrance, exfoliants , acne scrubs and washcloth \n\nShe also recommends an antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory bleach bath with this concentration 1/2 cup bleach (normal not splashless) for 1/2 tub of bath . Will be the same concentration as pool 3 times a week as preventative treatment. No need to rinse off. \n\nShe says to avoid acne product, because what is called acneiform rash is not acne but inflammation and will not respond to acne product which on the other hand they will make things worse. Antibiotics, oral or topical, can be given to lower inflammation even if it is not an infection. \n\nIF symptoms are bothersome, contact a dermatologist. They are options to help with rash, like topical steroid. \n\nShe was really insistent on the trying to prevent the skin issues with a strict cleansing, bathing, moisturising regiment. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope this helps . Good luck!! Thank you so much!! I genuinely appreciate your reply and suggestions. I will check her out and see if I have any other takeaways! About to start on the Koselugo.  Thank you for your post!  Had last year gone different I would have been in the Mirdametinib study!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will try to follow for other comments.  I have not even been sent my pills yet. \n\nAny personal experiences on personal hygiene products?  From what I read I might need to change the product I currently use to avoid aggravation to the skin.\n\nI am male, mid 40's.  NF1.  Was in on the NFX-179 topical study last year (28 days).  Otherwise I have only had a few surgeries for my NF, no medications, chemo, radiation have ever been used in my case.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\--Travis How did the NFX-179 turn out for you?

As when I asked my nf doctor about it he basically said its not for me It is supposed to shrink the international tumors.

I am seeing an oncologist for it, maybe try that rather than an NF specialist? Thank you Additionally, IIRC, Koselugo is indicated for plexiform neurofibromas, not cutaneous.

I have been asking for them for the samples to be transferred for two years. I have filled out the paperwork multiple times. They have sent the wrong samples. They have been holding me off for years. At this point I do not know what else to do besides try to get a lawyer. I need these to be properly diagnosed with either NF2 or schwannomatosis. I have one of the two. Why would not your doctor/specialist do a test at the hospital and send it to their lab? Your doctor should be requesting it, all they have to do is have you fill out a simple form giving them permission to request your records\n\nI would get a lawyer them doing this is a violation of HIPPA:\n\n1)you are entitled to your records\n\n2) they violated HIPPA by sending wrong samples i am in a weird situation because i was misdiagnosed before surgery and an orthopedic surgeon did my surgery (he had never done that surgery before). So my samples were sent to a random lab in Connecticut. My doctor has requested it at least 4 times, so I think at this point I need a lawyer :( Have you contacted the lab or has your doctor? both of us have contacted the lab. i suspect that they either got rid of the sample or it got destroyed That is unfortunate p, you my have to get legal help", "anyone else experience this? for the last two years, my butt has been itching. to be more direct, it is my butthole. it will just itch.

I am not sure if this is NF related or if I have tumors that have not been found yet. not sure if a colonoscopy would determine if I have anal cancer and not just colon?

Here is a picture of my neurofibroma tumor on my leg. \nIMAGE: ( ) according to my mom, this tumor used to be bigger and more bumpy and that right now it is much smaller. I do not have any picture of the bump when it was bigger but I believe my mom because she used to examine them when I was younger. I am 20 years old now btw.\n\nThere was this lab report I read on google. A pregnant woman had plexiforms and other tumors grow on her body because of her hormonal change BUT THEN, after the pregnancy they disappeared! \n\nRecently I decided to study my tumors and experiment. Have you ever wonder if massaging your tumors and touching them too much and trigger them to grow even bigger? Like massaging your scalp can trigger hair growth. I am not saying if you do not touch your tumors they will not grow at all, I am just wondering if touching them can make them grow even bigger. Recently I have been taking certain vitamins that have been proven to shrink tumors. (Turmeric) but I will talk about that in a longer post. I just wanted to talk about tumors shrinking on their own. This is interesting. When was the last time you had an MRI? I have a good couple dozen on my torso alone and if touching and rubbing them can make them smaller I guess it does not hurt to try. Afterall, we are all in it together as family. No I meant, touching them might make them bigger because it might trigger the nerves. Or maybe it might make them smaller. I do not know, I would have to experiment and see. I had one done on my breast when I had a mass In there. When they did the MRI they only saw the mass but tbh, they really werent looking for anything else. And the mass was not a neurofibroma.\n\nI had one done on my head a couple of months ago. They found nothing. However I do not know if the doctor was experienced with NF1, but he did know I have it. \n\nBut an actual MRI of my back and head done by someone who Is experienced on neurofibromatosis?

If its one you pay for then ANYONE is eligible.  I could have my dog trained through some companies.  If your going for a dog already trained, then the companies will often have restrictions.  Not on the disease but the symptoms.  Someone who has a tumor and is unable to walk far or has trouble opening doors because their hands are impacted, can likely qualify.  If your just looking for a dog to be your companion and help with pain/anxiety then that is most likely going to be on you for training, or find a dog that has a calm demenor and have a letter from the dr stating the dog is a companion animal.  Theres only a few reputable companies that can train a service dog that you own, so do your research and plan to spend a few thousand of the course of training (1-5 years). ", "Genetic Testing?

Every time I sit town or look down I see it and just hate it and normally end up in anger and hating myself. \n\nI am looking to have it removed but it might be too tricky of an operation (not looking for doctors you think might help. I have the best on the UK looking at it) \n\nBut does anyone else know what I mean? \n\nOff to hide away and binge on another Netflix box set. \n\nI am on (Amitriptyline for nerve pain) and other pain killers just to help me get through the day as I also have chronic pain. If this was taken away I do not know how I would cope\n\nP Hi there, I have also got a large plexiform on my face. I have had 3 operations, which have not stopped it.  Instead, it spread into my neck, and is close to the carotid artery, which complicates it even more. So I know what you mean.  \n\nI am in a bit of a low spot myself. I have been taking trametinib (cousin drug to the much-anticipated selumetinib, both MEK-1/2 inhibitors that have had success in plexiform reduction), however the MRI I had last week seemed inconclusive to my neurologist (still waiting for full report from radiology) and it does not seem to show any reduction after 8 months. Ugh.\n\nI have days where I hate this disease and hide away (being introverted makes that easier), but I just want to share with you that the NF and the plexiforms and any other tumors or complications do not have to define all of you. What makes YOU happy? What makes you laugh? Who gets you? Spend your time on those things. Did it really come back multiple times for you? I have a plexiform on my jawline that I am looking to have removed but having it come back with a vengeance is a huge fear. I have an MRI done a couple of times and the doctor said it looks like it could work out, so I am hopeful! But at the same time I am getting more spots on my body the older I get (I am 25), so who the fuck knows. Yeah, but NF is different for each person. For me it started as a tumor wrapped around my right ear canal. This was back in the 90s when I was a teenager, and although we knew about NF, we did not know what risks might be from a surgery. So my first operation was done by a local ENT and it grew back rather quickly, spreading to my face/jaw. The next 2 surgeries were done with better care at the U of Chicago Hospital. The rate of growth slowed, but has not stopped, and spread down the neck, where i have had a large cafe-au-lait, rather than just stay on the face.  \n\nI have met with surgeons who say they would operate and setting aside the risk with facial nerves and arteries, surgery might improve it for a time, but they have at least been honest that given my history, no guarantee that it would not come back again.  \n\nBut that is not to say the same would happen to you. Has your doctor suggested you get approved for Mekinist? The  side effects are almost non existent for my daughter (compared to another chemo tablet she took previously). Your insurance would have to approve for payment but the medication helps for  shrinking some plexiform NF1 tumors which are inoperable.", "Petition UK NF1 I was having a look around the Gov petition website and found. This one for NF. Only a few days left needs a lot more signatures.

That does not meant they cannot usenmore funding. Anyone in NF research or clinical care can always use more funding.", "Can someone explain Mosaic NF1 to me in layman's terms? I have been to a specialist to try to get some answers and I am just so confused. I had a large plexiform neurofibroma removed from my back a couple of years ago (the largest the specialist had ever seen, apparently) and have around 8-12 cafe au lait spots around my body, although no lisch nodes in my eyes. The doctor ran a blood test and a test on the biopsy tissue sample of the neurofibroma on my back, both of which came back with negative/inconclusive results. As far as I can tell, the specialist believes I have Mosaic NF1, but cannot definitively answer as they have not been able to find the mutation in my DNA. I do not have any family history of NF. \n\nWhat is going on with me? The doctor says there is nothing more they can do to get any clearer answer and I am worried about starting a family soon, whether I am going to pass on NF to my children. And worried that I might develop further tumors or cancers myself. Doctor said around 1 in 5 chance of giving the full condition to my children. I do not understand why I cannot get a clearer answer and I do not understand what Mosaic NF1 even is. Segmental Neurofibromatosis or mosaic Neurofibromatosis are terms used to describe a person where the signs for NF1 are limited to a particular area of their body. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSource  ( You have NF but it is highly localized. \n\nThat is the gist of what my doc told me when I asked the same question. I also have mosaic NF1.\n\nBased on what my doctor and genetic counselor told me, mosaic NF occurs when some of the cells that build the body mutate when the fetus is still developing. Mosaic mutations typically happen later in fetal development, which means you have a good number of normal, healthy cells along with some that are mutated, generally confined to a specific region or regions of your body. \n\nTo pass on mosaic NF, your egg or sperm would have to contain some of the mutated cells. It is fairly impossible for doctors to tell whether your mutated cells went into the building of your testes/ovaries or if they were made up of good cells, but I believe they try to estimate based on how much of your body and where your body is affected by NF1. Basically, it is a crapshoot, but you have much better odds of having kids without NF than someone without the mosaic variety.\n\nThat being said, genetics are complicated, and families can have tendencies to have nerve tumors without having full-blown NF. For instance, I have mosaic NF1 diagnosed by multiple biopsies of the tumors, but no one else in my family does. Still, my family tends to be \"bumpy\" in general, with isolated neurofibromas popping up here and there over a few generations. We have a tendency for tumors, but I am the only one so far that had full regions affected instead of just a random spot here or there. This is a really thorough answer, thanks! I have a very large cafe au lait patch covering nearly the whole of my back and part of one side of my torso, and had an operation to remove/debulk a large plexiform neurofibroma from that area. Aside from that I have a handful of small cafe au lait patches around 6mm diameter scattered around my body and as far as I can tell, no other neurofibromas. \n\nWere you worried when you were planning to start a family that your mosaic might mean your children would be born with the condition? My wife and I are a few years off having kids but I am not sure how worried we should be, or whether we should consider other options... We were referred to a genetic counselor when I got pregnant, and the counselor told us she did not think it was likely that our child would have NF based on how mild my NF is - it seems to be localized to one big nerve branch on my torso, though I have cafe au lait spots on my legs and armpits and the occasional bump elsewhere. So far I have only had cutaneous, no plexiform, so I am pretty lucky on the whole NF spectrum.\n\nStill, mine did not show itself (besides the cafe au lait spots) until I was a teen, and both of my kiddos are younger so I will not consider them clear until they reach about 20 with no sign of NF. \n\nIn my case, my eldest was born with some serious medical stuff completely unrelated to NF, so it turns out I was worrying about the wrong thing anyway. If there is one thing I have learned as a parent, it is not the stuff you are paranoid about that will get you, it is the stuff that never even crossed your mind. Go figure. (Even with the medical stuff, it was 100 percent worth it, just a little more stressful and way more expensive than we anticipated. Still, would do it all again in a heartbeat.)\n\nIf you have access to a genetic counselor, I highly recommend writing down all your questions and asking them. We found it to be a big help. Good luck to you! Thank you, and to you! I really appreciate you taking the time to reply to me. It is helped put my mind at rest a little and actually your symptoms and the severity of your condition sounds quite similar to my own. I am from the UK and I am not aware of genetic counselors being a thing over here - when I asked my NF specialist about that he kind of looked at me funny! - but I will do a little independent investigation. Thanks again :) That is really interesting. I was diagnosed with NF1 in 2011. My first tumor developed in 1992-93 when I was 11-12yo. I was not born with NF. No one in my family has it. UW research center has no idea why the mutation happened either. From the early 90\u2019s to 2012 I only had tumors in my hand, wrist and 1 in my forearm. Around 2012 they started to develop in my elbow, bicep, sternum and thigh BUT only on the right side of my body. I do not have a single tumor on the left side of my body.", "Feel awful Today and in most arguments my partner will use my illness against me. Being called names like Quasemodo if that is how you spell it.. bumpy, lumpy, I have a tumour on the back of my neck which he takes the mick out of and calls it \"my little friend\" big head and more that I cannot recall. Apparently I get uglier everyday... It really hurts I have been with him 3 years and my previous boyfriend never said anything like this. We have a little boy together and one on the way. I do not even have a really severe case they are not lumps yet apart from on my neck more bumps here and there. Before I met him j was a confident person but now I believe that no one could ever want me I am so sorry you are dealing with this. This is abusive behavior. You do not deserve to be spoken to that way. Also, I worry a lot about your child witnessing this and coming to learn that it is normal or in any way okay. It is one thing to have struggles with a partner, but to use your NF against you to put you down is incredibly low.  It is just whittling me down, I have always thought horrible stuff about myself anyway but to have someone else come up with new stuff and say all the old stuff is just horrible and draining. He does not do it around my son luckily but I know what you mean i do not want my son to be like that or ever spoken to like that. I just wish he would use something else to insult me not my illness  I agree with the other commenter. This definitely qualifies as abusive, domestic violence, etc. It is NOT okay to ever say that type of thing to anyway, but especially your partner. I know easier said than done but maybe this will at least plant a seed for you to make an exit strategy and leave him.  You do not deserve to be insulted or degraded at all, especially by your partner, especially about your illness. Have you ever expressed to him how hurtful these kinds of comments are to you? I worry because of course this has been wearing away at you over time. And he will not likely just decide to stop and be a better person on his own. I am sure there are plenty of other factors at play, but for your sake... Something has to change. I have and he will apologise and say he only says it because he knows it will hurt me, obviously it hurts as well because there is truth involved. I doubt he will stop it makes me feel like i cannot do anything wrong incase he says these things. I know I hope things do  I know, it is just i do not have any family and no friends. Without him I will be on my own completely and I already feel lonley. I know something had to be done though, it sounds cliche but I just wish he would change and be kind always That is the thing, though... I am sure you have been feeling awful for a long time and hoping things would change. Unfortunately, I think the only way things are going to change is if you actively do something to change them. Do you have a therapist? A mental health provider may be able to support you around navigating how to move forward. Your partner is a jerk. Time to move on. Better to be alone than abused.  That is straight up abusive behaviour. \n\nIf I was you I would leave. Do you have support in another city? Often times in abusive situations, being on your own is better than being with the abuse.  You cannot force people to change and you cannot force him to be kind. He either is or he is not.\n\nEven though he does not treat your son this way, your son still see's how he treats YOU and see's that this is an okay way to treat your partner. It is not okay or acceptable.\n\nI know it is lonely, and it is hard, but the alternative is living with someone who has no respect for you. I\"m also concerned that you have no family or friends to help. Has he pushed your friends away? Your family? Does he not let you have friends or does he mock your friends? Because that is also a sign of abuse. \n\nYou deserve someone who respects you. You deserve to be loved. There are domestic violence shelters that can help you. I know I just hope that he will see he is actually not being nice but he will always blame me for it. I lost my dad in 2016 and only have my mum but she is very unreliable and is an alcoholic. And yeah he does not like any of my friends I have not seen any of my friends in 2 years he mocks some of them cause they are trans, gay or one that is too posh so \"she has everything handed to her on a plate\". He will not really leave either if he does go he comes back within a couple of hours and it is my home in my name. I am just scared of being all alone and going weeks without seeing people  I know I should, it is hard though. Especially when it is mine and my son's home not his  Then you need to make him leave. \n\n Seek help. For real. It is your house, that is good. Try looking for information on how to get him out legally. After that maybe you could try to reconnect with you friends. My wife he NF and I can assure you that nobody should ever treat you this way. There are people out there that will love you for who you are like I do my wife. Been married for 10 years and her NF went from almost nothing to everywhere. I could not care less about it. She is so hard on herself but it matters so little to someone like me. I love her to the moon and back and you deserve/should expect that. Do not settle for less just because you have a flaw, we are all flawed.  This is not a healthy environment for you or the kids. If he is going to mock you he will do the same to kids who have it. \n\nSeriously fuck this jerk.  This is definitely abusive behavior. That is no way to speak to anyone, let alone a significant other.  If I were you, I would end the relationship.  Kick him out. Kick him out. Kick him out. This is textbook abusive behavior. The goal is to isolate you and make you feel that the only person you can rely on is him. He is succeeding. \n\nYou will not be alone if he leaves. You will not be bereft of companionship. Reconnect with your friends. I am sure they miss you, and will be glad to talk to you once you leave your abusive boyfriend. And go to therapy. ", "Nf2?? I am a little bit at a loss right now. I was very recently diagnosed with bilateral acoustic schwannomas. Which Is a main diagnosis criteria for NF2. At this point the neurologist that I saw who found these on my brain MRI has told me that this is only some thing the ENT deals with. I will not be able to see her until the beginning of October. I know comparatively speaking that is  soon. However I am increasingly concerned about something happening before then or before they are able to correctly diagnose me. I also have severe migraines and they are getting increasingly worse. I am kind of at a loss for what to do. Is there any way I can speed the process along??? What did you do when you were in the process of getting a diagnosis?? \n\nI of course will consult my DR on anything It took years for me to get a definitive NF2 diagnosis. On that note, keep in mind that NF2 is a slow disorder. The likelihood of \"something happening\" between now and your October ENT appointment is slim to none. \n\nI too have bilateral acoustic nueromas, as well as a tumor down my middle fossa, 7 down my spinal cord, one of which I had removed last July. Most of us are on the \"Watch and Wait\" system, yearly MRI's to measure tumor growth and then assess treatment options from there. I got diagnosed after a CAT scan during vision loss 5 years ago. The Schwannomas  caused the CSF in my brain to not drain properly and I needed a shunt fitted which sorted out my vision problems.   \n\n\nIf your MRI did not show anything urgent then I would wait until you see your ENT, It is typical for an ENT to deal with this type of condition since the growths are on the nerves for hearing,  When I see my ENT it is normally a team of people present,  A geneticist, neurosurgeon etc. So, I would not be alarmed if you go into a room and it is a bit crowded as NF2 is a rare condition and they are constantly studying it.  \n\n\nPeople with NF2 do go on to live normal and uncomplicated lives (Except some extreme cases).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope all goes well when you meet your ENT, so keep us updated! Thanks for your response! I am glad that your vision problems were resolved. I do have worsening hearing loss which was my other concern. As my name suggests I am deaf which was a cause of the NF2. The more they grow the more chance you have of losing your hearing. I had one of my schwannomas surgically removed two years ago as it was already at the stage where the hearing was almost gone, The only other alternative was Radiotherapy which would have slowed further growth but not brought the hearing back. They will most likely monitor your progress every 6 months or every year to determine if you need Radiotherapy, Surgery or neither. Fingers crossed you need neither! Also, not everyone has the same journey when going through NF or NF2, your story will be different than everyone else.

Not adhd  but though introduction  and getting know you stage he asked about ADHD ( never thought of it but chances of it with NF are high)  (I had seziure with Paxil on 5mg which caused them to put all SSRI on my allergic list). \n\nAnd to grammar  nazi (not you I love pillows )  no need to correct every  one it does not make you better person just makes you   asshole. . Finally I feel that I am not alone. It gets really frustrating most of the time. I have hard time with math too. I can get high scores for all subjects except math  Yup I was same. Math was the wore if there were to test me I belive they said it was 8th grade level *if my class in 2003 required the aims test to pass  I would not if graduated  high school*(my class was last year it was not required )\n\nI am likeeping in massive research  mode trying  to gather all mris and doctor notes and medical records . I was,in car accident  at end of Dec still have pain  like mother.  Nerologist  is holding up on doing spine mri to see if Physical  Therapy  helps first  (along have accident case in progress too)\nSo now I am hurting in places I was not before and now cannot be sure of its NF or pain from car accident  still. All well  end of the rant.\n\nSo yes just tell your  psychologist that you have trouble focusing if he,does not know you have NF open up to him about it. If he does not know about it you nay need to educate him on it. WebMD and even simplw Google search on NF mentions that ADHD is possible with NF.  My dr was somewhat familiar  did not have to educate  him that is why he asked me about it \n\nIf you Do get prescribed  addrael  watch your heart rate I started at 20mg heart rate jumped to resting 130 and lost 20lbs.

The surgeon who took out the last one did not seem like he felt that way. My question is, is there a tell all test they can give.

The 1st one I had was mistaken for a cyst and a doc gave me a cortisone shot. In my TUMOR. want to talk about ouch. Thanks in advance.", "Do not know much about NF1 Hi so according to my parents I was born with NF1 and besides some small troubles when I was young I have never to my knowledge had much trouble with it to the point where I did not know about it until 2 or so years ago. I know I had to get yearly MRI's as a kid since I had tumors on the brain but in 5 years I have not seen a specialist. As a 22-year-old male I am curious if theres anything I should know about NF1. Do I need to visit a doctor if I never have bumps on my skin if so how regularly? Is there anything I can be doing to help myself stay healthy? Anything I need to avoid. My mom refuses to talk with me about it as it stresses her out and I would love to hear from people who have first-hand experience. I was diagnosed with NF1 as a kid but stopped seeing doctors for it when I was about 11 (We moved away from my doctor I had been seeing and never got me back in with another one. I was too young to really care about bugging my parents about it). About a year ago I had some minor surgery to remove a neurofibroma on my pinky that had been causing me a lot of pain anytime I did anything with my hands. I have not really had any major issues other than that but decided a few months ago that I should probably start seeing someone about the NF on a semi-regular basis. So I got an appointment with a neurologist who got me an MRI.\n\nThe MRI revealed a mass in my brain that was not noted on my last MRI. My last MRI was probably about 15 years ago so they have no way of knowing how quickly this mass has been growing or anything. Which means now they have to do more tests to figure out what is going on. I now have to get an EEG, a spinal tap, another MRI, and possibly a biopsy depending on what the other test results show. Like I said I have not really had any issues so I am not super concerned yet but it is still all kind of scary and I wish I had been better about getting regular check-ups so it would not feel like this is all coming on so suddenly.\n\nIt is a good idea to, at minimum, see a neurologist once a year and probably get an MRI as well even if you are not showing any symptoms. That way they can just monitor what is going on and make sure that everything looks okay. As far as staying healthy, I do not really know if there is much specific to NF you can do but that would be more of a question for a neurologist since NF can affect people differently. Its a good idea to go to a doctor at least once a year if possible. I have been seeing my GP a Opthamolagist and a cancer/ tumor specialist yearly since I was a baby. As far as keeping healthy, the best thing to do is the same as everyone else. Eat properly and exercise regularly. So that if something does go wrong, you are in a good state to be able to fight it. I am 24. I have been diagnosed since I was very little. My mother has it and my parents knew soon after I was born that I had it but I do not think I got officially diagnosed till I was 2.\n\nI also have tumors in my brain. I get MRIs once a year and then go to a neuro-oncoligist to get the scans read. I really recommend that. If you have brain tumors, you SHOULD be getting them checked. I see an ophthalmologist once a year and my GP. Because my mom has it too, I have always gone. I had a lot more problems when I was little and when 3-4 times a year but once I got older I started going less.\n\nIt is really good to get everything checked out regularly. While my brain tumors have not grown, during a scan a few years ago on my abdomen (which I also get scanned once a year) they found a tumor that had grown and opted to remove it. I never would have known if it had not been checked and while it was not cancerous, there was fear that it could wrap around an organ or something.\n\nBut also, other than that, eat healthy, exercise...It is hard to know because NF is really variable and two people can have totally different issues I do not have NF1 but my son does.  He is 10 months old.  I have learned a lot through various sites and with his doctors.  My advice is make sure you find an NF clinic that specializes in NF. They will be able to tell you exactly what you need to do.  My son currently sees a geneticist, ophthalmologist, dermatologist, and an orthopedic specialist every 6 months. He does not see a neurologist yet.   This is a great website for general information about NF1.  I was diagnosed with it as 15, according to my parents doctors always believed I had it, but when I was tested for it as a baby and even when I was 9, results were always inconclusive. It was until I hit puberty that things started to take off and that when I was diagnosed. That was 21 years ago.\n\nI have yearly mri and I see my specialist who diagnosed me back when I was 15, at least 1-3 times a year. I have had four surgeries related to Neurofibromatosis, the last two were in 2014 and 2018. Those were cancerous. I do not mean to scare you, but unfortunately with this condition it can happen.\n\nNeurofibromatosis does effect everyone differently. I have Neurofibromatosis type one. I have tumors all throughout my body. I walk with a limp and have some balance issues. I do have daily pain, but medication does help. \n\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to ask. I was diagnosed with it when I was about 11. I had MRI and saw doctors about it when I was a teen, but nothing really came about it. When I was 18 I just stopped seeing the doctors and my mum like you mum does not really talk about it with me as it makes us panic. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think if you make it past your teens relatively easily  it shouldnt cause that much trouble but you should go see the doctor and have an MRI every couple of years. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think I need to start seeing the doctors again though. I hope everything is alright with that mass in your brain.\n\nI have not seen a neurologist in 15 years or so(I suck at  being an adult). I have finally gotten around to getting a referral to see an neurologist and I am getting stressed out that they are going to find something. I live in a country with terrible healthcare(united states). So if they were to find a mass in my brain like they did with you, all the extra tests would probably bankrupt me.\n\nHad you been experiencing any symptoms prior to this discovery of the mass? Thanks. So far everything seems good. I had an EEG which came back normal and also a lumbar puncture which was also normal. Have not actually talked to the doctor yet just looked at results online. She also mentioned wanting to do another mri so we will see about that when she calls me back. \n\nI am in the US as well! I do have health insurance, it is not the best but all things considered it is not bad I guess. My plan in high deductible (3k) which I have already hit for the year and then covers 100% once the deductible is hit. My hospital system provides no interest payment plans so it is not too bad, I am paying $96 a month towards the bill right now but that will probably go up a bit since there are some bills that have not hit my total yet. I am mostly worried about what I will do if I have to get any additional tests next year since my deductible will reset.\n\nI did not have any symptoms before they found the mass and still do not have any real symptoms. I just thought it was a good idea to get things checked out since it is been so long. You need to have your own neurologist, who sees you every year. If you had already tumors then especially, you also need brain MRI, every 2-3 years. I think its NF 2 because people with NF 1 have symptoms with tumors on the outside all over their skin's NF2 have the tumor in the brain and tumors inside their bodies.", "Rebekha Scott, we dearly miss you.

And although NF2 was a huge part of her and her life experiences she did not let her genetic condition define her.  She was forever focused on PEOPLE.  She wanted to always help others and better the world around her.  I am so blessed that God granted me several prayers.  I prayed often that she not suffer or die scared and alone.  She did have pain but did not have tremendous suffering.  At the end she knew she was home and surrounded by her entire family before she passed.

I constantly wear long sleeve, even in the summer because I know how people in this world point and talk. What can I do to overcome this and be able to wear what I want outside my home. Please help.  I have the same issue except on my torso and chest. I usually ignore it. what they think will not affect me on a daily basis and if they have a problem with it, well that is their issue\n\nWish you the best of luck! Thank you for your reply and honesty. :)  Just bear with it and not care what other people think. I have a very large one on my arm right now. I had a biopsy done on it recently because it is been causing a whole lot of nerve shooting pain. It came back positive, so I am going to be having surgery soon to remove it. We are hoping that it is just my sensory nerve, otherwise if it is my main nerve I could lose function of my right hand.

I was not going to wear a mask all day for the viewing pleasure of others. Fuck \u2018them! This is me and if you do not like it GTFO! \n\nI wish you can overcome it soon. For me I have a large lump on my leg and small bumps on my chest. \n\nFor the most part I just assume people are smart enough to know I likely have some medical issue. Ya, it could be something they never seen before, but I like to assume they know it is just a medical issue when it all comes down to it. Just like someone in a wheelchair or cerebral palsy. In addition, if I go somewhere that I need to wear shorts or take off my shirt I just think to myself, \"I am no going to see these people again, why do I care.\" Lastly, if someone asks what is up with my leg or chest, I just say, \"noncancerous tumors.\" There is nothing I can do about my NF-1 and it is the reality I only know, I cannot change so people just need to learn to accept me with my condition.    Thank you. I really appreciate your words. I understand what your saying. And yes it is easier said than done. I hope I can take the leap and just go out there and be me. It is so difficult to be different. YOUR AWESOME!!! Thanks  From the photos I have searched online and videos I have seen I guess I have a milder case of NF. I always make it a thing because that is just who I am. And I wish I was not like it. I am such a negative person. I thank you deeply for your words. I hope the best for you As well.  Thank you for replying, I will try to not care as much. I have learned much from this subreddit and did not realize so many people with this disease are actually strong. I will try. Thank you.  I am 39F and I have spots on my arms and I wear short sleeves. I dont think people notice if they do they are quiet about it. My NF prevents me from being touched and being intimate.

I have a lot of fibromas on my legs, my trunk, and some on my arms. For the most part I have not cared. Granted, I will not wear a bikini because of how messed up my back and stomach look, but as far as arm and legs are concerned I just go with it. Most people do not even notice, and if they do (like the fibroma on my palm) I will just say it is a scar and nobody asks any questions......really, you cannot change your life based on what other people think...\n\nI have a fair amount on my legs, and even some small ones on my face, and nobody has asked. I told my husband on our first or second date, and warned him about my back, but he did not seem to care.....I think because we look at them as our flaws we tend to put more stock into how noticeable they are as compared to what they really are.  Thank you for replying. I appreciate it. I am so happy that you do not care about what people think. I am trying to get over it myself and it is so hard. I just do not want people to look and say \u201chey what a freak\u201d  I am 43 and have the same issues.

I have a lot of resentment towards my biological mom for many reasons. So, maybe some just overlap each other.  She was never the greatest mother she had me at like 22 or 23. \n\nOne of the reasons why I resent her is not because he pass on NF 1. I think she was fully aware of it. However, she had another child around 12 years after I was born, This was after she was fully aware about what NF 1 was. I do think she has a cousin or a long distance family that has the same condition although I am certain. \n\nI am mad because having NF has cause a lot of emotional and sometimes physical pain that I would never wish on my enemy. I am mad that she had another child knowing she could potentially pass this on to her kid. to me it also felt like she willing pass NF 1 to me Yes it is wrong. It is a 50% chance to pass it if you have the condition, so there was a chance that it would not pass. I am the oldest out of four kids, none of my three siblings have it and if your mom or dad do not have it, then yours is likely a mutation. You did not say anything about your sibling (they have it or not). Having sibling is blessing, they always have each other to look out.\n\nNF is not something she can control. Life can be lonely if raise barrer all around yourself. They dont have it luckily. while she can not control having the NF gene she can control other aspects of her life. People can always adopt. and I do not know her too well. I was born in Colombia but immigrated to Canada with my dad step mom and half sister my mom has the gene to pass it on she doesnt have it herself.  I sorta think differently 50/50 is still a huge gamble imo My understanding from my Neurofibromatosis specialist whose one of the top in the field is, either you get it from parent who is also affected or it is a mutation that happens. my understanding is that she has the recessive gene and its possible to pass it on. At least from what I have been told but I could be wrong and i do have a lot of angry towards my mom not just because of what i said above but she was never a good caregiver so maybe its just a bunch of emotions clashing Everything I have read and been told, that you only get Neurofibromatosis by either inheriting it from a parent who has the condition or it is a mutation that happens. If none of your siblings have it, it sounds like yours was a mutation that unfortunately happened. It sounds like you should go talk with someone. I am sorry that you have Neurofibromatosis. I have it too and no one in my family has it. But it is no ones fault. It just happened. Neurofibromatosis is a dominant disorders and not a recessive. I do not think it is healthy or productive to feel like that, but I do as well sometimes. My dad had it. They knew the risk was 50/50. They lost the odds twice (I am the 2nd kid). I think it was incredibly selfish of them to take such a risk just because they wanted their kids to be \"theirs\".\n\nI do not want kids whatsoever, so I do not relate to that urge to have them. I just cannot understand that desire to have my genes passed on. So to me it is completely selfish. I should not have been made. After they failed the odds once, they should have called it. But \\*they\\* wanted kids and they wanted them to be \"theirs\" and now I have to suffer for it. It was not their risk to take...50/50 is too damn high of a chance to take of your kid being mutated. I feel exactly the same there towards the end. I never want to have kids unless my sperm can be modified to prevent such thing. I have had a lifetime of emotional pain that I would never want someone to go through and base it on a coin flip Hey, 25F here, I hear you. I have been there or I have thought it was kind of selfish of my mom to have me and my sister. Both my sister and I do not want biological children and are choosing not to. I am actually getting my tubes removed.\n\nI have had to go to therapy to deal with my anger and resentment. I highly recommend it, I think that anger and resentment mostly hurts you and prevents you from living fully. Through I wanted to share I get what it feels like to have a mom, who also is not really a good care giver.\n\nUltimately each person gets to choose if they want kids or not, I do not get to make that determination for others. I started therapy too but still resent my father.\nHe knew he had it, he has all the symptoms.\n\nHe passed it to my sister, her symptoms showed up when she was 10 and she is 11 years older to me\n\n\nSo my dad knew he had it, knew it was hereditary because my sister has it and still chose to pass it on to me. If you take out the NF equation, would you still have the anger? Would you see your Mom as a better parent if you did not have NF? \nFind an NF support group so you have someone to speak with.\nIf you become a parent, your own/thru adoption, you can be a better parent. There is also a third variation. My parents were checked on if they had the genes or otherwise I would have it spontaneous and it was spontaneous. Both did not had a gene with NF.\n\nedit: spelling I have been informed that with NF1 - there really is no recessive gene.  Either one of your parents has it and passes it on to you, or it is a genetic mutation.  Neither my husband or I have NF1.  However, our daughter was born with it. There was no way of us knowing she would get it.  Doctors say it was a genetic mutation that occurred very early on in the pregnancy. My mother did the best she could, she had NF verry bad and because of it was very sick and could not work. She knew the hardships of NF my older sibling did not have it but I got it. \n\nMy dad left as a baby as did not want to deal with a such kid and wife and was just a shit person. \n\nI was mad at her for a long time as I saw it as she gave me this, I was Verry sick when born and could of easily been let to pass as they already knew I had it. \n\nShe did from NF one grow inside her heart and grow till her heart could not contain it. I was 19\n\nI was mad at her for a long time. (While still loving her)\n\n\nI could not imagine my sibling having to deal with this lost alone, it was not healthy to hold so much hete with me and it Verry much twisted the way I look at the world for along time.\n\n\nI had to come to terms with it, yes someone did something now I have to live with it.\n\nBut I have done things and said things to people (that I regret) that I  know effect people and they have to live with it \n\nAnd that is life, it is unfair and can be cruel but sitting under my favourite tree in the sun eatting some nice food can be pretty nice", "NF and the Covid Vaccine Has anyone gotten the Covid vaccine yet? Having NF I am a little hesitant to get something that has not been properly tested, or tested long term with those of us who have NF.\n\nAs it has not really been tested and they decided to make these Covid passports do you think there is anyway that we could be exempt from those due to existing health conditions? I got it. It is fine. There is no mechanism in it that could affect NF. That\u2019a not how vaccines work. ALSO: would you rather get Covid? Because that has known lasting damage to your body, unrelated to NF. I had it mildly in March...no real lasting effects beyond a cough that went away one month later They are finding lung damage and other things in people who had very mild symptoms. Just because you do not notice them does not mean the damage is not there. However, having had Covid may mean you do not need the vaccine. That is a question for a doctor. My dad has a serious autoimmune condition, a simple flu vaccine made him really sick that he ended up in the hospital about four years ago. Then in 2019 he got sick again, because of his autoimmune condition. He had to learn to walk again, it took almost a whole year. \n\nHe ended up getting COVID at the end of November and comparing to how sick he was in 2019 to now he was with COVID, was not even comparable. All he had was a bad cough and was tired, never had to go to the hospital. He is already talked with his doctors and they are both under the agreement that he will not get the COVID vaccine.\n\nI am not so sure I will get the COVID vaccine either. I got a flu shot about 2-3 years ago and it cause a bump on my left arm and it has never gone away.\n\nI would discus it with your doctor, about what the best option for you is. Sincere question,\n\nI have segmented/Mosaic NF, and I some very large tumors on my spine. The Moderna vaccine has been reported (by Moderna) that swelling can occur in/around foreign bodies.  \n\nCould this trigger a swelling around my tumors? Should I try and get the Pfizer vaccine instead of the Moderna vaccine for this reason? I am not a doctor. I do not know if your tumors would be considered a foreign body even. \n\nI do know that both vaccines work in the same way so I would not think there is a difference in how it would affect you.

This means that half of your germ cells (I am assuming eggs based on your name) are perfectly healthy with no NF mutation. If you have several eggs fertilized by a donor/partner via in vitro fertilization (egg cells + sperm cells combined in a dish) the resulting zygotes can be tested when they are just a handful of cells - not only for NF but also down's syndrome and/or any other genetic condition that you would like to screen for, selecting only the embryo(s) that do not have any genetic problems for implantation. While this is a lot of trouble, many women who have trouble conceiving just because they are older do this exact same process to screen for chromosomal abnormalities.

This was despite having multiple insurance companies during these times, as well as different doctors, 4 was always the limit they would take off.\n\nHas anyone had more than this amount removed at once? I am at the age where more are appearing. I have at least 10 I would like removed and really do not want to have 3 different procedures just to get them all.\n That sounds crazy that their is a limit for something like that, I have only had one surgery though  I never heard about that, in my case when I have had to have surgeries the doctors would remove what needed and what could be removed that would not jeopardize my daily life. I have had a total of four surgeries from 2001-2018. \n\nIn your case are we talking needed surgery, because they are cancerous or in a location that could alter your daily life or just cosmetic?  These are cosmetic, as well as 2 in awkward areas.  The 2 awkward ones do cause pain and bleeding, but they are small. A few are on my face. Cosmetic would be the reason then, if there is no needed medical reason for the surgery then in most cases insurance would not pay for anything, but that could vary on insurance company. \n\nIn my cases they were medically needed, I had ones pressing on my spine and doctors were afraid I could wake up on day unable to move, the other two were cancerous tumors. \n\nThe first surgery I had was recommend to be done, but if think that one may have fallen in the middle as insurance did not cover all of it, but my parents did not have to pay that doctor, because he lied to them about having done surgeries to remove Neurofibromatosis. Turns out he had not and he was in for a shock when he cut my arm open. He removed it, but for a six month period my arm would turn a shade of green and would feel numb. So my dad removed to pay him any of the medical bills. Since that day all my all my other surgeries have been done in Chicago.\n\nSorry about your troubles. I know that is no fun and comes with pain. Sorry for what you went through. Thanks for sharing your story. The joys of NF!\n\nEven if it is cosmetic, there are special codes a doctors office needs to use when filing a claim with insurance to ensure neurofibroma removal is covered. I have never had that issue. Just want to do more than 4 at once! You are welcome. Hope all works out for you  Thank you for your reply. It makes more sense to me now. The low reimbursment to the doctors is unfortunate. They deserve proper compensation for their work.", "Pain in SI Joint I am having horrific pain in my back and leg the pain is the worst pain I have ever been on and I have chronic back pain before this started so I am on Oxycodone for the chronic back pain I have before this started and it is not helping the new pain at all and they said therapy was the treatment but I want a second opinion to make sure that is really what is going on this doctor is doing a new MRI to see if anything has changed since my last one diagnosis and what solutions did your doctor come up with  I have pain in that region from some tumors in my spine.  I have been doing physical therapy and taking gabapentin, which helps.  It does not get rid of the pain completely, but it does make things tolerable.  \n\nI also use a THC/CBD topical, but that might not be available to you, depending on where you live.  If you cannot get THC/CDB I have found that Salonpas has a patch or lotion that contains lidocaine that helps.  Granted, all of these things I am mentioning just lessen the pain, not get rid of it.  Nerve pain is tricky, and can take some experimentation on your part to figure out what works for you.  Good luck! This sounds eerily similar to what happened to me. I ended up having multiple tumors that were displacing my cauda equina nerve root. They had to be surgically removed and I am still recovering. \n     The first doctor I saw did not help me either. I got a second opinion and he diagnosed me with schwannomatosis and took out the tumors so I definitely support your decision to get a second opinion. Best of luck I know the pain is horrific.  Pain in lower back and down the leg are also symptoms of sciatica.   \nPhysical/massage therapy are safer than chiro. Bring your diagnosis to a massage therapist, they will perform some special tests, ROM testing and a few other things to determine the proper course of treatment. Does your NF affect treatment? I know it might for me because I have \u201cbumps\u201d in my lumbar and thoracic region.  Yeah my NF does affect treatment because the nerves are enlarged and are more sensitive I also have scoliosis I have been told I have tumors in my back area I am going to have a new MRI to see if anything has changed I am going to get a second opinion after I get the MRI just to be sure if it is what a SI joint problem I hope the therapy helps they said if it is to painful they can do a shot to help ", "Ringing in my ears Does anyone have ringing in their ears ? It is driving me nuts..it started about a month ago Mines been permanent since I was about 19 I have always had a ring in my ears. Even as a little kid complete silence did not exist for me. Yes. For over 20 years now. It is called tinnitus. There is no cure because they do not understand the mechanism that causes it. Sorry to bear bad news. It is tinnitus. It has many, many causes. Did you went to (loud) concerts? Or were you exposed to loud sounds for long period of times. It could be stress induced (mine is). It could be due to dental/jaw problems. Highly recommend getting a ct/mri done ASAP. Is has popping ringing in my ears since I was a toddler and have spent the past week in s hospite getting a tumor removed if your vision or depth perception seems did I would have or start to get looked into I know it sounds absolutely fucking terrifying I have just been in recovery from surgery for the past few day and I am still constantly shaking in fear over the whole thing. I know it is not fun t think about it at a slow but if you mes someone to talk to about any of it I can give you my direct number and help with any questions you may have your not alone in this fight.  I have personally never beeen that strong of s person and if I can wine this boss fight so scan you with the right motivation and thoughts going in you got this. Do not push it off start with an eye check up see your primary care and ty to get them to work together on setting up a mri or a CT scan for you Yes indeed. I am a little late to the party but yes. I have tinnitus as well in my right ear along with some hearing loss (and dizziness when I was a teenager).\n\nMine condition was pretty much like yours. I was fine one day, had normal hearing, no tinnitus and no dizziness and then the next puff I started having ear problems.\n\nWeird thing is that I have no tumor in my ear or anywhere near my right ear. Doctors cannot explain the tinnitus or hearing loss.\n\nYou should visit an ENT. It is best if you get an MRI of your ear to make sure you do not have a tumor.", "How do I find a doctor? So I have an appointment at an NF clinic near me, the only one that accepts my insurance despite living near a good handful of them. But the appt is not until the end October. I want the appt for several reasons: genetic counseling foremost as my husband and I would like to start a family soon, general NF care which I have never received and feel there might be some very minor complications I am experiencing that should be addressed, and of course I want prenatal care from a doctor that is experienced with NF. I do not really know if this clinic can provide any/all of that. But I also have no idea how to go about finding doctors for these needs in the first place. I just got off the phone with a doctors office for an OBGYN who is also listed as a board certified geneticist, but apparently she does not \u201creally do the genetics anymore\u201d whatever that is supposed to mean. I was told I would be referred out for genetic testing if the doctor though I needed it. But maybe she is a good fit anyway because she will certainly have more knowledge of NF than the average OBGYN. It is all overwhelming me! Any guidance would be really appreciated.  Zocdoc. com. You can find a doctor by speciality and narrow things down. You can also search for doctors by the insurance you have. Thank you! You are welcome. Hope everything works out for you. It is just so hard to find specialists and my GPS have never seemed even remotely concerned which is kind of weird and annoying. Like they have not even really asked me about anything to see if I needed to see a specialist. A GPS knows about NF but is not a specialist. It is best to find one and make an appointment on your own because it seems like your GPS just wants to treat you themselves. You do have an appointment in a few months but I know waiting is not fun. I just found another site you may like to visit. Zocdoc.com may work for you but you can also visit nfnetwork.org to find other places that may be able to get you in sooner. Nf Network is where I found the clinic which is basically the only thing they link to and it seems the clinics around me are mostly made up of neurologists. I do not think my GPs have \u201cwanted to treat me themselves\u201d considering I have never had a single one even talk to me for a single second about NF.  When I said \u201ctreat you like themselves,\u201d I met they may feel your current condition is at the point where you need to be referred.  That may come out wrong. I apologize if it did. NF, as you know, is progressive, so it makes sense to find the help you need. A GP should refer you upon request. Just had another thought. You should also give the Children\u2019s Tumor Foundation and speak to someone would could help you find the right doctor. Having someone else do the search for you may speed up the process. My pediatrician helped my parents find mine when I was 15 and twenty years later I am still seeing the same doctor. I go about every six months. I have yearly MRI scans and I have had four surgeries. Two of which were to remove cancerous tumors. \n\nI do not know what they will be able to do about having biological kids. There is a 50% chance you can pass the condition on to your children and then on top of that there is the risk of making your condition even worse. It is still up to you and your husband, but just keep in mind there are other ways to start a family.  I did not realize I could physically call them. Searching their website for a doctor yields the same clinics as the other NF websites unfortunately. \n\nI see what your saying. But they have never even looked at my skin or asked me any questions to see if I might be experiencing any symptoms. I have been to many doctors too since I have lived in a lot of places over the last decade. It is rather alarming to be honest that no one has ever even thought to ask if I had a doctor managing my care for the NF or if I see a skin doctor regularly or anything. Like I have literally never spoken to a doctor about it beyond me telling them I have it.  Luckily I have almost no symptoms from it. Scoliosis when I was a kid and a few surface fibromas here and there. \n\nBasically we want to know from a geneticist if we should do IVF or if that is not necessary. There is also the option genetic testing fairly early in pregnancy and termination. While not ideal it is probably the most likely way we would do it if the risks are high for a sick kid because it does not cost 15k like IVF does.\n\nI went through puberty without an increase in symptoms so I am not really worried about pregnancy and it is something I have dreamed of experiencing my entire life so the benefits outweigh the risk for me in that regard.  It is your choice, but I would never want to pass this condition on to a kid or even to my worst enemy.  It may be best to call them. Once you do, explain your situation and they should transfer you to the right department within the foundation. If you choose, you can call their toll free number at 1-800-323-7938. Let me know how things work out. I just gave several examples of ways I would not pass it on... Yes, but unfortunately even with IVF mistakes can happen. I recently came across an article where two woman with two different conditions used IVF, something went wrong and both kids were passed with the condition. Yes there are things that can be done to help it not be passed on or even lessen the chances, but nothing is perfect. Unexpected things can result that is all I am saying.  With that attitude no one is safe to ever have kids by any means because they could have something.  If you are near Boston, look up Dr. Brad Welling, he is a pretty renown NF-NF2 doctor Massachusetts General Hospital.  Not that only that, be he is an incredibly wonderful doctor.  Unfortunately my current insurance does not cover doctors that are out of state except in emergencies. I will be switching plans at the end of the year but I will probably opt for NYU since that is lots closer for me.  Yes I believe so. Have you looked into the Children\u2019s Tumor Foundation? It is not just for kids, it is mostly for everyone who has NF-1 and 2. There is also some really good resources with them as well!   That is where I found the only NF doctor/clinic that takes my insurance. I am just not sure if that is the best place to go to get all my various needs met since I want fibromas on my skin, a lump in my thigh, and genetic counseling addressed.  Ya I think I am just going to have to wait til my appt at the end of October It is just so annoying how long it takes to get an appt with them and it is not even really the clinic I want to go to. Is so much rather go to NYU where I am sure the docs are better. The closer one is about 30 mins and NYU is prob about 1 hr if I drove vs took public transit. Seriously thinking about switching insurance plans during open enrollment though so maybe I can go to NYU this winter.  Thanks! Just sent you a PM ProfMcGonaGirl hard ProfMcGonaGirl hard ???", "Do I have nf1? I am 15 and noticed I have been getting freckles and small cafe au lait spots on my groin the last two months. These are the only symptoms I have of nf1 so just wondering if any1 knows if that is normal or should I get checked Only a doctor can diagnose you, if your suspect you have it speak with your pediatrician and your parents about your concerns. I was diagnosed when I was 15, but a specialist is the one who diagnosed me. My pediatrician always suspected I had it, but could not be sure until after I hit puberty and things started to take off. I was refereed to a doctor in Chicago, Yeah similar here my pediatrician told my parents to get us checked for it.", "NF and Agent Orange. Anyone have parents or grandparents that served in the Vietnam war? Good afternoon all, I am looking around to see if any fellow NF carriers have something in common with me. I am a 22 year old guy with neurofibromatosis type one and severe scoliosis, I have tumors on my spine and ones on my brachial plexus nerve that start in my thorax and run along my left arm. My mother was a split gene mutation and also has NF 1, she is not physically affected but does have learning disabilities. My grandfather served in the Vietnam War and was heavily exposed to Agent Orange, he was healthy as an ox but later in life developed diabetes, several heart problems/diseases and eventually cancer, my mother was born after his exposure by the way. I believe with every fiber in my body that my mothers and my neurofibromatosis was caused by my grandfathers exposure to agent orange, and it is blatantly obvious. I am unsure if the studies are still going on, but I do know that at one point John Hopkins in Maryland was doing a study on neurofibromatosis, which was being fully funded by the United States Army, and across the way at Walter Reed, which mind you, is for the most part exclusively a military personnel hospital, they had one whole floor of kids with NF. at the time that they were going on my mother had called and asked just some information about the studies. But when she had asked about if I had anything to do with agent orange, they stonewalled her, immediately it was, they had to go, they could not talk anymore and they hung up. So my question is, does anyone else here who has a neurofibromatosis, have any parents or grandparents who was exposed to Agent Orange? What are your thoughts on this? Anyone is free to leave their input or opinion. Not around Agent Orange, but both of my parents worked at at a former nuclear facility and my serviced a decommissioned reactor and was around radiation. My parents always wondered if that may have had something to do with my developing it. My mom has it and she was born before the Vietnam War. And she believes he inherited it from her mom, who was never fully diagnosed but had many bumps consistent with fibrosis. Plus a couple of my mom's siblings had it. And none of them had a parent exposed to Agent Orange. For whatever it is worth. My grandfather did, yes.", "Genetic Testing Hello! My daughter is seven years old and has an appointment in a few weeks with a genetic testing department in a children\u2019s hospital for genetic testing to confirm or rule out NF. She has CAL spots and what I think is a Lisch nodule. My question has two parts.\n\n1. What can we expect from the testing? Is it just in, draw blood, then leave? Is there any other type of check up done?\n2. If I suspect Lisch nodules, should I get that checked before or would that be checked during?\n\nThank you so much in advance!! Genetic testing is a blood draw that will be analyzed by a lab to determine whether she has NF1 mutations. Generally speaking, if she has CALs and a Lisch nodule, that would meet the two required diagnostic criteria required for an official NF1 diagnosis. I am not a doctor, however. I would guess both questions probably best asked and answered by your clinic. Hello.  Can i ask how your daughters Lisch Nodule was detected? \n\n I recently took my 3 month old to see a neurologist whom she was referred to by her dermatologist who suspects NF1.  During her appointment, the doctor looked into her eyes and said she did not \u201csee anything suspicious\u201d but I do not 100 percent trust a superficial examination like that. \nAnyhow, the doctor recommended genetic testing which was completed right then and there.  Apparently, there is a company that can test cells taken via swabs of the in we cheek.  Thus, we swabbed my baby 10 times on each cheek and the clinic sent the samples to the lab.  The results are 95% accurate and will take anywhere between 6-8 weeks to get back to us.  \n\nThe other alternative to the swab is the traditional blood drawl.  \n\nI am looking at seeing an ophthalmologist to check my baby for lisch nodules or any other eye abnormalities.", "NF and Seizures I recently read about different kinds of seizures and realized I experience them sometimes, mostly focal seizures. I also read that people with nf are more likely to have epilepsy or non epilepsy related seizures. I was wondering if any of you experience seizures and if so what kinds? I have psychogenic seizures. As in, if I touch my eyes whilst fallilng asleep, I start having spasms. Have not had any that I am aware of and my doctor says I have one of the more severe cases of Neurofibromatosis. I have NF and have never had a seizure Due to brain tumors I have epilepsy so yes :/", "Vascular Tumor on tongue I am a 21 year old with tumor on tongue I have nf since has has a kid brown spots small bumps under skin.

You will get your questions answered and be put in the right course of action.  Even if you are hesitant to go to the doc in the pandemic, this is worth it!  They may even be able to do a e-appointment initially as so many doctors are doing now.  \nTake care of yourself. You should see your doctor and discuss it with them.

Has anyone here tried it and find it successful at reducing chronic pain symptoms and/or itchiness from the NF? I have never even heard of either one. My doctor who is a Neurofibromatosis specialist I see regularly right now has me on Koselugo which I started taking back in June. I also have been on two different pain medications for years. So how is Koselugo doing on you? I will not know whether it is shrinking tumors for several month, but aside from a couple side effects I have been feeling fine. The side effects I have had are acme, rash on and skin pealing on my face and swelling on my feet and ankles. I am assuming the infrared therapy is to relax and/or ease the pains? Infra-red sauna's are a thing and they are supposed to work. Maybe it is worth trying? Can I dm you? Sure Yeah, may give it a go. It is inexpensive and nearby me so why not.

My head feels like I have just spun around most of the time, or sometimes when I am walking it feels like I am in a fun house and the ground is moving sideways from under my feet. I lose my balance a lot because of this and sometimes feel my self tipping over backwards. \nAnyone else experience anything like this? Not necessarily dizzy but it feels like my inner inertia is off if that makes sense. It is been worse for me this past week. Florida just had a pretty decent temperature swing and it threw me off. It is been vertigo and migraines all week. I have, but not a whole lot, maybe a few times a year. I take meclizine and that helps a lot I do but I was diagnosed with moyamoya, which does have a link to NF , so if you wind up having this keep up or get other symptoms like tingling in face/arm/fingers or issues talking get to an ER pronto I experienced this for about a year when I was a teenager (constantly dizzy every day and would occasionally vomit). It went away by itself eventually but now I have hearing loss and tinnitus. \n\nWhen this happened, I went to ENT, had multiple MRIs to make sure there were not any tumors (there were not). Drs cannot explain what caused the dizziness, and what caused the hearing loss and tinnitus. \n\nI am fine now but it was a rough year. I recommend going to the ENT (to make sure there are not any tumors). At the very least they can prescribe some medicine to reduce/prevent the dizziness.\n\nBest of luck I get dizzy all the time, I have really low blood pressure to the point I am hypotensive. I get dizzy when I stand up sometimes and I get bouts of vertigo as well, even if I am just sitting still. My doctor said it sounds like an inner ear problem if my blood pressure is fine. We pulled up an old MRI my audiologist ordered six years ago that was done to see if my NF had any contribution in my hearing loss. \n\nWhile that came up fine, they did see two hyperwhite masses in two different parts of my brain and some other weird shit as well that could possibly relate to my dizzy spells, coordination issues, and stuff like that - but it is hard to say if it is NF, purely congenital that is unrelated to that, head trauma, or what have you. There was a fuck up somewhere and I was never told to schedule a followup, even though it was on my file. Whoops.\n\nI do not think I have had a dizzy spell in about a month, but I got an MRI lined up in two weeks, so I am hoping that might explain things.", "21 female with NF1: Surgery coming up, what to expect?

I am a 22yr male and my dating life has been minimal. Years ago I used to be both uninterested and quite heavy (5\u201911\u201d 245). Now I have tried to get more in shape (185, trying to hit 160), but now I feel I have some physical hurdles preventing me from dating. \n\nBesides my voice (*lack of a better word* autistic), I have 20-30 small neurofibromas on my chest, &lt;10 on my face, with one big one on my upper lip. \n\nGiven this, my voice (and my weight) I have been scared to put myself out there, especially in this Tinder, \u201cbook cover\u201d culture. \n\nAny tips? First, are you asking the right question: \"how to start dating?\" vs. \"should I start dating?\"  Dating does not always improve your life, with or without NF.  It is probably more likely to add stress to your life than lower it.\n\nIf you are really interested in dating, I can tell you that your age pretty much makes on-line data not useful.  You will find it more useful after 30.\n\nI would recommend considering seeking dates in the foreign-born Asian community. We all deserve to love and be loved by someone. My NF has been apart of me my whole life and the one thing I learned years ago was to love myself first and foremost. I started to love myself and the rest of life started to fall into place. Wow. I cannot even begin to explain how insulting this comment is. \n\nDating will not necessarily fix all of OP\u2019s issues. But OP wants affection and romance and he deserves that. If that is the case, he should find some local Asian restaurants for lunch and get to know the staff. Look. I have nothing against interracial relationships (assuming OP is not Asian) but the way you are presenting is not a mutually beneficial relationship.\n\nOP is capable of finding a relationship without dating people, who I presume you are implying, would be using him for a green card. You are also saying that due to OPs NF, he can only be in a relationship where somebody only dates him for citizenship.\n\nSo kindly F off My wife has a green card.  The OP wants results, not comments on what he deserves in regards to relationships. That is good for you. If OP can find a woman who wants to date him for reasons beyond getting a green card that is great.\n\nI am not suggesting OP date Asian women  solely because they will be willing to date him. You are insinuating he cannot find somebody who will love him for who he is. \n\nIf OP wants results, he is already on the right track by working on himself. I suggest he start out with classes, find hobbies and meet people naturally before trying out dating apps those are all good recommendations too Best of luck. I am I treated in the reply\u2019s My experience has been that most women do not really care that much.

That is makes me feel better!", "Small tumors vs big Some of my small tumors hurt so bad but the much larger ones do not hurt much at all why is that. The small ones do not seem to be growing. It could be location of the tumors but it could also just be random. Are they internal or external? I do not know what you mean you cannot see them but you can feel them. It is likely the location of the tumor. You should also make your doctor aware of the pain you are having as unfortunately these tumors can become cancerous and when they do they can be very painful. I have had that happen to me twice, once in 2014 and again in 2018. The doctors suck I hate going to them but I did make one with  NF specialist but is far I just going to see if I can hold out till then the pain stoped but randomly starts again do not know why it would stop and start again. I do not like going to the doctor either, but you really should go sooner rather then later. The one in my leg was a high grade cancerous tumor, while the one in my arm was a lower grade, but because of the pain I was having and the unsureness from the mri results, doctors were not sure if it was my sensory nerve effected or my median nerve. If it were my median nerve I could lose the ability to use my hand and require another surgery. Thankfully it was the sensory nerve. Also back in 2006/2007 I have having some issues going on and it turned out I had two tumors pressing against my cervical spine, had it not been caught in time I could have woken up one day and not been able to get out of bed.\n\nI am not trying to scare you, but I want you to be aware that when something is going on you need to go see your doctor.

Luckily, there were very small changes since 2014. But still I am freaking out. I have tumors in my torso. One is infiltrating into spinal cord. Can this make me disabled? I cannot calm down, and shaking while writing this. I just think what can happen. And surgery would not be possible cuz I have small lung capacity. I just cannot continue my normal life. I have scoliosis and sternum deformed, and I have been okay with it. But the thing that something can happen freaks me out, and I am only 25.\n\nAny advice? Thank you so much The tumors can make you disabled, but it does not have to change your quality of life. As a 47, (I am old) male NF has had a huge impact on my life and a lot of it for the good. Be mindful of the tumors you do have, they can stay the same and have no impact on your life. But, they can change and if they do you have to change the way you do things in life.\n\nEnjoy life to the fullest, dance like there is no tomorrow, and be happy.

If you spend your life worrying about what **could** happen in your life, you will not have any time to **live** your life. Definitely do not worry about it. It is never good to worry about what could be as we cannot control it. Things may be fine or they could progress. There is no way to know. Just enjoy your life as much as possible. I have had my fair share of issues during my life time such as a learning disability and 27 brain surgeries, but I very rarely even think of NF. Best not to look stuff up on the internet. Neurofibromatosis can effect everyone differently, it is good to keep up with doctors appointment and keep up to date with MRIs and so on.\n\nSome people can be disabled to different degrees, I am one of those, while other can live very normal lives with little to no limitations. It is different for everyone.\n\nI have had two surgeries related to my Neurofibromatosis, the last two were to remove tumors that had turned cancerous, but they were removed and I was good to go.\n\nI have since June 1st been on the medication Koselugo, which is a drug that came out over a year ago that helps shrink tumors. The fda only approved it for children, but with your doctors/specialist help it is possible to get it approved for an adult. I was told it can take about 6-8 months before seeing results of any shrinkage. I am set to see my specialist on the 18th of this months. I would guess that sometime between now and January I will be having some MRIs done to see what the results are.\n\nIf you have any questions, let me know. I do not know who told you surgery wasnt an option because of your lung capacity but I am almost positive theyre wrong.\n\nTalk to your neurologist/doctor about the spinal cord tumor. I had two that nearly paralyzed me, In a period of 6 months I went from being able to run a mile to about 10% movement in my hands and legs before I had surgery. Waiting to do something about was probably one of the worst things I did The anesthesiologist. How old were you then Yea but I just cannot tell myself that. In comments one guy had ones that nearly paralzyed him. I am freaking out now more 25, I had my surgery right at the beginning Of covid. And I have had about 10 other surgeries before but they are for very simple removals and was out of the hospital same day Thank you for your comment. I know but I just cannot calm down. In comment section someone said they had one that nearly paralzyed him. I just started to panic more Honestly, I just freaked out more. Where those 2 already existed or new ones I had known about it for a long time because it stuck out so much and figured I would just wait till it became a problem to deal with it which I learned is not a good approach with spinal tumors. Definitely something that should be imaged every year Majority of my surgeries had nothing to do with a tumor. Most were for a shunt that was implanted at age 4 for hydrocephalus, which means \u201cwater on the brain.\u201d Had a bunch of revisions to fix the shunt, but nothing since 2009.  Had one for a brain tumor, but ironically, it was not related to NF. What did your doctor say about this? Did they say you cannot have surgery? You need therapy if reading other people's stories is making you freak out/panic as you say. What has your doctor said about the imaging results? Also, do they specialize in nf? I am on therapy Thank you for your comment. We will, I am a lab tech. I would not be able to work. I would depend on others. I am holding with current situation, but thinking it could change freak the hell out of me I understand. But still you had the one in the spine. And.my country is not that developed for options Thank you for your reply. I am from the Balkans (Europe) and I my neurologist said nothing when I mentioned kosulego Thank you\u2764\ufe0f Just that it slightly changed, we do not have nf specialist in my country :( I do not know since I had to go back to town I live, and my mother was with the doctor. But in general they say I cannot have surgery with total anesthesia That is odd. Here is a website if you would like to read up on it, I am not sure if there is one for Europe.\n You should call the doctor and get more info. You are an adult and your parents should not be the ones talking to the doctor without you. hey love. \nmy 13 yo son was diagnosed with type 2 (tumors on central nervous system) when he was 9. \nthe first year was absolutely fucking terrifying. i fell into a black hole. i scoured the internet. i joined groups. we had appointment after appointment. one thing to the next. and the next. it does not end. \n\nand then i came out of it. \ni realized no one shared the good stuff on the internet. \ni understand we cannot live in fear, because that is not living. \ni know he will have challenges, but i also know we are strong enough to get through them. \nthis disease is so fucking terrible. i have had doctors straight day to my face, \u201cit is always the worst when a kid with nf comes in\u201d. \n\nso, fuck it. \nhe has his third brain surgery tomorrow. \nthen we will re-teach him how to walk and we will have a party. \n\nyes. a lot of terrible shit can happen. both in type 1 and type 2. and yes, the treatment options are surgery and for some types, chemo. and yes, you could become disabled. THAT SUCKS. \n\nonce you accept that this disorder can be mild or terrible, you walk through that anxiety and accept that fear. and keep doing your life the way you are now. and take care of your body and your Self. and build your support system. find doctors that KNOW nf, and see them. find a therapist who you feel comfortable with. \n\nyou are going to be okay.", "Should I go get checked out? Hello everyone, I have type 1 NF and was diagnosed around the time when I was 5 and I am currently 16.\n\nRecently, I have been having really awful headaches, and I have noticed some of the bumps on my scalp have come back. (I got surgery for the bumps on my scalp when I was little, which is when I found out I had NF) and there also is a bump forming on my forehead too (it is been there for quite awhile but I just now started to feel bad pain) \n\nHowever, I do not know if I am just having bad headaches from stress over school as I am pretty stressed over it constantly, or if it is NF tumors causing the pain, what should I do? I do not want to waste my parents time and make then take me and it be nothing, so I do not know. \n\nThank you! Hey its always weird when we have pains in our body especially in the head because we dont know if it is NF pain or \"normal\" pain. it cant get hurt to checked out but we cant run to the doctors all the time but as someone with a brain tumour i know how easy it is to worry about these little things. if you dont want to worry your parents ( they wont mind as you are their child and they love you\" monitor it for say a week or 2 on how bad the pain gets and how frequent it is Keeping an eye on your health, especially with NF of any variety, is not a waste of anyone\u2019s time. You should get yourself checked out to make sure that you have not developed anything troublesome, and also to give yourself some peace of mind (which is incredibly important as a student!). Your parents probably want to know when you are struggling and want to help you when you are. Talk to them about it. \n\nAlso- I hope that you get to feeling better! When is the last time you were assessed? Do you have anyone following you for your NF? As a parent with a NF1 child, I can safely say your parents will not feel like you are wasting their time. Go gave it checked out, even if it is nothing. It is a good idea to continue to keep things in check when concerning your Neurofibromatosis. I see my specialist regularly (at least once a year, sometimes more) and have since I was diagnosed back when I was 15. And one of the things he always asks me about is if I am having headaches and how bad they are. If something does not feel right, go get checked out. It may be nothing but if it is, you can catch it  early. If you have unexplained pain anywhere, it means your body trying to tell you something. Each parent responds to NF1 differently. I have known parents who are unsupportive. OP- I do not know how your parents would respond. I hope they are supportive. But if they are not (even unintentionally), it is always still worth advocating for your health. If something does not feel right (even if it ends up being nothing), it is okay to say something. You are just figuring out how to take care of yourself and how to navigate the health challenges that come with NF. And there is nothing wrong with that. I see my NF doctor once a year just so everything is kept up to date.  I JUST started my first medication for NF.  So I would advise to see a doctor.  My mind is leaning towards neurology rather than a NF doctor, but that likely is because of having seizures most of my life. Apologies for the late reply, the last time I was assessed was a year or two ago I believe. Currently I have no one following me for my NF because my old doctor retired It would not be a waste of time if it turned out to be nothing, because you will be able to use your scans as a baseline for future appointments! I remember having a lot of worrisome headaches around your age, and it turned out to be stress related. I say this as a parent myself, I would want my kid to tell me so we could check things out! I would get it checked.  It would not matter if it was my NF warrior or my other child suffering those symptoms.  I would get either child checked.", "Possibly NSFW: Has anyone had any experience with getting a neurofibroma removed from their butt? Long story short, I have neurofibromas running up and down my left leg.  One behind my knee that I almost got removed due to a lot of pain when I was 10, but a doctor thought it could cause nerve damage, so we decided not to.  One popped up on my left thigh a few years ago, that hurts off and on, and then the mother of all them popped up in my left butt cheek.  This hurts around 75% of the time I am sitting, and then another bought of pain as I am first standing up.  These tumors seem to work in tandem, as if one of them starts hurting, the others do, too.  The one behind my knee, for example, is causing me the most pain it has in years (it subsided shortly after we decided not to remove it.)\n\nAnyways, I want all three of these gone, but the one in the butt seems to be the most pressing issue (pun shamefully intended).  Does anyone have any experience removing a tumor from their butt?  How major of a surgery is it? I suspect that this procedure's ease / outcome would likely depend on whether or not it is similar to the one behind your knee or on a special area. I have had two removed from my back and at the time (and still) one on my spine seemed to discourage the surgeon.\n\nI have one in my left thigh too that I have recently noticed and unfortunately I think it is too deep in the muscle tissue to dig out... idk what the repercussions will be of ignoring it.\n\nI think it really varies case by case and I also think there are not enough informed primary care physicians. See this thing is it depends on how deep the tumor is in the muscle. The deeper it is the more risks such as losing feeling and such. If it is more surface it will not be major at all. I do not know if I am too late but I had one on my butt! I have NF2 but there was a giant one just growing there. They removed it and all was good but now I have this giant pocket of weird loose skin that looks like a massive bruise. \nI actually have pictures of the tumour and the surgery. You are not too late at all!  Thank you so much for your response.\n\nThe only real problem with this one I can see is it appears to be pretty deep in the cheek, not on the surface at all.

I have also heard of injections my actual interpersonal nerves, but I am unsure so far. I ordered some patches on Amazon and they should be here soon, OTC strength. As for the nerve blocks, they have not yet. The  neurosurgeon knew about my pain, but was more concerned about some broken issues on my lumbar spine. So I just had some of those removed a week ago, and I am recovering. I did send a message to both my neurosurgeon and neurologist and should hopefully hear back from them on Monday.

Is there anyway any of you have help improve your own thought process. Oh and I am 40 now. Maybe try playing memory games or even video games. I always had bad memory. I play videogames and do puzzlegames, but I cannot say for sure if they help improving or prevent decline.

Some background, I am a 27 year old male, and for the past 7-8 years I have been suffering from an inability to defecate properly. After dozens of doctor visits, and many, many tests, my colorectal surgeons generally agreed that I have obstructed defective disorder as a result of a weak pelvic floor. We tried biofeedback and exercises to solve this issue, but to no avail. At this point, I have given up on what seems to be a hopeless issue, but two things have made me curious as to what might be an avenue of hope:\n\n(1) my father has NF1 that has resulted in a benign tumor on his eye. I have never had any such tumors, but recently\n\n(2) I have noticed a pretty big lump in my lower back (sacral area). I saw an internist about this, and he said that it might just be a lipoma since it is superficial, but the area was never scanned.\n\nI was just wondering if it is possible, given this background, that I have NF1 that has gone undiagnosed. What sort of doctor can I see to get some tests done on this? What sort of nerve issue might cause my constipation and hypertonic pelvic floor issues? Any advice is appreciated. While I am 43 and female ..\nI have had cyclical bouts of constipation but never tied it to NF \nI did know someone who is (non NF) Child had issues and they thought it was nerve issues in the colon.\nMaybe a gastroenterologist or proctologist? \nNot sure if it helps but hope you find your answers. Your father's diagnosis alone means you have a 50% chance of inheritance, and your lump might very well be a fibroma. While light years from an official diagnosis, some common, easily identifiable signs of NF1 include:\n\n- Freckles in the armpits and groin\n- Caf\u00e9 au lait spots, brown pigmentation spots named for their color, sized from about 5mm\n- Yellow-brown-ish nodules in the iris (lisch nodules)\n\nThat said, I have never heard about defecation issues with NF1, but given how complicated this condition is I would pass the notion completely. But take it up with your general physician on where to go to get a proper diagnosis. There is a 50% chance of it being passed done when one parents has the condition, but a neurologist would need to diagnose you with it. I was diagnosed with it when I was 15, What is strange is that when I was a teenager, I had the opposite problem (constant diarreah). Unfortunately the gastro I saw did nothing for me other than refer me to a colorectal, so I am not too hopeful about that avenue. Thanks for the reply; I read about that criteria recently, but after looking around, I do not see any of those signs. I have had a subungual melanoma (underneath the nail), which my dad also has, but that is apparently not part of the criteria for NF1 diagnosis. \n\n&gt;That said, I have never heard about defecation issues with NF1, but given how complicated this condition is I would pass the notion completely. But take it up with your general physician on where to go to get a proper diagnosis.\n\nI will try to see a neurologist about this; my internist dismissed the lump as a lipoma (although he did an issue a scan which I did not get a chance to do), but to be fair, I failed to mention that my father has NF1. Hey man I think I can shed some light onto your situation, \n\nI have had hypertonic pelvic floor muscles for almost 11 years (although I did not know it was hypertonic for that long). This started with a kegels injury, my pelvic floor went into spasm. Over the years the muscles stayed in spasm and weakened. I have noticed my symptoms will flare up if I am constipated, sometimes to such an intense pain it is almost unbearable for long periods of time. But usually it just feels extra tight and warm in my perineum. Once I relive myself I instantly feel better. There is a strong connection between defecating and pelvic pain since those muscle work closely with your rectum. Let me know if this helps, I would like to keep up with how you are doing. I have Schwannomatosis, not NF1, but since we are talking about tumors here, I think that my experience is at least somewhat relevant.  I had 3 tumors on the cauda equina in the L1-2 region of my spinal cord.  They were causing pain, but I was able to deal with that using gabapentin and topical THC/CBD ointments.  However, I was told to see my neurosurgeon immediately if I noticed a change in bladder and bowel control, since the location of the tumor was in one of the regions that controls that.  I started having bladder control issues, so they removed the largest of the 3, even though it had not started causing compression of the nerves to avoid me becoming incontinent.   \n\n\nSo . . . the tumor you have in your sacral area could be pressing on one of the nerves that control bowel function.  You can ask your doctor for an MRI of the area, and they should be able to tell you if that is the case.  Good luck! &gt; I started having bladder control issues, so they removed the largest of the 3, even though it had not started causing compression of the nerves to avoid me becoming incontinent.\n\nInteresting; did you have *any* sort of symptoms resembling incontinence or tightness prior to the removal of those tumors? If so, did the surgery ameliorate those symptoms? Apologies for the late reply, I do not use reddit much. \n\nMy problem has nothing to do with pelvic pain. It has entirely to do with the muscles being totally unable to relax and push out stool properly. Believe me, I have tried everything you can think of on this subject. My daily fiber intake is good (both soluble and insoluble), so it does not have to do with my diet. I have tried biofeedback (did absolutely nothing), botox injections (did absolutely nothing), pelvic floor exercises (did absolutely nothing). This is why I keep thinking NF is the culprit. The good news is that I got the lab order to get the NF1 gene test done, so I will know if I have it soon. I started to have problems holding my urine in prior to surgery. I just basically put myself on a schedule of going to the bathroom even if I did not feel like I had to pee to avoid accidents. Once the tumor was removed I stopped having these issues. The surgeon told me that if I had let things go longer it could have caused nerve damage so that the incontinence could not be reversed. &gt; The surgeon told me that if I had let things go longer it could have caused nerve damage so that the incontinence could not be reversed.\n\nThat is very disconcerting news for me to hear.

Hi NF family.. just curious if I am the only alcoholic and pill popper here? I do not take of my health at all in the hope of an early death. No, my life matters to me, as do the people around me. I would never do anything that would harm me or them. I am not an alcoholic or pill popper. I do go out a lot by only drink socially. Life\u2019s too short to worry like this. Yes, NF can be difficult to deal with for many, but it is not worth hurting yourself even more by abusing alcohol and pills. Try to enjoy your life and do not try to end it early. Perhaps instead of focusing on what your life looks like now you could begin focusing it on what you wanted it to look like.  Maybe do not imagine football star or astronaut!  But what would make life feel worthwhile to you?  And what can you do to move toward that goal?

Definitely good Facebook groups, search nf1 or neurofibromatosis. Also there are some hospitals that have NF clinics that sometimes have support groups or can help in that regard. There is an NF camp I believe as well, some type of summer camp. There is information on ctf.org (children's tumor foundation, ending NF with research). They also put on walks to raise money to end nf in many many cities and are a great opportunity to meet others. You can register online ctf.org, it is free, but they like you to register so they know who will be there and also I believe they provide food. Definitely worth checking out!

Really, truly it is fucking scary and honestly sometimes I am glad I am so good at shoving my emotions down deep because having this (or any, I imagine) genetic condition is an anxiety nightmare. I hate just having to wait. Everyone tells me there is no point worrying about the future, and that nobody is guaranteed tomorrow, but fuck!! I just wanted to vent.

In 1996 i had the surgery for scoliosis . harrington rod fusion to my upper spine. I was never treated for my NF1. Still to this day im am now 35 and had 1 child . my pain by my shoulder is in extreme pain. I have a rib hump but I am not sure if i have tumors on my spine or my nerves or anywhere. Maybe my brain. I get headaches every day for the past 10 years. Sometimes migraines. Vision is getting worse . My question is , with having a harrington rod, would it be safe to get a MRI? I have not had one since before the scoliosis surgery. Im always in constant paij and i need to go to pain management because my dr can no longer perscribe my tramadol as i am a chronic pain paitient and she is not a pain dr. I cannot afford treatment and lost my job of 10 years. I worked retail sales and 8 hours of standing and walking bending lifting. I feel like im 80! I wonder if theres any NF specialists who take medicaid ?  MRI will not be affected by Harrington Rods  Thank you. I need to get to the root of this dibilitating pain. It is unbearable. Unfortunately i have passed my NF1 to my son. He was confirmed at 6 months old. He is almost 2. Im not going to ignore his NF like py parents did til I was a kid. Always accusing me of fakinging headaches and never treating my learning disabilities. It was rough on me. Hope I can do what I can for my son.  Is there an NF clinic in your area?

I stare daggers back at adults who make faces, I have snapped at adults who make degrading comments, but mostly I try to utilize education. Especially when it comes to children. \n\nThe other day a pre-teen made a rude comment to him while we were at the store the other day about him needing to be on an episode of Dr Pimple Popper.\n\nI did not hear it, but I could see on his face that something happened. I asked who, he willingly pointed him out, and instead of confronting the kid himself, I addressed his mother. The kid went white as a sheet when he was essentially told on.\nThe mother came to our defense and we again we were able to utilize it as a teaching moment as well as the kid realizing neither his mother nor Strangers will put up with bullying comments. I can only hope it sticks with some of the people, often asking them if they would like it if someone stared and made mean comments about something THEY have no control over.\n\nBut this particular comment has really struck a chord with him and he is been really depressed and in a funk since. \nI remind him daily that he is loved, that I think he is a wonderful, handsome man, and that \"those who matter do not mind, and those who minds do not matter\". Just as daily reassurances to help build the confidence that years have spent beating out of him. \n\nI am just not sure what else I may be able to do to help him out of this funk and I just do not know what to do. \nI cannot claim to know what he deals with daily, I just hate seeing him so upset without knowing what I can do to help. \n\nAny advice is welcome. TIA for any help!\n\nTldr; how do you cope/help a loved one cope with rude remarks? Best thing I can say is just be the person you are being and keep telling him how much you love him.  Not sure how old you guys are, I am 37 and get comments / looks etc, and it still hurts. \n\nLike you and your fiance (congrats btw!) Educating younger kids is one thing , but adults and teens should know better. Neither of you owe anyone an explanation for his existence or condition.\n\nBut everyone is different and he might feel like it helps to tell people. Ultimately, for me reassurance from my husband about how much he loves me helps me.  Remind him how much you love him and how great, sexy, wonderful you think he is. Keep being there. \n\nFeel free to DM if you want to chat. X Hey, so i feel words have power, you continuously making him feel good about himself will definitely help him, so keep doing that but remember words have power only when the person we direct to accepts and believes in it and not just thinks we are saying it to just to make them feel better, so contact a counsellor maybe who can help him build that. \nSecondly i think we all should together try to give very less importance to looks which is ofc very difficult living in a world that thrives on looks but once we give less importance to how we look, any rude comment will not hurt him. And this attitude can be build with a counsellor too.\nSo i feel explaining a counsellor his situation might be  helpful Just ignore! Life is too short to worry what people think about you. Cherish every moment!\n\nEdit: He should have already realized that by now with NF, He might be more worried what you think when people react that way. If its okay with you, then nothing matters. Re-phrase the experience.  You use the word 'rude' and place a negative tone on what happened.\n\nPerhaps you consider these comments as 'accidental comments' or 'curious remarks'.  Some people who have unique appearances will consider remarks education opportunities to engage strangers in a way to share information about their looks in a kind, compassion way.  You or your fiance could offer to explain NF1 to someone who makes accidental comments.\n\nYou get to decide if you are in a world of rude comments or curious, inviting comments. Oh I love staring back at the kids and making ugly faces at them. The guilty looks are hilarious.  You have got to try and make some humor out of the situation. There is a time to be mature and educate people,  but sometimes you need a good laugh.\n\nETA: I am in the same exact relationship configuration as you (I do not have NF, my fiance does). I love that you went to mom for a teaching moment. \n\nI am actually really scarred that my NF will progress and I will not look \u201cnormal.\u201d  I know people who are covered in fibromas. I have lovely people in my life who ground me and remind me of my outer and inner beauty. I would also honestly recommend therapy, I have a therapist who I talk about my NF with. She gives me DBT skills and acceptance skills. People with NF are unfortunately often subject to stares, comments, etc. I have NF, but do not any noticeable tumors, neurofibromas that stand out. People said things in the past with the size of my head (which is due to hydrocephalus related to NF). It is not too big in my mind, but people still noticed. Not a big deal to me. Believe it or not, none of it bothered me. I actually poked fun at myself to prove that. This was actually during my early school years with classmates. I am friends with many of them now. These comments actually stopped shortly after. One guy felt really bad after he found out I had a condition that caused it. He actually cried. We became friends shortly after. I know it is harder to do with with strangers, but I suggest he be as strong as possible and try not to let those comments bother him. What someone looks like has no bearing on who they are as a person. I obviously do not know him but he sounds like a really good person. People who make these comments obviously have something wrong with them, maybe except for the kid who probably could not comprehend he what he was saying. He should try to keep his head up and enjoy life and not let those people who clearly lack maturity bother him. Thank you! We are about the same age as yourself. Most of the time he just \"let us it go\" if you can say that, because I know it still takes a blow to his self esteem. This particular comment from the kid has really hurt him. \n\nHe is has surgery to remove some fibromas in the past that have been particularly large or in painful places like the backs of his knees. I know those scars also make him more self conscious. I want to help him realize no one else's opinions matter, but his take on things is to \"hide\". \n\nHe is felt education is best for kids, because he said as a kid that is when he got the worst teasing. He understands it is human nature to look at things that we do not recognize, are unusual or scary. It happens from everything to a person who is 7 feet tall to car wrecks. So he is feels educating then young will help in maybe stopping them from making snap comments or reactions to someone else in the future that looks \"different\" than what they view as \"normal\".\n\nI tell him every day how handsome, amazing, sexy, etc that I think he is. I made him a daily reassurance note that he laminated and carried with him in his wallet. \nI just feel so lost on what else I can do. This kid was the first comment I have seen from anyone that made him cry when we got home.\n\nI will definitely chat with you soon! Thank you! X He is covered in them as well, and has had some removed in the past due to pain, size, or location of them. \n\nHe said growing up as a kid with it was the worst about teasing. He thinks educating then young will hopefully help them from making comments about others who are \"different\". In some cases, it is better to get the parents involved. Because children are often far more afraid of the punishments they will receive at home than comments from some random stranger. \n\nDo you see a therapist who specializes in things like NF? Like when my father had his leg amputated he had a special therapist who is worked with amputees to help them cope and understand things beyond what his normal doctor and PT worked with him on. \n\nI just want to be able to help my fianc\u00e9 enjoy his life as much as he can and not let others that he will likely never see again, bother him. \n\nThanks for the help! Even with NF, a person does not always and should not have to learn to ignore people making rude comments. People should just stick to the golden rule we were taught as kids, if you do not have anything nice to say do not say anything. \nThe burden of having to take abuse should not have to be shouldered by anyone with something out of their control. \n\nIt MIGHT have something to do with how he perceives I will view him, though I am not sure. But this time the comments made him cry, and that is not what anyone wants to see from their loved ones. \n\nThat is part of the reason I tell him every day how much I love him, value him, and how I think he is incredibly handsome. As I said in my post, we usually utilize education. But there is no real way to spin comments like \"you need to be on an episode of Dr pimple popper\" as anything but ride and negative. That is the hardest thing I think for him to accept, is that I DO find him attractive. He hears me and listens to me. But I know he does not fully believe me. \n\nHow do you find a therapist that specializes in something like this? Like I saw a grief counselor who specializes in death when my parents and sister died. When my dad had his leg amputated, he was seem by a therapist who specializes in working with people who do not have/lost limbs. \n\nBut all of those are \"more common\" than someone with NF. Or would just a regular counselor be the way to go? \n\nSecondly I agree. Beautyis subjective and changes based on who you ask. So the fact that society pages so much value is something so subjective is ridiculous. Looking forward to it xx If some has big mold on face people stare. In NF whole body is filled (not only on surface but deep within), along with the discomfort. I think he is blessed to have someone like you who see the true inner him. Supporting morally is good thing, but do not over do it. We know how we look, we cannot change it. We ignore those who fail to make eye contact when we communicate. So...not who you commented to, and I was not going to say anything, however...\n\nLet me start by saying I have NEVER seen an episode of the show, but I guess recently there actually has been a few guests of the show who have Neurofibromatosis. Sure the kid was probably being rude, but there is a small chance that an awkward teen may have said the wrong thing while trying to actually start a conversation. There have been moments in my own life, where I think someone is being a bit of an a-hole, only to realize that they did not actually intend to be one. I do not have a therapist who specializes in NF, but she has a social work degree and worked in a school and had multiple students who had NF. I think a good therapist would do research to understand NF. \n\nYour partner is very lucky to have someone who cares so deeply.

Hello\n\nHope you are all doing as well as can be. I have two questions today, have you had the covid vaccine and how are you? And separately, do you use any alternative or holistic therapies if so do you have any success with that? I got the shot back in late May, never had any issues anytime after the shot like some other who said after the shot they felt sore, feverish, and real tired. Time will only tell long term if there will be any issues, but my Neurofibromatosis specialist was the one who told me it was okay to get the shot. Either way I would consult with your doctor about it, do not feel pressured to do something you are not ready to do. I am all for people making their own personal choice regarding this shot, as some of us just are not comfortable because of the unknown long term, then there are those like my dad who just cannot have the shot because of certain medical conditions.\n\nI have no information on holistic therapies, I have had about four surgeries related to my Neurofibromatosis and take medication for pain.\n\nIf you have any questions let me know. I have my second dose of Moderna at July 1st, I had some fever in the evening and was tired next day, nothing more.\n\nI am sceptic. I do not believe in most of the so called alternative because most of them has no scientific base Got Pfizer in April. Sore arm and felt a liiiiiitle under the weather for a couple hours with the 2nd shot. \n\nDo not do anything holistic. I got the Moderna shot this spring. My husband felt more sickish than I did,  but I def felt better just laying on the couch. I mostly just felt worn out. Also work was hard at that time so I used the excuse to lay about for a day. \n\nWhat kinds of alternative or holistic therapies do you mean? Oils and the like? I do not believe they do anything for treatment besides smell good. \n\nI am not opposed to certain \u201cherbs\u201d for treatment.

Nth else", "Question: Any tips about how/when to tell significant other about NF1 diagnosis I am female college student with nf1.  Any tips on when and how to tell a boyfriend about the disease?  I would rather tell someone early rather than later, but not too long into a relationship.  Any tips would be greatly appreciated. I have struggled to always find the right way to tell a significant other about my diagnosis too. For me it is best to tell them that you have to tell them something important if things start to get more serious. Tell them about your diagnosis and be prepared if they have any questions about it. For me I tell people pretty early on, but NF has dramatically effected my life. So while I could get by with not telling people for a long time I typically am very open about the basics. And the more serious parts of it later( like my lack of ability to have kids, pass on gene...exc) I have visible tumors (even when fully clothed), so this is something that would come up naturally and I would tell them then.  (Eventually they would ask about a tumor; or I would mention one of my surgeries and they would ask about that). The significance to having children would come up at the same time the topic of children came up, or never, for relationships that were not headed in that direction. I never went out of my way to announce my NF but it is also not something I have ever kept a secret. Maybe because my case is visible I have never thought about when to tell people. Usually they ask! It is a tough talk to have, i had it with mt ex fiance, and she pushed me away because of it. But I am not to certain on this but im sure it skips a generation. If that helps. You can take it slowly and bring it up or have your parents help you with it if they know more about it. Hi sure it skips a generation, I am Dad\ud83d\udc68 just tell them I do not even hide it (hard in some cases) I have a massive fibroma on my leg, so before anything happened I explained it so no questions would come up. That is really sad.  Thanks for your comment.\n\nPS: NF1 is considered dominant (though I think its a little more complicated than punnet squares) so it does not skip generations I think i told my hubs when we were 4-6 months in? Maybe sooner. Its really up to you. You will know when the time is right, especially if you see yourself with them long term I think the best way is to just tell him without being too awkward about it. The passing of NF is 50/50. It does not skip generations. It can also spontaneously mutate. No, NF does not skip a generation. There is a 50% risk of passing it by and I am glad to hear your child was lucky enough to get mommy's gene instead of yours. :) I believe it is autosomal recessive, so the Punnett Square would look like this:\n\nNF1 parent (top), non-NF1 parent (left)\n    r        r\n  -----------------\n  |  rr   |  rr   |   \nr |       |       |\n  |----------------\n  | Rr    | Rr    | \nR |       |       |\n  ----------------- No it is definitely autosomal dominant. Okay yeah, I had those definitions mixed up Hi, I just want to share that if children are something that you want and you can afford it, IVF with genetic testing can tell you if the embryo has the NF1 gene. So you could decide which embryos to implant and be sure they do not have NF1. of course this is only if children are something you want, and everyone should be able to decide for themselves if they do or do not want children. I just wanted to make sure that you were aware of this possible option. Thank you so much \ud83d\udc97 I have been told that is an option, I would also need to find a surrogate bc I cannot carry children due to my tumor being in my bladder and uterus.... However it is amazing that technology has advanced this far I just bring it up when and f something relevant happens. Someone sees a surgical scar of a tumor. I kind of always felt like if I make a big deal out of it then the person will too. I told my boyfriend about 4 months into dating about my sons possible NF. At the time he only had several CALS and was not formally diagnosed. I told him he might have it and it could cause health issues in the future. I disclosed this because our relationship felt like it was becoming more serious and I noticed that they were growing close.I did not want him to feel blindsided. About 2 months later he proposed to me. A good guy will stick around. A year later my (now our) son was formally diagnosed after a large plexi was found from his neck and into his chest. Husband has stayed overnight in hospitals been to oncology, neuro, and several other specialty appointments for him.

I would advise not taking anything like steroids unless it is medically needed by a doctor as I am sure that be like giving the tumors super juice.  I have been working out since I was 15, 34 now. Most supplements will no effect on your NF and also your gains. Test boosters are all overpriced herbs and fluff that you would have to take 3-5 times of to get any results which would be minimal anyway. If you are going to use anything supplement some protein. After 15 years I use beta alanine and AAKG as a personal preference.", "Hi Hello!\n\nI dont know if this is the correct subreddit for this or not. I have been in and out of different hospitals for the last 6 months because of tumors in my leg.\n\nI have been referred to a surgeon and a neurologist that believe it may be schwannomatosis, neurofibromatosis type 3.\n\nI havent been diagnosed yet, but Im looking for other people who may be diagnosed with this disease. From my own degree as a \"google doctor\" it seems that this diagnose fits me very well. I have Neurofibromatosis type one and have tumors all throughout my body, especially in my right leg. In 2014 I had a high grade cancerous tumor removed. I highly recommend to stop diagnosing yourself using google and was not until you see the surgeon and neurologist. Only they will be able to diagnose you. Hi there! \n\nI also may have schwannomatosis, but I do not have a definitive diagnosis yet either. My neurologist thinks the next tumor removed will probably prove it.\n\nI am not sure I can be much help but I wanted you to know there is at least 1 more of us", "After spinal fusion is my neck stronger or weaker? xt week will be 1 year ago that I had my spinal fusion surgery.  They remove the fibroma from C6 and fused C5 through T1.  After I finish physical therapy 4 months later and was pretty much back to normal it showed up on an CAT scan that two of the screws worked their way a little loose. So for anxious stability they went through anteriorly this time and put a cage around the same area but from the front.  Now I am pretty much almost 100% healed I still have some stiffness in my traps in my upper shoulders but I go for a trigger point injections for that.  I am no longer taking any opiates but I do smoke medical marijuana almost everyday. \n\nNow that you know my backstory, I can ask;\n\nAfter having all this new metal in my neck is a technically weaker or stronger God forbid I was to get into a car accident?  I will say that I do have some limited movement.  I cannot head bang to metal music anymore. This is a question you should ask your doctor. The doctor and surgeon who over saw your surgery and has access to your medical records and X-ray would know better than anyone here. ", "nf1 and the covid-19 pfizer vaccine has there been any research done on getting the covid vaccine while having nf1? i am getting it soon and i am feeling a little nervous about it. I do not believe there is any reason to be more concerned about this vaccine than any other. Millions of people have been vaccinated which means thousands of us, those with NF1 have been too. \n\nDo you have any specific concerns? I had my first one, next week the second.  I had nothing except the usual stiff arm. No, and there has not been any research done on people with cancer either.\n\nI myself and deciding not to get it. I have had cancerous tumors before, in 2014 and 2018, plus I take hydrocodone which has acetaminophen in it. I have read articles about how people if they take acetaminophen it reduces the effects of the vaccine. I take hydrocodone twice a day, a long with tramadol. The last time I had a flu shot which was about three or four years ago, it left a bump and that bump still has not gone away.  \n\nI am just not comfortable with taking the vaccine, I have already been exposed to the virus. My dad got sick in November after coming back from hunting, he actually did surprising well for someone who has an autoimmune condition. He was very sick in 2019 pretty much that whole year, he had to stay in a care place and needed help with everything and once he got his strength back needed to learn to walk again. So when he got the virus he was nervous, but he just ended up being very tired and had a cough. He is definitely will not be getting the vaccine, he is already talked with his doctor about it. And they both agree he should not get it. In years past the flu vaccine made him very sick where he had to go to the hospital. Just got my second dose. Besides the usual side effects that many people get I was fine. (I was out for the day/night with a bad headache and fatigue) I got moderna and had a sore arm from the first, and sore arm + low grade fever and body aches from the second. I cannot imagine why NF would have anything to do with a vaccine. It is not an immunity disorder. one of my main concerns is if i am more at risk to some of the side effects that have been discovered in the vaccine that is it really. also i am the minimum age requirement for it so i could be more at risk so that is also an concern I do not believe having NF1 has been demonstrated to have a higher likelihood for the side effects. Secondly, I do not think being the minimum age puts you at a heighten risk. But I am not a doctor. Talk to your doctor about this. I got the Pfizer and it did make me a little nauseated, fatigued and my arm killed, but I am 3 weeks out from having my second dose and I am feeling 100% fine! that gives me a better feeling about it thank you!", "Koselugo. Hey everyone.  I am doing some research and was hoping to learn about people's experience with Koselugo (good or bad or insurance problems or ??).  This drug was approved by FDA in May, 2020, so I thought maybe there might some insights after 9 months on the market. Please message me directly if you want to keep things private.  Thanks for any feedback you can provide. I have been taking it since October. Will go in for MRI later in the week--we will see if there is been any result in tumor reduction. Side effects not too bad: skin rash and some acid reflux have been mostly it. Nothing I cannot manage so far.  \n\nI was also denied by my insurance company, but I am receiving it directly from AZ. Insurance says Koselugo is still considered \"experimental\" for adults and would not budge after 2 appeals. That seems consistent with other stories I have heard.  AZ is trying to gather information regarding adults taking this drug, so they are willing to provide for a while without cost in order to learn.  I am not surprised that insurance is not covering this drug. List price is $150K/year, so until they have FDA approval, I doubt insurance is going to provide without a fight.  Good luck and I do hope the treatment proves successful is shrinking and/or stopping tumor growth. Good to know someone is gathering information. I imagine it will take time for the FDA to say, \"yes we approve this for children AND adults.\" In the meantime, I am grateful AZ has a program that provides the meds. I have had a plexiform tumor in my face since I was 6. I just turned 31 and my doctor told me that I did not qualify for the drug. It was only for Kids. I am going to Mass General soon, hoping that I can get some answers. Has your doctor reviewed information to see if you can take Mekinist? I just started taking it on the 17th. I have been experiencing some diarrhea and a pretty large rash that covers my chest, back, and shoulders (does not itch, just looks bad). I also have an acne rash all over my face. Other than those things, it is been going well with the meds. Of course, it is still pretty early on, so we will see with time. \n\nAs for insurance, it was not an issue for me even though I am an adult. It was considered a special drug, so it cost $50 (thank goodness) for 30 days worth of pills. Also, mine comes from an oncology pharmacy rather than a standard one. It has to be shipped to my house and I have to be home to sign for the shipment. \n\nHope this helps a little! Thanks for this information.  The list price for the drug is about $12K/mo (insurance price gets negotiated), so that is great that they are covering it.  I hope the rash gets better, and more importantly I hope the tumors shrink and pain (if you have pain) gets better.  Good luck to you... Absolutely! I was very lucky to have good insurance, I know othera are not so lucky. Hope you find the info you need!", "Natural remedies? Been feeling a decent amount of pain lately, I believe it to be from my NF1 just because of the spots that I am feeling at. Is there anything that I can use that is more natural then just taking pain killers like ibuprofen and such? I hate taking pills and would prefer something more natural. A lot of the pain I get is in spots in my back and my knees, and I have to work two jobs where I stand the whole time, so that does not help the pain at all. And if there is anything to help with itchiness as well, cause I get really itchy from it too. Thank you Unfortunately the only thing I have found that works the best in pain medication, I am on two different medications prescribed by a doctor. Sometimes the icyhot or lidocaine patches can help. Alright. It is going to be a while before I am able to get to a doctor about it, so hopefully icy hot will help me until then. Sometimes bathing in epsom salt can help at least bring some temporary relief. I would definitely try the icy hot patches or lidocaine patches versus the cream. The cream can be helpful, but I have found that the patches last a bit longer and will not rub off on your clothing. Thank you. I will for sure try that out today. I have done Epsom salt baths before and they have helped but it is not something that I can easily do between jobs. I will definitely buy some of those patches today though You are welcome. Hope it helps Have you tried THC or CBD? Prior to my surgeries I was in some pretty intense pain - a THC/CBD combo was amazing. I have tried CBD a bit but I do not think it was a strong enough dose of it to do much (cause it can be pricey) and as far as thc goes the state I live in medical is not legal so it is not something I can really do much with having the two jobs and all Valerian tea makes a slight difference My son has a large PNF on his lumbar spine.  It causes him some pain, but not to the extent that it sounds like you are experiencing.   Per his NF doc He takes B12 which she says can help.  He is been taking it now for about 10 months and he almost never experiences that pain.  I am amazed.  Again, his pain was mild, but it is worth a try!  \nGood luck!", "First of all let me say I hope I am posting this the right way. Forgive me if I am not. I just thought of a comeback that if someone is looking at you or making fun because of a bump that you look different you just tell them God thought I was too beautiful, so they had to strike me different because \" *whatever you want to say in here* \"  something along those lines you know what I mean.  The person would not expect that response.  Keep it positive", "Anyone else have \"lesions\"on the brain? Freaking out I recently had a bad headache, they sent me for an MRI and found I had a lesion on the brain?? They said they would do a repeat MRI in 3 months\n \nThey also found I had sphenoid wing dysplasia! But are not too concerned about this either, and just need another repeat MRI as well in a few months. \n\nI am 26F with no other issues with NF until now!! \n\nWorried this will effect me, or future ability to live a normal life? \n\nAnyone with similar experience? Thank you! I have lesions, a few since 17. They call it white spots on MRI I think. But it has not grown. I am 37 now. I am fine in the brain. If it does not grown then you will be fine I think. Did you get additional MRI for other parts of your body? Did they find anything else? I have them as well, have since my early teens.\nMy 12 year old daughter has them also, hers were found when she was about 5. We see the same specialist, who does generational studies, and she calls them UBOs (Unidentifiable Bright Objects). She said they are normal for NF. Yes. My back, my pelvis, ankles only because I have tumors grown there so have to moniter it. Two were found in my brain when I was 12 or 13.  Ive pretty much had yearly - every three year MRIs since.  They have not grown and one actually appears to have reduced in size.", "Mosaic NF2 or schwannomatosis tumor excision Hello all,\n\nMy wife (29F) is currently being screened for mosaic NF2/schwannomatosis at our local NF clinic. She has multiple schwannomas (MRI) in one limb but negative for the vestibular or spinal schwannomas. They said before we have consider having kids, we should ensure that we have a confirmed diagnosis to make an informed decision. They said the best way to do this for mosaic versions of the disorders is through excision of one schwannoma as bloodwork could not work on the mosaic version. Anyone have experience with schwannoma excision? They are going to give the surgeon his pick based on which one is most likely to result in no neurological deficits. Also - no guarantees.

I have only had surgery once in my life to remove a tumor in my neck, but lately I have noticed various new bumps around my body and a lot of new Cafe au lait spots.\n\nIf it matters, I am 16 years old, although I turn 17 in two weeks or so?\n\nBut yeah, I never really go to check ups and stuff.. so yeah. I see my NF doctor at least once if not twice a year in Chicago. I have been doing this since I was 15 years old, I am 35 now. I have yearly MRI scans. And between 2014-2018 I have had two cancerous tumors removed, one in my right leg and most recently in my right arm.\n\nSo y s I would highly recommend seeing your NF doctor on a more regular basis and having MRI scans done at least once a year if not every other year, because unfortunately these tumors can turn cancerous and even ones that do not they can still cause problems depending on where they grow and appear. \n\nI do not mean to scare you, every case is different, but it better to be safe then sorry.  I totally agree and understand. And yeah, the one in my neck was benign, although huge. Sadly I have a huge scar but oh well, there is nothing I can do about it.\n\nAlso, yeah, I will talk to my parents about it, thanks. and sorry to ask another question. Are MRI taken on the whole body? Or what is the procedure/technique? You can ask any questions you want. MRIs can be done of the whole body. Mine are usually done in two days each day being around three hours total, sometimes four. \n\nI also have a tumor that is been growing on my neck, but given the location of where it is at for right now we are keeping an eye on it.  It is 100% individual. I go to specialists 1-2 a year and then every few years an MRI or some other type of test, but I have several tumors that need to be monitored. I should but rarely go to the doctor. I have not really had any issues with NF other than a lot of little bumps and back pain. I go about every 2-3 years or if there is something concerning. \nMy son has NF and he sees doctors regularly but as for MRIs it causes him great distress to the point of extreme mental anguish. His doctor said unless something manifests they do not want to put him through it. \nI do worry sometimes that any pain is a new NF issue... it really can change at any time. \n I stopped going as soon as I turned 18. \n\nMy logic was, I know my body, I will know when something is wrong. \n\nOne of my tumours has suddenly grown a fair bit, so I am going to see the neurologist about it (lucky he is one of the NF specialists in the UK, probably the most qualified tbh). \n\nOnly worrying thing is, it is either on my spinal cord, or right next to my spinal cord, so obviously the worry about paralysis is real.  I only see a doctor about my NF after surgery or if there seems to be a problem. I have had a bunch of health issues but none in 9 years. You should, especially since you are getting more bumps.I have not anything really grow in years and I still get yearly monitoring.  Honestly, unless something is bothering you or you have an ongoing issue, you really do not need to go in for check ups. You might be too old for it now, but it is always best to get yearly eye checkups with NF1 (and because of the nf, it is covered under your general health insurance)", "NF and Touch screen phones Hey all,\n\nHope everyone is well and keeping always from the awful and despicable COVID19.  \n\nThis is a random one I have found I have a large plexiform on my face and when I am on the mobile I have now found it keeps muting me trying to explain this to none NF people is hard and they do not really believe me. \n\nPlease tell me this is not just me.  \n\nP I am sorry this has not happened to me. I do have a good size tumor just below my right ear. Would it be possible trying using the phone on the other ear then the one you been using? Or would it be possible to get one of those Bluetooth ear pieces that has a little mic attached, that way you would not have to hold the phone up to your ear. When kids ask about my various bumps, I usually say \"it is kind of like a mole but the same color as my skin\". This works for adults too when either I do not feel like explaining or they do not understand. I do not have a plexiform tumor but sometimes I end up bumping the mute on my phone. \nI offer no explanation other than oops.", "NF Possibility/ Doctor visits Hello everyone. I am so happy to have found this sub and get real advice from real people. I have a young daughter who is 7 years old. Since she was born, she is had cafe au lait spots. When she was a few years old, a PA at her pediatrician was the first person to mention that they could be a problem. Up until then, we would always assumed they were just quirky birth marks, albeit a large amount of them. So we took her to a pediatric neurologist (the only one in town due to small city) and he ran a blood test. He said it was negative, but that the test was not that reliable. Apparently, it had a high false negativity rate. So he pretty much said there was nothing else to do but wait. He admittedly did not know much about NF, so he had to look up info. We felt relieved just seeing the negative result. However, the spots kept spreading to her underarm then her groin. So then I started getting worried that perhaps she might have been a false negative. This has been on my mind for years now.  My husband thinks there might not be a need to get her evaluated right now if she is not showing any other symptoms, since our research seems to indicate there is not much to be done now. However, this is all online stuff. From people who have lived through this, I would like to know: Is there a benefit to getting it diagnosed already or should we just wait? I would like to know even though I know that even if she does have it, the severity is pretty much up in the air. I just like to be aware with my kids\u2019 health. However, I do not want to put my daughter through anything if it is unnecessary at this point and there is nothing they can do or check now. I read an article saying that age 10 is when more symptoms show up. I do not even know if that is true. So I would like your thoughts and advice, please. Anything would be appreciated because if I do take her to get checked out again, we will have to travel because this time I would like to find someone who is more familiar with NF.

There is always a benefit to being evaluated. My wife and son have NF1 and we are fortunate to see Dr Slopis in Houston. Working with him has given all of us price of mind and turned uncertainty into something we feel comfortable with moving forward. Definitely. It can come with myriad of problems especially during childhood age. From learning disabilities to scoliosis to neurofibromas and migraines and  a long list of other stuff.  It is best to get the proper diagnosis so that your child can be monitored. One of the things most, if not all, people with NF have is lisch nodules on the eyes. It is one of the markers for diagnosis. You can search for a pediatric neurologist for confirmation. I was diagnosed around 4. All the best. Let me know if I can answer anything else. I knew how confused and scared my mum was. I mentioned this the other day to someone else. I also live in a small community where most doctors do not know much about NF. But I was able to get a virtual appointment with a specialist (neurologist) that is familiar with NF.  \n\nThe Children's Tumor Foundation is a great NF resource, and I think they have a section on their site that will help you find doctors. The University of Utah has a pediatric hospital, and some of the docs run an NF clinic, I think there are also some good resources in Chicago. Thank you! I am in Texas, and Houston is actually where I was thinking of taking my daughter. Unfortunately our local pediatric neurologist was not aware of NF, and although he did try to do his research I would prefer to take her elsewhere. Yeah, I am pretty scared and confused now at the possibility. Now with COVID, it looks like I will have to wait to see anyone. I will look into CTF. It is unfortunate that I may have to travel for hours to see a good specialist, but if she is diagnosed then it is worth it. I will definitely look into the virtual appointments. Although, if she has not been diagnosed I wonder if they would even see her. I highly recommend the brain and spine center at MD Anderson. Specifically Dr John Slopis he has been incredible every step up the way for both my wife and my son both with NF type 1 If you are close enough contact Children's National in Washington DC. There is an NF Clinic team and they can do conclusive genetic testing. You may want to start there (or at an in state hospital that has an NF clinic) When I was born doctors thought I had it, but results were inconclusive I was tested again when I was nine with the same results. When I was 15 I was fully diagnosed by a Neurofibromatosis specialist in Chicago and have continued to see him for the last 20 plus years. \n\nYes there are benefits to get diagnosed sooner than later, but that mostly depends on how Neurofibromatosis effects the individual as it effects everyone differently. In my case Neurofibromatosis has gotten worse over the years, but some people have a very mild case of it. \n\nIf you can see a specialist who studies and sees patients with Neurofibromatosis I would highly recommend taking your daughter to them, especially because now there is a drug available that was recently approved by the fda to shrink tumors.\n\nIf you have questions let me know. If you live in closer to Austin, there is Austin Brain &amp; Spine as well. Thanks for the recommendation! I will look into it. Thank you!", "Where to start I was diagnosed with nf1 at 5 based on criteria. My mother never took me to any follow up appointments after that and growing up new very little about it. Flash forward I have 2 kids with it, one who went through chemo for optic never gliomas at 2 and again at 9 may be receiving treatment again. The other is followed by tumor board and oncology plus all other specialties as well. It was a very fast move with the oldest were we went straight to oncology because of eye protruding. \n\nMy question is, I am looking to start taking better care of myself and see who I should for my NF, so who should I have my Dr. refer me out to first? Genetics, Nuerology, anything else? My Dr. Is old and I do not think he knows much if anything about NF. I asked him for a referral once and he sent my to derm lol. I will basically have to tell him exactly what I want. \n\nIf any of this help, I was given the diagnosis based on CAL. Ive had one small nuerofibroma that was removed at a walk in clinic and I think it obvious as an adult that is now dealing with children that it did cause learning difficulty. \n\nThanks to all who can help guide me! Hello, I have an adult daughter with NF1. I knew she had CALM at birth but I had no idea what having the spots meant. \nI would suggest you find a neurologist who has training in working with NF patients. In my daughter's case her surgeons always confer with her neurologist and refer to her MRI studies. \n\nThe Children' Tumor Foundation can also help you with figuring out doctor choices. You could see about seeing a doctor who specializes in Neurofibromatosis. I was not fully diagnosed until I was 15, puberty basically was like the on switch for me. My pediatrician referred me to Chicago for a doctor who specializes in it and I guess you could say I was lucky, because he is the guy that basically work the instruction manual for dealing with Neurofibromatosis. \n\nThis should be helpful find a doctor \n Thanks! The local Dr.s on that list are my children's Drs. Their pediatrics. I am hoping I can at least get into the genetics center that is private practice. You are welcome. I hope all works out for you and your family You want a guide, start with the French Guidelines ( They are the most recent and they cover most of the issues that we may - and I want to insist on the \"may\" encounter in our life. \n\nAs you know we all come with different manifestations, and different levels of severity. It does not mean we will get them all. \n\nSince 2016, it is now clear we have an accrued risk of cancer with poor prognosis, therefor it is important to have checkups to catch it early . \n\nA lot of doctors still use Dr Korf's old book which was published in 2005 (second edition of a book first published in 1983) . A lot, an awful lot of research has been done since, but somehow, this is still the reference which will determine your care. \n\nThere is a enormous difference between the care for children and the one for adult. You will need to educate yourself and often educate the doctors. \n\nDr Kaleb Yohay has made a video to help navigate the system and I recommend you watch it even if it is long (  It is called Lifehack Your NF presented by Dr. Kaleb Yohay and is from the NF Network YouTube channel . \n\nHe is based in New York if you are from that area (", "telling significant other how long did you wait before telling your significant other about having NF? i have been talking/casually seeing the same guy for about 5 months, i only see him a few times a month before we live in different cities. i am though, moving back to his city soon. i am scared to tell him for fear of rejection. i am sure he knows there is something different about me from CAL spots and a cluster of fibromas i have on my hip. he is asked me about that once and i just played it off as it was a raised birth mark. i am so embarrassed to have  NF. only very few of my friends know i have it.  i ended up telling him via text a few days ago and he does not care :) i feel really relieved and happy things did not change between us.  Great news! She knew right away. I have the disease and my case is okay.

I just recently discovered this subreddit. Im 27, male, and do not know if I have NF1/2. I just had my 4th surgery last month to de-bulk the only tumor I have ever had which has alway been in my lower lip. The surgery actually did not go so well and I had swelling complications that ended up cutting the blood supply to my lip and had to have another surgery to relieve the pressure which ended up with some tissue necrosis and lost ~30% of the white part of the lower lip and incurred some other damaged tissue. They reassured me that as soon as the lost tissue is healed they will be able to do a revision hopefully making things look somewhat normal again. It was never an issue really but my mother noticed it had grown which prompted the surgery along with having good insurance and just graduating college.  I had a surgery in 93, 04, and 06. The last 3 surgeries were done at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN. The first two by a Dr. Clay who is now in Mississippi I believe. He was a very nice guy and very talented. I would recommend him to anyone who was in his network. I always knew I had a neurofibroma but never had heard of NF1/2 until just yesterday. Im not sure if I carry either mutation yet. I am hoping to have children one day and I am going to look into genetic testing soon. Has anyone done so? Did insurance cover it or was it out of pocket? How much does it usually cost? I also want to get an MRI to make sure that I do not have any other tumors anywhere.  I just wanted to introduce myself and say Hi. If you have any questions what-so-ever feel free to post or PM. Im currently getting daily Hyperbaric Oxygen therapy to help accelerate healing and promote new tissue growth so I am around all the time.", "Essay on Selumetinib (Koselugo) Hi everyone, I am a medical student and I am writing a report on the drug selumetinib to treat plexiform neurofibromas in children with NF1. I have some questions regarding this drug.\n\nSince this drug is already approved in the US, I was wondering if there are some medical professionals here that could give me their opinion on selumetinib use in NF1 patients? (Opinions from patients are welcome too, but please indicate whether you are a patient or a professional)\n\nDoes the implementation of this drug lead to improvements in the clinic (and healthcare wise)? Are there concerns about long term health effects? What are some ethical issues concerning selumetinib use in children? And for how long do patients generally get this drug? \n\nThis is probably different in the US than in Europe, but how expensive is the drug and is this covered by health care insurance? \n\nWhat are the next steps in the improvement of plexiform neurofibroma therapy? I have read about combined therapies and also the use of selumetinib in adults for example.\n\nThanks for your time! I would really appreciate your responses. I  am currently taking it and have been for almost a year now. Feel free to PM me! I have been taking it for the past few months, feel free to message me Not a user, but am interested in the results. So does it work? What are your experiences? On May 20th I will be seeing my Neurofibromatosis specialist to discuss the drug. Since I am an adult and the drug was only fda approved for children, I needed to get special approval to take it. So I ended up needed to have a number of test done, mostly just blood work, mri, ekg, echo and eye exam. Then they had see about putting it through insurance to make sure i would get approval there. I was told I was approved and now just need to discuss the medication before I am put on it. We started this process over a year ago, but I only just had all the test done back in January. COVID slowed things done, I was originally going to be part of the trial and we were going through the process of that until the fda approved it. Hey, did you ever start your youtube channel about your experience? I remember you wrote that you were thinking of starting one. I have. I have not posted in a few weeks since I am in school but will pick back up in a few days. Hi, I live in the Netherlands, the drug is not used here yet, but my essay is mainly about the formation of these neurofibromas, the phase I and II trials that have been performed and what still needs to be done in the future. And then I have to touch upon some ethical, economical and health care aspects. So I am not really getting any results myself, but from what I have read the benefits are greater than the side effects. It might take a while (~6 months) to get meaningful benefit in terms of pain, disfigurement and motion, but I think it is definitely worth the wait. My understanding from what I gathered at the CTF medical symposium last year in Sydney is that Koselugo is a drug for life, because when it is stopped , the tumours grow back. They did not know what happened when you are to the end of puberty because all the older kids, aged around 16 stopped because of the terrible acne it was causing, so a lot is still unknown. \n\nKoselugo works well at stopping tumour growth, and in the majority of cases at reducing the size of the tumour on average by 26% which does not seem much but you need to consider that the child will grow around the tumour and this will make the tumour smaller in proportion. Koselugo does also \"soften\" the tumours even without a change in volume. \n\nThere are many questions about long term use. The first is the typical resistance to MEK inhibitors. The second is the question mark about long term toxicity especially on the heart. It was never meant to be a long term drug or worse a for-life-drug\n\nIt has a very high price. around 12.500/ month or 150.000 per year. It has now been approved in Europe as well. I believe it is more expensive than it was when used as a (very bad) chemo drug. I hope to be wrong. Cashing on a child's pain and suffering is a low as you can get. \n\nInterestingly, a dietary intervention trial obtained the same results, a 25% reduction and no side effects and beneficial on the long term. ( \n\nIn Italy now in the Nf1 centres of expertise, diet is part of the package of care given to NF1 patients. \n\nI would love to see a clinical trial Koselugo vs Diet, but I doubt Astra Zeneca would pay for it...\n\nFor those of you who are taking Koselugo as an adult, have you ever considered the diet before opting for the pill? Thank you for your comment! The diet article is really interesting indeed. Do these high costs for the drug get covered by insurance? It seems like a lot of money for patients and their families. I assume not everyone can afford this. I am in Australia, where Koselugo is not approved yet, so I cannot answer who pays. \n\nMy understanding is that Koselugo  is covered for plexiform in children in the USA under certain criteria. Many insurance will not cover the removal of neurofibromas as considered \"cosmetic\" so I am not sure, what their stance will be for a \"cosmetic\" use of koselugo for the cutaneous neurofibromas.  \n\nKoselugo, despite the question marks, has been a life-saver for several children, especially those who had a plexiform in the neck. There is no doubt that a MEK inhibitor helps. The CTF Website has a lot of material and stories about it and you can find it here (   and on this celebration video ( there are a lot of emotions. \n\nIt is great that the most common genetic disease has finally at least 1 drug approved. Several mothers go to sleep with a smile and not tears thanks to it. \n\nThere is however more to the story, even if as a medical student, it might not be relevant for your essay that might explain why selumetinib was picked against other MEK inhibitors. \n\nIn one of the recent CTF video called HACK  for NF, where researchers present a pitch to win funds for their data analytics and research methodologies projects -  in other words  the \"tech\" part of research and not the  medical one -  one of the projects was to match drug molecules to genes, and the comment the presenter made matches exactly my thoughts about Koselugo, that it is not even a good MEK inhibitor (there are more than 20 different ones) suggesting others might be more effective . ( (10.52)  . \n\nIt is not a novelty, it has been known for a while that it was a very bad cancer drug, making cancer worse not better. They desperately tried it in many cancers, lungs, eye, thyroid, ... before throwing in the towel. \n\nI cannot shake off the financial and reputational  motives that might explain why selumetinib was so pushed to find a second life. Even without the prospect of gain (selumetiniob was forecasted to make 45 billions in 2023) , it saves the face and a relationship with their partners (  as well as calming the boardroom down. \n\nWhat I am trying to say is that there is a lot more than the \"poster child\" in the  Koselugo's story.\n\nStill, despite all the skeletons in the closet, there is cause to rejoice, but I really hope Koselugo is a starting point in showing that drugs can help, and not the end or main focus of research. I know this is a week old but I just wanted to say, the last tumor I had removed was pressing against my spine but my insurance still ruled it as cosmetic. This is so unfair.", "Hello I am new here.

You mean, if at all ... touchwood ... get cancer, then radiation affects NF? I do not know. Not sure. Just curious about it and worry about it. Probably something I misunderstood from talking to a doctor early on. Never had any radiation, aside from what you may get from MRIs and xrays. I am not sure exactly when the tumors became cancerous I just know that I started having a lot of pain and it was discovered with MRIs that the tumors were cancerous.

Just started seeing specialist within the past 2 years. In December last year, they found an optical nerve glimoa, the dr said everythings fine and nothing to worry about since ive probably had it since childhood. I recently had my yearly mris done in mid july. The dr who \"discovered \" the optical glimoa now wants me to see another specialist, a neurological optometrist. Has anyone else experienced this? Or has seen a neurological optometrist and can give some advice on what to expect. Thanks Hi ya. I have had a optic nerve glioma since birth and am 30. Mine was always just monitored and nothing else done about it.  I have seen an neurological optometrist since birth. My appointments arnt too differnt from my regular optometrist just more testing which makes the apt longer. He looks in my eyes a lot longer. I have to get dilated and then do all the tests again. Reading the wall, him looking close up. Nothing crazy. I always need to have a mri or ct before I see him and we go over my migraine and vertigo symptoms but its honestly a pretty easy apt. Besides the dialting I still hate having that done. Thank you, ive just been worried cause this part is still new to me. It just made me nervous since in December he said everything was fine and now he wants me to see a different specialist. Oh no worries at all. Its all can be so stressful. Im sure its just to monitor it and keep you established with a nero dr. My doctor said if your out of your teens its very unlikely anything will changed but to be safe to still get checked out every few years or so. So if anything I would feel better now knowing a dr will be keeping tabs on it. I appreciate it, like i said just started seeing specialist within the past two years. That only happened by chance cause they found a tumor growing through my sciatic nerve, had to have surgery two summers ago. So now its been a lot of playing catch up, i guess. Already have a set neurosurgeon and doing the MRIs. Again I very much appreciate the advice/info. \ud83d\ude04 calmed me down a bit Well, I have known of having them all my life and aside from going on chemo at age 8 and a recent (2019) optic-canal-decompression-surgery, I have not experienced anything too serious. They say I will most likely need surgery on the other side too, but for now it looks stable. \n\nMy vision is kind of bad, but it has not gotten noticebly worse over the years and neither has my field of vision. \n\nVisiting the neuro-ophthalmologist is not that scary at all. They will just check your eyesight, your field of vision and then look into your eyes through a machine that is not painful at all; you just stare into a light and the doctor takes photos from the other side. Yeah, you better get used to the MRIs lol. At my last checkup, my neuro-surgeon said they will not look at the MRIs too much when determining if I will need a second surgery, they will be more on the lookout for severe changes in my vision. \n\nMy MRIs have thankfully been stable for more than a decade and I hope I will not have to deal with any changes there. The mris definitely dont bother me lol. I fall asleep during my brain and spine one. Takes like 2.5 hours so i just end up napping. My neurosurgeon said everything else was stable and shell see me in a year. The eye oncologist wants me to see the neurological optometrist now, that is what staryed to worry me Good to hear things are stabls. :)\n\nAs i said, neuro-opto checkups are nothing to worry about either. My daughter seems a neuro oncologist. They found hers when she was 18 months, and while the damage it caused is not reversible it has not progressed at all, shes almost six now. We see the eye doc twice a year, he said once shes a certain age that will go to once a year. Then we see her neuro oncologist with a MRI scan once a year. Hi there ! 29 years old, on my latest MRI they discovered a new optic nerve Glioma developing\u2026 I am a little nervous as I am not sure what to expect.. My doctor referred me to a neurologist, but the wait list to see a neurologist in Ontario is at least 3+ months\u2026 I hope things speed up now since they retrieved all my old MRI\u2019s from where I used to live and noticed it was not there before\u2026", "a few questions about nf2 my brother (10) has nf2 and i just have a few questions about what will happen. \n(for context, he was found to have a brain tumour when he was 3 because his right pupil did not dilate properly. he is had an mri scan every year and over lockdown, after some blood tests, he was finally diagnosed with nf2 and they said that they thought that they had found 2 new tumours near his ear but that his hearing was still the same. right now he is just a normal 10 year old boy who enjoys stuff every other 10 year old boy enjoys but i know that will change).\nall i have been told is that his mobility could get significantly worse and that his hearing, eye sight and ability to speak will also get worse. \ni guess what i am really asking is has anyone gone through anything similar. i hate talking to my parents about it as i feel like they should be more concerned with him rather than me. i just want a community of people who i can talk to rather than people who do not understand tell me that they do.\nthank you in advance i also know that other people with nf1/2 have it much worse so i do not want to seem like im trying to take away from any of their experiences. i am extremely lucky for my brother to be as happy and well as he is currently and i am well aware of that I have nf type 1, I was not diagnosed until I was 15, puberty was like an on switch for me, though doctors always suspected I had it when I was born. My condition has gotten worse over the years, but Neurofibromatosis does effect everyone differently. There sadly is no way to know just how it will effect someone and at what length.\n\nIf you have any questions let me know. I have NF2. I was diagnosed around 9 or 10. I would push your parents on this, and maybe talk to a family therapist together. They will need to make all of his medical decisions for at least the next 8 years.\n\nI lost hearing in 1 ear when I was 10, and vision in 1 eye when I was 12. It really did not affect my life too much (I just had to give up my dream of playing shortstop for the Mets). But I went to regular public school, regular college, etc.\n\nI started losing hearing in my other ear in my mid-20s, which became a much more significant issue. But that is a whole other can of worms.\n\nRight now, the important thing is to get your family talking, and get everyone on the same page. There will be some big decisions to make, and it is immensely important that everyone is using the same information. If neither of the parents have it, then you will likely not have a diagnosis that goes into great detail, which was exactly my case when i was diagnosed (at 14 yo). I am talking about detail because i was told there might be different 'levels of severity' of the disease. If he is made it to 10 yo without big hearing problems, i guess his disease is not of the worst kind. Also they told you 'mobility will get worse' but without telling you when, might very well be in his 60s or 70s for all you know. For reference i am 25, had a surgery on the hearing nerve (the most common one, i was told) at 15, another one at the brain at 21 and I am relatively ok. Lost about 40% of my hearing from what the tests say, but to me feels more like 10%, as it turns out hearing and understanding is something we do more with our brains than our hears. Also i have the pupil dilatation thing too, they told me that that tumor behind the eye is an extremely common thing to have too, together with the ones on the acoustic nerves. The eyelid may become a little bit 'lazy' too, in older age. But they also said that those are not really anything that one cannot cope with, they should be monitored constantly, especially in a development age since tumors tend to grow more the more the body grows. What I am saying is that for now you cannot really do anything other than treating him just like you would if he was healthy, if anything being treated differently is just annoying IMHO. What you should do is make sure to make him take RMIs, and eventually try and guesstimate what the extent of the problem will be. Also keep an eye open for tumors of the skin, and make sure he is appropriately protected when staying under the sun for prolonged periods of time (i use 50+ sunscreen on all the body). He could live just like a 'normal' person that has very bad eyesight and hearing (hardly a bad life), or it could get worse; there is no way of knowing until the disease progresses. Hope this helps thank you that really helped thank you! Yeah, also another thing i forgot to mention is that not all doctors are able to follow someone with NF 2, if you can try to find a specialist that already had some experiences and knowledge with NF2 patients. In my experience 'regular' brain surgeons always have a 'let us operate ASAP to save the patient' approach, while with NF2 the standard approach is more like wait-and-see with RMIs every 9-12 months and only operate when there is the real need to, otherwise the patient would live constantly in and out of hospitals", "In case you did not know. :D I almost forgot myself. Did not even know we had a month till a couple years ago. ", "NF2 T5 Spinal Tumor Removal I just got the news today that I have to have surgery to remove a tumor on my T5.

Selumetinib is looking promising for cNFs (as well as plexiforms, optic glioma, cognition, and social deficits. It is quite incredible). \n\nThe 2019 NF Conference abstract book is now available at CTF:\n\n\n\nThe very last abstract, on page 141, has a small update on study NCT02839720; I will quote the most encouraging section:\n\n\" Preliminary data is now available from the first four study participants. The average cNF volume decrease was 25% after 4 cycles and 35% after 8 cycles.\nFurthermore, the decrease in cNF volume was visibly apparent. No significant change in cNF number has been observed to date\" Would be very good... But guess Will not be something for the next ten years... But going to read it when more time. Thx They are having a lot of success with the drug trials. My doctor was trying to get me into one, but we are having some issues with Medicare. I should have had everything done months ago as I was approved back in April, a medical decision was approved by the judge, but everything has been at a stand still and no one has heard anything. \n\nAnyways with the drug trials they are seeing 20-40% in tumor shrinkage. This is a good sign. WoW very good indeed! If i need to take every hour or like 20 pills a day to get a cure i would do it... To bad you could do the trial. But maybe someday we all can do this! \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udf40 We can only hope. Actually rumour has it that it will be approved for the plexiform indication within the next 12 months I am sorry you are feeling like this. I promise you that the people around you are not judging you nearly as hard as you are judging yourself, even if it feels like they are sometimes!! You are beautiful the way you are! I know I am lucky that my tumors are really only on my head but still I know how you feel. Because of NF, I have bowed legs and my skin is always red.

I feel this hard, I have one subcutaneous neurofibroma that is a bit noticeable on my forehead and under top down lighting you can really see it and it is the worst :/ It is true! There is a clinical trial that is currently recruiting, I think through the National Cancer Institute. You can find it through clinicaltrials.gov My heart breaks for you friend. I know how you are feeling as I go through it every day. I wish their was something I could tell you to make you feel better. All I can say is.\nNothing is forever, you have had many lives and will continue to do so and this is just a very challenging life in which you have to be strong. Sorry to hear you have it hard and feel bad Evert single day. Big big for you (if it is allowed do not want a hashtag metoo haha). Yeah but if whzt you believe is true,you do not know it in another life,so it still stay hard now... So yeah,but we need to deal with it as we cannot change anything.itns not like some People are allergic and get skin rash from some food or.... If it was like that i immediately would stop eating it,... Even if it was my favorite food... Well yeah have a good day / night / evening (depends with Timezone you live in)", "NF and leukemia? A few months ago I had routine blood work.  Later that day my primary care called me himself and told me my hemoglobin was a 6.5 and I had to get to the emergency room for a blood transfusion. I was experiencing the chills, I was tired all the time,  would lose my breath easily, and would able to feel my heart beating at times.  I thought all over this was just due to me being out of shape.  \n\nLast year I did see a cardiologist and everything came back good news.  \n\nAfter more recent blood tests and two iron infusions my hemoglobin improved a little. I still have all the symptoms I felt before and one of the numbers in my blood work that is scaring me is my RDW. Mine is more than twice what it is supposed to be.  Looking at past results it has gotten worse in a year and a half.  Of course like most of us, you look online and worry and search. Of course before I get too worried I am going to have to wait until I see my doctor on Wednesday.  I did read though, that those with NF do have a higher chance of having leukemia. \n\nI will be honest with you worst case scenario I do not think I am going to fight it.  I do not have any kids and I live with my parents helping to take care of them with my sister. Maybe it is the depression talking but I honestly feel like I do not have anything left to offer this world.  All I have ever done is let down my family and disappoint them and upset them and make everybody worry because I am always sick or I was on drugs for the pain  I am so sorry you feel that way.\nPlease note I do not have neurofibromatosis but I had a similar experience like yours, do I would like to ease you up by telling about my experience.\n\n\nAbout 2 years ago I got severely sick. I was making rounds to the hospital and reports were not also that clear. Of course I googled my symptoms and everything pointed to cancer. You know, it fucked me up so badly until my reports came back. I had some other problem which I did not expect at all. It was treatable and curable just by medicines. I had to get 3 drippings of iron in my blood as well.\n\n\nBefore the iron drippings, I used to get really tired easily and could feel my heart beat simply while just laying or maybe going up a simple flight of stairs. I had even developed a serious craving for refrigerator ice.\n\nAfter the drippings, my energy came back and I started feeling way better and normal.\n\nYou should absolutely not google your symptoms. Just trust your doctor and wait for the test results. Googling will give you unnecessary tension.\n\nAlso, I am praying for you, hope every goes well for you. Stay strong. Do not let those negative thoughts ruin your spirit please. Take care. Cancer/leukemia is not the death sentence it used to be. You are not alone in your struggles with NF. Have you considered reaching out to the folks at ( They may be able to connect you with someone who has NF related leukemia so you can learn their experience. \n\nYour family is worried about you because they love you. You were dealt a difficult hand with NF but the fact that you are asking the right questions means there is hope. Trust your doctor, find a doctor through CTF if they do not know everything about NF, and keep fighting for a better future. You can get through it! Sounds more like your low on iron. I have never heard anything about being at higher risk of having leukemia, I have had cancerous tumors both in 2014 and 2018. But I had surgery to remove them and now I am good. Never needed chemo or radiation. I am on Koselugo now, you should see if your doctor can get approval for you to be on it. My doctor was able to get approval for me and I have been on it since June. \n\nI would recommend you stop looking up your symptoms and blood results online and not over think things. That will not do you any good and likely will must cause you stress, which in itself can make you sick. You are absolutely right about looking up your symptoms, everything's going to say that it is cancer\n\nBack in 2019 I had 6 months worth of Avastin treatments.  With hope to shrink the tumors in my spine. The word cancer was never used.  It is given at the infusion center or the cancer center of the hospital but I know it is not chemo", "Sad that I have introduced Neurofibromatosis 2 into my bloodline. Mosaic Neurofibromatosis 2 to be exact. None of my family, even the extended portion, has this condition. I just was quite unlucky and developed the condition as a mutation as I was still forming in the womb.\n\nI wanted to have kids eventually, but with this condition I dont want to risk passing it on to my hypothetical kid(s). Especially because it would be a full version of NF2, as opposed to my mosaic NF2.\n\nIm not against adoption, in fact maybe its \"fated\", but I always wanted to continue on my family name + the bloodline, as I am the only son of the family who can do so (also this is a desire I brought onto myself, my family has insisted I dont worry about it so much, but Im still sad).\n\nDunno if there was much of a point to this post, but Im in a sort of melancholic mood right now. You may well have the option of having kids who will not be affected by NF2.\nThere is a procedure called preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). In order to do this, couples undergo in vitro fertilization (IVF) in which eggs from the mother and sperm from the father are harvested separately and then combined in a lab to produce a number of embryos. Each embryo is tested to determine whether or not it carries the NF2 mutation that you carry. Only embryos that do not carry the mutation are implanted. You should talk to a genetic counselor if you are interested in learning if this approach is appropriate in your case. That certainly seems like something worth looking into, thank you for sharing! Do not give up hope just yet. Crazy amazing things are happening in the medical field as we speak.  I already had three children before I got diagnosed with nf2. I was devastated because it was basically a guarantee at least 1-2 of them would have nf. But I got a second opinion and ending up finding out I actually have nf3 not nf2 and my doctor said my children were not any more likely to have nf than anyone else. What I have read says otherwise but I am no neurologist. Either way nothing I can do now. That being said, if I knew then what I know now I would not have children.  The pain that I have been through has been worse than I could have imagined. I just turned 30 had a major operation and my surgeon says I will need more down the road. No way I would want to see my kids go through that knowing that I knew it was 50/50 they would get it. No. Way.  I am right there with you on the bloodline thing. I am the last Male on my dads side of the family, the family ends here :( Im dating someone with NF1. Weve already talked about that if we have kids were opting for IVF. Its expensive but its worth it, and in the future it will only get cheaper.  Yeah they were \u201csure\u201d it was nf2 until I found out I did not have any brain tumors. Then they got the tumors out they had them tested and told me they were absolutely certain this time. ", "First post here! Looking for some support. Heyo! My name is Britt and I am a 26 y/o female with NF1. I have had the condition since birth and inherited it from my mother. \n\nI have always had it relatively mild but the last two years they have gotten a lot worse especially on my face.\n\nMy back is pretty covered and they hurt and bleed constantly. Also developing pretty bad agoraphobia and an overall dread for the future in general. \n\nI do not have anyone to talk with about the condition (my mom is not the sympathetic type.) Was wondering if there was a place with people from similar walks of life that I can talk with. Those Facebook groups are just too much for me tbh. :) Hey. 31 yo male in California. My case is pretty mild. I did not know neurofibromas could bleed! I am sorry that is happening. I have had a few removed but mostly for cosmetic reasons. One on my scalp (inferior to the occipital protuberance) was near a sweat gland and so would result in pimples there that were painful but never any direct bleeding from the fibromas. This group is very small but a great group for people. I have NF1 with a large plexiform on my face. \n\nI agree the Facebook groups can be a bit much.\n\nI am male from the UK.  \n\nIf you every need to rant or just someone to talk too you are free to message me. Hay girl!  Im 29 with NF, my symptoms have been mostly mild, my daughter has an optic glioma.... you can message me whenever! Howdy, I am Sarah from the big apple. I am 20yrs, currently studying at Savannah college of Art and Design, I am majoring photography with a minor in advertising and branding!\nI have was diagnosed at 10 with NF. I mostly suffer from knee pains and back pains. I am sorry about you fibromas, I have a couple just on my head through, some are painful and some are not. Always feel free to reach out! I am 30s/F with mild NF1, you can always send me a message. :) Hey! I am 28F with NF, currently living in SF. I only recently joined one of the facebook groups, but I prefer the vibe here even if it is a lot quieter. My case is also pretty mild, but I have also noticed an uptick in neurofibromas as I have gone through my 20s (which was a surprise because I was always told puberty/pregnancy/menopause) would be the times for it. I am also starting to feel like more of my \"unrelated\" complaints than I have thought previously might be related, but even if you include them I am probably still in the \"mild\" category. \n\nLife is kind of busy right now, but I am always open to chatting. Heyo! Oh, man. I had a cluster of a few tumors removed from my scalp as a kid as they would bleed and cake my hair in blood constantly. The ones on my back have been bleeding on and off since as far back as I can remember. Tbh, I think it has to do with dry skin and irritation from clothing. Got To try and find a lotion I am not sensitive to lol.   Hope all is well with you :) I like the vibe here more, too. It is quieter and less depressing lol. I have definitely noticed more of an increase in tumor growth now in my 20\u2019s than ever before. \nBy this point, I think I went from having a mild case to a moderate one. \nGod, I cannot imaging during menopause with all the hormonal changes. \n\nAnd yea same here with the other symptoms part. Been having increasingly frequent body pain on the left side of my body (mainly located in the hip and leg) that I told myself for years was just arthritis. Now I am not so sure. Hey! Love your major/minor! Sounds like the classes would be very interesting. Oh, man. Same here with the knee pain. I feel like my knee belongs to an 80 y/o lol. :) Thanks, I appreciate it! Also mmmmmm...Gruyere Heyo! I was diagnosed with an optic glioma as a kid and luckily it does not seem to be growing any larger. Best wishes for you and your daughter with her optic glioma! I imagine that that is quite scary for the both of you. Feel free to message me! Been trying to find work so I may not be on as frequently as I would like for the near future :) Hello! I actually prefer the smaller groups, tbh. It feels more \u2018personal\u2019 that way. Also helps you keep track of who is who without however many thousands of people lol. \n\nSorry to hear about your plexiform fibroma. I know they can be painful. I hope yours does not hurt you too much. And the pain is only part of the battle when it comes to facial tumors. \n\nI am here if you want to talk! Hope all is well with you! :) Was there ever a time where you did need treatment for it ? its for sure nerve wracking but I try not to worry til I need to ya know? I agree about the smaller group and find talking to others with NF better than friends as they just do not seem to get \"it\" but other with NF I can say certain things and know I do not need to explain things to them.\n\nI feel very lucky as I do not get any real pain from my plexi's and hope this continues,\n\n:)", "Plexis If you eating or about to maybe give this post a kiss to later.\n\nI have a few plexiforms. I have one on my back which is larger than the rest under it it is sore to touch and always (wet) I guess sweat. \n\nAm I alone with this or normal. I keep forgetting to mention it to anyone medical even today when I was having bloods taken. You really need to point those out to your doctor especially if your experiencing any pain. I did this today I have an mri next week do they are going to look at the scans. It is with contrast which I have never had before. Contrast is just a different imaging technique, I have had it with and without. Hope all goes well. Yeah like a CT when they inject the fluid I believe. Not concerned at all I find it quite calming in fact", "Gallbladder I am 22 with NF1, and I recently went to a regular doctor to have something completely unrelated looked at and when she was doing the typical tummy feel up I told I had a tender spot on what I thought was a rib. Well she said that it is not a rib but my gallbladder, and I should get a ultrasound on it. I have always had some pain there for a long time it comes and goes, only really painful if it gets pressed. I am super nervous and wondering if anyone has had anything NF related to their gallbladder.  I am currently having GI issues with abdominal pain, and got an ultrasound, and they found a 4mm polyp in my gallbladder. I am not sure if it is NF related though, but it would not surprise me if it was. Greaaaat just what I need", "NF1 question I was wondering if anyone has any symptom to what I am experiencing. \n\nIt seems for the past couple of years my brain doesnt respond to my eyes sometimes (if that even makes sense). Ive noticed that when I look for something, it is right in front of me but I see it as something else. This could just be me over thinking everything, or it has nothing to do with NF1 and it is something else. I have had my eyes check and the doctor said it was perfect. I havent told them about this though, because I just thought it was nothing. I was diagnosed officially about 4 years ago when I was 13. \n\n I would love to hear a response, thank you.  I am not sure if it is the same but I can look past something right in front of me.  What exactly do you mean by see it as something else? Can you give me an example? I am not the best with explaining, I am sorry. My mom pointed out that when I practice driving I will sometimes seem to miss red lights (luckily I catch it in time) or when I am looking for stuff in the house, I will do a deep search and still cant find it but my friends or parents will find it within seconds. This could be nothing, I am just taking precautions to see if it is something.  I do not think it is connected to your NF.  It sounds to me like your brain is processing the visual input too fast.  It is happened to me, then I was diagnosed with ADHD and put on meds.  It seems to have helped.   Thank you so much. I will look into that more.  Fyi adhd is correlated with nf. ", "NF1 plus COVID vaccine Is it ok to get the vaccine if you have NF1? I just searched vaccine in this sub reddit there are already 6 other posts asking this very question. I do not see why not. I just got mine and I feel fine. I got two shots in januari and februari, im fine I got mine a little over a week ago...so far so good. Only got a really bad migraine...I asked a doctor about it and he basically said if you get the flu shot you will be fine with this I got both shots and had nothing happen I got Pfizer, my second dose was on May 10, I have been feeling fine I got mine and did not even have side effects other than a sore arm. Yes (\n\n&gt; Vaccine news has been promising, and there are no specific data that any of the Covid-19 vaccines affect people with NF differently than other people. Yes - more than okay. I just saw my doctor on Thursday and he told me yes. I would talk with you doctor about it, ask them any questions you have, as Neurofibromatosis does affect everyone differently. At the end of the day do what you feel is right for you and what your most comfortable doing. Do not feel pressured into anything you do not want to do. I do not think it is anything to worry about. \nI was laid out the next day but it is better than being on a ventilator. I live in NYC, and a patient of NYU facilities I got called very early (right after frontliner and some elderly) to do the Vaccine, as NF people falls in the category that requires it Oh really ok thank you Yeah sure, just to give a perspective I got my Pfizer second dose in late March. Did not feel anything It is completely fine. I got both shots and had no side effects. NF alone will not affect your response to the vaccine. Yes, I got the modera I got the Pfizer and I feel fine. The only side effects I had from the vaccine was fatigue but it lasted less than 24 hours.", "Tumor removed from C-6 this past Tuesday. Bone fusion from C-6 through T-1.

So I am getting a Brain MRI on Tuesday the 21st...it is been several years since my last one....would love any words of encouragement. Also, last time I had a MRI I was not allowed to listen to music.....does anyone know if that is changed?  Thank you! I have never has an MRI of my brain, but I have of my neck and cervical spine, and as the rest of my body and I have been allowed to listen to music, not that you can really hear it over all the noise of the MRI. I have been having MRIs since 1999 and I have pretty much always been allowed to, so unless there is some reason with a brain scan your not allowed to, I do not see why you would not.\n\nAnyways I wish you he best, remember to stay calm and try not to move. Sometimes it helps to close your eyes and try to fall asleep. Curious, I had one recently and I could listen to music. Could hear it quite well actually, was not loud either. I could not listen to music, I have been having them yearly for the past 7 years.  Prayers!! I had one about a 8 months ago, with and without contrast. I did not think to ask if I could listen to music, but in the past I have not been allowed to. The worst part of the MRI is being left to your own thoughts, so try to think of something fun. I know that sounds a little silly. But it is all I have got. Are you going getting contrast with yours? That really helps break up the MRI, so it does not feel like it is as long as it is.  You are going to do great regardless!! I do not think it sounds silly. When I used to get them I would make up a silly alphabet song just to help pass the time. I am getting one with and without contrast so that is a good thing. I appreciate the prayers. Thanks! It really depends on where you go.  Some places have tvs built in, and some places have nothing for you to do.\n\nCall ahead and ask about what they offer.\n\nLast time I had one I imagined building shelving and what order I would put my books in.\n You got this!! Are you opposed to getting medication? I always ask for atavan (I get generic) when I have to do neck or brain MRIs. Be sure you have someone to drive you if you are not used to it. \n\nI have always been able to have music. It helps pass the time. I play games with myself. Like, I know a song is about 3 minutes. This is the fourth song. It is been almost 15 minutes ...\n\nBrain MRIs suck. Good luck! I would rather not get medicated...I need to be able to pick my daughter up from school that afternoon. I think I can do it without. My son is going for a brain mri this Thursday. We have been there! Hoping all goes well. I hope all goes well! hey! i am having my annual MRI soon. the one time I did get to watch/listen to something the machine was so loud I unfortunately could not hear it. I have found that listening to the sounds of the machine and trying to puzzle out what they remind me of and build a story from that. Have you ever explored meditation and/or mindfulness? I have been getting (lengthy) MRIs for ~25 years. I am now deaf without my ABIs, so music is not an option. But I find I can \"zen out\" and relax/nap during an MRI now. I just got one done about a month ago and was aloud to listen to music. They gave me headphones and were also able to talk to me through them Fingers crossed they let me listen to something and that I can hear it! \ud83d\ude42 Do you know what brand machine you were in? I do not, sorry. The headphones are a new thing though. Up to last year, you just had to make due with those shitty yellow foamy earplugs, and some towels they put in to fixate the head (brain MRI, if you had regular MRI you were screwed). Hell, even the music it self is new because while they had the headphones, they were not hooked up until months later lol. \n\nThe headphones do make a lot of difference, even without music. I wonder why they did not use them earlier. My best advice to you is to be positive. I have had some in the past and was not bothered by them at all. No music. I just pretended that the MRI sounds was music playing. I had an MRI in 2008, where a tumor was discovered. Was not stressed by it at all. When the PA mentioned I had a tumor, I just smiled. I have had 27 brain surgeries during my lifetime so it is become a walk in the park for me. Everyone is different so there is a chance you will have more during your lifetime.", "PFOA (Teflon) and NF? I was watching a youtube video on PFOA and realized that the scandal where DuPont poisoned water supplies and realized it that my dad grew up down stream from where this poisoned water came from. Also the neighborhood I grew up in is near by a former site of a rubber factory (they cannot or will not build on this land as previously planned) I am beginning to wondering if PFOA can be linked to the gene mutation that causes NF.

M/27 I have NF1 and have many light colored cafe au lait spots, particularly around my groin area. This has CRUSHED my confidence with women (still a virgin). Is there any type of cream or product to fade these spots? Thanks for feedback. Sorry about this non answer :c but I would not worry! I am 25/F and very \"typical\" and I know for a fact that cafe au lait marks would not phase me in the slightest if I even noticed, and once I did I would think it is sweet just like most other women would! I dated a guy for a while who had a large like... Divet in the middle of his chest, a kind of \"strange\" sunken area but after I said it was cute he told me every girl he would ever been with had said that to him, while he would gone his whole life being super scared for a woman to see it. I would honestly do nothing to lighten the spots because who knows what will happen! I would 100% not worry about it if you can. For whatever it is worth, my personal opinion is do not do anything about them, but I also fully understand where you are coming from. Even without going into any detail about the disorder itself you can explain them as \"birthmarks\". Another user already essentially commented this, but most people find the presence of birthmarks \"cute\" especially if it is in a private enough location that only they know about it. A caring person is not going to care you have them. They will be more concerned with your general health and how you fare with the disorder. If it is someone you are close to (or hope to be) you would presumably disclose having NF anyway, so hiding the CALs is not going to avoid that. \n\nThat said to actually answer your question:\n\nThere are some alleged home remedies that can lighten such as lemon juice, however outside of individual anecdotes there is no real significant evidence that this type of stuff works or is worth your time. Even if you have some success you will not completly erase them with any home remedy. \n\nThere are prescription steroid creams than can lighten spots, you would need to discuss those with a dermatologist, and from my experience discussing this with people may or may not work, and usually only lightens them. In a particularly sensitive area like you describe \"a little less noticible\" probably does not serve your purpose. \n\nLastly there are multiple surgical and more invasive options, including lasers, electrodesiccation. Any of these would also need to be discussed with a doctor, and all pose some risk including the possibility the treatment may not work or leave scars, which probably would be \"worse\" for your concerns. I know I probably should not say this, and you pie probably heard it many times before, but if a woman is taking you clothes off she probably is not going to leave if she sees your care au pair spots.", "Spinal fusion, C5 through T1 ", "I am planning on designing shirts for the NF community and I wanted feedback. What would you want on a shirt or sweatshirt. Here is the back design. ", "Having children I am a 21F diagnosed with NF1 at 2 years old. I had some complications as a child but currently live a relatively normal life. I started taking hormonal birth control in April and have noticed a slight increase in neurofibromas on my body since. \n\nThat being said, I would like to have children one day in my future. I know there is a chance that I could pass NF1 onto my children, but I am currently more concerned about the physical effects that pregnancy will have on me.  I plan on seeing my neuro-oncologist soon to discuss the new fibromas and some other issues that I have been having. \n\nFor those of you that have had a pregnancy, how did your body respond? What symptoms did you have during and afterwards that an individual with NF would not have?\n\n I also have neurofibromatosis and based on my research and things I have learned from my doctor who I have been seeing for 20 years, there is a 50% chance of passing onto your children and for woman who become pregnant there is a risk of their neurofibromatosis becoming worse than it already is. It would be best to speak with your doctor about this, unfortunately neurofibromatosis is different with every person and it can effect everyone differently. In the last four years I have had tumors turn cancerous. So I would advise speaking with your primary doctor as well as the doctor who oversees your neurofibromatosis. \n\nKeep in mind there are other ways of having kids. You can always adopt. There are a ton of kids out there looking for a home. So even if your doctor feel it would be too risky for your to get pregnant, do not ever lose hope of being a mother.  That aligns with what I currently understand, thank you. I know adoption is an option but I struggle with the idea of having a kid that \u201cis not my own\u201d and worry about other complications that may arise. I know I would love the child irregardless though.  While they do say blood is thicker than water, blood does not always make us family. You are own, are whomever you decide to share your life with. \n\nI have one cousin who adopted a son, and we all love him dearly. I have another cousins whose husband was adopted and he is as awesome guy. \n\nI wish you the best and good health.  NF1,  mom of 2 (7 &amp;3)  \nAbout a year before I got pregnant I was diagnosed with neuropathy. When I got pregnant I had to stop taking my gabapentin pain. \nI think any unpleasant symptoms where due to life circumstances. \nFirst one I gained WAY too much weight and worked more than I probably should have. I was on my feet constantly. \nI do not drive so I did a lot of walking and I hurt so bad from being on my feet carrying so much more weight than I was used to. \nMy hips ached when I laid on my side but that was normal for pregnancy. \nThey said pregnancy hormones can increase spot growth (like skin tags, lumps etc) and I have a few more of those but nothing even noticeable. \nMy birth was a whole different nightmare but as far as I can tell unrelated to my NF1.  I breastfed for 4 years with her. \nNo 2 was under better life circumstances and I gained less but still too much weight. Super uneventful pregnancy. \n2 cesareans healed up well. No trouble breastfeeding. Stopped at about 6 months. \nOver the past couple years I have been having nasty hip pain and it was getting so bad that I was limping and I am pretty active. I am not sporty or whatever but I get shit done type of active.\nSo I finally force myself to look into it and turns out I have a benign tumor on my nerve root at L4. \nIdk if my body is reacting to age or my pregnancies but all the sudden this pops up.   Thank you for the reply. Are you able to do anything about the tumor on your nerve root or will you just have to live with it? I have an appointment on the 28th so I guess I will find out then.  Not sure how I could live with it though. I am not a sit around all day person but it hurts to walk.  Neurofibromatosis reacts strongly to hormonal changes including puberty, menopause, and pregnancy. It is a 50% chance to pass it on. Current medical advice is that you are strongly cautioned about those factors. The question is,  do you think having biological kids is worth the risk not just to you,  but to them. It is the kid's lives and wellbeing you are risking. Talk to some people with more severe symptoms and decide if that is what you want to give to your child.  I am 25F and I have NF2 so not exactly the same, but I did look into things with a fertility specialist on my end. There are actually several things that can be done with modern reproductive medicine these days. You can have eggs frozen and converted into embryos of course, but there is a gene editing component that would remove the NF gene from each embryo. Surrogacy could work in conjunction with this if you must avoid a natural pregnancy because of complications regarding NF and not being allowed to take certain medications for the 9-month period. Just thought I would give my 2 cents. Thank you for sharing! I have thought about freezing eggs/surrogacy but I am concerned about hormonal treatment to get the eggs and cost. What do you think you will do in your future? To make things a bit complicated, I am also a Type 1 Diabetic so first, I would need to get my blood sugars down to a safe level before pursuing egg-freezing according to the doctor. I really like the idea of having that kind of insurance policy. If things go well up to that point, I am open to gene editing and surrogacy although I might not need to do the latter since I am no longer on Avastin/Bevacizumab chemotherapy (and have not been for over a year). I do want to mitigate any risk involved though whether it be regarding the child (passing on unfavorable genes) or myself (pregnancy complications). I feel like you have gotten a lot of good answers here, and I have never been pregnant so I do not have much to add, but here is my bit in regards to birth control. I was told to avoid high-progestin birth control due to NF1, so that is something you might want to ask your neuro-oncologist and/or gynecologist about. I do not know the ins and outs of why and I do not want to speculate, anyway.  I am taking loestrin so it is a low-dose pill which definitely helps. My onc did not specify what to/not to take and just left it up to my GYN once I was approved.  For what it is worth, I am on LoLoEstrin (and was previously on LoEstrin) and my neuro said it was okay. As others have said, there is a higher chance of passing it on to your child and that your symptoms could get worse. If you live a normal life and your fibromas do not have any impacts on your life I would caution to stay away. Of course, that is personal opinion, as that is the plan I am going to follow. Having been through surgery and knowing what NF could be in more serious cases I would not want that for my future child. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow other options if you want to have your own child, but do not want to risk carrying it, would be using a surrogate mother. Think what Phoebe did for her brother on Friends. That way you get to have your own child with your husband but do not risk making your condition worse. There is still the risk of the child getting it, but at least your symptoms would stay the same.  I have not had a child yet (I have NF1), but my husband and I are planning to this year. We are going to do IVF with PGD (Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis). We want to guarantee the child does not have NF.\n\nI know that pregnancy hormones can make it worse and that honestly frightens me and worries me a lot, especially when I see articles featuring people that have thousands on their body. It makes me fearful for what \u201cmay\u201d come.  Exactly. I do not know what will happen and that is terrifying.  My husband and I are trying to conceive now. I have very mild symptoms. The worst was scoliosis that I had spinal fusion for as a kid. I went to a geneticist specializing in NF recently and she did not think I personally had much to worry about in terms of pregnancy hormones affecting me because I went through puberty without a very noticeable increase in symptoms. \n\nAs for passing it on, we are currently exploring IVF with PGD as an option but it is very very unlikely going to be financially feasible for us. So we plan to get pregnant naturally and test every pregnancy for the disorder. We will terminate if the gene has been passed on. There is just so much variance with how severe symptoms are. The geneticist said even in families, there is no way to predict how severe symptoms might be. My husband and I decided that we would not be able to cope with the guilt if we ended up having a very sick child. So that is what our plan is.  Did you inherit NF or did you have a mutation? \n\n Exactly why I am trying to think about it and figure things out before I see my neuro-onc in March. This is a big part of my future and I want to know what my options are. I did not have an issue with puberty but am seeing a progression with BC. If I cannot have kids I would obviously like to come off BC and go another route, but if I can I need to figure out how and when is best for me.  My parents have never been tested but they have no symptoms. While I am curious, it does not make any difference for me or my children\u2019s future. Having the gene is having the gene.  So NF1 can be tested during pregnancy? That is the answer that I was looking for. Is it pretty standard to check for with all of the other tests? I am starting to plan on having children (32F), but I \\*may\\* have mosaic/segmental NF1. I only have cafe au lait spots and freckling, but I have a weird pattern that suggests segmental NF manifestation as opposed to regular NF1. I writing to doctors now to see about testing. But I do not really care about me (since I do not have any other symptom so far- zero neurofibromas) but I do care about any future children. From what I read Segmental NF still has 50% of passing on full NF1 to children. Also, it is interesting about hormonal effects on the condition. I have been taking birth control for so many years. If I end up having segmental NF1, maybe I would see more symptoms during pregnancy. Yes it can absolutely be tested in pregnancy but I was told I needed my DNA test before hand so they can build what is called a probe which basically allows them to look for the exact same mutation. It is not standard for them to check for NF during pregnancy. You will need either a CVS (biopsy of the placenta) or an amniocentesis (removal of some amniotic fluid) for them to test the fetal cells with. We went for several pre-conception counseling appointments with an OBGYN, geneticist specializing in NF, and a perinatologist prior to starting to try.  Thanks so much for this info!! It sounds complicated and expensive! But I am glad to know it is an option.  There is no such thing as gene editing. What they can do is called PGD (pre-implantation diagnosis) - test the fertilized eggs for NF (or any other gene) before implanting them into your womb. When they invent gene editing it will be a MAJOR scientific breakthrough. I went to a fertility clinic for a consultation and was told I have very very healthy ovaries and would probably get 1-2 embryos without NF out of a IVF cycle. It is also extremely expensive and therefore not an option for us.  Yes PGD is what I was thinking of and I was incorrect. You are right and that was mentioned to me as well. I will have to look into things further but I am aware that it is very costly. Thank you. I got diagnosed when I was pregnant (at 32) because the hormones caused a huge uptick in neurofibromas.", "Medical costs for NF and anyone used selumetinib? Hello everyone. \n\nI have NF and live in the US.

I have not used selumetib yet, but my nf doctor wants to get me on it, I was actually in the process of doing the trial for it, but then the while virus stuff happened and then it became approved. No I have not.  Would I be eligible for Medicare if I am 26? I am in NC by the way if that helps. I am 36 and I am on it, but I also applied years ago for SSI, which put me on Medicaid for a while, then when my dad applied for retirement a couple years, I was able to apply off of him and now receive Medicare. \n\nBecause of the progression of my condition I cannot really work a job with a meaningful incomes, so that is why I applied. Which Medicaid I had to have my bank account no more than $2000 at any given time, I did receive SSI, it was not a ton and most of it went to rent to my parents, but it really helped having that medical aid. Now since my dad retired and I was able to apply off of his I have more income coming in and have Medicare which makes it easier for me to see my doctor in Chicago, because with Medicaid I would always need basically their permission because it was out of network and they did not care that I had been seeing this doctor since I was 15. \n\nDepending on what your situation is that might be something to look at, everyone is situation is different, especially when it comes to Neurofibromatosis, as it effects us all differently.", "Awaiting a DNA test for certainty, but it is looking possible I may have NF2.

Hello. I posted a while ago about my concerns of my vision loss and how I thought it could be to do with nf. Well since then I have FINALLY seen a neurologist who specialises in NF. He did not believe the vision loss was caused by an optical glioma as I have had previous tests done on my eyes which showed nothing and that I did not present the symptoms associated with them. He said he did not think I needed an MRI but referred me to have one anyway to put my mind at ease. \n\nSo anyway this morning I had my mri (with contrast) and it was not as bad as expected and was over within an hour.

Oh, i see, it is just that i have read something about the gene being related to autistic tendencies, and maximizing the chances of having the others It is hard to say for sure but several studies have shown that adults with NF are more likely to also struggle with mental health. \n\nThere was one study that used the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale and resulted in 55% of participate getting a score that indicates a high likelihood of clinical depression. \n\nOther studies have shown that around 33% of NF adults getting the score that indicated clinical depression. \n\nAn there was also a 12 study of 48 NF adults found that 21% of them met DSM criteria for Persistent Depressive Disorder. That same study shows that about 33% of NF adults have at least one psychological disorder. \n\nFor comparison, around 16% of the general population will experience clinical depression in their lifetime. \n\n I am pretty sure it is related to autism, but I am not sure on the others My doctor said that both ADHD and autism are more likely with NF1.\n\nRead this ( which has this quote \"An increased frequency of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autistic spectrum disorders has also been observed in individuals with NF1.\" It may not cause it, but people with NF1 are statistically more likely to have autism and/or ADHD. NF affects people so differently, that they can have one or two or all mention above! Please consult your doctor about appropriate medical advice! Probably.

(Cosmetically speaking) They are very small and I have not noticed much growth since around 21. The biggest one i have is the size of a baby pea, the rest is just my skin, which has that slightly raised red look before they break through the skin...\n\nI was thinking of getting them removed while they are small, but they will grow back wont they? Im getting self concious about wearing a bikini now. If they are removed correctly will they leave scars, or will that depend on the surgeon? How big will they get? Is it better to just leave them alone and accept my fate? No advice.  21 here. But I feel this. Found a picture of me from years ago.  Before I could even think. I said  my face has no bumps. I am so pretty. \n\nI find comfort in twirly higher neck dresses. Bonus points if their pink. And any outfit that matches my rockstar princess purple sparkly shoes. ( they are kids Velcro shoes and I love them.) I have had 15+ removed and only one has partial grown back. The dermatologist goes pretty deep to try and avoid regrowth. You will have a scar of some size depending on how you scar. Best to speak with your Neurofibromatosis specialist about whether the tumors are problematic or if they are causing you pain. You should keep in mind that if they are only removed for cosmetic reasons insurance usually will not cover it for that and unfortunately these tumors over time can grow back. I have had that happen to me. In 2006 I had tumors removed from my cervical spine and unfortunately it looks like some of them have returned, my nf doctor has setup an appointment for me to see a surgeon on the 9th of next month. I have most of my 'spots' my my trunk and breast which kind of sucks. I got some removed from between my cleavage and I honestly feel like more grew back. Sometime I swear these little fibromas a like Hydra and if you chop off the head of one ten more grow back in it is place......Mine are not huge, but my best advice would be that if they are not causing you pain then just leave them alone.....\n\nI was always of the belief that if someone really love you then they will accept your fibromas. The removal could will vary significantly based on size, shape, depth, location, your skin etc. To be honest no one here will be able to tell you if you will scar and how large those scars will look except for your doctors.\n\nAs for how big will they get or if they will grow back, it is completely up to your case. The tough thing about neurofibromas is they are often so unique to how and where they grow on each of us. \n\nAs for leaving them vs removing them. Obviously it is easiest to remove something smaller. But again I think that is a discussion you should have with your doctor. \n\nPersonally from the sound of what you are describing based on the look I would try and get them removed if possible. I think even visible small scars tends to be less unsightly. And if you are feeling self conscious, even without physical pain, that is absolutely a reason to talk to your doctors about what your options are. \n\nIf you are not already talking to a doctor who specializes in NF, you absolutely need to get on top of that. Now is the time.. Unfortunately for us this is a situation we need to track and monitor. When it comes to scars, medical scar creams do make a difference. My husband got two bumps removed from his arm at the same time as a few more hidden bumps. He used scar cream on the arm but not elsewhere. We can see the difference very clearly. They are still scars, of course, but a lot less noticeable, and that is even though they got aggravated while he was recovering because it is his left arm and he is left-handed. (He got the bumps removed and used the scar cream because they bothered him, not me. I think he is lovely. I feel like this is an important disclaimer.) I have one removed on the side of my ribs because it would cause a slight discomfort when I slept on my sides on even with a light brush when I am putting on a shirt. \n\nIt was removed by a plastic surgeon who was recommended by my NF specialist and to be my surprised it was quick and painless. Yes it left a very noticeable scar but other than that nothing has grown back yet Can you share me or us the scar cream your husband is using? TIA! Of course! He uses Mederma Advanced. I would recommend talking to your doctor about your options. Next week I am hoping to have electrodesiccation to remove some small bumps on my chests/breasts (as well as other parts on my body).

Lawyers that deal with social security, you do not pay them unless your case is won. And the payment it take out of backpay. Once you have been approved you will be put on Medicaid right away and that will take care of medical expenses. The only thing about being on social security for something like SSI you cannot have more than $2000 in your bank account and they include any saving account, stocks and bonds into that as well. Thank you for the advice, I am already on ssi, it is helpful. But $900 a month is nearly impossible to survive on. At least here in California.. I used to work a decent paying computer job.

But it really helped having Medicaid that took care of my medical expense. I would then pay my parents $450 in rent. The only big issue with Medicaid was they like you being in network and my nf doctor who I had been seeing since I was 15 was out of state. We ran into a couple issues over the years where Medicaid would deny me. I would always have to get special permission, but thankfully my primary doctors and my doctors in Chicago would always send letters to Medicaid big heads and explain the importance of why I need to go to Chicago and why my surgeries to remove cancerous tumors needed to be done there. \n\nOnce my dad applied for retirement and started receiving it, I was able to apply off of that to receive ssri off a parent and now receive around $1080 a month and was put on Medicare (this happened almost last fall) I still have partial Medicaid, but not the part that would cover dental.

I can work now, I went to college and graduated with a 4.0 gpa. \n\nHave you tried marijuana? Yeah turns out my OG neurologist is moving his practice out of town and is therefore not taking on any more big cases! Pretty low if that is really why he said I was inoperable.

That is what is causing me so much pain. I have been curious about marijuana, but have not tried it as it is still fully illegal in my state.  Very good idea to seek out a second opinion! \nI am not sure where you are located, but I use high doses of marijuana for pain.\nI personally have not had any radiation or chemo treatments done on my spine tumors, but have they thrown that out as an option at all?

Hoping for the best. \n     \n    Fir what it is worth, I used the 12,5 which is the smallest dose. It barely took it from intense pain to \"I might be able to sleep tonight\". These fentanyl patches seem to be a hit or miss kind of deal. They might work wonders for certain types of pain, while doing very little for others. If it is inoperable, maybe you can ask to get an appointment with a pain-clinic. Long term use of opioids, as said before, is not a good thing so maybe they can offer a more custom solution. Haha!

Well good luck hopefully you get your appointment. Do you see a specialist who specializes in Neurofibromatosis? If you do not I would advise looking into seeing one. They would be able to tell you whether surgery is possible versus a doctor who is not very familiar with the condition. I saw one in Alaska. We moved abruptly to Eastern Tennessee, and I have seen one once at Vanderbilt. We have been trying to make a second one at Vanderbilt for the past 5 months with no luck. Hopefully you are able to get in touch with one. If you are able it is very important to regularly see a Neurofibromatosis specialist or at least someone who is very familiar with the condition. I live in NYC, 26 I grew up with NF. However during summer 2020 in a regular checkup, blood work showed that I had some kind of inflammation. With some test, turns out I got RA ( Rheumatoid Arthritis ). RA falls in Autoimmune diseases and apparently its not clear why it happens.\n\nSo dont think its related to NF 2nd opinion would probably be great in this instance. I have arthritis in my hip because of a congenital bone abnormality that is probably NF1-related, so do not think you can totally rule out an NF1 connection. What kind of imaging have you had done so far? I have done 2 mris, one when I first tore it (December 2019), I decided to do physical therapy and finish the season, and I got another one in December 2020. The second one is where he saw the arthritis. Same surgeon both times. Ah gotcha, then it seems less likely to be NF-related. But I am definitely not a medical expert and agree with everyone else that should you talk to an NF specialist. Hope you can get in soon!", "dural ectasia linked to shakes Hello all, \nPast week I have had  weakness in left arm and leg due to  existing neurofibromatosis type 1. attended a&amp;e last week due to concern cauda equina syndrome, no visible compression of nerve seen, however my MRI for my dural ectasia, which looks worse, compared to my scan 6 years ago. I have a referral to neurosurgery, however the waiting list where I live is a year!!! And that is the urgent list.\n\nI am currently on 2 opiods to manage pain. weaknesses and tremors left side worse and tripping over easily, and either landing bum first or on my back. It seems to be My left side, if I use my left arm to support myself getting up from sofa,  it takes me a few go's, often I trip over minor things that I would not normally. When I try and stand my arm goes then .y leg follows.\n\nI suspect a neurofibroma on the brain, given the symptoms. Anyone else had this, or still has it, that can reassure or point me in the right direction. My MRI was of my lower back. No CT scan conducted as if yet. I have image of my spine MRI wise If that helps", "does anyone else find it hard to monitor symptoms? hello everyone, first off im very bad at typing things out so please excuse my spelling, grammar, run on sentences ext.\n\na quick history: i am a 33 year old male with NF1 diagnosed at a very young age.  i have been mostly problem free for my life, i had a tumor removed in 2007 in my abdomen.  around 2014 i was having pain in my neck head area and went to get it checked out. turns out i have serval tumors around C1-2, C2-3, C3-4 with alot of cord compression.  the doctors in my area(NY) were ready to operate to removed, almost went though with it, went for a seconded opion at Johns Hopkins. were they found although my scans look horrible my exams are good, so they did not want to operate, just monitor with MRIs every 3 months, that countied for a year or so, then went to once every 6 months, then once a year,  then in 2019 some of the grew, witch ment surgery was back on the table, or atlest i had to think about it.  and monitore my body more closely. im back to MRIs every 3 months, and need to montire things like unration frequencyand BMs balance among others, i just some times find it hard to tell if im having a change that was eather very slow over time where i dont really notice till its very different or just a temproaly change for diet, or other things.  thanks for reading, ive just been stressed out about it recently, and maybe with covid being ask constly about thoes symtoms im just self montored out for the time being \n\n\nTLDR: do you find it hard to tell if things are changing or just a temp change or something like that. I am also in NY.   My NF is mild and I pay very little attention to it. I try not to overthink but I often do. So many issues may be NF while usually it is just being 44 all the time It is the most frustrating and anxiety inducing part of it all.  Do I have a headache because I did not sleep well, or is there a tumor pressing on some nerve and it is doing irreversible damage? All the time and I hate it. I am always anxious about every time I have pain.", "I hate this so much. ", "Diagnosed On a Whim Hi all! I have so many questions about neurofibromatosis. Long story short, I have had 5 tumors shown up. The first when I was 17, in my arm pit which was surgically removed and never diagnosed as such. At 22 I was diagnosed after an MRI detected 4 in one leg below the knee. I saw an oncologist who could not diagnose it as anything, saw many specialists before finally seeing my PCP who diagnosed it as neurofibromatosis. I initially had lots of swelling and extreme pain, which has since subsided. Occasionally it flares up but is easily treated with anti inflammatories. I was not given much information on it, therefore I do not know much about it at all. \n\nSo my questions is... Do I need to seek out scans to confirm I do not have more? Or will my body send me warning signals? Every time I get a new ache I think I have got another tumor. And does this fit neurofibromatosis or was I diagnosed improperly? And if it is, what exact type of physician should I be seeing for this? Grateful for any information offered. I am not sure where you are in the world.  But I see the team in Manchester yearly and genetics yearly as well normally 6 months between the two.  I have MRI yearly as my NF is both inside and outside my body. I have it in my lungs which is a big concern for me. I also check for any new lumps just in case it is a new lump or plexi. If you can get mri I would as this helps keep track of it. I was diagnosed when I was 15 and typically have MRI scans yearly. I have for the last 21 years. I have had four surgeries involving my Neurofibromatosis in 2001, 2006, 2014 and 2018. The surgery in 2006 was to remove tumors that were pressing against my cervical spine. The surgeries in 2014 and 2018 were to remove tumors that had turned cancerous. \n\nI would highly suggest get an official diagnosis as Neurofibromatosis is something that does need to be monitored. You must be genetically tested to verify if you have NF and which kind you may have.  The doctor can suspect you have a form of NF but only blood testing is definitive.", "Writing a book and need some help! Hi, all! I am currently writing my first book where the main character has Neurofibromatis (Type 1.) In this novel, the central character is a high school freshman and suffers bullying from her peers. She has visibly textured skin. \nThis is where I need some help!\nTell me the nicknames you have been called. All the ways you have been bullied. \nI want to make this as real as possible and want to get a more diverse view apart from my own perspective on things (I have NF1 as well.) \n\nAlso if anyone has any advice for me in general send me a message me whatever! Would love to hear it as I am going into this process blind! :) I had scoliosis causes by NF and was called back brace girl. The book Deenie by Judy Bloom really helped me and might be a good reference for a teen with medical issues (scoliosis).  No one ever called me names because of my Neurofibromatosis, I was diagnosed until I was 15. I went to a small private Catholic School from K-12 grade. I was however called names because of my lazy eye, but not until college. I was called druggie and crack baby. People have commented on my cafe au lait spots (usually just something along the lines of \"woah, you have got a lot of birthmarks\") and my foot's been called \"freaky\" before Nobody ever called me names specifically because I had NF, since mine was not very visible but I was bullied plenty.\n\nMy name is Samantha, and some kids used to tease me about having \"Sammie Disease,\" again I do not think they knew about NF specifically, but they knew something was \"different.\"\n\nI wore a backtrace for part of middle school and high school. I had trouble adjusting since I could not bend, and even though the brace was not visible (since it went under my clothes) the others kids found out and threw stuff at me (erasers, raisins) so they could hear the sound it made.\n\nOne girl who I hung out with for one summer, I think we met at camp or something, would always point out my cafe au last marks (I have a few that are quite visible if I am wearing short sleeves or shorts. Do not really care.)\n\nBecause of my NF, I struggled A LOT with math. (I have a tumor in the area of the brain dealing spatial/math stuff) 6th grade was particularly difficult and the teacher refused to give me any extra help because the things we were studying were easy and \"I should know it.\" She just sat me at the table next to the smartest kid in class and expected him to help/me to cheat off of him. So not a student bully, but a teacher bully which is worse.\n\nLots of general teasing in that grade by other students too. TBH, blocked much of it out but it was bad enough that I had to transfer schools. Both middle schools placed me in these lunch groups designed to help improve my \"social abilities.\" Which did not help because it made me stand out even more, and my issue was not necessarily making friends so much as I did not want to be friends with any of my classmates. Knowing how to talk on the phone (which I knew) and small talk was not going to help me not get bullied. (Basically my thought process was that I did not want to try to be friends with the people teasing me, because you know...they were bullying me. Acting more normal was not going to change that. I could go into depth about all of this but that would be very ranty.\n\nAlso, I think those ended up hurting more than helping but who knows\n\nGot all the usual stuff too: weak, slow, weirdo...etc. \n\nHigh school was much better since my parents decided to send me to a private school where a lot of the kids had learning or social issues, but was not strictly a school for learning disabilities or specializing in that. Basically it seemed like nearly all my classmates had ADD, ADHD, dyslexia or some combination of the three, but that was not the school's goal or marketing tactic.\n\nStill had some issues; one of the guys who had bullied me in middle school showed up my sophomore year, still had plenty of drama with friends, had another guy tried to drive my friend group apart for no real reason but that was not really about me having NF so much as it was me being a socially awkward high schooler.\n\nI do not know how much of this is relevant, but I could go on for quite a bit.\n\n&amp;#x200B; People asked how I got burned a lot.  ( People have called me lop head, said look like I have fetal alcohol syndrome, got beat really bad, just got called straight up ugly. Idk what else  I have a very mild case compared to most.  But, I have a lot of the CALs.\n\nStarting in 6th grade, we had to change for gym.  Because of the CALs, I became known as \"AIDS Boy.\" Same....people see the one on my palm and ask what it is....typically I will just say it is a scar  Never really got made fun of for my spots....but then again I never really took gym class for people to notice and most of my spots are on my trunk. I had to take special ed gym class because of the titanium plate in my head....so whenever anyone asked me why I was in that class I would just look them straight in the eyes and say 'Well I have a titanium plate in my head' and it would silence them....  \n\n\nOnly thing I could suggest would be that if she would have had a titanium plate in her head that people knew about for them to say something along the lines of 'well that explains a lot' about her being the weird kid or whatever......my personality is always to say something before they can. So whenever I would tell some friends about it I would say 'it explains a lot, eh?' before anybody could say anything.....or say that my body 'looks like a damned cheetah.'   \n\n\nIf she does find love within the novel I could suggest what I did with my husband. I asked him if he wanted to see my stomach and back before things got too serious, that it would change his mind since it looks bloody well ugly.....but he basically said that he did not care what it looked like that he loved me regardless. ", "i have neuro fibroma i dont know if i will get a gf ever...life is sad! will i get married ever? i have neuro fibroma on back, chest, hands, some on legs...", "Are these NF1 lumps apearing i have them on the left ankle and a one on the right ankle ", "seeking advice please I have NF1 and I despise it. I feel ugly and I hate my body/skin. I do not wish it on anyone else, but I wish I did not have it. When I was younger, it never really bothered me because I have a mild case. However, now that I am married, having NF is causing more stress than ever. My husband does not care I have NF but it is preventing me from having a child. I want my own child, I want to be pregnant. I want that experience, I want that exciting feeling of getting that big fat positive pregnancy test without worry about passing on this horrible faulty gene.\n\nI am probably never going to get pregnant and I am continuously crying. Everyone I know, friends, family, co-workers are announcing they are pregnant. Pregnant with no.1, no.2 and so on. I, myself, have to be mindful of this simple hope, enjoyment and motherhood. \n\nI just want to roll myself in a ball and never come undone. I am seeking advice for those who have NF1 that was passed down by your parents. I was not that case. I was spontaneous so I have no feelings of anger towards my parents. The last thing I want to do is be responsible for giving my child a lifetime of anger, hate and feeling like they are diseased. I want to see if anyone is okay with having NF1. I do not want this to be negative, I know it is.... but I am just seeing if I were to get pregnant and have a child who has NF1 that they will be okay. Fortunatly, I do not want to have childre, but I can emphatize with you. I do not know where are you front (if is USA I suppose is too expensive) but maybe you can ask your doctor  for a preimpantaton genetic diagnosis for select \"healthy\" embryos I do not want to do that because I was told that doing that route could causes more tumors due to the hormones. Either way, I am screwed. :/ Yeah, I forgot it! For this reason I cannot take the pill for birth control... \n\nBut remember: family is not blood. You can adopt. I know that it is not the same, but you will made very happy to a kid with not home and definitly will be YOUR son/daugther. \nFamily is not blood.\n\nA huge hug Hey there. Just wanted to say that there is still a possible way for you to have your own child and not pass it. Mind you it can be more costly.  My genetic spealist said that with ivf they can harvest eggs, check which ones carry the nf gene and remove those ones. Then they reimplant the nf free eggs. So that you could still have a child that would be healthy. I would talk to a doctor to get more information and see if this is somthing you could do. I also was a spontaneous mutation.\n\nThoughts and prays to you.  Hugs You can absolutely get pregnant. I got pregnant naturally and tested the pregnancy for NF1. I terminated because I too do not want to pass it on. Then I did IVF w/ PGT and tested the embryos for NF before transferring one back into me. I know have an incredible and healthy 7 month old daughter. Just to be clear, they cannot test the eggs for anything. They must fertilize the eggs and let the embryos grow for about 5 days and can then biopsy a few cells to test for the genetic disorder. Telling someone who wants to have their own children, to experience pregnancy, etc. that they can adopt is like pouring salty lemon water in a gaping wound. You do not want kids. Please stay out of the discussion. Your advice is not helpful and only causes more pain. IVF does not cause any more tumors to grow. Compared to a whole pregnancy it is a short amount of time to be exposed to extra hormones. I do not think so. I told that I can emphatize because I know is important. And I know very well the diference and fell bad for her. \n\nBut I am not agree with you. Mi desires are not important for the discussion. And family is family. She cannot have the experiece of pregnancy and this is a bad thing. Is horrible. But she cant enjoy of the experience of be mom. Say that adopted children are real children is not deney the pain of cannot have children. I know this pain (not on my skin, but near)     As someone who has felt this pain and been told to just adopt...no. You are wrong. Stand down. \n\nIf you want to adopt go right ahead. It is not your place to suggest this advice to anyone. It has nothing to do with the fact that there are children who need loving homes. Adoption is complicated, expensive, and not for everyone. Everyone knows it is exists and if they are interested they will explore it as an option without your suggestion. If you desire to have children first talk with your doctor about the risk. There are things that can be done to lesson the chance of passing the condition on to your children, however be aware that pregnancy can make your condition worse for you. You are lucky you have a mild case of it, I am not so lucky. I have been told by my own doctor that I have a severe case of it. I have had cancerous tumors, as well as tumors growing on my cervical spine. I am 37. It sucks, but I try not to let it get me down. Yes I have limitations, but I know that hiding away is not going to make things better for me. There are people out there with far worse condition than mine out there living their lives. Try taking things day by day and being grateful for the things you do have. Life is far too short. I have NF1.. I cannot have kids.. and it blew apart my marriage.  No children,  the depression and all the other parts of NF1. The problems of learning disabilities,  filling out forms, the simplest of tasks are even harder.\n\n   I understand your point of view I would definitely get on some antidepressants. It is very hard..at least for me and has gotten harder the older I get.\n  Finding the compassionate Doctors...  is even harder, so true.\nI understand what you have to share,\n I would not never want anyone else in the whole world to have this issue. Or have the chance of passing this along ever to anyone.\n   When I found out that I had an NF1.  The light at the end of the tunnel turned on...it explained everything that was going on in my life that was wrong, all my failures and all the pain.\n\n   It took me so much work to accept myself.  \n   It is a total inside job. It takes a lot of work. \n\n I guess the closest thing I can say to you..is that you got to love you. You with nothing else in your life.\nLove to dance by yourself.  \nDance by yourself with NF1 and all the problems.\nIt is really hard, as each journey is so unique. You can do it. She is just presenting an alternative viewpoint and she was not unsympathetic at all... \ud83d\ude15 I did not say she was unsympathetic. I was explaining is it feels to be told that when you want more than anything in the world to experience pregnancy and having your own biological children. She is offering advice on something she really does not know anything about. It is not from her own personal experience. It is not something she is ever had to consider. It is hurtful even if it was not intended to be. On a public forum you will read many viewpoints. Yes and some viewpoints are not relevant when that viewpoint does not have personal experience with it. Well, again, it is a public forum on the internet... You are going see stuff you do not like... Do not tell people they are not relevant and should stand down \ud83d\ude15.... That is the last thing I am saying; this conversation is going away from the point of the thread.... So then why are you getting involved? I do not wish to adopt. We want biological children. My heart aches, cries and breaks. I am not sure how I can continue on much longer. It is funny.. we are just so blind during childhood, teenage years and young adult and now when you are in your 30s, you are awake and realize what lie you were living this whole life. It is hard to get back up from that.. I am just not liking this life anymore. I am sorry that you marriage did not work. Is it because of the no children? I am hoping that my husband will not leave me because of me. I am just sad by it all. I am trying to inform from someone who is felt very much like OP. Suggestions like that can be really hurtful. OP is already in pain and saying \u201cjust adopt\u201d is not helpful. You can have your \u201copinions\u201d but until you have felt like OP feels, you do not know how those comments and suggestions sting. So you can either take what I have shared to help protect OP\u2019s feelings or not.", "29 years old and just got my diagnosis Well I am an active guy and started having back pain so I went to an orthopedic back doctor. He gets x-rays and says I look ok (apart from a sachrilized vertebrae and slightly herniated disk) tells me to do some stretches... did not work. My pain starts intensifying and he sends me to get an MRI or my lumbar spine. \n     Multiple tumors are found on my lumbar spine as well as a large mass in my psoas muscle. My doc sends me to a top neurologist in my city who tells me I have NF and it is not operable. He sends me to pain management. \n      My pain management doc injects steroids into my (slightly) herniated disk and gives me nerve pain pills for the well...nerve pain..\n     Now I am a couch potato.  With nerve pain. \n\nDoes it get better? Should I get more opinions? What advice do you have for me if any?\n      \n I obviously do not know the details of your tumors, but I have never had a doctor tell me one of my tumors is inoperable. There is also radiation treatment for tumors, as well as drug therapies.\n\nI do not know where you are located, but a few very good NF clinics: House Ear Institute in LA, NYU in New York City, and Mass General in Boston. Northwestern in Chicago also has a few doctors.\n\nFeel free to PM me with more questions. I have not dealt with them much but I can vouch for NYU being excellent. Their Clinical Genetic Services were top notch. They also explained to me that the NF team is a collection of doctors across different specialties who are all top in their field and well versed in NF. Many plexiforms can be inoperable as they grow along nerves.  I did not realize that. Are there drug therapies for that? Currently, no. Neither traditional chemotherapy nor radiation can even slow the growth of plexiforms let alone stop growth or shrink them.\n\nHowever, a promising new drug, Selumetinib, is showing promise. It passed a phase 2 trial with flying colors (70% saw &gt;20% shrinkage) and is currently in a final phase before submission to the FDA.\n\nGiven the promising results in plexiforms, it has recently begun to be studied for cutaneous neurofibromas as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n I currently have a tumour either on, or very very close to my spine, naturally I doubt surgery is an option. \n\nIf I am offered a chance to be part of a trial for that, I will jump at it. No questions asked. I do not even care if it comes out that it shortens life expectancy, I just want something of a normal life, I do not want to have this fucking tumour constantly growing, getting more and more painful. It is reached the point where my left arm feels slightly numb constantly, and I am fucking terrified for the future.  Have you asked a doctor about surgery? I also have a tumor near my spine and was pleasantly surprised to learn that the surgery to remove it would be very straightforward. Speaking to a neurologist, and NF specialist (probably one of, if not THE most qualified person about it in the UK) in the next few weeks hopefully. Just need to wait on the referral from the doctor to go through. \n\nProblem is, with it causing so much numbness on my left arm, I have a real concern about losing feeling or movement in it. And yeah, I genuinely could not cope with life like that. That is completely understandable. I will say, I have a very very weak left arm and hand, but I lead a full life. I am a PhD student, and I am getting married in a few weeks. I totally get how scary it can feel, but I can promise you that there are ways to deal with it. Feel free to PM me with questions. I would ask your specialist or neurologist to look at any MEK inhibitor trial. Selumetinib is not the only MEK inhibitor. In fact, Trametinib is already approved for other conditions and is an MEK inhibitor also. It is just lagging behind selumetinib in terms of nf1 research.  Thing is, I have always been really active, pretty much my entire life revolves around being outdoors, mostly climbing, and mountain hiking. They are my therapy, it is where I am happy. If I did not have that, if I could not do that... Honestly I do not know if I could cope. \n\nLike, I am currently in training to attempt a 12 hour traverse of the Cuillin ridge. Like, my fear, my absolute biggest fear is losing feeling or movement in any of my limbs.  Oh, I forgot to add. MEK inhibitors actually have milder side effects than traditional chemotherapy drugs.  Yeah it is scary. They found three tumors on my spinal cord and a large mass and that was just a lumbar MRI. I am going back for a full spine MRI and I feel it is likely they will find brain tumors as I have chronic tinnitus. Above all I just hope my 3 kids are clear or low symptoms. Nerve pain is the worst. I know bc I had kidney failure as well.  My neurologist told me there was no removing the tumor from the nerve because the tumor IS the nerve. Said he can remove it but something will not work. I would either lose feeling or motion in my leg. I am still waiting on the next MRI to tell me more detail but I am not sure how productive that will be since I cannot use contrast bc of my kidney disease. Fingers crossed !! I have three tumors on my actual spinal cord. That is why my neurologist said he was hesitant to operate. \n    That is true about the tinnitus thanks for reminding me! No need to get worked up about tumors I may not even have. Cannot wait for my MRI to tell me more.  Were you involved in a clinical trial? Are you still on the drug? Did it help you?  Hm interesting. I know the PD drug is actually moving to a phase 3 trial now, so many must have had success with it.  For nf. Check out  welcome bro. im 29 too. i have one that is superficial to/right around my spine (around T6 vertebrae) and two dermatologists were straight up like \"i am not going near that\"\n\nfortunately mine do not cause pain rn\n\ngood luck", "Possible NF in my son Hi everyone I have just started looking into NF and getting the ball rolling on getting my son checked out for NF. He does not have many signs besides about 20 small cafe au lait spots on mostly his trunk (with at least 8 being the same to slightly larger than 0.5cm) He is 4 and was/is so speech delayed (I never thought much of it since he was child#3 and my husband was also slightly delayed) I also just assumed the spots were birth marks for years. Non of my doctors said anything otherwise. So I guess my questions are how did you get diagnosed, what lead your parents to get checked out, what the process is like, if you were not born with any visible fibromas when did you develop them. Thanks everyone I have NF1. I was born with multiple CALS. I did not develop any tumors until I was about 15. My mother was a genetic mutation and the first one in the family. So far it is only her and I. Because she had it, I was tested genetically at 9 months old. I did not too bad issues besides vision issues, and and scoliosis until I was 15. But I would suggest getting a referral from your pediatrician for neurology (they will do MRIS to check for tumors on the inside.) genetics (they will fo the testing to see if your son has NF) ophthalmology (optic nerve fibromas are extremely common in people with NF). I hope this helps and I wish you the best of luck. If you have Facebook there is a Facebook group for Moms of kids with NF. And is full of super helpful information when it comes to doctors, hospitals, test results etc. Doctors always believed I had it sometime after I was born. I believe it was actually eye doctor that first brought it up, I was also born with a lazy right eye. Ultimately it was my pediatrician that kept an eye on things, as she always suspected I had it. When I was nine I was referred to the university of Michigan, where they did a couple test (do not really remember much other than point out the bumps on my head). Results to my understanding were inconclusive. Jump forward in time after I have started puberty and my pediatrician is seeing more and more reason to suspect I have it, so at 15 I am sent to the university of Chicago, where they do some blood work and an exam. I would end up going back for a whole week stay at the hospital for a number of test (ending up missing the last week of my freshmen year of highschool) after all the test is was determined I had Neurofibromatosis, weeks before my 16th birthday.\n\nIf you have any more questions feel free to ask I was 34. I always had a lot of CALs, thought it was normal, like freckles. Had my daughter, who was born with 6 CALs too, still figured it was a normal thing. No doctor had said otherwise at any point. She had a cyst removed at 11 months old, during surgery a nurse noticed her spots and that led us down the path to both getting diagnosed. We are both luckily mild so far, just the spots and migraines as well as anxiety but cannot totally say that is from NF or not. Not many doctors know about it so them seeing these spots would not trigger them to think about it. \n\nI have had many doctors where I had to explain to them what it was. \n\nI am in a bigger city now so this issue is less common, but I also mainly see a neurologist now. Thanks for the reply I appreciate it! That makes sense, I also never thought to look into it until now. Thanks for the reply! Do you mind me asking how bad your scoliosis is? My husband has a very slight curvature so it does not really affect him much and he is so freckled, but I do not think he has any CALS so I do not think my son would get it from him.  Reading about scoliosis did catch my attention though. Thanks for the reply and the info! I will check out that Facebook page! Thanks for the reply! Did and your daughter you end up getting checked for internal fibromas? I am glad you both are mild! I am hoping my son is too. You are welcome She had a baseline MRI done which was clean so we are just in the wait and see stage now. And you are welcome! When this all first came up I was desperate to hear stories of mild cases, and that is never what shows up on Google so I always want to share our cases to help new parents see all the possibilities. My curve is also minor. I was last checked at 13 (18 now) and it was a 15\u00b0 curve barely qualifying for scoliosis. I did not have many back issues when I was younger, but when I started playing sports in middle school my lower back got much worse. It might be worth you and your sons dad getting genetically tested to see if it was passed down or if it was a genetic mutation. NF is just getting more attention and was not known until recently.\n\nYou can find more info at ctf.org I was not diagnosed until my 30s after my son had issues that resulted in him having to have a VP shunt. I was diagnosed at 3. At the same time my sister and mum were also diagnosed. I was at a doctor for a non related issue and the GP noticed the signs while examining me\n\nI am now in my 30s\n\nI do not have skin tags. I have had neurofibromas removed. They would have been visible if you looked at the right spot. They were deep and required general anaesthetic to remove", "NF1 Pain relief? New to the group! I have NF1.  I have pretty bad pain, daily, all day.  My Dr prescribed me Tramadol about 2 years ago.  It takes the edge off but does not really cut it. I suffer pretty badly every day.  He has tried anti-depressants thinking that would help, but they made me really offside ( I told him it would happen! Anti-depressants of any kind and I do not mix well)\n\nIs there anything anyone else does for pain? Is pain normal in NF? He seems to think its all nerve pain and kind of dissmisses it.  I am so frustrated!!! I found going to the gym really helped me feel good but with COVID, I am currenly just excercising at home.  you can ask to change medication gabapentin would probably be the next step, nerve pain is pretty common with NF. I have been on Gabapentin before. I did not touch the pain. :( How long were you on the gabapentin and what dosage? I take two different pain medications, Tramadol which is my helper pain medication and my main one is hydrocodone. Both work great together for me and help me function throughout the day. Thank you for your reply. I am on Tramadol but that is all. I will look into hydrocodone You are welcome. It is the generic for vicodin  Things are super strict in Canada with opiates. I have to go in and do a pee test to prove I am actually taking my Tramadol and not selling it. Even though Tramadol is a mild painkiller. They are extremely hesitant here to prescribe painkillers and I had to sign a bunch of paperwork basically saying I would take as prescribed,  not sell it, not give it away, not drink alcohol (LOL to the alcohol.) I told my doc, well occasionally you may find alcohol because I am going to have a drink when I want. He just laughed. I was on it for about 3 months, as far as the dosage I honestly do not recall. Its been going back about 3 years. They have been trying to help me for over 10 years now to find something that manages it best. I have to do that once a year, plus sign a contract here in the states. I have only had to once every 3 to 4 months right now because our covid restrictions do not allow us to go to the DR as often. Usually its every time i need a refill. Every 30 days. Kind of sad really when they know I need it and would never do those things. The town I love in is really bad for drugs though, so I try to understand. Have you considered Acetyl L carnitine? It is very safe addiction free supplement already used for Nf1 hypotonia and weakness . \n\nAcetyl L carnitine has been proven very effective for painful peripheral neuropathy ( \n\nIF you browse a bit on pubmed, there are many studies about Carnitine and pain, and another  combination worth looking at is Alpha Thioctic Acid together with  Vitamin B Complex. \n\nI would - if possible - leave opioids as a very very last resort, and explore all other alternatives. Thank you! I will look into this Every time I need a refill I have to contact my doctor, who then sends a prescription order to the pharmacy. Before the government starting cracking down on opioids, I just had to login to my Walgreens account and request a refill. It stinks, because in my opinion it add more work and time for the doctor and does effect those of us who have chronic pain who are not abusing our medication. \n\nI understand they are trying to crack down on illegal drug use of opioids, but I feel that addicts are going to find a way to get their hands on the drugs even with out a prescription written by a doctor. Maybe cognitive behavioral therapy I completely agree with you!!! Thank you so much for responding to me. This is more helpful than you know. We have fake opiods circulating in our community right now. I am in Ontario, Canada. They are laced with Fentanyl and Carfentanyl. There are a lot of deaths and I am sure that is why the restrictions have been tighter. I myself used to just email the Dr and would be able to pick up my prescription I am not in need of any sort of psychological help. Thanks though I meant this kind of therapy helps deal with ways to cope with the pain. You do not need to have any psychological conditions to receive this kind of therapy. Regular surgery may help also. Internal tumors may be causing the pain. You are welcome. Yeah, there have been a lot of Fentanyl related death all over. It is very sad. I just hope that those of us with chronic pain issues, do not have to jump through any more hoops than we already do in order to get our medication. 100%! Merry Christmas.  You made my first post in the group very easy. Had not thought of it this way....... thank you That was the worst thing for me! It made me so sick You are welcome. I hope you find something that helps Merry Christmas to you too. If you live where medical marijuana is available go and register with a pain doctor. Ketamine infusions work, and often for a few months. Ketamie tablets, that go under your tongue, can also be made for you ( if prescribed by your pain doctor) by a pharmacist. My adult offspring explained that she has CONSTANT pain. \nName the medication, she tried them all. They only worked for a finite time period. \nKeeping a pain diary is important so you have a record of how you feel. \nJust understand that your pain is real but no one can see it. Keeping a diary will help you voice how you are doing. Thank you so much for your response! I will look into all of this. Medical Marijuana was prescribed but I was not a huge fan I hope you are able to get and use the medical cannabis tablets. Try finding something like RSO(. Rick Simpson oil, I think) or tincitures as they have worked wonders for pain for me. Thanks!!! I have recently been put on gabapentin and it seems to be helping a lot.", "10 month old with 10+ cafe au lait Hello to you; I am new to parenting, cafe au lait spots and now reddit. I am reaching out because I feel such despair and concern for my little girl. I  blanked at the appointment with the paediatric dermatologist and feel like I did not ask all the questions I needed to...just cried instead. And I do not even know if the doctor could not have helped ease my concerns anyway. So here I am...howling into the abyss?\n\nAnyway my 10 month old has 10 cafe au lait spots,  with 3 larger than 5 mm. The paediatric dermatologist said she does not see any signs of developmental delay and if anything my girl is advanced for her age. There are cafe au lait spots on both sides of the family however no one has more than 2-3. In order to be clear we have been referred for genetic testing which may take a year. The doctor is querying Leguis Syndrome, although says it is even more rare that NF1. This has never been detected in either sides of our families. How rare is a genetic mutation? Are there folks out there with 10+ spots that do not have NF1 or any genetic disorder? (My guess is that they would not be reading this thread). \nI am desperate for any consolation. I am so scared for my little girl. I am worried that I am so worried that I am not being present for her right now. How do parents manage this worry during the waiting? I would not stress out if I were you. \n\nI am an adult with little ones of my own. I am in the process of (most likely) being diagnosed with NF1 myself. I have the caf\u00e9 au lait spots, but it has never bothered me. Nor have I had anything about (most likely) having NF1 bother me or really impact my life. \n\nThe only thing that really brought it to my attention was a family member being diagnosed. Between that and the numerous caf\u00e9 spots I have, I am pretty sure I have it. \n\nThe \u201cnice\u201d thing about (potentially) being formally diagnosed (for me at least) is being able to know what sort of complications to look out for, so that they can be detected/taken care of before they become a more major issue. I suppose that is a benefit to have medical attention before issues become big trouble. I had not thought of it that way. NF1 is approx 1:3000 births, with 50% of those being from a spontaneous mutation and 50% being inherited from a parent. Currently not much you can do aside from more frequent screenings than the unaffected child would expect (like u/amydaynow said). Good luck! I think you will be ok. My condition was most likely a mutation, neither one of my parents had it. Neither of my three younger siblings have it either. Doctors believed when I was born I had it, but test results back then were inconclusive, I was tested again when I was nine, but the same results. It was until I was 15 that I was fully diagnosed. For some people puberty can be like the on switch to get things rolling with this condition. I am 37 now. If you have questions, please feel free to ask. Thank you for taking the time and replying. I guess I do have a few questions; how many cafe au lait spots did you have in infancy? Are you saying genetic testing results cane back inconclusive until you were 15? What kind of test was it? I am not sure how many I had when I was a baby, all I know is doctors suspected I had it and informed my parents. I did not become aware of anything until I was 15. All I know is when I was a baby and when I was nine, test were done, but results were inconclusive. I was born in 1983 and in 1993 I would have been nine. All I remember when I was nine was them doing some basic test, looking at the marks on my arms and legs, and the little bumps I had on my head. They probably took some blood work, but that was so long ago.\n\nWhen I was 15, they did blood work, xrays and MRIs. I stayed in the hospital for about a week while they ran all those test. My son was diagnosed at 3 1/2 years old.  He should have been diagnosed earlier, but I cannot fix that at this point.  When he was diagnosed it was because I noticed one of his eyes began to look larger than the other.  It turned out that he had 2 brain tumors.   One of them left him permanently blind in one eye.   Lots of treatment later and 1 tumor is gone, the other (inoperable) responded well to chemo and has benn sitting quietly with no growth for 7 years.  \nI know this is all scary to hear, but I am sharing it with you so that you can appreciate the good news of your situation.  With such an early diagnosis you can stay on top of things and ensure your daughter has the best possible chance of not developing complications like my son has experienced.  \nNow, for the diagnosis of your daughter: You do NOT have to wait a year to get a firm diagnosis.  Search for NF specialists in your area and make an appointment.  If you have a pediatric hospital near you that is a good place to start.  If they do think your daughter has NF1 they will be able to answer all your questions AND set you up with the right appointments to appropriately monitor her.  \nFor many with NF1 they live their whole lives with no serious complications, and live perfectly normal lives, so as hard as it is, try to just take it one step at a time.  Just stay focused on doing the next thing that is within your control.  So, search, and make an appointment.  That is all you need to focus on for now.  \nWe are fortunate to be near Johns Hopkins where we still go for routine monitoring and follow-up.  But, I have learned that there are NF specialists all across the country and we have now known several that have trained at Hopkins and then moved on to treat NF in other parts of the country.  \nStay positive and appreciate that you have the chance of such an early diagnosis.  \nIf I can help further please let me know. Oh, and BTW, my son is very gifted; no developmental delays whatsoever!  Also, I realized from your spelling that you might be in another country.  Fear not!  Even though NF1 is not well known it is actually one of the more common genetic mutations.  So, I imagine you will be able to find a specialist wherever you are! Thank you so much for sharing your family\u2019s story. I am so sorry to hear of your little guy\u2019s early challenges and it is encouraging to hear he has been healthy since. \nI live in Canada in a rural community. We travelled 4 hours to see the paediatric dermatologist and will have to do so again to see the eye specialist in November. They will determine if there are Lisch nodules. If there is it is certain she has NF1. The genetic testing would be to confirm. However I heard that genetic testing can be inconclusive as another person shared on this thread. I am seeing the value in early detection and we are blessed with free healthcare in Canada so I could seek out as many resources as possible...as long as our doctor refers. I think I will research NF1 organizations in Canada. Thank you for the suggestion and for your encouraging words. With all of that travel time it would be great if you could set up all of your appointments in one day (possible if you are going to an NF specialist in a hospital setting) and stay overnight in a hotel. Then do something fun the next day to relieve your stress!  As your daughter gets older this will make the doc. visits something to look forward to because she will know that a fun adventure is all part of the package.   I will tell you that my son NEVER heard words like: disease, tumor, cancer, chemo, MRI, etc.  As he got older and started asking I answered his questions honestly, but when he was little he just knew that he was really special and there were interesting things happening in his body that the doctors wanted to learn about and take special pictures of.  I always made sure the hospital was fun and entertaining.  At 12 yrs old he still thinks it is fun to go there!  So despite the distance you have to travel just look at it  as an opportunity to have some fun while you are away.  \nHang in there.  No matter what, you will be giving your daughter all the same love and opportunities that you would have in any circumstance and I am sure she will grow to be a happy little girl! Wonderful suggestions! I caught NF from a mutation. It is rare, but it does happen. The most important thing to remember is that your daughter is - and will always be - more than her \"medical label\". \n\nMany of us who have NF are able to live normal lives. \n\nWish you and your dauhter the strength to get through this.", "I am so worn out... I have been lurking this sub for while..wanting to post but too afraid to I suppose.\nAlright, so 4 days after I was born my lower left leg snapped due to the bone mass being mostly taken over by tumor mass.\nA few months after that thanks to a big \u2018ol spot on my stomach, I was diagnosed with NF1.\nAt 2 years old they did a bone transplant to try and fix my left leg (if did not work) they also did not pin the bones in my right leg, so my gate is totally fucked, completely fallen arch, which is making me progressively more and more knock kneed, but I get ahead of myself.\n \nSo after the bone transplant I in many different casts/ braces. But nothing really worked...So at 6 years old they amputated my foot. \nThere was still a break in the bone, so wearing my prosthetic was very painful, then at age 10 they did a revision amputation, which thankfully has made walking more comfortable..\n...there was a shit ton of surgeries peppered throughout my life so..\nThe last brutal one was in 2015, I had a mass growing in my neck growing at an alarming rate (it was about the size of an avocado) in removing the mass they paralyzed the left sized of my larynx..for about 6 months after I could not really speak, then another minor procedure and I have a different much weaker voice...its taken some getting used too...\n\nHonestly there has been too many surgeries to type out (33 to be exact)..I am not sure why I am writing this..i guess I am just frustrated, people always tell me    \u201cIt will get better, tomorrow\u2019s another day\u201d\nBut from literally everything life has taught me, it does not get better..\nLike my bacon constantly hurts, waking is painful, my head hurts, my hands randomly do not work????\n\n\t\t\tdo not even get me started on the emotional issues thanks to an adolescences in hospital beds and wheelchairs and those fun isolating things..\n\n\n  I am sorry if this seem all pity party like...\n      \n\tmy apologies for grammatical errors, over here stoned to the bone and salty I am so sorry that you have had such a rough time with NF1. it amazes me how broad our conditions can be. For me it is been a tumor in my bladder that has caused my bladder to not work, and I had a urostomy bag for 10 years. I now have a different badder situation that looks more normal but still causes problems. \n\nI understand needed to rant, cry, complain and pity ourselves..... If you ever need to talk feel free to message me on here That Is tough, I will I can say is that yes, it does suck really bad sometimes and most people will not understand that. For much of my life i was an extreme atheist. I would laugh at the mention of God or Jesus. In recent years since my diagnosis, around 5 years, my relationship with God has strengthened and the faith has been a real comfort for me.\n\nI have dealt with a weakened voice for 20 years due to my right vocal fold being paralyzed. It sucks, to barely be able to speak and i am recently half deaf from my vestibular schwannomas. But I have God now, and faith has helped me.", "Started Koselugo for primary PA brain tumor WHO grade 1 - 31 M NF1 patient Summary:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs the title says.  I am 31, male, and have NF1.  I have had zero issues related to NF1 until Dec 2016, where I was diagnosed with a primary brain tumor located in the cerebellum.  Since then I have had 2 brain surgeries, a couple doses of proton radiation, was on Avastin, temodar ( Temozolomide ), gleostine ( Lomustine ), -- roughly all in that order,never doubled up.  Now I am on Koselugo.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started Koselugo on the 1st of the year and so far I have had minimal side effects.  I have some GI issues and I seem to have some sensitive skin or a rash on top of my head (under the hair) but I cannot tell what it looks like and its not much of a bother at this time to have anyone look at it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, thought Id put a post on here and see where it goes.  I will attempt to check this often, but I cant promise I will be too prompt.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am more than happy to answer any questions you may have or hear about some of your own experience that may relate to any of the above. How was insurance. They hesitant to pay? Copay? Hey I would hope to stay in touch with you. It seems we are in fairly similar situations. I am a 30 M and discovered I had a large tumor growing off my spine into my pre-sacral area in July of 2020. Initially it was thought to be severe colon cancer but here we are. \n\nPrior to this discovery I never had any issues related to NF1 I just have a few small CALS spots. \n\nI am currently talking to doctors at MD Anderson about my situation and it looks like I may soon be put on Koselugo as well. \n\nAre there any tests/exams you had to check prior to going on Koselugo? Was there any difficulties in getting the drug with your insurance/pharmacy etc? How frequent are you going in to check for any shrinking of the tumor? And what is your current dosage? &gt;CALS spots\n\nI am  VERY fortunate that I have worked (and am working) for some big fortune 500 type companies.  So luckily I have, so far, had no issues with insurance.  But as soon as I leave, I will probably struggle. &gt;? How frequent are you going in to check for any shrinking of the tumor? And what is your current dosage?\n\nIll try to figure out how to send you a PM and I can get you an email to reach me more reliably. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo answer your questions:\n\nThey recommend an eye exam and an echocardiogram.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think because I work for a bigger company, insurance wasnt an issue AND that I have NF1 and this is a NF1 medication, my doctors at Mayo, had no issues.  They chose the pharmacy for me and I received it in time.   My standard check up is every 2 months, that has been my standard check up for ALL medications, so its not specific to this one.   Dosage, I think, is (45mg?) twice a day. The question for insurance was more if your provider would attempt to deny coverage for any reason. I saw that koselugo is insanely expensive and if my insurance does not cover it, there is no way almost anyone could afford it. \n\n&gt;Dosage, I think, is (45mg?) twice a day.\n\nGotcha, as I understood it, if you do not start to see any shrinking they just up your dosage. Has that been the case for you?\n\nBut it is very re-assuring to hear that your symptoms have been pretty minor. \n\nThis may be too personal of a question, and if you would feel more comfortable you I can PM you instead,\n\nI am not sure if you are planning on having children, but was there any discussion around the impact on your sperm/fertility?

Look for a hair products with no alcohol and no petroleum. Also, you can also use exactly what you use on you skin on your scalp.\n\nShe takes an anti-nauseous medication periodically for the Koselugo side effect.\n\nI hope this helps. &gt;t it is very re-assuring to hear that your symptoms have been pretty minor.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This may be too personal of a q\n\nI started on Jan 1, so no dose change as of yet.

I am wondering what the surgery will be like to remove if it is a quick and outpatient or not Ik had one remover from my upperleg, i had to stay one night. It was a plexiform neurofibroma I had a very large cancerous one removed from my upper leg before. I spent about 5-7 days in the hospital wind them about a week and a half recovering at home. I had my leg removed because of nf lol...coincidentally also the left leg and about six inches above the ankle.\n\n   the doctor is probably the only one who can tell you if it will be outpatient or not..\n\nif they are putting you fully under chances are you will have to stay the night\n\nsurgery is never an enjoyable thing.. (I have had 28 so far)\n\njust do not push push yourself too hard after the procedure I had one removed on my back under local anesthesia and was let home straight after, I think it depends on where it is what it is and all that though. I have got another one scheduled for removal next month, it all depends also expect a bigger scar than you would think just fyi Good luck for next month ! I had a tumor removed behind my knee \nI did not sleep there and I had to stay fully in bed for 1-2 days and about 1 or 2 week for a full recovery I have one behind my knee but they will not operate due to complications from a previous surgery.

So I recently got told I have ibs, have known I have had NF1 since I was 3 weeks old. I have hundreds of tumors and have had numerous surgeries. Well anyways while at the GI dr she palpated my abdomen and I yelped in pain in the upper abdomen area. So she ordered blood work and a ct,MRI. My blood results showed my pancreatic enzymes were well over 4,000 which is very elevated. The CT scan shows a with normal limits looking pancreas. My MRI is next week. She said if it looks normal they need to send me off to specialist to see if I have a tumor somewhere that is causing the issues. But anyways any of you have pancreas issues ?  You could have a tumour on the adrelne gland, I had this surgery five years ago and my pancreatics was affected by the tumour. Good Luck ! Thanks ! Did you have any other symptoms ? Hope you are doing alright now. My doctors are pretty stumped but I plan on mentioning what you said to them to see if we can rule that out.  I have not had any other symptoms since the removal of the tumor, and the test to see if you have the tumor it is a piss one so not very invasive at first. I personally cannot go overboard with certain foods and beer because the pancreas  is  the organ that process that kind of food product. I hope it this helpful, the tumor issues is called pheochromocytoma. Good Luck I hope they find the issue for you. ", "Question about NF1 spots Hi all. I do not have NF but wondering about my stepson. My stepdad has NF1 so I am pretty familiar with it but not really with how it starts out. \n\nStepson is 6 and has had cafe au lait spots since he was little. He is got a big one on his hip and then several other small ones. Maybe 4 total but I am not entirely sure. I told his dad years ago that he needs to watch out because of that being a sign of NF. \n\nMaybe about 3 months ago we noticed some tiny flesh colored raised bumps on him. Very tiny tho. Probably .5cm or less and maybe about 20 total. I thought at first maybe they were just some type of warts. My daughter (not related to him) has some small flat warts on the back of her leg so I thought maybe he got them from her. \n\nWe were looking at them again yesterday and I thought to myself how weird that they are all over his body. Arms, legs, hands and maybe one on the back of his neck and would not they be in one area like my daughter's if they were warts. Then I remembered the cafe au lait spots and it clicked. \n\nI hope that I am just overreacting but I told his dad to make him an appointment to get checked out. My friend whose daughter also has NF1 told me they would have caught it when he was young once the doctor saw the spots. I am not so certain tho because his mom has not really kept up with his care like she should have and why we have him now. \n\nMy stepdad has plenty of raised spots but they are pretty large (diameter of a quarter and maybe 1-2cm high). I do not know if maybe they start out that tiny in the beginning? \n\nThanks for any input. ", "Follow-up from my previous post. So I know that I posted something on here a few days ago that was a bit morbid, and basically just some ramblings about my life and my feelings, but I just wanted to update everyone about my time trying to figure out a solution with the head of neurology and NF center at the mayo clinic. *warning, if you do not want to read a sob story or just do not give a shit, then do not continue reading this because it does not have a good ending.* So, just a reminder, Im a 21 (Male) with severe scoliosis and NF(1), yet despite my extensive health problems and 3 dozen surgeries I lived a relatively normal life and went to college until two years ago when my symptoms (pain, neuropathy, fatigue, etc) got much much worse to the point that I basically stay in my house all day. So, I went to the mayo clinic to find a solution since none of my other doctors seem to know what is going on with me. I was hoping for some good news, or at least no news at all, but what the doctor told me today is basically the worst news someone can get in their entire life. Basically, the doctor said that there is a lot of scar tissue pressing on my spinal cord due to the many spinal surgeries that I had along with my scoliosis. This scar tissue has and will continue to grow and get worse even though I have not had a surgery in two years, and that it is \u201cchocking my spinal cord\u201d to the point that the cord is so thin that it is impossible to see on the scans. I saw the scans myself, and the spinal cord -not the vertebrae- is normal and visible at the top of my neck, but it quickly becomes thinner and thinner until it is so impacted by the scar tissue that the cord itself becomes \u201cnearly invisible\u201d on the scans. He said that my body will continue to deteriorate over the next few months, and maybe a year or two if I am lucky, and that there is nothing that can be done. He never said that I will die in a few months, but in his own words he said \u201cyour body will continue to deteriorate until that is it.\u201d I am terrified, I am basically going to waste away slowly and painfully. The worst part is that my father, who came with me, is acting all happy like nothing happened. Life is fucked up, but I guess now I will soon find out if there is an afterlife or not. Does anyone have any advice as to how I can deal with my imminent demise? Shit man, I am so sorry. I cannot imagine what you are going through, but if it were me in would just start doing things that I want to do before I die. Traveling, going to concerts, talking to someone that can sort out my feelings, or just doing whatever makes you happy. Just go out there and live life to the fullest. I am sorry if this does not help, but feel free to hit me up if you want to talk in private to vent or whatever.  ( has put exactly my thoughts on this. So sorry. same if you need to talk in private or vent please PM. Thanks. I really want to do things that I dreamed of, but my health is already so poor that I can hardly get out of the house.

My next suggestion may be morbid, but once you are ready, it may be helpful.\n\n\nAlthough this choice is rather questionable, you can get medically \"put down\" if you do not want a painful death at the end. Of course, dying is terrible, but some people would rather die than feel so much pain.\n\n\nIt is not a common process, but my mother's therapist (who lives in New York) is suffering from a neuromuscular (I think that is the term) disease that has made her home-bound in the past few months. She can barely walk, and needs help doing anything. Her brain is still in perfect tact, however, and my mom is still visiting her all the time, regardless of the fact that the therapist will not share details, for the patient \"must not worry about their doctor\".\n\n\nThe therapist wants to fly out to Germany (most reliable place where she can get the procedure done) while her body still can take it. She is come to terms with the fact that she will die, and she knows she would rather do it in a way that she knows she will definitely die, and that she dies happy. She does not want to live on life support, not being able to talk, barely being able to breathe. The chest contractions that will hurt, and she does not want to away in pain, feeling so weak and helpless. \n\n\nThe process is a little similar to that \"suicide machine\" that went trending over the summer. You get a bunch of gaseous drugs, ones that make you not feel pain, happy, sleepy, and then, you go. \n\n\nI am not saying you should do this, considering you are young and still have a lot to give and get, but I want you to be aware of all your options. \n\n\nFor now, as any normal person would, I recommend living out as much as you can, but if the emotional and physical pain gets too high, you always have a painless medical way to leave us whilst having family by your side.\n\n\nI hope that in the time that you are alive, perhaps doctors will find a way that they can slow the tissue from growing, or that they can even prevent it completely. Life is good and everything happens for a reason. One thing that will answer your question (is there an afterlife or not) is smoke DMT. That has the answer to why this awful thing is happening to you. Trust me, you will gladly except death after it.\n\nEdit- since you are pretty much bedridden watch this whole video. Your life has meaning do not let this shut you down. Life is short and you will be going back to where we all came from. I hope this can make a difference. You can still make an imprint on this life.  Praying for you, man What has helped me with my own fear of death was Eckhart Tolles book Stillness Speaks :( Especially chapter 9, which is about death: \"When you walk though a forest that has not been tamed and interfered with by man, you will see not only abundant life around you, but you will also encounter fallen trees and decaying trunks, rotting leaves and decomposing matter at every step. Wherever you look, you will find death as well as life. Upon closer scrutiny, however, you will discover that the decomposing tree trunk and rotting leaves not only give birth to new life, but are full of life themselves. Microorganisms are at work. Molecules are rearranging themselves. So death is not to be found anywhere. There is only the metamorphosis of life forms. What can you learn from this? Death is not the opposite of life. Life has no opposite. The opposite of death is birth. Life is eternal.\"\n\nAnother that has helped me is Adyashanti: Death the essential teachings (\n\nI also sent you PM! Thanks.

You may be facing what I consider a fate worse than death which is a deterioration of the spinal cord which may leave you as a quadriplegic I believe is the term basically paralyzed from the neck down but competent and aware of your own helplessness. If life is precious enough for you then you may consider this good news and I would suggest reaching the subject with your doctors and clarifying just what it is they are trying to say. Good luck to you and I wish the best to you! I am sorry to hear what happening to you. Life sometimes just throws you a curve ball sometimes.

Anyone have any removed from their face?\nI have two which are starting to make me feel extremely insecure but I am scared to have surgery on my face. I have had large tumors removed from my right leg, right arm and spinal cord. If the tumor on your face are bothering you, you first must speak with your doctor about it, removing these types of tumors is no easy task and usually they are only removed if it becomes necessary because of pain, could cause health issues or have become cancerous. They would also be best to be removed by a surgeon who knows what they are doing and are familiar with Neurofibromatosis. I do have small tumors on my forehead and side of my head, along with a ping pong ball sized tumor below my ear on my face. We are keeping an eye on those. I am getting one removed on my arm in November. It will be the first one I ever get removed. It is fairly large, tho it causes me no problems other than cosmetic reasons or it hurts if I bump or injure it. I am just tired of people asking me what is on my face in disgust and ask why I dint get it removed. Or ask what that lump on my arm is. and I do not want to wear short sleeves anymore I am constantly covering myself up. I used to have more body confidence but now I put on as many layers as possible. Have not worn a dress all summer. Only jeans and sweaters. The one on my face is more for cosmetic purposes rather than a problem. \n\nI have just been more insecure than ever this last little while that is its becoming overwhelming. Been really down on myself and Idk how to fight it. \n\nI hate how the world points out all your flaws and imperfections first. I play poker professionally and so many people on the table say \"eww what is that on your face\" \"get it removed\" ... Like come on people, no \"nice smile\" or \"you have pretty eyes\" but wow I see your flaw why do you have flaws.\n\nDoes the one on your ear cause you hearing problems?\nI am begining to suspect that there is one growing on the inside of my war because I am seeing a large bump forming that is blocking my hearing. My specialist appointment is in 6 months. Docs keep saying its allergies but it does not make sense. I can feel something inside. Yes I have had them removed from my face before. How honest do you want me to be about the operation? If we are talking about just the small lumps, I have had a couple of small \"below-the-skin\" kind in my forehead removed through ( TL;DR, focused AM radio waves makes the cells shrivel up. In my case I had to get pricked with a small needle that acted as the antenna, so that left a *very* minute scar, but apart from the prick itself there was no pain at all. If you have the \"in-skin\" fibromas, those can be done too, but will leave small burn scars where the fibromas were removed. For small lumps, this is probably the quickest and easiest method out there with the least amount of scarring involved. **Radiofrequency ablation**\n\nRadiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a medical procedure in which part of the electrical conduction system of the heart, tumor or other dysfunctional tissue is ablated using the heat generated from medium frequency alternating current (in the range of 350\u2013500 kHz). RFA is generally conducted in the outpatient setting, using either local anesthetics or conscious sedation anesthesia. When it is delivered via catheter, it is called radiofrequency catheter ablation.\n\nTwo important advantages of radio frequency current (over previously used low frequency AC or pulses of DC) are that it does not directly stimulate nerves or heart muscle and therefore can often be used without the need for general anesthetic, and that it is very specific for treating the desired tissue without significant collateral damage.Documented benefits have led to RFA becoming widely used during the 21st century.\n\n***\n\n^( ^| ( ^| ( ^| ( ^| (   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28 My hearing is fine, so no issues right now. The tumors that were on my right leg and arm were cancerous so that is why I had those removed. And the one on my cervical spine were pressing against it, I could have woken up one day unable to move. Unfortunately after about 12 years the tumors have grown back, but are not pressing against my spine, so we are keeping an eye on that right now too.\nI have not had any tumors removed for cosmetic reason, but I can I understand some wanting to. I have not because usually insurance will not cover it and most surgeons do not want to remove these tumors unless it become necessary because of the difficultly, risk of damaging the nerves and because unfortunately these tumors can grow back over time.\n\nI do not really have an issue with people asking. I was born with a lazy right eye, so I guess I am just more used to it. No one really made a big deal out of it in school, there may have been little kids while I was out and about shopping or eating somewhere that wondered what was up. It was not until I went to college that my right eye became a big deal, some people called be a druggie or assumed I was on drugs. So I much rather have people ask me about my eye and the bumps on my body, rather than them coming to their own conclusion about me. \n\nI hope your surgery goes well. I would like to know as much as possible! I am not squeemish Wow I did not know that existed I thought it was a cut it out type of thing Sorry to hear your tumours grew cancerous. There is so much I did not know about this condition till I came on reddit and read people's experiences. There is lots doctors did not tell me. They just said do not worry about it and sent me home. But I did not know all the stuff I had to look out for like it becoming cancer or growing on the spine possible. Lots of people talk about pain too or balance issues and issues during pregnancy. I really wish my doctors informed me more of what to look out for so I could be careful and at least know what to expect. I will probably have to look for a new specialist. You must be in the states if you have to pay for removals and procedures. I am sorry to hear that. Really unfair how expensive it is over there. And thank you for the well wishes! I am in the United States, thankfully I have a great specialist and great surgeons who removed the tumors. My insurance does cover needed surgeries, but when it is cosmetic in most cases insurance will not cover that. I had one removed around 2002/3 (actually cannot remember only going off a few years after my last spinal operation) \n\nThe operation was a major risk. Due to the plexiform been full of blood vessels. I lots a lot of blood (all the blood in my body and more so needed a major transfusion.  I also react badly to general anaesthetic.\n\nAlso when working on the face there is a few mussels which control your expression these can be damaged.  Luckily these when not damaged.\n\nI also lost a little hearing in on ear and now get ear infection all the time.\n\nBut the operation was a success which was good news.  The pain from it is awful all the pain meds could not touch it but in the long run it was worth it, even the spinal operation I had awake was no where as bad (only had it awake so I did not need to fast, plus it was just fitting a halo) \n\nI am in the long process at the moment starting to ask if they will remove another from my face the side they did not do. Was the radiofrequency ablation successful in removing/killing the fibroma? I am scheduled to have another 4 removed next week, I have already had about 12 removed in the past, but am still covered in 500+ fibromas.....I am not exaggerating. Oh that is really good then! I hope I find a good specialist. Been very dissapointed with docs in my area Yeah, it can be tough to find one, especially when it is a rare condition. I hope you find one who can help you Wow I did not know that suck a small bump can be such a hassle. Glad to hear you are ok and the operation was a success.\nThat is why I am scared to do anything on my face. I do not want to damage muscles and I am scared it might grow back. I could live with a scar.\nLost hearing from the bump removal on the face? Mine is rather a large complex case.  This will show you how mine is. This is a project I started this year.  Wow I am so sorry to see you are going through this man. Are you looking into getting it removed or would it be too dangerous to perform such an operation?\nIt baffles me how not more reaserch can be done on this to prevent it and to help such cases etc Most of them are on your chest and back? If you do not mind me saying, other that the big one, your face is remarkably fibroma free, or am I mistaken? Oh yeah. A few from the face, but quite a few from the head. Some were cosmetic, some were practical (difficult to shave), others were medical (they hurt, were itchy or were located on a spot that annoyed me) Yes, the vast majority. my plexiform are very large, most bumps and fibromas are small in most cases, but NF is different in everyone. The loss of earing is only slight and when I am ill or have an ear infection also I have heard to live with it. I am going to ask about removing but would be a dangerous operation, I know from my last one. I have ones on my chest and a few on my back around the shoulder blades and inside my body around my spine and lungs. Yes, I have NF1, with a large tumour on my face. I have had multiple surgeries on my face throughout high school and college. It is lessened now cause I am older. I only get them if they obstruct my breathing. \n\nMay I ask what are you feeling insecure about the surgery you are going to have?", "Suicide Anyone else with NF ever have these thoughts. No, I could never bring that kind of hurt and suffering to my family. It would be selfish. No matter how much it sucks, or how much pain I am in or how much I have gotten tired of the surgeries, doctors, and MRIs, I could never do that. My family means too much to me to ever do that to them. But has it ever thought of it I have thought of what it would do to my family. Hey, friend. There is hope. Suicide prevention line, in US:  1-800-273-8255. If you are not in the US, find someone to call. It is not worth it. Yes I have Yes. But it was not linked to my NF, at least not directly. \n\nLife can be a major grind even without NF. Politics, world events...fuckin covid. It is a lot to take. And then you see yourself naked in the mirror and you think \"and then there is this shit to deal with.\" It can truly make it all that much more overwhelming.\n\nI do believe I have never been 100% because of it, even after finding happiness elsewhere in life. But I just try to make the best of it. And I am lucky to have a mostly mild case. Yeah, I do not think I could actually do it, but I have thoughts like this every day.\n\nI just try to ignore it, focus on things that I like, and think about that I will die one day anyways. So I might as well just keep living and see what happens. unfortunately yes,  Please remember you are not alone. This site has a list of hotlines for many countries. If you are in need please call your countries number.  You are important and loved. \n\n( In short if I am being honest yes. But I could never put my family and friends through the mess I would leave behind. They are some great services if your needing someone to talk to Samaritans in the UK there is a shout text service for when you cannot say the words that service did save my life last year. \n\nIf you do not have anyone you cannot reach out too or cannot say the words maybe write it down and hand it to someone\n\nOr write is down then tear it up and then burn the notes.\n\nIf you want someone to talk to in private you can PM me. I do not think I would ever follow through with it, but yeah I have thought about it alot over the years. people with NF are 4 times more likly to commit sucide than the general population. NF does not cause suicide thoughts per se. However, I think low self-esteem and other emotional problems are very common for people who suffer from unpredictable conditions. \n\nI would say it is very important not to make NF the centre of your whole identity - It is somethin completely out of your control and not something to blame yourself for. You should consider seeing a therapist or maybe start by calling a suicide hotline. The main reason not to take your own life is not \"family\" or \"friends\" because your life is **your** life and you are not living it for anyone but you. The main reason not to take **your own** life is that **you** can still **improve yourself**. You can become a better version of **yourself** and you can overcome **your** negative emotions.\n\nI would suggest you keep a journal. Anytime a negative thought or emotion pops up, your write it down. How it feels. Where it started and what triggered it. Ask yourself what the emotion would tell you if it could talk. Does this emotion have a voice? Is it your voice? What is the voice like, judging or maybe condescending?\n\nThis is a great way of noticing patterns which you can work with and an even better way of getting to know yourself and your mind. Every day, my friend. I hope everything is okay. Live life one second at a time. Close your eyes and breathe. Make sure to treat yourself often. Most importantly... Fight those thoughts. I promise you will be stronger in the long run. There is something Or someone out there waiting for you. Yes.  Bringing a child into the world knowing they might be born with NF is cruel, and I wish that my parents had not made that selfish decision.", "Radiation Exposure? Hi all,\n\nI have schwannomatosis and have heard from a few doctors to avoid radiation as it can cause benign tumors to turn malignant/cancerous. Has anyone else come across this? How do you deal with x-rays at the dentist (the radiation level is very low, but it is a scary location of the body to be taking a risk with)? Any insight would be helpful. I was always under the impression that it meant for more major procedures like gamma knife surgery or radioactive iodine treatment. Hey,\n\nSo I can give a bit of insight from the NF-1 perspective.  Quick genetics lesson - we all, at conception, inherit one of each chromosome from our mother and father (except males get one X and one Y).  This gives is genetic redundancy - we have two copies of every gene.\n\nThe ( says that both copies of a tumor suppressor gene must undergo mutation for a tumor to form.  The NF-1 gene is a tumor suppressor.\n\nSo in theory - anyone can get a neurofibroma.  They just need both copies of NF-1 ***in the same cell*** to become mutated.  This is of course very unlikely for a \"genetically normal\" person.  Even though all of us accumulate cellular mutations daily, the average human has 30 trillion cells - it would be unlikely for both copies of the same gene in the same cell to become mutated.\n\nHowever, those of us with NF-1 are born with one copy of NF-1 already mutated in all of our cells.  This means any hit to the second copy of NF-1 in any of our cells is the \"second hit\" required for a neurofibroma to form.\n\nRadiation causes cellular mutations - thus the recommendation to avoid radiation whenever possible.  ( is a comic, but also a handy guide at how much radiation is in certain procedures, events, etc. This is correct but only in terms of radiation therapy, which is a very high level of radiation. From what I know, it is still a valid concern, however as radiation treatment gets more and more focused, the concerns are getting less and less.\n\nOne other possible consequence of radiation therapy is that if the tumor regrows and they want to do a traditional tumor removal, an irradiated tumor can be more difficult to remove.\n\nAll that being said, this really only applies to the very high doses. Still I try to be cautious. Mention it to your dentist or x-ray technician, and they can probably provide some additional protection. As long as you are not being exposed to x-rays on a regular basis though, I do not think it is a huge concern. Another NF-1 perspective as someone who has had their fair share of X-rays, MRIs, and even the gamma knife....I have not had any issues. The dentist really is such a low level that it really is not too much of a concern.  It is not like it is a constant thing, it is either a once a year or every other year thing. \n\nI had the gamma knife to actually kill off a benign tumour in my brain and it did kill it off so now it is just an air bubble up there. If you were going into areas with high levels of radiation then it would be an issue, but that should not be anything, especially since it is only directed at the teeth. Fun fact, MRIs are radiation free! I have Neurofibromatosis and been told that radiation from chemo can cause problems with the types of tumors from Neurofibromatosis and that it would only be done is absolutely necessary. Any radiation from MRIs and xrays is pretty minor. I have mri yearly that are ordered by my Neurofibromatosis specialist.", "Two perks of having NF 1.) it would be much more difficult to break into our Face ID\u2019s \n\n2.)

I get a lot of brain MRIs so my dad always jokes that if somebody told me I did not have a brain I could say I have pictures to prove them wrong. Whenever I am losing an argument with my brother, I tell him he is being ableist and discriminating against me because I have a brain tumor. I do this ironically, if that isnt clear.

(I was asked to do it years ago but it was still in early stages).\nI am scared to do it. Back a few months ago i went to Manchester to have a talk with them, which apparently have 11 years of experience using it to treat nf. They were very confident in the drug's ability to \"buy time\", the only big downside that they saw with it is the fact that you cannot have any surgery while under the treatment I was not aware of not being allowed to have surgery while taking it, I saw a neurologist in the USA that was keen to get patients on the trail, but this was going on 15 years ago and I was not ready. I guess one of my big fears is that the medication is traditionally a chemotherapeutic drug and I worry about the side effects. \nWill it dissolve tumours that have already developed? I have ready so much and come up with different opinions. I know it is now FDA approved but it is not on the Australian PBS (yet). \nDo you think you would take this medication. Oh, i just checked because it did not add up and it turns out that i actually confused the names selumetinib with bevacizumab. They mentioned both to me but only went into detail with bevacizumab (avastin), so what i wrote does not apply for your case. I am very sorry for that. bevacizumab is what I spent 6 months on last year. One treatment every other week for 12 treatments. MRI's before and after showed no change. I will have more MRI's in 6 more months. In my case it unfortunately did not help So a quick summary for you:\n\n- seems like 70% of patients experience between 20-60% reduction in existing plexiform neurofibroma size\n\n- the other 30% see a cessation in growth\n\n- side effects exist but are typically more mild than traditional chemotherapy\n\n- the drug is showing a lot of promise for cutaneous neurofibromas and optic glioma as well I was taking trametinib for about 8 months and MRI indicated there was no change (so no shrinkage) for my plexiform. I stopped taking it earlier this year and waited for the FDA approval of selumetnib. Now that it is approved my neurologist is working on prescribing it for me.  \n\nSelumetinib and trametinib are similar drugs with similar side-effects and outcomes for NF paitents. From what I understand, neither drug is for all who has NF--they specifically target plexiform neurofibromas, so NF patients who do not have plexiforms will not be able to take selumetinib.  \n\nI can say that it took a great deal of effort and tests to get cleared to even have the chance to acquire trametinib. Most important, I think, is the potential for a serous side effect involving the heart. I needed MRIs, cardio-echo, and blood work before my neurologist could seek prior-authorization from my insurance. Other side effects vary from patient to patient, but most common, I think, is rash. Having gone through all that last year, I just needed 1 quick cardio-echo for selumetinib, hopefully then insurance approval is not far ahead. This is still in drug trials from what I know. Oh, do not even worry! Does the medication has different names depending on location? I was asked about the avastin trail, but read the one I mentioned was ready and approved. It is all confusing. Perhaps we could talk a little more about this. \nHave to return to work. Would this be enough for anyone on this forum to take this medication It is only approved for use in the United States for those with plexiform neurofibromas.\n\nOver the coming months I would expect more countries to also approve the drug. I would be an ideal candidate.  But since I know longer live in the United States, or have insurance that would cover anything related to even seeing a doctor if I were to visit. \nI do not know if I could join a clinical trail in my country now to try and get on the medical anyway. \n\nThank you for replying.

Got diagnosed at late 24, I am 28 now. Details in comments  Lost my hearing, had to quit my \"dream career\", had a dozen surgies, had a failed cochlear implement. Failed ABI, VP SHUNT replaced after malfunctioning and the new one rejected by my body and I spent two weeks in the ICU with staph infection in my head. Have to use a walker and during one of the surgies I got brain damage. My hand shakes and I have decreased sensation on my whole left side, (Yay facial palsy joining in) I try to stay positive but these last three years have not made it easy. How do I do this for the rest of my life? I am tired. And I just got word that my nf doctor that I see is not covered by my Medicare anymore", "itchy butt ", "Have you ever experienced discrimination in the workplace related to NF? If so, how did you navigate it? Hi, 22/f, NF1 here. My NF mostly manifests in the form of a short height, scoliosis, chronic pain, and a handful of fibromas throughout my body. I am a recent college graduate and I am currently looking for entry-level work in my field.\u00a0(Psychological technician at a drug rehabilitation center.) The position\u00a0I was applying for required a high school degree at most and no prior\u00a0experience, so I thought I had a good shot at getting it.\u00a0About 2 weeks ago I had the\u00a0interview, which left a sour taste in my mouth and made some memories of workplace discrimination reemerge.\u00a0\n\n\nAs is custom for all of my interviews, I told the employer \"I acknowledge that I am petite (4'10, 85 lbs for those wondering) and, oftentimes my size restricts me from reaching high objects and lifting things that are too heavy. Would you be able to provide accomodations like a step-stool and help in lifting things?\" The vibe in the room changed. The interviewer gave me a spiteful reply in a very rude tone, and our talk was soon cut short. As I was being led out of the room to leave, the interviewer said to me \"you are so small, everyone is going to think you are a client.\"\u00a0\n\n\nRight... The way I was made to feel in that room reminded me of some  past\u00a0positions. I have been screamed at for being unable to lift things that weigh more than my total body weight\u00a0and I have had coworkers purposefully\u00a0put tools &amp;\u00a0my personal belongings in places I cannot reach. I have had a few managers who are understanding and 'help' me where it is needed, but mostly my needs have been met with ire and contempt.\n\n\n\u00a0I have always done my job well and I ensure to speak openly and honestly about my needs with employers from the get-go, but I am afraid that the simple act of ASKING for necessary accomodations tarnishes my working relationships and makes me look unemployable. I have learned to let these poor experiences roll off my back and consider it to be a 'litmus test' for a toxic work culture, but damn. I need a job to live and eat.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0So... I suppose my questions for you all is how do you advocate for yourself in the workplace? What are your experiences with workplace discrimination? Should I omit asking for accomodations in my interviews altogether? What do?\u00a0 You need to assert your dominance in the workplace and be more entitled. I am pissed off that this happened to you. If you are a woman, you should wear heals, I highly recommend it. And next time, do not even ask. Tell them you need this and that you are a hard worker. \n\nDo not ask for accommodations, demand them. Be entitled, and be stern. ESPECIALLY if ur a woman. Also next time this happens to you, tell them you have a neurological disorder and ur offended that they would treat you like this and threaten them to expose them/sue them. You have to be harsh with people. I understand you may be shy, I am too and I would never think of doing this but reading your experience has given me an realization that we NF1 folks and other disabled people should NOT take bullshit from anyone. \n\nYou should have a \u201cdont fuck with me\u201d mentality and live with that. You are completely right. I suppose I am so used to being the smallest person in every room that this 'smallness' seeps into my personality and I have a hard time making demands and being firm. I have no problem fighting tooth &amp; nail to advocate for others, but when it comes to fighting for myself I have the tendency to shut down and accept mistreatment. I need to learn to direct that same fighting energy towards myself. Thank you for your insight! Me too, trust me. I am exactly the same but please force yourself. Step out of your comfort zone. You deserve to be treated as an equal to everyone else. If it is going to take you being mean and being more demanding then so be it. I have adhd and social anxiety. It is hard for me to stand up for myself but it is something that I am going to have to learn how to do. We are women, women with a neurological condition going into the workplace. People will try to fuck with us because we are vulnerable, and we cannot let that happen. yikes.\n\nI cannot believe they are the same people who are supposed to help addicts get back on their feet.\n\nThey suck big time. You are too good for them.\n\nYou should definitely let them know that you have a neurological disorder and their comments are rude, offensive, and unacceptable.\n\nDo not forget that the best things come in small packages. I thought the same thing... Having experienced addiction and  years of recovery myself, I got the weird vibe that the management does not care for evidence-based treatment. If they treat a potential employee like that in the first few minutes of meeting me, I do not want to imagine how they treat their clients. On the chance that they call me back I am going to mention that rude comment and tell them I am passing on their offer. Sounds like a case for ADA Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, you are entitled to reasonable accommodations. You should absolutely be granted any accommodations you request. They will make your job easier. You really are not asking for that much so I am not sure why they had an issue.\n\nAlso, do not let them be rude to you. NF affects everyone differently and it is not your fault about which cards you were dealt. It is clear that you have a strong work ethic and all employers should praise that. Not really because she cannot prove that one they knew it was a disability, by her own account she only told them she was small, unless they know she has a disability they are not required to provide accommodations.  Not only that but to be able to prove the reason behind not getting a job being a disability is beyond difficult, hell im in the middle of a lawsuit and it is hard as hell and I was literally told it was due to what they seen as a disability. Fuck them. This is discrimination and honestly as someone who deals with workplace injuries his response is boarding on illegal. The employer is always supposed to make accommodations for safety. \n\nNext time do not ask , demand it ! That is the only advice I can give you , sorry.\n\nI know what its like I am 5'0 and people have got snarly at me when I said I could not lift things /reach things in retail. I have attempted to report that I have a disability before to a workplace so I can get accomodations, but I could not get any of my medical documents for 'proof' from my healthcare providers. I was diagnosed with NF1 when I was a few years old but I have not been able to afford/receive any healthcare in about 10 years, and I live about 1900 miles away now from my provider that diagnosed me, so I cannot exactly walk in and get physical copies.\n\n Do you have any idea what I have to do in order to get the documentation as proof of my disability? I mean, you would think employers would be able to piece together that I cannot lift things that weigh 50 lbs more than I do just by looking at me. I am sorry you have to deal with this bullshit too, we are in this together! \ud83d\ude42 Honestly you should be able to call the provider and ask for copies they might require you to email, documents proving its you due to HIPPA but you are entitled to your medical records.\n\nsomething to note I would not use NF1 as your call to disability use the Scoliosis, as I do not think NF1 is a recognized disability because of the wide range of affect it has on people. also when you go to file be ready for a drawn out case I have been at mine for going on 2 years !!! Thank you for the help! It makes a lot more sense to claim scoliosis over NF1. Your side completely makes sense, too-- I have waited to ask for accomodations until after I have gotten a job, but that did not work out well for me, either. It feels like a lose-lose situation no matter how I go about it, and my well-being is dependent on whether or not management is feeling empathetic.\n\nI wish I could afford to see an occupational therapist &amp; seek a healthcare professional so I can have things documented, but I am afraid I cannot afford those kinds of services.\n\nI have been sending out applications to a number of places lately, but I have not been getting any bites... Even though my education, research, and years of volunteering qualifies me for these positions, finding a job at the moment is bleak &amp; it is taking a toll on my esteem. I do not know if I should keep searching for a place that is in line with my field, or hold off &amp; settle for a temporary coffee shop job. \ud83d\ude30\n\nAnyway, thank you for your input &amp; sorry if I rambled a bit. I lost my favorite job Tuesday due to my NF related communication issues. All I needed was to be told one time what my responsibilities are. I cannot do cues and I most definitely cannot read your mind.   \n\nI hate that this happened to you. I hate that for *you!!*  I am so sorry to hear you lost your favorite job. Feel free to message me if you need to vent or talk about it. And to go for SSI for disability you really really need a lawyer.  Lawyers fees are capped at a low rate for SSI cases and they can take it out of your $ award, so no out of pocket but it is a complicated, drawn out process for anyone who is not terminally ill, and they will decline several times before granting a hearing.   Seriously, get an SSI lawyer.  \nAND, in the meantime apply for medicAID in your state to get health coverage right away.  That is typically a simple and speedy process.  Good luck! Like u/copyingerror I am in a hiring role.   I will echo the same advice.  Do not ask for accommodations in the interview.  It is next to impossible to successfully prove that you were discriminated against in a hiring decision.   Once you have a new position, I would still wait to ask until a situation came up that required accommodation.  (Unless the job description outlines something specific that you know you will need accommodation for.) \nOnce you are in the job you will have a legal right to accommodation.  As u/copyingerror pointed out, you will need documentation of a disability for the employer to be required to accommodate.  I would also add that when you request accommodation you need to do it in writing (email works) so that you can prove your request if necessary.   If at your next job you do not receive accommodation despite the above, speak to HR.  They are the ones that understand the legal implications that managers may not.  \nAs for your recent interview, I am sorry you had that experience.  But, obviously you dodged a bullet!  Who would want to work there?!?\nGood luck in your job search.  It is a tough moment for anyone to be looking for work, so do not be too hard on yourself. Thank you for all the help, really. This comment outlines all the steps I need to take in an easy, straightforward manner.  I am going to apply for Medi-Cal soon and hopefully be able to get some more treatment and proof of disability. \n\nI have updated my linkedin and have been applying to about 10 different positions each day-- I got a promising phone screening session yesterday and the person on the other line had some glowing things to say about my experience, so fingers crossed it will lead somewhere. I have been feeling a little mopey and directionless from my initial interview, plus the fact that I just graduated into a clusterfuck shitshow nightmare recession. \ud83e\udd74 \n\nGo easy on yourself as well.

I know they are available in the states but do not think they have approval in the UK yet and I cannot see it happening for years.

I have always known my mother had a simple \"skin condition\" causing some bumps, but I had no idea that implications of this disease until I was diagnosed with it. My mother has no symptoms other than a some bumps on her arms and chest. No hearing loss or other problems. My mother's always had a optimistic, unconcerned outlook on her NF2. She last had an MRI in roughly 2002, so I do not know if she has additional tumors. \n\nWhen I told my doctor my mom has NF2, my doctor became very concerned, which lead me to finally look into the disease. Prior to this, I just thought NF2 was aesthetic. I now realize I am wrong. \n\nEverything I am reading is terrifying, and not consistent with what I see in my mother. Does my mother's relatively healthy life have any implications for my future with NF2? How about the fact that I am 29 (almost 30) and still have excellent hearing and no other obvious issues? \n\nBecause I inherited this from my mother, am I guaranteed to have the same type of NF2 mutation as her? I read  ( which suggests there is  major mortality differences depending on the type of mutation (truncating, splice-site, missense, mosiac?). Can I assume since she is getting older and still doing just fine that I will have a similar experience/life-span?\n\nMy doctor wants me to see a neurologist and to get an MRI.

I had chronic back pain and painful tumors, etc. Something that is helped me immensely was going vegetarian (pescatarian on special/cultural events). It started out as an accident (broke college student do not want to pay extra for meat) but I found that the chronic back pain, pain from the tumors all went away. I have also noticed my tumors actually shrunk and stopped spread (at least that i know of). Not guaranteeing that this will work for you but just wanted to share what is helped me! \n(also smoking weed) A clinical trial had dietary intervention for 6 months and showed improvement. \n\n( \n\nSo your personal experience is relevant. \n\nIn addition to diet, it might be worth having a look at ketotifen. We talk about it here ( Wow! Glad going vegetarian helped you and your health! That is awesome! Thanks for the info! Been meaning to go on a diet and I want to cut out red meat completely. I have a problem with sugar and definitely need to cut back a lot. Found a website that has a \u2018Mediterranean diet grocery list\u2019 with food suggestions so definitely going to bring that to the grocery store with me This really helped me too.

It is been really tough for me the past 1-2 years\n\nHave you talked to your doctor about Koselugo/Selumtinib? Has you neuologist/oncologist discussed one of the newer medications for shrinking tumors? Also all plexiform tumors want sugar so try and starve your tumors. At the CTF annual conference this year, it was confirmed T-cells are needed for tumour initiation, so limiting/lowering inflammation could only be beneficial. We know which food raise inflammation (processed food , sweet food, fried food, processed meats, alcohol, ....) and which foods lower inflammation, vegetables, spices and herbs, fruits, ...\n\nIn addition to T cells, other cells of the immune system respond to inflammation, such as mast cells. Neurofibromas are mostly made of mast cells. Ketotifen I mention above is a mast cells stabiliser. \n\nDrugs are being trialled for the plexiform and the very severe neurofibromas cases, but while we wait, we can try and see if reducing inflammation with diet combined with or without ketotifen might help preventing  more neurofibromas from occurring. \n\nOP, have a chat with your doctor about trying for a couple of months to have a preventative approach to NF1 and see if the rate of increase slows down. No guarantee it might not work, every body is different, but no harm in trying. I am 37f and totally understand your concerns. I was diagnosed at around 15 and I only had one area of tumor then. Now I have pea sized lumps under the skin of my torso (basically on my ribs), down my spine, my left armpit/boob, my right bicep which hurts the majority of the time and my right thigh. The smaller ones bother me the most as they are noticible when I do not have a top on and it makes me feel very self conscious. I also have bumps on top of my skin on my chest and neck which I really hate as feel like people just stare at them I am F/32\n\nI do not have that many. I had 5 small ones on my face that I had removed and I have had 5 more recently  removed on my arms. I have noticed I have more on my butt/ lower back..

Going To mention it to them when I have my appointment. I have mainly all plexiform fibromas so definitely going to cut out the sugar. I eat too much of it honestly. Been trying to avoid red meat and overly processed food, too. Thank you, it is appreciated! Sometimes I just feel like another species. Like some kind of monster. It is surreal living a life where beauty comes before personality in a lot of ways. The idea of body positivity does not resonate with me as how can I be positive about having over 2000 tumors on my body. It is very isolating but helps to know that there are people who can see the person behind the masses. I also often feel like another version of a human, and not in a good way. Lots of hugs to you.

I am 22 and have a singular neurofibroma; not everyone with NF gets one or gets a lot of them. One time when they tend to develop more frequently is during hormone changes like puberty or pregnancy. I was diagnosed at around 16 months My child was born with tiny tumors. She did not have the genetic testing u til she was nine. Have they grown since then  or stayed the same? Hi, she is an adult now, and the tumors did not to be removed until she was a teenager. She has taken mek-inhibitors, as they became available. We never allowed her condition to be an excuse for bad behavior nor was she ever referred to as a hero. She is just a person born with an uncurable condition so we try to make sure she gets to fully experience life. I would contract the organization in Grand Rapids, they are awesome.  If you do not live close they can hopefully link you to the one closer to where you live. I actually go to University of Chicago and have been for many years. It was recommended by the Grand Rapids NF clinic at that time when I needed to see someone that I go to Chicago instead of them. Both places are pretty much the same distance for me and they told my pediatrician that it would be better for me to go to Chicago. Not to scare but, some of then increase from birth. I had a tiny one on my breast, and over time it grew and when I turned 14 I had to get it surgically removed. But it was harmless, and as long as your child is okay with it getting removed then do so. Because remember, it is not your body it is theirs, i was not comfy having male surgeon touching that place", "New here! Hello, just wanted to introduce myself! I am Britt, I am 24 years old and I have NF1. I was diagnosed at birth and my mother has the same condition. I have many small tumors littering my back and stomach but luckily have been spared big tumors on my face. Aside from surface level tumors I have a small tumor on my optic nerve which is degrading my vision. I am very short in stature and have horrible teeth (my dental hygiene is fine just bad genetics.) As well NF, I have Crohn\u2019s disease which they are trying to sort a treatment plan for. I have pretty bad depression and anxiety and would like to connect with some people who know what it is like to have this condition. Hope all is well with everyone! :) Hey! Nice to meet you.  I have NF1 I wore braces for 5 years in my 20s my teeth were overcrowded. Baby teeth didnt fall out.  nice to meet you Britt. I have had it all my life and I am happy with what life has given me hi britt! nice to meet you. i am 28f and have lived with NF my whole life. i also inherited it from my mother.  Glad to hear that! Trying to get to that mindset myself. It is not easy but baby steps, right? :) Look up phage therapy for your crohns condition ", "Getting a large number of cutaneous neurofibromas removed I am a 24M (on parents insurance for another 1.5yrs) and I have always been self conscious of my appearance (and voice - this is a huge). \n\nWithout getting too deep on my mental tribulations, I have started to care of my myself, get in shape, etc. but.... I still have a large number of neurofibromas on my chest (20&lt;50), some on my neck (5-8), and some on my arms (4). \n\nAll of the easily visible ones are pea-blueberry sized (there are some that are very small and look more like ache scars all over my chest). \n\nMy question is besides learning to \u201clove\u201d or accept the ones on my chest what are my best options to get them removed (I will note I am planning on meeting with a dermatologist in Seattle hopefully EoY). \n\nI cannot say the ones on my chest are causing any medical risk (or irradiation unless I hit/rub one). \n\nTo be honest I am not too concerned with pain or discomfort (not to an extent that I would hurt myself) I really just want them off; scar is fine I guess as long as it does not result in a huge bump/lump. \n\nAny recommendations? Is this most likely something that will be out of pocket? Any way for them to remove all most of them?\n\nCheers If you want them fully removed and do not want them to grow back in the same spot I would suggest getting them \"cut out at the root/nerve.\" You have to find a good doctor that knows about NF and neurofibromas. Talk to them about exactly what you want. Some only \"shave them off the top\" which leave less of a scar, but they can grow back because it was not cut off from the nerve itself. Some dermatologists are not familiar with this procedure. Some are. I just had some taken off by a dermatologist and she was great. Make sure you get a consultation and talk to the doctor and explain your concerns. The first one you see may not be a perfect fit. Getting them cut off at the nerve will give more of a scar and longer healing time. On mine I have noticed the healing time and scar size seems to depend on the location of, size, and how deep the neurofibromas were. If you have any questions let me know. Also, payment just depends on your insurance and the codes the doctor you go to uses. They a will likely give you a consultation first anyways and you can ask for these codes and contact your insurance about how much they would cover. Thanks so much for your quick response! I am hoping the dermatologist I go to is a good one (recommended by my NF team) but the point about getting them taken off at the nerve is not something I had even thought about - great advice! I think the comment above says it all but from my personal experience I wanted to remove some cutaneous neurofibromas that are on my head ( You see it either if I have a middle part or a side part ). The doctor tried to remove it but it regrew. The doctor did not want to try again since with the operating on the head can impact the growth of hair.\n\nSo my advice would really be to ask your doctor of all the consequences post surgery and how confident they feel about the removal. On my side I was upset when it grew bigger so knowing it in advance might have impacted my decision. You are welcome. Just get all the information you need and questions answered before committing. I will clarify that when you get them off at the nerve they should not grow back in that exact spot (since the nerve is cut) but of course can grow all around that area still. A lot of times when people only get them \"shaved\" off the top of the skin, they just grow back right on top of where they were taken, same size and all. I felt relief just getting the ones off I did permanently, even if I have others growing, because I know those will not grow back. Some people prefer having them just shaved off because there is no scar and they do not mind that they will likely grow back. It is just a preference. I have had my tumors removed with a dermatologist that knows NF1.  Look up on the internet, or call first before you make appointment. If they do not  are not familiar with NF1 ask them if they could possibly give you a referral to a dermatologist. You are best options would be to speak with your doctor or Neurofibromatosis specialist. I have tumors all over my body, including a last mass on my right leg that is very noticeable, especially during the summer months around the pool. I have only had four surgeries related to my Neurofibromatosis and these were all deemed necessary.\n\nWith these types of tumors doctors and surgeons generally do not want to remove them, unless they are causing pain, in a problematic location or have become cancerous. This is because these tumors can be very difficult to remove, can grow back over time and there is a risk of causing more harm in removing them. The other thing is if they are only being removed for cosmetic reasons, then insurance usually will not cover it.\n\nI suggest you speak with your doctor about what options you may have. You should also be aware that there a fda approved drug that does shrink tumor size. It has only been approved for children, but with the help of your doctor it is possible for an adult to get approval. I will be seeing my specialist on the 20th to discuss the medication as I have already been approved for it.\n\nIf you have questions let me know I have had several procedures to remove neurofibromas over the years and have probably had over 30 removed this way. Out of all of my procedures, maybe 3 neurofibromas have grown back, and these are ones I had removed almost 20 years ago, so I think that is a pretty good success rate. This is just my experience though. \n\nAs others have said, it is important for these really be cut out at the root. I have always had these done by a plastic surgeon. \n\nDepending on the specifics of your insurance benefits, these should be covered. If your insurance denies these for any reason or says it is considered cosmetic, do what you can to fight it and ask the doctor to go fight it as well.\n\n Check out the link below for some tips. \n\n\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that many doctors will limit the amount they will surgically remove at one time, such as maybe 2 or 4 in one sitting. If so, you may need to start with a few and go from there.\n\nThere is a procedure called electeodessication that is used to remove many neurofibromas at once, with electrical impulses, instead of surgery. If you live near a doctor that performs this, it may be worth looking into.\n\nIf removal of these neurofibromas is something you want to do, go for it.  I do not beleive we should have to just live with something that bothers us if we have a way to fix it..\nGood luck. I was going to paste the exact same document which contains all the insurance codes as well as the name of specialised surgeons. \n\nMark, you can cut them off and I would do so while still under insurance.  Check the document, it has EVERYTHING in it. Go to the surgeons 'website and see pictures of before and after. At the very least, check if and how much they would cover. \n\nCan I ask what is wrong with you voice?  Do you have a neurofibroma pushing against your vocal cords? Voice issues in Nf1 have been (poorly) studied and reported. ( Is it something worth investigating since it seems to really affect you?  Maybe your parents' cover will pay for a laryngologist or a speech specialist? This is great! Thanks for the attachment, beyond useful to have in my back pocket. Already had one instance where insurance did not cover my visit properly, but I can go in at least more prepared. Fascinating study, I will definitely give it a thorough read!\n\nDo not think there is anything medically wrong with my throat/vocal cords, but tbh no one has ever brought up the correlation. \n\nWhen I was a young kid I was in pre-pre-school (age 3 &amp; 4) specifically for speech therapy as apparently I talked and talked and no one could understand me. Then from age 5~8 (K-3/4gr) I had a speech therapist as a part of my normal schooling. \n\nI struggled very hard (and still do if I am honest) with my \u201cR\u201ds. I have also had numerous experiences with an orthodontist as a way to help with my bone structure. \n\nAs of now, I cannot really describe what my voice sounds like to my ears (w/out being offensive), but in short I hate it, but do t know if there is much to do (or worth the $$) Another paper looked more specifically at the Nf1 speech issues  (  identifying the right issue will allow you to have targeted speech therapy. You will probably have to educate your therapist to the specific of Nf1 \n\nI know you had therapy as a child, but I would give it another go. \n\nIn Australia we have something called a Speech Pathologist who teach people to talk again after surgeries or accidents but they also deal with voice disorders, and apparently there are many . Have a look here on this Australian medical team ( to be able to find out how it is called where you are. \n\nOn this page from the same website, ( , they have a list of common voice disorder, maybe one will sound familiar. \n\nI know, maybe I am going a bit overboard, but you are too young to hate your voice so much. Look into what is wrong and if anything can be done. \n\nI am a militant when it comes to dealing with our Nf1 manifestations. The attitude of the medical professionals is often dismissive with a  it-is-genetic-nothing-can-be-done litany and my personal experience, is that a lot of things can actually be done. I (26 F) had electrodessication to remove about 50-70 small cutaneous fibromas (some on my back, chest, arms, neck, and face) back in October 2020 by a plastic surgeon in Chicago, and my insurance covered whole thing. All but a few are completely gone, and my skin is all smooth now (albeit with some scarring that still looks better than the bumps). I honestly could wear a bikini again, andI do not think anyone would even be able to tell that I have NF1. Your mileage may vary, but I hope you find someone who can help! Oh wow. I did not even know this was a thing. My geneticist told me that removal would just make them grow back, and probably bigger than before. Do you have any resources you could recommend about electrodessication? I am a 21 year old female and I have never, *ever* worn a two-piece bathing suit because the bumps upset me too much. I do not have an exact resource aside from looking at various plastic surgeons\u2019 websites who use the technique. Dr. Weinburg in NYC pioneered the surgical technique that is now being used more broadly, and he has good reference pictures of typical before-after photos one year post-operation. I found my doctors from reading the forum pages on the NF1 Inspire page. Also feel free to DM me more specifics :)", "Donating blood I just tried to donate blood at Hoxworth today. Double reds to be exact. They have asked me about the bumps on my arms before, but it was never an issue. Today though, they looked up neurofibromatosis on the computer and told me it permanently disqualifies me. I am pretty annoyed. Might try the Red Cross instead next week. The fuck? I have been donating blood for a long time without issue to Red cross and Heinlein Society. Never been an issue before. What agency did you try to donate to? I do not believe having Neurofibromatosis should prevent you for donating blood, unless your effected in a way they could cause you harm by donating, but it would in no way harm someone else, as Neurofibromatosis is a condition you are born with and can only be passed on to your children, not through blood. It sounds like the people who looked it up are misinformed and saw the word tumors and cancer, which scared them from wanting to take your blood. Hoxworth. It is weird. I got my 5 gallon pin from them recently. They always talk about how much they need O+ blood, so you would think they would not be so strict once it is explained. I did have an issue when I tried to sell plasma years back at a completely different company. Their issue was I might have a seizure while hooked to the machine. I was able to get a note from my specialist proving I have no history of seizures and it was fine. Hoxworth will not even take my doctor's word for it. Not now anyway. The phlebotomist said to check back next month and it could change. Some places just do not want to be held liable in the case something did happen. It is understandable and I get it, but if your going to single someone out, it would  nice if at some point they take some time to learn about the medical condition of the person they are excluding. I am in another country (Germany) but I recently asked the Red Cross here about it, and they also told me that I am permanently disqualified from donating blood.\n\nMaybe it is a recent change in regulations? Yeah, I do not blame the office people. You would think the higher ups would consult specialists before excluding people though. I have been wanting to donate for ages, but kept pushing it back because I was supposed to start a drug trial for neurofibromas and I did not want to mess anything up for that. That did not work out either because another trial participant had an eye rupture and my coordinator did not want that happening to me. So, it was extra frustrating today. I think they worry about your own safety.\n\nI asked both blood donation organizations and stem cell donation organizations in my country (in the past couple of weeks); they both told me that I am disqualified even though I never had any malignant complications.\n\nThe blood donation organization did not give me any reason, but the stem cell donation organization told me that it is for my own safety.\n\nI mean, I am quite disappointed because I feel that I am able to donate. But I guess they do not want to risk anything (and possibly get themselves into trouble) and therefore have the rule that you are categorically disqualified no matter how well you are. It is unfortunate, but I understand their concerns, especially about the malignant tumors. I have had those both in 2014 and 2018. . Have you heard of Koselugo. It was fda approved a year ago for children, but with your doctors help adults can get approval for it. I just started it on June 1st. Must be. It has not been an issue before. Probably will not do anything, but I will send off some e-mails to a couple places and explain that there is no danger to most of us. I had not, but I will ask! I get most of my testing done at Cincinnati Children's still since they no longer kick out people that have been treated there as kids. Should be pretty easy to do. Yeah. I go to the university of Chicago, my doctor sees both children and adults, but I always have to go to the kids floor. It is great that Cincinnati Children's does not stop seeing people once they become of age. There is so few specialist out there who treat/see adults with Neurofibromatosis.\n\nHopefully things will work out for you with Koselugo, so far I have not had any of the side effects my doctor mentioned. I do have to take 45mg twice a day, but the company does not make it in that dosage, only in 10mg and 25mg, so I have to take two 10mg and one 25mg, twice a day. My doctor said they usually did not see any result until 4-6 month of tumor shrinkage. That would be fine with me. If it helps shrink the ones on my spine, I will take it however long it takes. Fellow Cincinnatian, NF1, and blood giver here. *waves* I am flabbergasted. Clinic and Hoxworth are in the same dang building. Perhaps we can get them to talk. Last time I gave I got multiple questions on the forum about my true \u201cgender.\u201d \ud83d\ude44 Ugh. You would think they would get with the times, but they still require gay men to abstain from sex for 3 months prior to donating. I will send a message to the doctor at UC that helps coordinate NF drug trials. She might be able to raise a ruckus. Yeah. I had tumors removed from my cervical spine in 2006, they were pressing against it. Some months ago we learned they grew back, but right now they are not pressing against my spine like before, it is still a concern, but right now my doctor is happy with my balance and strength to where he does not feel we need to do surgery. The last thing he was is for me to be cut open and have more harm done in the process and the surgeon he had me see felt the same way. I donate plasma and blood. Have for years. I went to a new place and they did that to me. I even got a letter from my NF doctor saying it was ok. \n\nIn my case the guy checking me out googled it then emailed their off site doctor. He is the one that black balled me. I would advise reaching out to your doctor if you have one. \n\nThat being said I moved towns and have been donating again just fine. In my country you can not donate blood if you have a chronic disease that are just the rules here. I think because of the dna? I do not know why I thought nobody with NF could donate blood tbh In the US, you could donate even with a chronic illness if there is no danger to you. It cannot be passed in the blood, so I can only guess they changed the rules to avoid liability if someone has issues during the blood draw. It just feels overly cautious in a time where blood is very much needed. I have experienced this too (California) \n\n... made my heart hurt being rejected when I was just trying to help.. to try and prove a point to the donation center, I had my doctor write a letter explaining that NF cannot be transferred through blood or plasma... \n\nstill the donation place rejected my blood.\n\nMakes me think that even though I am an organ donor, when my time comes they will probably not utilize parts of my innards to help others, just out of a lack of understanding...\n\nwhy does the medical world have to be so....silly to put it nicely. My doctors outright called it stupid. I am an organ donor too, but I am tempted to just donate my body to science. At least some medical students might learn something. I donate for more than 20 years. In Europe, they know I am NFI, they do not give a fuck. It is not transmittable disease so one cannot endanger the recipient, I cannot imagine a case of endangering the donor with NFI by donating blood. They did not ever care before. I have had to explain that the bumps near the draw site will not affect anything, but a phlebotomist has always waved away concerns from the screeners. I do not have a history of seizures either, so that would not be an issue while hooked to the machine. I am still a little miffed about it. That is really strange. Because a friend if mine worked with a company who did the blood draws. \n\nTo avoid embarrassing a donor they still took their blood (unless they were anemic) and it was marked with a colored dot, meaning for possible disposable. That way if the donor had some sort if genetic issue or a disease it could be checked since a tube if blood was attached.\n\nMaybe that has changed. \n\nBut I have donated (not in many years as I ALWAYS pass out,  even on the table once smh) and stated I had it.\n\nBut NF is NOT contagious so it cant  be passed through a blood donation.", "Anyone here from Australia? First of all, hello! I did not know Reddit had a sub for NF.\n\nMy mum and I both live with NF 1, and we live in NSW, in Australia. There is not much for people with NF here, though we do know about the Children's Tumour Foundation...and my mum and I hold monthly coffee chats in Wollongong normally the first Wednesday of the month. When we lived in the States (because of my dad's job) there seemed to be more. \n\nBoth mum and I have had several surgeries because of NF, I have a brain stem tumour, and when I was 15, 80% was removed and then I went through radiation treatment,, which shrunk it a bit. I also have some lesions near the frontal lobes. These are monitored by MRIs. I also have learning disabilities which put me on the Aspergers spectrum. \n\nBut it is hard to get people together...everyone seems to be in the big cities, though now that Cupids Undie Run has been made regional, it is coming to Wollongong and my mum is the race director..so if you live in the Illawarra...join in the fun! :D\n\nSo yeah, if you are in Australia...what are things like for you in your neck of the woods?? I am from Australia! I live in a smallish city in WA and as far as support nerworks go they are non existant. I have 3 docs appointments a year to keep everything in check, but beyond that I am more or less on my own.  That is why I am glad I found this place.  Woo! Other side of the country! :D You live in a smallish city...I live in a smallish town...mum and I have our yearly appointment with our neurologist, and our MRIs...the MRIs are before the doctor appointment, and then when we see him we go over everything and he plays those 'games' with us...you know the Touch my finger...then touch your nose, do not let me push down, walk heel to toe..\n\nI am a master at those games...just not the heel to toe. I have no coordination what so ever..  Yeah I do those. Strength co-ordination checks with a specialist, eyesight checks with a ophthalmologist and regular checkups with a doctor. Pain in the arse to go through every year but definitely a good idea. And so far theres nothing to be concerned about. Have only seen an ophthalmologist once and that was after my brain surgery, and all was good...just bad peripheral vision, but that is remained steady. My last optometrist visit was good, and although they do not do the test as intensely as ophthalmologists, they are happy with my eyes...which is good. I am from Sydney! never heard of such fundraisers until i did my own research online and the fact that growing up i never saw specialists for my condiotion which would have helped I am not sure I would believe that...several people who do the Undie Run in Sydney have NF...much more than 4-6, then there is the fact that NSW if fairly big...I wonder where he got that from?\n\nBut it is cool to have another NSW person here!", "terrible constant pain Hey guys, \nSo for about four months I have had terrible pain in my legs, I have got a large fibroma growing on the back of my think with another in my calf. I am in constant pain and it wakes me up at night. I have never had such severe pain with my NF before. My doctor has prescribed me tramadol and gabapentin. I have a MRI scheduled for Thursday to see exactly what is going on. If I can have them removed I will be seeing a specialist at Johns Hopkins. I was wondering what, if any, medications helps you guys with the pain, and if anyone has experience with getting their bumps removed. \nThanks for reading!\nMarky Mark\n\nUpdate: had a MRI as well as pet scan and there is a confirmed fibroma on my left leg. I am being sent for a biopsy on Monday, we will see how this plays out! \n\nUpdate #2: Biopsy results came back, i have a sarcoma in the left leg, which is a type of cancer. They want me to start Chemo after meeting with some specialists. Does anyone have any experience with this?", "Here is my NF2 rant,  I started experiencing pain again 2 years ago. Its been slowly been getting worse, day by day. Now it is at the point where it is starting to get unbearable. I have 3 intense lower back spinal surgeries performed throughout my life to remove tumors logged around the nervous system/spinal cord, according to my doctors my spine is now starting to degenerate. I am losing feeling in my legs, my arms, my hands, my feet. I have muscle spasms far too often and my legs kick at random times. The worse part is the pain and random burning sensations that occur throughout my body every single day. It is not the type of pain that is always extremely excruciating, but the type that is achy yet persistent. It even hurts to sleep unless I am in the perfect awkwardly held position. \n\nSomedays it gets the better of me. Imagine arthritis throughout all of your spines. But also imagine a mild burning in your legs and arms. Yup, that is how I feel pretty much all the time. I have taken hundreds of pills over the last couple of years; ibuprofen, Advil, Prescribed steroids, muscle relaxants ect. (I refuse to be on opioids because I do not want an early grave). I have been to the doctors' office too many times and I have had way too many MRIs. When I am in front of other people I try to act like nothing is wrong because I do not want to make things awkward, but occasionally I am not able to hide it and awkwardness ensues (lol I guess I am starting to get used to it).\n\n I have neurofibromatosis type 2. There is no cure, only mitigation of pain. Many of my hopes and dreams have had to change lately and oh what I would do to feel normal and healthy again. I guess it could be worse, I am grateful for my friends and my family for being around. I do not have cancer. But to be honest it just sucks. I feel like no one around me in person understands, but occasionally, when I see posts on this subreddit, I feel a sense of belonging. So if you are reading this and you can relate, you are not alone. I have been diagnosed with 'schwannomatosis', which pretty much means \"bro you got tumors/schwannomas but we do not know why\". No NF symptoms other than nerve sheath tumors. I have had a couple spine/brain surgeries to remove most of them, I still have one or two little ones that are not causing any issue right now so it is the classic \"watch and wait\".\n\nReading this really hit home. I cannot relate to all of it, but I know the pain you are describing. It can be devastating. A brave face throughout the day and crying in pain on the living room floor at 2am at night. At one time, my pain was so bad I would just buy big generic tylenol, naproxen, asprin, and ibuprofin, mix them all in a tupperware container and just grab six or seven of whatever came out at a time and take them, three to five times per day. Like you, I refused the opiates - I know people, I have family that have gone down that path. It is a slippery slope and while they work amazingly well, I know myself. I enjoy them too much when I do have them (post-op) that I know if I took them all the time, I would get hooked. I have felt it before, that little weird silent-but-screaming voice in my head that says \"if you do this, that, and this you might be able to get more\".  Not today, subconscious addition Smeagol.\n\nI do not have much of a point to this. There is nothing I can really say to help, except that you are not alone. I can only imagine a fraction of what you are going through, but it is enough. I understand.\n\nShoot me a PM if you ever want to chat, friend. Hi. I too have NF2. It is frustrating and often times heartbreaking thing to deal with. There is that feeling of \u201cno one truly understands what I am going through\u201d. \n\nIt is hard. Dealing with this stuff is hard. And sometimes it feels like your body just hates you. But I have found that going on this sub/being active in the NF-2 community has helped a ton.  \n\nAnyway. All that is to say, I am here for anyone dealing with NF2. It is a sucky disease. You are the Boss but avoiding opiates is not something I would do myself.....perhaps you have bought into fear of them which might be misplaced?\n\nAfter all is said and done they are the most effective pain reliever in history. There are many people who take them for decades and they do not die. If you are not injecting heroin or swallowing mouthfuls of stuff you got from the corner dealer there is little to fear.\n\nYou could first try Tramadol which is not a \"real\" opiate. Opiates, in general, CAN also help with your spirits. No kidding.\n\nProbably the worst effect of opiates (less so for Tramadol) is constipation - which many can counter by eating properly and other methods.\n\nI am not telling you what to do - only that our family member get NF2 relief from them over the years  - and, that suffering less is something you deserve. Good Luck. I do not have NF.  My son has NF1, which is why I am here.  But, your description of your pain is so familiar to me.  I have a degenerative disease of the spine which has also affected my SI joints and in the past the pain has been so bad that I have passed out multiple times, and vomited often (which is NO help for back pain!!)  I would not be at all functional if it were not for the pain management practice I go to.  Opiates do help, but not long term.  In fact with long term use they actually increase your brain\u2019s sensitivity to pain which makes them increase rather than decrease your pain.  I have experienced this myself and stopped taking them as a result after 18 years of using them daily.  \nBut, relief does not have to mean opiates!! There are many other options.  For example, I take neurontin for the burning nerve pain in my legs and feet.  I also have procedures done to reduce the pain.  Some procedures inject steroids and numbing medication directly into the problem areas.  These last a minimum of 3 months.  I also have rhyzotomies  done which is a procedure that temporarily prevents pain signals from the affected area from reaching your brain.  Typically these are effective for 3-6 months for me. \nThere are a lot of very effective options besides opiates.  Find a reputable pain management practice.  I literally would not be able to stand without the work they do on me.  \nGood luck!! Oh, and BTW these procedures I described are covered by insurance.  I have Medicare as my condition is a disability and Medicare covers all of this, as did my other insurance before Medicare.", "Growths Do the growths from NF1 look like skin tags?

Not sure if that has changed. \n\nAs you might know optic gliomas are common with NF and depending where on the optic nerve it is it could be causing those issues. AFAIK the go to way to find if there is tumors and where they are is taking an RMI. It is non invasive and has virtually no side effects. Or at least that is how i found out about all mine in the brain. As for the blurry vision, it may actually be something related with the eye itself, rather than the brain, as IIRC it is pretty common for NF patients to have tumors in the back of the retina or some place like that. To diagnose those there is an exam in which they shine a light into your eyes and look directly at the retina. Pretty annoying when you are there but still it is pretty much as non invasive as it gets. If you are concerned you should make an appointment with a professional to see which exams you should take Get a brain MRI asap. Definitely get an MRI.

It is been years since my last surgery for my spine and I still do the exercises at home and my bending mobility still surprises some drs.at first you will need a brace or cast which is unpleasant and may create some of those feelings, but I think if your in a lot of pain it may be worth it. It honestly depends. Yes you do move less but again over time without getting anything done you will start to move less anyway. :/ I am sorry for the situation your in, I know how hard it is. I hope you get some relief. Thank you. They always give me Valium before the scans because of my anxiety. Thank you. Yes I can barely bend my back as it is and it is drop to the floor painful if I bend the wrong way. How is your quality of life with a fused spine? You can try one of the stand up/sit down MRI facilities. I know they get a rap for having less resolution but I asked about that when they found my spinal tumor and they said the difference was negligible. It was sure a nice change to sit down and watch a bad movie on their bad TV while they did the whole spinal-brain series, both with and without contrast. That would have been about 6 hours in the tube the old way. No thanks. I would imagine it would only matter to your neurosurgeon if they have some kind of hard on preference for the tube machine, but I would definitely ask if it matters to them.\n\nI am wondering if a fusion may not be appropriate or necessary for schwanwannomas. The whole idea is to cut away the the tumors that are compressing the nerves, right? That should deal with the compression. I may be wrong (it wouldnt be the first or last time) but there doesnt seem to be any advantage to fusing vertebra in that situation. Your spinal geometry could be immaculate but if you have a new growth pushing in to a nerve or the cord it would squeeze in anyhow whether it has to go around titanium structures and screws or not. I wonder if you catch this early enough if they can just aspirate the tumors and shrink them so they wont press on anything painful? Just sorta thinking out loud, I am sure you have run these thoughts by your surgeon the last time. FWIW, I hope you are wrong and its just a regular backache. I got my fingers crossed for you. Best of luck.... Well I also have deteriorating disc disease and a sacralized vertebrae. I am not sure if that is why but he said I would eventually need it but wanted to wait until I was older. Out of all my medical issues my spine is the best. I get neck pain from the rodding and some other pains in shoulder and back. Besides the pain when I was a kid I went horse back riding, running, swimming. My spine never really held me back from anything it was my other health issues that did. I of course cant do hard core roller costers and things like play hard takle sports but I use to ride gentler ones and do easier sports. If anything I could/can do more because of my spinal fusion. \n\nIt is differnt for everyone but I am happy I had mine. One good thing is at least you will have a new MRI to compare with the old one so you can get a rough idea of how fast the disc degeneration is taking place. Hopefully its going pretty slow, but 2 years can be a long time for spinal issues. I hate to go blasting surgeons that people have established relationships with already, but I cannot help but wonder if the need to fuse part of you spine was there before, why didnt they do the fusion while they had you open? The most dangerous part of any surgery is the anesthesia. it seems somehow wrong to put you through that twice when they could gave done it all in one shot. I hope you dont think I am being nosy or starting anything, but even if the schwannomas are back, I would suggest a 2nd surgical opinion. It never hurts to get a 2nd pair of eyes on a problem. Hang in there.. I can add to this a lot. I will try to do it tomorrow when fully awake. If I do not please PM me to give me a nudge as I might forget. I just had an MRI done Friday, and it was suggested to me by a friend to ask for a cloth to cover your eyes. This made a world of difference. I am not that claustrophobic but being in that small tube with all the sounds, the strip of light and the air blowing on you starts to get to you and over 45 minutes and beyond it is easy to fall into a bad head space. I had trouble keeping my eyes closed for the 45+ minutes but with the cloth if I did open them it was to nothing. I am not sure if you experienced the annoyance of having that stream of air blow on your face but for me the cloth completely stopped that. \n\nGood luck! Sorry this took a lot long than I liked to reply. I have had countless MRI\u2019s. I would try to speak to your doctor about the claustrophobia if you having a scan they might be able to give you something to help with the scan. \n\nI had my operations as a teen I am now approaching 40. While I cannot bend my back I have found ways to do most things. I sometimes use litter pickers or grabbers. I have also learnt recently to ask for help when I cannot do something as it is not a sign of weakness. \n\nI will not tell you it will get better as there is good days and bad days (today\u2019s a bad one for me so done nothing, apart from supervises the new lights getter fitted in the office or watching Netflix as some might call it). Definitely speak to your doctors maybe write it all day and hand them the paper if that makes it easy. \n\nPlease do not put it off. I did this for 10+ years and in the last year I have a new team fighting for me and things pain wise are so much better. A year ago I did want to go on. But I met a woman (NF nurse as she saved my life) Fusion's not such a great answer either since all of the flex, cushioning and weight bearing is transferred to the level below the fusion often leading to premature failure of those levels. Artificial discs really sound like the best option, but they dont do enough of it (compared to fusion) to get a really fair reading of long term success. I guess eventually they will do it more but its sure taking surgeons a long time to warm up to something new... Ah, sorry I forgot you were the schwannomatosis poster. That is kind of a rough deal.

Has anybody ever had surgery on their c spine where they went in through the front of your throat?  This is what I am having done on Tuesday.  Once the cage is put in then he will go in again and remove the hardware from the back, this is where a couple of the screws are loose at C5 and the pain in my neck and upper shoulders from behind or getting worse. \n\n According to the letter I got from the insurance company, everything was already approved but I seriously doubt both surgeries could be done on the same day.  My question to you all is did you have a hard time speaking or swallowing after the incision on your throat? I have had surgery done on my cervical spine, but mine was on the back on my neck. If you have any questions like me know. I hope all goes well and you start to feel better. What other options do you have? Do you want two surgeries? Can you call and talk to the doctor again? Some hardware is loose? Do you have tumors giving you problems? I did all this with voice to text because I have a hard time typing so if some of it does not make sense that is the reason that is the way the phone heard my voice\n\n\nI have many tumors all throughout my body but they are all deep inside and very very few can be seen from the outside I look completely normal over the last 27 years since I was 16 I have had 11 surgeries four of them were major two on my lowest spine l2 l3 and then l4 l5 in 2000 and 2008 then two on my c spine at c2c3 2005 and now so the hardware is a little bit loose to two screws and I could feel a stabbing ice pick pain in the back of my neck and my upper shoulders so he is going to go into the front on Tuesday and put a cage around it for more stability then I doubt he will do the back the same time I might have to wait a few months but then he will go in from behind and take out the hardware and my c spine will still be supported by the cage the only part about that that scares me is he will be cutting through a lot of scar tissue and muscle again that is going to have to heal so it is going to be really sore and next Tuesday is actually 6 months to the day of my last surgery and right now after 6 months and physical therapy I am almost 100% like I was before the surgery without the neuropathy and numbness in my left arm. And to tell you the truth if it was up to me I would have both surgeries done at the same time if it can be this way I only have to recover one more time instead of recovering from this one and then however many months later recovering from the other one Oh geez.. yes these tumors can really hide.  I hear you.. I am not exactly like you but I have tumors growing on each level of my spinal cord.   Nobody would ever know I have a freaking problem.   I am not here to talk about my problem. But I just wanted to share that have tumors hidden on my body too. On my shins, my thighs. So you loose hardware, and they need to fix it? Have you been free of pain previously? Are you considering a spinal cord stimulator at all?? Yes, I know..one surgery would be the best deal. I actually tried the spinal cord stimulator a couple of years ago they put in the temporary one with a battery pack and everything was on the outside but the little electrode wire thing is going up your spine.  It did absolutely nothing even when they put the power all the way up the only thing that would happen is I would feel like it tens unit was on me I am sure you know what I mean those little pads they put on you and you feel a little bit of you know vibration so that was the complete waste of time.  As far as dealing with the pain, years ago I lost about 10 to 12 years of my life because I was over medicated on morphine and MS Contin 100 mg four times a day I was a dope addict but legally I guess.  I have never been pain free since I was 16 years old.  After my last surgery they gave me Percocet started at 20 mg four times a day and every 2 weeks they would lower it to the point where I was on 10 mg twice a day and then off of it so I just want to deal with the pain over the years. I have had a total of 11 surgeries over the years some minor some not so minor I had my lower back l2 l3 operated on a 2000 l4 l5 operated on in 2008 then I had my cervical spine c2c3 work operated on in 2005 and then this person November c5c6 to remove the tumor and put in hardware Yes, I  have an a SCS. It sorta works, it allows me to sit, and not be in excruciating pain.  The strange vibrations from it is really bizarre.  This week I getting an DRG medical device with 4 leads for my legs but I definitely need more help than that.  Plus the medical community not I understanding that we have a genetic condition. As, my degree of pain is off the charts and nobody ever seems to care.   If I had cancer, I would be treated much better, even my animals are treated better when it comes to pain.   I am just tired of it all and I just want to have some fun.  It sounds like you have had lots of surgeries and a little better pain management then I have been able to find.

Paul has ADHD and learning disabilities. Im wondering if other people have the same learning disabilities if this is common for NF. It is very common It is very common... There have been a few promising studies on drugs that can help - namely Ritalin, Lovastatin and Lamotrigine.  I am most interested in the latter due to the theory behind it and the continuing extension of study enrollment and duration.  Almost 80% of people with NF will have some form of learning disability and/or ADHD. About 20% will have autism, though usually less severe symptoms than typical kids with autism. hopefully his kids have an IEP or 504 to help them get services if needed or help with support.

I unfortunately am now going on hospice due to the disease caused by my nf1 I have had two cancerous tumors caused by my Neurofibromatosis both in 2014 and 2018, the first one was a large mass in my right leg and the second was in my right arm.

I had both tumors removed and the extreme pain I was getting from both of them went away and I was just back to the normal pain I have from Neurofibromatosis. \n\nI never had to go into hospice, I just had the tumors removed. If you have questions I will try to answer them. I am not OP but I would have some questions: Was the pain constantly that bad and how was it differently from your \"normal\" NF pain? And do you know how long they were growing until they were discovered and what additional treatment to the surgery did you have? I have a mild case and therefore do not go to the doctor very often but I sometimes I have some pain that is quite a bit worse than usual but it is not constant so I believe it is probably harmless. It was way different than my normal pain. The pain I was getting from the cancerous tumors, was an intense sharp pain that could last for a good period of time, that sometimes felt like it was burning, enough that I could not ignore it, could not enjoy eating with my family and would wake me up in the middle of the night.\n\nI have no idea how long they were growing, the one in my leg was pretty much has always had a large mass. And they actually could not remove all of the mass otherwise I would have been left with basically all this empty space in my leg because of the mass. They were able to remove the part that was cancerous.\n\nThe one with my arm that tumor we were keeping an eye on. It was not so much that it got bigger, it was an egg sized tumor that they removed, but I do not think the size changed all that much. It just started sending a down my arm and it was a similar pain to the one in my leg.

You will need to seek out a neurosurgeon.

I have been thinking of getting it tested though I am really kind of late since I have had it all my life You should! You never know. I had no idea there was a tumor in my pelvis until I was 32.

I have never checked for them so maybe I could just to be sure? Do you have any other symptoms? how big is the cluster? it could be segmental NF. You can have neurofibromas without having NF1. A dermatologist told my mom she had it when he saw one on her back. We were surprised because we always thought my case was spontaneous. I took her to my specialist and she has no other symptoms. So, it is unlikely she has it. They generally will look for several symptoms before going forward with a more thorough diagnostic test. You can probably be tested but I warn you, if a doctor does not deem it necessary, your insurance may not cover it. The test would have cost $1,200 if we went forward with it. They are called cafe au lait spots. They essentially look like freckles, but are centered around the armpits and groin.  \n\n\nMy diagnosis of Schwannomatosis was based on my cafe au laits, a confirmed schwannoma upon biopsy, and three more small schwannomas on my head. A  blood cancer diagnostic test determined I do not have any of the currently known genetic mutations. Doc said it could be a spontaneous mutation or a genetic mutation they do not yet know about yet/have testing for. It is like a lot of small spots in one area which is about 8cm? On my right hand. Nowhere else. Thank you for responding. It helps a lot. I was thinking of getting tested but maybe I will take a doctor's opinion first I have a cluster of these small spots just below the elbow on my right arm. Do not have them anywhere else. I am thinking of asking my doctor about it. Thank you for replying. I doubt it. They need to be sizable in comparison to freckles and they are always spread around for classic NF1, and six or more in number. Additionally, a major telltale sign is freckling in armpits and groin. If all you have are spots in that small area, NF1 is a leap in my opinion. I was in a similar situation. A derm \nbiopsied some lesions and immediately referred me to a genetics specialist. I had tried to go through my primary care doctor, but they wanted to order tests that the genetics specialist said were not quite appropriate. If it is an option for you, I would try to see a medical geneticist next. Good luck! \ud83c\udf40 I agree, insurance does not like to pay. Every one that I have had removed has cost me. I had a few removed from my skin back when the plastic surgeon at Cincinnati Children's Hospital still accepted adult patients. My insurance at the time covered anything done at pediatric facilities, luckily. Not so anymore.  It is very common to not always find what you are looking for on the internet in terms of detecting and identifying a specific symptom. However, it is important that you get the information you need in order to determine whether this symptom can be the cause of a severe or serious syndrome. There are a variety of telehealth and telegenetic services that provide (  from experts. Check out FDNA telehealth. This company has a variety of information on syndromes and symptoms that will help navigate and hopefully answer what you are going through! thank you so much for responding! also this may be kind of weird but is it common to have those spots behind the shoulders/upper back sides or on the lower butt? Sorry if its too TMI It seems like they can be anywhere, even the face, so yes, they can be on your back or your bum. Torso is often affected a lot. You can Google NF1 cafe au lait spots and look at the images to get an idea.", "FDA Approves First Ever Treatment for Neurofibromatosis ", "Should I get genetic testing? Hi! 19F here. I have OCD and one of my recent obsessive thoughts has been whether or not I have NF2, so I figured I might as well ask for some advice. For background, I have a lot (over 20) cafe au lait spots, have failed many hearing tests, and have some strange bumps on my skin. I do not think I am anywhere close to being deaf, but my hearing has gotten worse over the years. I also get dizzy often. When I was a kid, I was checked out for NF1 by a professional after failing a hearing test and noticing the spots on my skin. I was told to get genetic testing for NF2 as I have multiple signs of it, but I never did. I do not know if I should just wait to see if something bad will happen or get tested. Were any of you in a similar situation, and are there any benefits to finding out earlier? Not nf2, but I would get tested. if things do start to get bad, you may lose precious time getting a right diagnosis because you did not get tested. I agree that you should see a geneticist. You show a lot of symptoms of something and you should be monitored for whatever it is. I did not think NF2 had cafe au laits but NF1 does not have hearing issues. Anyway, you should be monitored so you should go get a diagnosis. The first step of that is seeing a geneticist. You should definitely get test, because from your description it does sound like Neurofibromatosis. I was diagnosed when I was 15. They had tried to diagnose me when I was a baby and when I was 9, but test results were inconclusive. I am 36 now and have multiple tumors throughout my body, as well as the birthmarks and other trademarks of nf. I know, that is why I am confused lol. You are probably right, thanks! Thanks, good advice My sister first started complaining about pain when she was 16, and it took her until she was 42 to get properly diagnosed with Schwannomatosis.  I was diagnosed much quicker, but only because they wanted to genetically test me to confirm her diagnosis.  Treatment and scans were much easier to access with that diagnosis, so it is a good idea for you to talk to your doctor and see what kind of scans (MRI/etc) or genetic testing you can get.", "Some sage advice (google is not always your friend) So I used to go to the NF clinic at Mass General in Boston, but because I was really symptom free and Boston is a royal pain to get to (Mass drivers) I let my membership lapse (advice #1, do not do that). Well recently I started to get weird symptoms - a bad limp and weirdness in my right arm/hand. So I call my primary care doctor who immediately sees me and gets me an MRI of the spine at my local hospital - on the condition that I get in contact with the NF clinic in Boston. I get the MRI done and call the NF clinic who tell me that the first appointment is a virtual one in September, but they want me to immediately send the MRI + radiology report to them. Upon reading the radiology report I come across a term I do not understand and google it (advice #2 do not do that). Of course, the top results that come up are cancer related terminology. Now I am starting to now freak the hell out, but no worries cannot be that bad my appointment is in September. Then 2 days later  I get a call from Boston telling me they want to see me the following week in-person (I know they now have the MRI + the radiology report). At this point my stress levels are through the roof, I am thinking this is really bad and my spinal neurofibromas are glowing like Christmas trees with cancer. \n\nSo begins one of the worse weeks of my life, I am seriously thinking I have got a few months to live. Eventually I get to the clinic, my blood-pressure is higher than it is ever been and the doctor walks in. I eventually ask her how bad is it, what does this all mean? She just sits there dumb-founded and tells me that the tumors have grown slightly and I will need surgery at some point in the near future. No cancer, no worries. I have never quite known relief like that and I felt like a total dumb-ass. Most stuff about tumors does not mean shit with NF. They are always designed for people who do not have it. Most people and therefore Google -usually make the tumors equals cancer thing.\n\nI have some tumors in my brain due to NF that have been benign and have not grown for years. This has made me weirdly blase about other people talking about brain tumors because I forget that they do usually affect people pretty badly...But for me it is like, it is a brain tumor sure, but those are not a huge deal. I got some and I am doing fine.\n\nDo not feel too stupid about it. Good point Same. I sometimes randomly mention the tumors in my brain and people freak out and I am just like what? Take a deep breath. Nd count to ten. Now stop thinking the worst, that is the worst thing you can do to yourself. Even if the tumors do turn out to be cancerous, that does not mean it is super bad. I myself had had cancerous nf tumors removed twice both in 2014 and 2018. Both were a success and neither needed radiation. If you have any questions let me know. Thank you. Did you have symptoms or was it an incidental finding? Where were the cancers? I just do not mention it unless it is needed. People think about cancer and I am just like \u201cNah. They are just there.\u201d\n\nThough sometimes it is really fun when people ask \u201cWTF is wrong with you?\u201d And I can go. \u201cLook I got a body full of tumors. This is the best you are going to get.\u201d I usually mention it when people are playing the \"what is something interesting about you we do not know\" game. I was having intense pain (way outside of my normal pain that I have grown used to), that was a sharp shooting burning pain that would go up in down. In 2014 it was my upper right leg and in 2018 it was in my upper right arm. The one in my leg was a higher grade tumor compared to the one in my arm. \n\nFor the one in my leg, they were able to tell right away with just an mri scan. With the one in my arm, they also needed to do a biopsy to confirm that it was cancerous. Recovery times for both were not too bad.\n\nThe one in my leg I had to stay in the hospital for I think 4-5 days and then I was able to go home. I was up and walking around as soon as I woke up from the surgery. With the one on my arm I was able to go home to day of my surgery.\n\nIf you have any other questions, let me know. Lol. That works too Thanks for sharing. I guess most MPNSTs are in the limbs are not they? Luckily all my tumors are on my spine and in the torso (although I have a whole body MRI booked in 2 weeks to confirm this). Not much pain too other than the occasional feeling that someone has slammed my hand in a vice. That is a new thing too. You are welcome. Hope all goes well with your scans. I have had whole body scans before, while they can take a few hours to complete, the best advise I can give is to just close your eyes and relax. They likely will have to put a sort of head gear cage thing over your head, but it really is not too bad. I have had to have one many times, back in 2006 I had to have nf tumors removed from my cervical spine, those were not cancerous, but I was told I could have woken up one day unable to get up. The way they knew to suspect something may be going on was I was have a heating-cooling sensation in my feet and ankles and some back pain, an MRI would later confirm it. For me I have 3 tumors that need removing from my cervical and 1 big one on my lumbar spine. I realized there was a problem when I could not brush my teeth. My brain says \u201carm, move\u201d and my arm goes \u201chuh?\u201d. So I am in the middle of a whole bunch of MRIs and dr appointments right now , but I am facing 2 surgeries at least. I know that things will work out fine in the end and still consider myself lucky with how the condition has impacted me compared to many others. Yeah, I am sure everything will turn out fine and you feel a lot better. Sending best wishes to you. Thank you I get that. Or sometimes I see people talk about getting a mole/birthmark/skin bump removed as a cancer scare that made them re-evaluate life and it is hard sometimes to see it from their perspective. My NF is pretty mild so I have downplayed a lot of my experiences because compared to so many others it is mild, but it is not fair of me to do that to others. Been there!!  Glad it all worked out for you!!  When my son was 3 1/2 I had noticed one of his eyes looked slightly larger than the other.  Took him to his pediatrician who immediately sent us for an emergency scan at the hospital up the street (literally we were in the scan 20 mins after leaving the doctors office!) Then they sent us straight back to the pediatricians office.   She stood there in the exam room crying her eyes out as she told me he had a brain tumor and it was \u201creally bad, terminal\u201d ....lots more tears from HER (I was just in shock and PISSED that she was blubbering like this in front of my son!) She had called ahead to the peds ER at Johns Hopkins and told me they were expecting us and we should go there immediately.   36 EXCRUCIATING hours in the ER later and I finally got the diagnosis that he has NF and 2 tumors, not one, and the reassurance that it was not terminal.  OMG I wanted to ring that pediatrician\u2019s neck!!!!  Never mind that he should have been diagnosed before he was 1!!!  It is quite a roller coaster ride we can get on with NF!", "Thought this was pretty interesting. Hope you are having a peaceful day NF peeps ", "NF1 and academic studies Does anyone here have cognitive issues that impact their ability to study? If so do you have any strategies that help to overcome these? I was only diagnosed with NF1 when I was 21 and although I had some issues at school, I generally received acceptable grades. I went to university as a mature student and struggled all the way throughout my undergraduate degree. It was only towards the end that I made the connection between my academic struggles and my NF1. \n\nI am now finishing off a research master's in political science and have been given an extension for my dissertation due to illness (stress and depression) and I get study support through my university's disability service. However, I feel that I still struggle so much. I feel that the amount of work I have left to do is achievable yet I seem to have no concentration span these days. I also have issues with processing information and short term memory. The more stressed I get about my new deadline (which is soft and can be extended pretty much until I am ready) the less I seem to be able to focus. Has anyone else had similar issues? Did you manage to overcome them and if so what did you do? My language skills took a long time to come around, my grammar and spelling still are not great but I have improved a lot. I also have never been able to take notes other than that I did well academically. I only finished an associates degree but it is been enough education to make a living, I tried to get a bachelors and could not keep up with all the work. I do plan on going back part time. I have never been diagnosed with anything but it would not surprise me if I have some nf1-related 'glitches' with attention, sense of direction, and visual things. If you are already plugged into support you are probably getting better advice than I could offer, but I can at least commiserate. But I will say, having been a grad student, that\nit is perfectly normal to have trouble sustaining interest and attention on a dissertation -- even with the end in sight. There may be a few students around who seem to have unlimited focus and discipline, and good for them, but that is not everybody. You can power through despite the frustration and succeed. Do it!  I definitely also have the visual and sense of direction glitches too. I am 32 years old and still have to make an L with my hand so I can figure out me right and left. The dissertation is definitely a slog but it is great to hear that you managed to get through it. Your post has really motivated me to keep on going. Thank you! :) Thanks for your reply! I did my master's classes part time and found that it reduced a lot of the stress that I had during my undergraduate degree. One thing that was an issue was sustaining interest over this time, especially as I found it harder to make the connection between the different classes on the course. I think the solution here would be to continue reading the previous years notes and trying to see the connections. Another issue for me was that I chose to do a research masters which meant 3/6 of my classes were research based. These all came in my second year and none of them interested me. If I were to do it again, I would maybe tr to select at least one other class that was of more interest to me.  I do not. But have a physical disability.\nBtw I think you made a great progress; you manage all of this and reach almost the end. Do not be so hard on yourself, you already showed yourself you are capable by reaching this point. \nTake a rest, eat good, sleep good, have fun and relax yourself; you will finish it \ud83d\ude0a Thank you so much for this message! &lt;3  I struggled more in grade school, but once I was diagnosed with dyslexia and my parents got me a tutor I was fine and able to keep up. In Junior High and Highschool I did mostly fine average grades my school did not have special ed so I was taking the same classes as everyone else. The only class that may have come close would be independent math that I took for 9th-12th grade. I just did my best in all my classes and it seemed to work out for me. I was not the smartest by any means, but I was able to get by.\n\n Its seems to be that having support in place is a key element to success. I am glad that you managed to get by without issue. Thank you.  It is pretty well established that those with nf1 suffer from mild to moderate cognitive issues. I think the consensus is an average IQ of ~90? So not quite 1 standard deviation below average.\n\nThere have been a number of clinical trials to find drugs to help, but to date, the best they have been able to do is partially restore certain functions. Nothing has shown an ability to fully restore all cognitive deficiencies.\n\nRitalin and Lovastatin have shown to be modestly effective.\n\nOne study I am following with interest is NF-EXCEL. It is testing Lamotrigine for cognitive restoration in NF1 children. The theory is that loss of NF1 causes weakened HCN channels, which Lamotrigine can strengthen.

", "23 F Freakin out about NF1 Hey everyone\n\nIm 23 f and currently freaking out worrying about the prospect of tumors covering my body im almost crying.\n\nIve had NF2 my whole life obviously and ive never once worried. Recently ive seen on the internet videos and articles of women with thousands of tumors all over their body. I see some saying it got outta hand after pregnancy. \nI have really been thinking about having a child but now im worroed about\nA. Getting a bunch of tumours\nAnd\nb. My child having Nf1 too. I know its not the end of the world but that just isnt ideal\n\n\nAbout me\nI have an optic glioma and that is about the only tumour i have.\nBut my husband recently has been noticing that my skin has been a bit bumpy ish. Its very hard to notice so im wondering if its knew or always been like that. Im worried its going to start forming.\n\nBasically im wondering about people who do have Nf1 tunours.\nWhen did you get them?\nLater in life? Did you get more and more as the time progressed ? Are you older 65+ and have still never really had any skin tumours?\n\nPlease be honest. Thanks I am in my upper 30s and I have NF1. I have minimal bumps. My father has it too, is 66, and has a few more than I do, but they are also fairly minimal. I had some tiny one when I was nine on my head, but it was never confirmed 100% I had Neurofibromatosis type 1 until I was 15 (1999). Puberty likely is what jump started everything for me. I have internal tumors all throughout my body, mostly in my right upper leg. I have had four surgeries related to my Neurofibromatosis and the last two which were in 2014 and 2018 were to remove one that had become cancerous.\n\nNeurofibromatosis unfortunately effects us all differently, so it is hard to say how one will be effected at any time. \n\nIf you have any questions let me know. Grandfather- Deceased, but had thousands on his body.\n\nMy mom-  65F has some. More after each pregnancy though but had not gotten more as she has aged.\n\nAunt-70F female. She has thousands on her body. She did not have any children. I know she got more after menopause. \n\nSister 26F has a few. No pregnancies\n\nMyself- 25F one on my arm. I have had one non viable pregnancy that lasted 8 weeks. I personally am getting my tubes tied in October because I do not want biological children due to the affects it could have on me and my potential child. This is a HARD and personal choice for everyone. I am really hoping it will not progress like my aunt and grandfather- time will tell. I have NF1 and mom say I started to to have tumors on torso with puberty(I do not remember clearly time without them), although I have some of them even before. Like huge one on inner right ankle. I have a lot of them on torso but it is not as on the \"bad\" picture. My cleavage is mostly free of them.\n\nI did not inherit it, in my case it is spontaneous mutation. I have millions all over my body, had them as long as I can remember. I am 26M, there are a handful that I had/have to get removed. I too have an optic glioma. \n\nDoes your husband know that you have NF? You should also speak to some specialists as there are **possible** complications during pregnancy and delivery. You cannot tell how it will progress during life. I know hormones can affect it (such as puberty or pregnancy). I am 25F and have be having tumors inside my torso. And I keep telling myself that it should not progress rapidly (like maybe there is a certain rate by which it develops). So I hope it can be like that. \n\nRegarding passing it to your child. I know there are IVF in which they can screen for nf1 and choose ones without it. You can maybe try surrogate mother (for me it is not an option). And you can risk having a kid on your own. One woman on tik tok told she developed only few after her pregnancies. But its indivual. But you should talk to your specialist The internet is sensational. A woman covered head to toes with neurofibromas will attract more clicks than a perfectly normal looking woman, so you should not see these images as a prediction of where you are headed. In Nf1, most people have mutations, but a few have deletions, which mean the totality of the nf1 gene is missing and this people sadly have very severe symptoms. \n\nThis said, you need to educated yourself a bit, especially if you want to have kids on how to avoid passing your mutation to your baby. The only safe way is to do prenatal diagnosis , which is IVF. \n\nI would not worry about triggering a wave of tumours during pregnancy because a study who compared pregnant woman and non pregnant woman showed all them develop more because what will trigger the tumours is a \"second hit\" and time will bring these on. \n\nThe nf1 gene does not cause tumours, it prevents them... when it is functioning. In us, one of our copy is malfunctioning, mutated and does not its job. Luckily, we have two copies of it, but sometimes, a random mutation hits the functioning one, and if repair mechanism fails, this is. how tumours can start. \n\nEveryone has more than 800 mutations happening every hour. That is more than 19.000 every day. Every time one of our cells divide, an error might happen, that will be quickly zapped, corrected, repaired, eliminated, .... and we are perfectly fine. As we age, the repair mechanisms get tired, busy, distracted, lost, and this why the worst phase is in our old age.\n\nTo be precise on what NF1 does, amongst many functions, its main one is to slow down a cellular pathway called RAS that controls cells growth and proliferation. In us, RAS is overactive because of the failing of the NF1 gene. So we grow more cells, and this is what causes the tumours. \n\nSo are we hopeless and helpless .... I like to think we are not. \n\nA few things are in your hands, the amount and rate of mutations , boosting the repair mechanism, understanding how nutrition - good and bad - influences genes' action. \n\nWe have known for a while now that a certain diet is beneficial (  . A bad diet will increase mutations . We have known for more than 20 years that certain nutrient deficiency can cause DNA damage, such as for example a folate deficiency will cause chromosomes to break. So one more reason to have a high vegetables diet. \n\nI am not saying \"eat a carrot and you will be fine\" . I am saying that our behaviour and lifestyle can influence how our Nf1 will evolve to a certain extent. Many terrible tumours will progress whatever we do, especially in people who have severe forms and I am very happy there are drugs now that hopefully will help. \n\nIn people like you -   lucky enough to have a mild form so far, and avoided all the devastating manifestations in children ,  from missing or deformed bones, plexiform, brain tumours, ....  - , diet should be considered to try to slow progression on the amount and severity of our manifestations. \n\nI would also recommend you go and see a specialist because what we know about NF1 today is very different of what we knew  up until 5 years ago and there are things you should be aware of and act upon. \n\nFor example, we know 48% of us will have osteopenia , poor bone density , and we also know that your bone capital, meaning how strong your bones are , is built before the age of 30. So you should maybe try to increase your bone density now, with again good diet and weight bearing exercise. After the age of 30, you cannot build quality bone, you lose a bit every year. \n\nWe also know, that we get more cancers, at a younger age and with a worse prognosis.  So, from the age of 30ish, you should get breast MRIs. And yes, diet and lifestyle can alter your cancer risk. Not make it disappear, of course, but hopefully diet combined with early imaging will give you the best chances. \n\nSo in a way, you being alerted by those images is a good thing. Because it forces you to educate yourself about nf1, not to fear it, but to address it. \n\nThis is good sources of what our complications can be (  in people in nf1. Each of us, will have 1 or 2 of these, not all of them, however it is essential to be aware NF1 is far more than cafe au lait and bumps. So do not read these guidelines as a prediction of your life, you evidently are doing very and this is great. \n\nI gave a copy of these to my doctor, and once a year, I have my cancer screening, my DEXA scan , blood pressure checks, and I am good until the next year unless something happens. I eat the diet that gives me the best chances , even if I know it is not fail- proof diet, but at least I will have tried to remain the way I am and the way I look. If you have NF2, I do not quite understand why you are freaking out about NF1. As far as I know, they are on two different chromosomes. One does not develop from the other and your kid would not get type 1 from you, and you are not going to get type 1 tumors.\n\nETA: when you say you have had NF2 your whole life, is that actually a typo? I have NF1\nMy mother does too \n\nNeither of us are affected severely \n\nMy son does not yet show any signs Hi! Can you explain more what you meant by this \"second hit\" and also how to increase bone density? Also what is your diet like?\n\nThank you im 28M no one in my family has had it (knowingly) had 1 removed due to it being in an inconvenient location. i have some in my brain which gets monitored regularly. Ive noticed a few small one pop up on different parts on my body but do not seem to be growing. I too have one behind my right eye which causes it to droop and make me look like I have had a stroke which I fucking hate. Apparently, you can have inventro fertilisation to get the NF gene removed. Not sure how it works where you are from but in Australia it is covered by Medicare\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt affects everyone differently but I think you are quite lucky that you have a husband who understands and accepts you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIm too scared to develop a relationship out of the fear of being rejected over this shit disease. Thanks for this. I was not aware of a lot of what you have said and have found it really helpful. Even if it only helps a little , I will be pushing myself for a better diet. Not sure if anyone has heard of  it but the clinical trials of NFX-179 are interesting and worth keeping an eye on.\n  We have two copies of the NF1 gene. One is mutated (first hit) and not working very well, the other is not mutated, and produces enough circulating neurofibromin to do its purpose. If a random mutation - and as I was saying , they happen constantly -  happens on the functioning copy of our NF1 , it is referred to as the second hit.\n\nOur body is quite efficient at taking care of random mutation. We have plenty of repair mechanism, such as the sirtuins for example.\n\nOur lifestyle can influence both the mutations and the repairs. Bruce Ames has highlighted how vitamins and nutrients are necessary for optimal gene functioning and we also need to consider if certain food can cause damage, and we have known for a long time that  fried food causes DNA damage and that  high blood sugar will disrupt the cellular processed that repair DNA damage.  On the other hand we can boost these, some food will activate sirtuins and repairs, mainly polyphenols in plants. Given that we have a \" fragility\" when it comes to mutations, adopting a diet high in polyphenols rich food that is anti inflammatory as well , has the potential to help us a bit. Increase the good, limit the bad. I try to help my functioning NF1 as much as I can by eating  high vegetable diet. Colour rich. and variety is as important as quantity. Plenty of soups, lovely salads, juicy watermelon, ...\n\nOn the bones front, talk to your doctor. We build bones in the first three decades of life. After that we maintain and will eventually lose, especially at menopause. So we need to have the best bone capital by 30. Bone cells respond to stimulation and stress, so weight bearing exercise, walking combined with calcium rich food + vitamin K2. The nf1 gene influences bone cells. We have weaker bones and should act soon. Consider having a DEXA scan to know where you are at now, and them with your doctor you can make a plan. Does not it hurt if its all over? Is it uncomfortable?\n\nAnd yea he knows but not really aware of what it means exactly Thanks so much for the info and links.\nI have an Nf1 specialist (endocrinologist) whos been following my family for years. But last time i saw her i was too young to really even understand what Nf1 was Typo i have NF1 You dont want biological children because of NF1? Lets say i do ivf would that \"fix\" the mutation so thet my childs children will not have the 50% chance of having nf1 Youre the pioneer in your family lol Ivf is so expensive plus it wont remove the mutation for my futures grandchildren and great grand children etc. I know its not the end of the world byt i just dont want to pass it down idk The tumour behind your eye is in your brain , yea? Optic glioma? I have my right side that droops a little too and I think its cause of that Thanks!\nIf i was in the states id participate lol As for the diet, good thing im arab/Mediterranean lol I emailed the team to ask about trials where I am (UK) if I hear back I will let you know. not all the time, kind of used to the pain. Not really the ones that were uncomfortable I had surgically removed.\n\nI would have a talk with him, and highly recommend you go see a specialist. CTF.org has a feature that allows to find them in your area (given you are in the USA). You have two copies of the NF1 gene, one is mutated, the other normal. WIth IVF you will not pass the mutated copy but only the healthy one Thanks! Thanks I have had a specialist since I was born basically since my mom and two sisters have NF1\nBut I have not seen her since i was able to actually understand Nf1 And I will be the only one no its seperate.\n\none behind my eye one in my brain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhave them in my spine stomach too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nand yes mine is my right eye that droops which makes me looks terrible i hate it so much NF is probably the biggest reason to be honest, that is just my choice and I have wanted to tie my tubes since I was 18. There are also other genetic reasons, financial, and climate reasons. I might adopt kids or foster when I am at a more stable point. Would CTF be able to connect me, an adult, to a neurologist/specialist near me? I think they  have a search engine type deal, for people in the USA I dont know, Im sorry I dont have any advice for you - but Im the same age (24) F with a mild case. Tbh I just cope knowing that with whatever happens, no one really cares and we will all get old and ugly and die and none of this life will have mattered anyway. If your child does not inherit the mutation their children will not either. It is an autosomal dominant mutation so there is a 50/50 chance you will pass it on, but your children will either have it or they will not. You cannot be a carrier. There is always a chance a future child would develop a spontaneous mutation, but it cannot \u201chide\u201d in the gene pool like some other genetic diseases can. Just wanted to clarify. Thank you! That is exactly what I wanted to know!", "NF-1 &amp; CBD OIL So im 25, diagnosed at 6mo was wondering if anyone has tried obd oil for tumor growth or even pain. I ordered some originally for my insominia but then got to thinking if its used to stop or slow cancer tumors could it benefit us wotg nf?  I have NF1 also and have been using CBD Oil for sleep and pain. I also use a lotion with CBD in it that also helps me. The CBD seems to help me, but I have a severe case of NF so I am also pain meds. I just ordered a stronger CBD product that hopefully will help me sleep better. It might help with pain, but it is not going to slow tumor growth or prevent cancerous tumors. There is however 4-5 different drug trials of different pills that are showing 20-40% shirkage for tumors. My doctor who diagnosed me and has been seeing me for my neurofibromatosis for 20 years is looking to get me into one of them.\n\nI do not use CBD oil, but I do take two different pain medications.  I do not have NF1, my child does though. I do not think you will see slower tumor growth but it will not hurt trying. Some people still swear by Curcumin, I give my child that. There are studies going on right now to see how Selumetinib affects cutaneous neurofibroma growth. Fingers crossed that something useful comes out of that.  If you do not mind me asking, what for pain is it? I am interested in oil of lotion, but i am not sure if it is for me as my pain stems from damage done during operations, rather than the NF itself. I have over 500 plus tumors throughout my body and the pain is the worst in my thighs and lower back. I can only use the lotion on my thighs at the moment because I just had surgery and I have not had the opportunity to try it on my back. It seems to help me have some relief. I used it a lot after surgery because my leg pain got a lot worse because of the surgery.  thank you for the insight.  I have read a few anecdotes about mek inhibitors for cutaneous neurofibromas.  Both from patients in the trials for plexiforms and patients in the cutaneous trial. Not to get your hopes up but it sounds like it is going well.  The clinical trial page was also updated a couple months ago to add a qualification that patients seeing good results could remain on the trial longer than originally specified.\n\nHere is one such anecdote:\n\n\n CBD helps me with pain and anxiety but I have not noticed any tumor depressant benefits. ", "pituitary tumor and new shin tumor I have had the pituitary tumor for a few years now and i believe its getting worse because of my headaches. I also havent been able to walk much on my right leg due to apperently a small shin tumor and a displaced knee cap. if i get surgery itll be 18 (counting nerve blocks, and scopes) since 2011. Im miserable. my muscle relaxer stopped working it only helps me sleep.The gabapentin only made me gain weight barely helped with the pain. Hey. PM me if you want to talk.", "How early were you diagnosed? I (26M) have a father that has NF1. But from old pictures that I found of him, he did not start growing tumors until after at least 25. He had five siblings and at least one other had it as severely as he has.\n\nMy brothers, 29 and 27, have more cafe au lait spots than I do (I only have one) but they really have not shown any symptoms. Is it likely that we will grow tumors as well? 6 years old At 14 but I have had tumours since birth. My parents did not want me to have the testing done when I was a baby. 2 months old Not until I was 15, doctors actually did try to diagnose me sometime after I was born and then again when I was 9, but both times the results were inclusive. It was until I hit puberty that the on switch was  turned on. Around 7 or 8  I can still remember the Professor I saw in his white coat, and round glasses and moustache. and ran just remember hearing  von recklinghausen disease now known as neurofibromatosis. 7 years old, I am 51 now I was around 16 years old,  I had to go to the doctor  because i was sick or something,   but then  my doctor saw i had some \"funny  blue spots\"  on my skin he send me to a specialist  and then I coincidentally got my nf1 diagnosis. I was 32yrs old when finally diagnosed. 4 years old. My son was diagnosed from the genetic test before age 2 but I suspected when he was around one based on the number of cafe au pair spots. His pediatrician referred us to a geneticist who ran the tests. I think my parents said when I was 4. I have been on SSI since i was a small child. 6, am 37 now. NF is wildly unpredictable so there is no way to say what will happen when. Very early on Probably just after birth \nI am 43 now\nDo not go to the doctor too often but I am now having issues with my lower back\nMy son has NF also \nLots of freckles \nI would say it is pretty mild for us both 9 months old. I had rotavirus and when my parents took me in for that they discovers my NF. They suspected I had it as a baby but I did not get diagnosed until 21.\n\nI have a very mild form luckily My son was diagnosed at 6 months after an ER doc noticed his CALs and sent us for genetic testing. Diagnose at 10 but showed signs at 1-2. I have many spots on my body, I was a late walker and had to go to PT, OT and speech therapy till I was 11. But it all helped. 12 years cancer free and going strong. I only have small tumors on my head and very lucky for that. Not everyone who has NF has tumors all over. I know some people with NF2 and look normal. 2 months old I was three but confirmed when the blood test came out when I was eight. 5 years old in the early 90s. Multiple cafe au lait spots were what gave it away. My mom did not start growing fibromas on her skin until after 35, maybe 40. She was diagnosed a few years later. My daughter was diagnosed through genetic testing at about 15. Neither she nor I have visible fibromas, though we have had other symptoms related to NF1 our whole lives. My son (7) has not been tested yet. He has a spot on his cheek I have been watching that may be a fibroma. I was 18 years old. It is a bit weird because doctors noticed my cafe-au-lait-spots when I was 14 and in hospital because of sudden hypertension but I was only tested if I had McCune\u2013Albright syndrome. I have NF2, I was a clumsy child and hard of hearing. I got diagnosed with a 24. Neither of my siblings have presentd sympathy, just me and my mom. 20 years old. But I started feeling pain at around 16-17 and got formally diagnosed years later. I have about 20,000 tumors all over my body but not visible from the outside. They are spreading too.", "Ringing noise and sharp pain. NF1 here. I have this loud single tone ringing noise, more like an audible high pitched tone and then I feel a sharp pain sensation in my ear. In my left ear I already have the inner wall collapsed about 25%. Does anyone else suffer this? Did you goto the doctor about it?\n\nI have not gone to get an MRI in about 10-12 years now, So I know I need to go back. \n\nI would had trouble with pains in my back and most recently gastro trouble which I thought may be related but it seems to have gone away and now this issue happens about every few days. I have ignored it in the past, but now that pain in my ear just makes me want to scream.\n\n", "I never knew that this existed sweet. I Have NF1 when I was diagnosed, luckily I had a pediatrician who knew about it, as that led to my dad being diagnosed as well as my brother and eventually his two boys. They do not know if my dads mutated, it is possible he got it from his mom she passed from cancer, they said her tumors were abnormal. My sister lucked out as it skipped her. \n\nI have multiple plexiforms Fibromas one in my leg, that multiple doctors have not wanted to touch it for multiple reasons, and a couple in my back. \n\nScoliosis, which has led to multiple compression fractures. \n\nIt is crazy to think of the range at which this effects everyone even in my own family. My brother and nephews have basically no problems. Hello! I have NF1 diagnosed\nAt birth. No problems thus far thank God. I did have a pheyochromocytoma on my adrenal gland but it is been removed and all is well so far \u2764\ufe0f", "Is anyone else terrified to go to the beach or swimming pool? I know we should not let others dictate how we live our lives.. but in recent years my anxiety about being in public has spiked to pretty extreme measures.\n\nMy back is covered in hundreds of fibromas, so wearing a bikini is simply not an option in my mind. I used to be okay with wearing a bathing suit as it covers most of them, but in the past 2/3 years my confidence has taken a massive dip. I do not want the stares. I do not want the comments. \n\nIt is not fair to my partner, nor to myself. But I fly into a panic every time we talk about going on a holiday or even going to the local beach. How can I get over this? How does anyone get over this? People can be so mean. \n\nDoes anyone else have these feelings? How do you cope with it? Do you just say \u201cf*** it\u201d? I never go swimming and I live by the ocean.. I just cannot do it. I completely understand, even though I am heartbroken for you. \n\nI used to love going to the beach and swimming. I cannot imagine living close to a beach and not being able to go due to things out of our control. I got severely bullied when I was younger in high school. People who ask me, what is that shit on your back ? Which caused me to have low self esteem. Every time I go to the beach people would stare at me, I sometimes like to wear a top when I go swimming, but there are people out there that are understanding. The older I get the less I care because those people are just ignorant... I have hundreds of fibromas on my torso, couple on legs, I have really long surgical scar along my spine after scoliosis surgery. I used to afraid of peoples reaction on it. That they will assume it is some contractible disease and will ask about the scar. So I really understand your worries.\n\n**No one, really no one ever cared.** Only my OB and once dental surgeon asked what it is.\n\nSo I do not care either. If they are offended or horrified or scared by fibromas or the scar it is their problem, their problem only, not mine. I do not want to be restrained by others peoples worries when I am no threat to them. But it took me long years to acquire this attitude. Your story is an inspirational one! I think repeating to myself \u201cno one cares no one cares\u201d might be helpful. I will try to adopt it more as a mantra. Swim shirts are really common here in socal, they are spf shirts to prevent sunburn. Maybe that would help?\n\n  \n\n\nSending hugs. Wear what you will be happy in. I will not do it, unless I am with my closest friends and family members. I usually wear a t shirt, when I am swimming, but I still get those that stare!! It is best not to care what other people think of you, granted it is hard, but that what would be best for anyone regardless if they have a medical condition that changes their appearance. \n\nOne thing you might want to look into that maybe would make you feel more comfortable are swim shirts. They come in many different styles and colors. I agree. It is so easy to say we should not care what other people think but that takes a lot of continued work. \n\nI see people all the time in full coverage swim clothes. Swim shirts, cover-ups, ( Some people wear them because of body image, some for religious or skin care reasons. If you are worried about you or your partner's quality of life being affected by not going swimming, find an outfit you feel confident in. The reasons do not matter. Wear a rash guard? I have this one cafe au lait spot on my thigh which is more than 30 cm(basically covers my entire thigh almost). Its HUGE AS FUCK. I have many others but that one is the biggest. Till i was 13, i would wear swim suits and shorts too but after that(maybe because of adolescence) I got so conscious that i stopped wearing them entirely. For me the reason of getting conscious was that i thought my cafe au lait spots were not pretty and that 30 cm huge ass one was certainly not \"pretty\". I felt really ugly. \nBut i know, i thought(still think) like this about myself because in mainstream media there were not enough examples for people like us.\nSo i would suggest to you wear bikini or whatever you want to wear because you just do not know there might be a little girl somewhere who would have Nf (or maybe even not) who would look at you and feel confident about her body and accepther body because of you. \nI still cannot wear shorts as such, but i will also try to come out of this 30 cm is 11.81 inches I know it is a bot that convert to american units for americans lol Oh lol Throwaway account for obvious reasons.\n\n\nYes I hate it. I have got lots of small cals and some large ones and a slightly textured stomach. I am also not in the best shape - slight belly pooch etc, but I do not really care about that a whole lot. It is more the appearance of my skin that I get self conscious about. I have got it mildly compared to some, so I feel like shit complaining about it.\n\nAs a female it sucks. I bought my first bikini almost a year ago. But I have never worn it out in public - only paraded it around my place. I hate wearing rash guards and body suits etc. the only reason why I wear them is to hide. \n\nI do have an amazing partner who accepts me despite being far from his usual type (with or without nf). And he is the only one I would feel comfortable wearing it around. Would not even wear it around friends or family. To be honest I do not want to be anyone\u2019s example to feel confident about themselves. That in turn would make me feel worse about myself. I do not care if they are a child or an adult or otherwise. I just want to be another beach goer. And not be treated any different by any one - no matter what we have in common or not. Hmm, fair enough. Growing up I always wanted to go to the beach and pool. Any where outside really. \n\nMy mum had meany NFS on her face and body so mostly would stay inside the house.\nWhen I got older teenage this subconsciously past on to me even tho at that point I had none. \n\n\nNow I am older I will not go shirt less, but I will not stop living my life and I will go to the beach it took like 15 years to deal with it and now I think it is kind of silly I did not wihil still relating and understanding my anxiety", "Suggestions on what to ask the dermatologist? hi everyone!!\n\ni am finally seeing the dermatologist tomorrow, after 2 years! unfortunately, i come from a country where there are not any NF specialist. For those of you all fams who have seen a derm specialist before, what are the \u201cavailable treatments\u201d you guys were presented by your specialists? - wanting to ask to see if i could get any ideas to ask mine tomorrow \n\n- i was thinking of requesting for electrodessocstion for a few visible bumps on my arm, and prolly surgically removing a slightly larger one on my body. \n\nthank you!! Sorry about your situation, I am lucky enough that I am able to see a Neurofibromatosis specialist whose able to recommend surgeons to remove tumors.\n\nBut for my first surgery, was done by a surgeon in my hometown and not in the state of my specialist that was back when I was in highschool was done by a surgeon who lied to my parents saying that he had preformed surgery on others with nf, but when he cut my arm open he saw how difficult it was. He still preformed the surgery, but told my mom that he would never do another surgery on me again. For about six months my right arm had a numbing sensation going on and turned a shade of green. After that my other surgeries were all done by surgeons that my specialist hand picked at the hospital he works at.\n\nI am not telling you this to scare you, I just want to be sure that which ever surgeon does remove any tumors is familiar with Neurofibromatosis and knows what they are doing. I would not want things to be made worse for you.\n\nYou should also be aware that these tumors do grow back. I have had it happen. I have only had four surgeries down and they were all done because they were either done for preventative or because they were causing major issues. A good Neurofibromatosis specialist generally only likes doing surgery when it is absolutely needed, because of the difficulty in removing these tumors and for the fact they grow back.\n\nI hope your appointment goes well and wish you the best of luck. thankyou so much for your insightful reply! how about electrodessication? have i tried that? i have read from many sources that people with nf does rid some of this lumps for temporal purposes thoo I have never had electrodessication, never even heard of it before. I have only had four surgeries done, even though I have tumors all throughout my body.\n\n1. 2001 to remove tumors on my right lower arm (preventative)\n\n2. 2006 to remove tumors on my cervical spine (was pressing against my spine)\n\n3. 2014 to remove tumors on my upper right leg (was a high grade cancerous tumors)\n\n4. 2018 to remove tumor on my upper right arm (was a low grade cancerous tumors)\n\nIt was recently thought that I was going to need surgery again on my cervical spine, some of the tumors have grown back, but at my appointment earlier this month my specialist was happy with my balance and strength and felt that right now there are no issues and that we are going to keep an eye on things. He is hoping to put me on medication that has been approved by the FDA that will help shrink the tumors, we just need to go through some paperwork. \n\nIf you have any questions let me know. right right! i remember reading information on selumtinib! i will prolly ask my doctors about that tooo! i have some questions too but i guess it would be better if i pm you, if u do not mind:/ Which ever works for you, just be aware that right now the FDA has only approved selumtinib for children, but my doctor has already been able to have one of his adult patients approved, but he is hopeful he will be able to get me approved as well. He even told me that he thinks it stupid that it is not approved for both children and adult, since those children will grow up to be adults and still have Neurofibromatosis.", "Do you tell your friends about your NF? (25M) NF1 sufferer here, I have been wondering lately if there is a reason or motivation to telling my friends about my NF. I have almost entirely subcutaneous fibromas luckily so it is not super obvious, but I still have a fair number of bumps that are somewhat noticeable that I have never had anyone ask about. I am wondering if they are noticing my fibromas and never asking about them. I do not feel like I am being dishonest by not talking about it, but I am wondering if there is some benefit to doing so. To be honest I am also kind of afraid people will see me differently or worry unnecessarily about me when they do not need to.  \n\n\nWas wondering if anyone else had any other thoughts on sharing / not sharing your NF diagnosis with friends? mine are pretty noticeable so I have had a lot of friends ask about them. Everyone is known about mine since day one when I was diagnosed at 15, but at the end of the day it totally up to you if you want to talk about it with them. Yeah I have done mines very visible so had too. Only the closest ones I told friends about the NF and I have had friends ask me. I had surgery on face so the scar is there and people are curious. The friends who I have told have been and still are my friends from grade 4. The ones who have asked me waited until we were close enough and not right away when they saw the scar.\n\nI have had random people ask me though and it all starts around the same way \"Can I ask you a sensitive question ?\" Then I have had people just ask \"what happened to your face\"\n\nAlthough when I was younger I would not say anything in either case and just say I had an operation and not say why. Now that I am 23 i take it as an opportunity to educate them a Lil bit on what NF is because not many people know about it. I am not necessarily concerned about loosing friends because of it. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with choosing for when you are comfortable to tell people your truths. And that is for you to decide. Not them. Mine is not too noticeable. I have red marks all over my chest/back and some bumps on my body. I usually do not tell people until we have been friends for a while and I only talk about it if it comes up somewhat naturally in conversation. Otherwise I do not feel the need to I have not really told anyone about it. I am open about it to my close friends, but then again I do not have a ton of friends and am close with all the friends that I have. I only went into extensive detail about the disease with two of my friends though. I struggled for a long time, but by Junior year in HS I found that it was easier to be open about it instead of acting like nothing is wrong. I have told my closest friends. Its part of me. It does not define me...but its part of who i am and i share those things with my closest friends I am not Sarah without an NF Only if they ask. When you look at me you do not see that I have NF1 but all my friends know it since I need to go to the hospital for mri scans and I have to see a dermatologist and a neurologist. And I am happy they know it so I can talk about it with my friends.", "Just some health related question Just want to ask, (i have NF1), do you guys have this chronic cough that never goes away, and most of the time, its always like those kind of \"violent cough\"? I have been having this for almost 3 years and my doctors be like \"its normal\" :/ That does not sound normal to me. Time for a second opinion.  No this is not something I have. Would be a good idea to get it checked. Especially if you smoke.  i do not smoke though, but yea, i prolly should find another specialist for that. thanks!:) Next time your there ask then to test your oxygen level while your active. It could possibly  mean oxygen  level is dropping.  They just prescribe you a inhaler.. I guess i could ask my doctor bout that during my next visit! thanks man:)", "Foundation for textured skin? Has anyone found a foundation that works for textured skin? Liquid foundation makes then stand out more where certain powder foundations do not. I hear Two Faced: Born this Way is supposed to be good but it is a liquid. Anyone know any specific foundations or a combination of items that would help make the nfs slightly less noticeable? Do you first conceal the really bright/dark areas first, then apply a light coat of liquid foundation. After waiting for the liquid to dry, about two minutes or so,  apply  a pressed powder foundation on top. I am not the  NF person but skin is skin and most people have skin that is multi textured. -I would look up make up artist too, you can use color correction primer (green, orange, or purple) to help even the color out. \n-I would even go to your local beauty store in the US-Ulta or Sephora to see, I bet they see various skin conditions all the time There are also special colour foundation sticks for marks, or freckels, maybe that would work too? It is like a lipstick but then to cover it up. I do not know if it is different in every country but here it is a green one. \n\nI do not know if it also works for nfs I don;t use make-up but that is just because the make-up sometimes irritates my skin MAC powder foundation helps (On top of your regular foundation) I would recommend a light dewy base with strategic spot concealing to reduce overall skin texture. To draw attention away from texture, one can also use a bold eye or lip.

Nearly all my tumors are a purple color. I only have 3 that are not that color. Just wanted to see if anyone else has this too :) Yes. Those are more difficult to remove btw. If you end up having surgery, please make sure you see a specialist.  I have one under my armpit that it is purple and deep. Ugh I hate it. I just had a nice deep purple one removed Tuesday from behind my knee that I had since kindergarten or first grade. I remember saying to my teacher \u2018I have a mosquito bite on my leg.\u2019 She sent me to the nurse and my parents had to explain things to both the school and myself. Kind Of felt weird parting with it in a way since it was the first one I remember having but that sucker hurt so bye bye lol Coincidently I just had one removed Tuesday lol and yep saw a surgeon familiar and experienced  with the disease. He did say that it was deeper than he expected but besides some pain when the local did not quite reach. He had to re-numb me a few times lol \n :) Yes!

I am a 27yo female and I was diagnosed as a child at least 2nd grade that I know of with NF but my mother told me she stopped taking me  because she felt like it was unneeded as it is unpreventable. But now I would like to get myself into a doctor I do not know where to start! Some of my bumps on my back have been very painful lately and I have no clue what to do. I live in a town where the resources are very limited. If you are in the United States this should help you. I am sorry your mom stopped taking you. I was diagnosed when I was 15, I will be 37 next months. I have been seeing the same specialist for the last 20plus years. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. It is very important to keep this condition in check as it effects all of us differently, some of us have a minor case of it and others like me have a more severe case of it.\n\n I live in USA Georgia and the only thing that came up was a children\u2019s doctor, but I am taking my 1 year old son to see that exact doctor at the end of the month because they believe I may have passed it on to him. I am hoping to ask her questions too about myself. Do you think that would be too weird for an adult to ask a pediatric doctor questions? You should absolutely ask questions! I would also ask your son\u2019s doctor if he knows of a neurologist in the area that specializes in NF1. I do not think so, the doctor I see, sees both children and adults. This doctor may also be able to recommend a doctor that you can see for yourself if they do not continue seeing their patients with nf after they turn 18-22. Hello, \n\nFirst of all, I am terribly sorry ro hear about your condition, but you are not alone and any questions you may have, this community is here for you. Secondly, your mother made a terrible mistake and I really think you should talk to her about it.\n\nAlthough it is \"unpreventabole\" it is not \"unstoppable\" in that the earlier actions are taken the better. You should definitely go visit an neutrologist for a check-up asap. Absolutely not. They are experts in the field and professionals who choose their career because they want to help people.\n\nI was diagnosed with NF early and had the same neurologist for years, but when I turned 18 I had to move from the children's hospital and lost all contact with this fantastic man who had been there throughout my whole journey. Anyways, last year it was suggested I should have optic nerve decompression-surgery and shocked as I was, I went to ask this old children's doctor for advice and guidance (he was the only person I could think of who could give me real advice) and he was more than happy to help me.  :)\n\nI know this is just anecdotal and it may vary from doctor to doctor, but I cannot see why it would be an issue.", "The Ugly Face of Disability Hate Crime - BBC Documentary I do not know if this been posted here yet  but interesting video.\n\nI just feel lucky that I do not have it has bad as he does but I do know how he feels about how people will judge you.\n\nEdit: \n\n", "Hello Hey everyone I am Catie. I have neurofibromatosis types 1 and 2. Add me. Also i have a support group on Facebook  neurofibromatosis support group. Send request to join Hi, can you post the link to the support group? I think so give me a minute and i will see if i can.  Please feel free to copy link and have other nfers send request to join. Would love to have anyone with or without nf but they either have to be friends with people who have neurofibromatosis or family members. Cant just have someone join the group that have no idea about neurofibromatosis:) Thanks. We also have a discord community.  Have you recieved an official genetic diagnosis of both types?\n\nThe likely hood of having both by random mutation is almost immeasurably  small. Since they are not linked on a genetic level, having one would not have an impact on having the other. AFAIK there has never been a confirmed case of a patient with both types\n\nThe majority of medical support for the two overlaps quite a bit, but if a doctor has specifically told you that you have both I would strongly encourage a second opinion to ensure you are receiving the most accurate care possible. I have both types of neurofibromatosis i am one of the rare cases. Please do not question my diagnosis. Its not okay. Its rude. I know what i have ive known what I have for 31 years. I had  genetic testing done and it was 100 percent confirmed that i have both types of neurofibromatosis. Have a nice night", "What is the likelihood of becoming partially-entirely deaf or blind? I have nf1, and was diagnosed at 6 months. I was a new mutation, and I have got a pretty mild case. I am 19, but have not had anything too serious happen, the worst I have got is a couple tumors on my spine, a slight curvature, and what was supposed to be a jaw curvature/misalignment, that was corrected when I was 8-10 years old (thanks, childhood dentist!) Anyway, I know that as a nf patient progresses in life and age, they could get worse symptoms and side effects from their condition. So I was wondering what the likelihood of becoming partially-entirely deaf or blind at some point in my life (I have perfect vision and hearing as of my last doctors appointments). This is probably the possibility about this condition that scares me the most. Any answer would be appreciated. NF2er here, so your mileage may vary, but I have always been told by docs (and found similar results in researching on my own) that it is so person-specific it is hard to give a set probability. Some people might go their whole lives without much of a problem. Others have it far worse. \n\nPersonally speaking, I lost hearing in my left ear at 19 from NF2, and my doctor at the time told me to immediately learn sign language and how to read lips, as it was \"almost a guarantee\" that I would be deaf within 5 years.\n\nAlmost 15 years later, I still have perfect hearing in my good ear. I do have an acoustic neuroma (a double one, no less) on that ear, but I have my hearing tested yearly along with my yearly MRI scans, and we watch it closely. No growth since it was first spotted. \n\nTo top it off, I have been blind in one eye since birth (unrelated to NF2), and I have a small NF2 tumor on the left eye, which is not impacting vision yet, but is another one that we watch suuuuuper closely, for obvious reasons. \n\nAll this is to say - I think just focusing on what senses you do have, and being vigilant goes a long way. Preparation can be helpful if you can handle it. I took three years of ASL in college (language credit, woohoo!) but am nowhere near fluent now so many years later and would have to start fresh should I lose the rest of my hearing. Do I worry about one day going deaf/blind or both? Absolutely! But I do not let the worry about that future keep me from savoring what I have today. \n\n*big hugs* I am 27 and on my second pregnancy (I went through PGD IVF to ensure my kids do not have NF). I still have perfect hearing and sight. I have a pretty mild case of NF too. My\nMom and brother have it worse but still have good sight and hearing. I think it just varies person to person. Nf1 here. No one blind or deaf in my family yet.  How much did the PGD IVF cost you?  Around $20,000. Insurance covered my medications once or twice.  I am 35 And my mom also had it. So does my sister. I believe my mom was the first mutation in the family. Her father did not have it, neither did her mother and her siblings also did not have it. So far, no one blind or deaf. My sight has been deteriorating, but that because I use the computer all day, plus it is very very little.  I also intend to do this when I become pregnant - how is the process? What does insurance cover? Is it all out-of-pocket?  So it is sucky to do. I would not have been able to do it without my husband he was a great support and he gave me all my shots.\n\nI had to do two rounds of IVF. The first round all embryos were affected. Insurance covered that round of medications which was a couple thousand dollars. \nThe part where they retrieve the eggs was very painful to me afterwards.\n\nThe second round we got two embryos that were unaffected. Im pregnant with the second embryo. And my first son is 18 months. \n\nWe also had to travel 4 hours to get to the IVF clinic. Luckily my brother lived nearby so we saved money on food and a place to stay. \n\nI would never do the process again because it was long, uncomfortable and emotional. But it is so worth it in the end.   I am 33 and my hearing is still great and other then a lazy eye that I was born with my eye sight is fine.  You should have your doctors keep an eye on the tumors around your spine. Back in 2007 I had mine removed as they were crushing against my spine and I could have woken up one day and not be able to move.  I have been keeping an eye on it. I have a brain/spine MRI every few years, to make sure everything's alright. The doctors said they do not think they will really change much. And gosh, that must have been a scary experience, being told you may not be able to walk if you did not get tumors removed. My doctor makes me have my MRIs down once a year. I had one last week, then two this week. So I should be good for another year. It was a little scary being told that, but it was just something I have gotten used to. Wow. Best of luck to you \n Thank you. I will see my doctor in April to go over the results. ", "Skull Base Surgery (NF2) I have Neurofibromatosis Type II (NF2) and am having skull base surgery to partially remove an acoustic neuroma in a couple of months. I am having an auditory brainstem implant (ABI) put in during the same procedure. Just a side note: I have lost all, if not most, of my hearing already. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was wondering if anyone that has experienced this, or something similar, could give me an idea of what to expect in terms of:\n\n* **Chance of permanent facial nerve damage following surgery**\n* **Anecdotes regarding the recovery process:** How long until facial weakness fully improves, what areas of the body will be temporarily numbed, if any, following the procedure, etc.\n* **Benefits from ABI:** How well does it work/help? I have a cochlear implant (CI) on the opposite side of the prospective ABI side, but the tumor on the CI side has done too much damage for me to really benefit.\n* **Permanent adverse effects** resulting from surgery that I should be aware of regardless of the chances of them occurring\n\nI appreciate the opportunity to get this information. Thank you in advance for taking time to read this. Something I can answerfinally ... lol\n\nI have had this exact surgery;\n\n* paralysis - the surgery left the left side of my face completely paralyzed, even my left can no longer focus\n\n* benefits from ABI - bone for me, when it does work it just makes beeps and boops .. it is nothing like hearing, it is all R2D2 bs. \n\n* I no longer use the abi, it would work sporadically, and when it did it caused vertigo\n\nTLDR: I dont recommend an ABI at all. The surgery has caused numerous complications for me\n\n Where was your procedure done? I could PM you about that if you prefer. Thanks for responding! You can PM me and I can get into more detail I have had two tumor removals and two ABIs implanted. In answer to your questions:\n\n* The ABIs have been absolutely incredible, and they are only getting better. I also had almost no hearing before surgery. The ABIs have taken a couple of years of practice, but my hearing is so much better than it used to be. I can even hear some music now, and talk on the phone. I could not do that for at least 5 years before the surgery, when the tumors were starting to affect my hearing. Also, Cochlear is now working with Apple, and there is this amazing syncing ability with an iPhone/iPad.  I have not upgraded yet, but it looks incredible.\n* The first surgery ended up causing some wild fluctuations in my blood pressure. 5 years later, they are starting to go away. No one is quite sure why it happened in the first place.\n* I did have facial paralysis after my first surgery, and the implanted nerve never regenerated. A couple years later I saw Tessa Hadlock at Mass General. She has some amazing procedures, and she has given me largely functional facial function again.\n* I have also had some more hand weakness. My hands were weak beforehand, but the surgery made the weaker. I should be doing more occupational therapy to work on that.\n* Recovery takes a couple of weeks. The first few days you are in ICU, and then you move to the regular hospital.\n\nFeel free to ask me anything else, either here or via DM. Good luck! Hi!\n\nMy grandfather had surgery similar to yours, about 20 years ago. He lost hearing in one ear, and his balance is a bit dodgy and never fully recovered (but he is nearing 80 now so..). It mostly affected his left side, his right side is relatively fine. They flew out doctors from the US to my home country to perform it, btw. \n\nHe did not suffer any other adverse events, though his recovery took a while (months) since he was in his late fifties when he had his tumor removed. Techniques have only gotten better since then, so I really hope it works out for you! My dad had a similar surgery and had a stroke during it. He never fully recovered from it, was unable to eat following it (he used a GI-tube the rest of his life. He also never benefited from the ABI. I am not trying to scare you but I do want you to have these facts.  UPDATE:\n\nI just recently had my surgery on Thursday, December 13th of last week. The procedure was very successful. I was told that 90% of my left-side acoustic neuroma was removed prior to ABI implantation and abdominal fat graft. I have some facial weakness and asymmetry on the left side of my face, which was to be expected. Very minimal and I do not believe there is any paralysis. I was told that I am expected to fully recover.\n\nI was discharged after 4 days in post-operative recovery. I can walk unassisted (albeit with caution) and perform regular household/daily activities (supervised for good measure). The outcome so far has been incredible I think. I have not experienced any new loss of sensation anywhere else throughout my body. Minimal dizziness is present, but is disappearing. My sense of taste is off but is improving I think. I will be getting to vestibular/physical therapy this week to work on balance, which is not much different compared to before surgery at this time.\n\nI think the objective was ultimately reached with this procedure. The goal was to remove as much tumor as possible without compromising facial nerve function. I am very fortunate and am looking forward to getting myself back to normal. My ABI will be activated in several weeks after my incision sutures are removed. Crossing my fingers that I benefit from it, but I had nothing to lose as my ability to hear was already absent bilaterally prior to surgery.\n\nThank you to everyone in this sub who took time to read and even provide feedback regarding my concerns about surgery. I appreciate how I am able to gain insight for situations such as these. Here is to not having surgery for a while! The right side will continue to be monitored regularly and already includes a cochlear implant that I do not greatly benefit from.\n\nIf there are any questions, I will do my best to address them.

Is there another subreddit or somewhere else I can go for help or questions?\n", "Running Tests for NF1 on our Son. Hello there. I have been a bit of a wreck today. I took my five-year-old son in for a check-up and asked the doctor about several spots he has all over his body. They are CALs, and he has at least 7 of them more than a centimeter in diameter. I had looked them up online and found stuff about NF1, but tried to not worry about it because WebMD is always scary. He also has freckling/discoloring on his neck, groin, and armpit. He has complained about the occasional headache and of his hip hurting of all things. Neither my husband or I have been diagnosed or shown signs of it that we know of, but then again, we do not really know what those signs would be and certainly have not been watching for it. \n\nThe doctor removed all of my nonchalance by becoming concerned when I showed him the spots. He drew a blood sample for testing (in my anxious state, I should have asked specifically where the test was being done and what exact type of test it is). Next week, we are scheduled with an ophthalmologist and then we have an MRI. I am really nervous about sedating him for the MRI. The doctor, for all of his concern, seemed to have very little knowledge of the disease and even went to do research on it during the appointment. The pathologist told me she had to look it up on the internet to see what sort of blood test it was. So I am not sure what to think of their judgement.\n\nI know we cannot get any real answers until the tests are done, but I guess I am just reaching out for advice/reassurance/anecdotal support. I have read that a lot of children my son's age are diagnosed just based on the spots and freckling, since other symptoms do not come until later. From your experience, is it likely that our son will be diagnosed? I know it is incredibly variable (which is all the more frightening), but what can we expect? If it is not NF1, what could it be?\n\nTL;DR: My five-year-old's check up has turned into a wave of anxious testing. He has CALs and freckling, but not much else. Occasional headaches. What can we expect? \n\nEdit: Thank you all so much for your kind words, encouragement, advice, and the gold! I am so glad I have found this wonderful community, whether he is diagnosed or not.

They diddnt want to do it again. \nThey did see 'something' diddnt know what but that couldnt be it and never heard about that again even when they said they would look into it.

The doctors at Johns Hopkins prescribed me all sorts of things, from Butalbital, to Tramadol, to Topamax. None of it really did much, but after doing a bit of research I tried Kratom(Mitragyna Speciosa), a natural botanical that is related to coffee and has powerful analgesic properties, and since then my pain has not been a factor in the quality of my life.

I know I should not solicit medical information/advice from Reddit but I do not think I can go to a doctor/hospital and thought I would ask here. I think I have NF1 but I am not sure, I have multiple cafe au lait spots on my body as well as freckling on my armpits. I do not think I have neurofibromas, I am not entirely sure what they look like, I have maybe 2 very small slightly raised moles that might be neurofibromas? I also do not know if this is related but I did/do have a quarter sized growth?/ slightly raised mole on my neck that was biopsied and came back as non cancerous, but I do not think that is a symptom of NF1. Anyways other than the cafe au lait spots and freckling I do not think I have any other symptoms of NF1 but is it still possible I have it? And will it get worse from here? I just turned 21 if that makes a difference. I would just really appreciate anyone\u2019s advice/experience with the disease.  seems like it could be nf1 but it is best to have it checked if you have not Definitely could be it and it would be good to see a specialist. Some people have really mild cases like this, and it might not effect you much. However, you will want to find out before you have kids as you could pass it along if you do have it. go to the doctors keep going back cause for year's no one would tell me I have NF. Best thing I can say go to the doctors do not just go based on cafe ole spots Only a doctor can diagnose you with nf. I would speak with your doctor about the spots. While you should not attempt to self diagnose, I would be suspicious enough to pursue a professional opinion. I know medical infrastructure can be scarce in certain parts of the world. Do you have at least 6 CALS of at least 15mm? CALS associated with NF1 also tend to have cleaner borders than those found in the general population. The CALS and freckling is enough for a doctor to clinically diagnose you. Depending your age, the lack of visible neurofibromas is expected. A lot of people get them in their 20s and 30s, with women often getting an influx during pregnancy. The last consideration is that you could have a mosaic case of NF1, which is very common in spontaneous mutations. Mosaic cases only impact some of the cells in the body and can ever be limited to one segment. I hope this info helps and you are able to see a doctor. Definitely go to the doctor, depending on where you are located some doctors may have little to no experience with people with NF because of how rare it is. Definitely call ahead if you are unsure if your doctor has experience in treating people with NF. If you are in a big/major city your chances are good that they might know about it, however, if you are in a small city/town it makes it more unlikely that they would even know what NF is.   \n\n\nI have NF1 and I can tell you my experience that I have had thus far. My mom who also has NF  had a pretty good feeling right as I was born that I had some type of NF because the size of my head was larger than the norm. As I started to grow up I had cafe au lait spots appear on my body. Once I started school and they would do the yearly vision test was when we found out that I was severely colorblind and failed that test every time I had to take it over the next couple of years. Once I started high school I started having extreme pain when I would get hair cuts in a certain area. Come to find out there was a neurofibroma under the skin that was causing the extreme pain. So I had surgery to remove the spot as well as 3 other smaller spots under the skin on the side of my neck that was not causing me any trouble, but the doctor wanted to get them checked just in case. Spots got tested and came back negative.   \n\n\nA couple of years later in 2018, I started having severe pain in my left leg. It was a constant squeezing sensation. The pain was so severe it would wake me up in the middle of the night. I tried muscle rub, pain meds, pressure, anything I could find to try and alleviate the pain. I spoke with my family doctor about it and he was not sure what was causing it so he just prescribed me some pain medicine which obviously did nothing. It took some doing but eventually, I was able to get an MRI done of my leg and that was when they saw a tumor about the size of a sweet potato compressing the femoral nerve about even with my hip. So I went and met with a surgeon in town and he stated that he was uncomfortable doing the procedure because it was not something he had a lot of experience in and if he was not 100% certain about something he usually did not attempt, which I respect. So he referred me to a surgeon about an hour away at the bigger university hospital. Met with the surgeon and had the operation done. The tumor got tested and it was classified as an MPNST tumor. I get radiation done o the area after it had healed up slightly to ensure that it would not grow back in that area. About 6 months later i started feeling the same type of pain but in my right leg this time. Went to my doc and he thought it was plantar fasciitis. I knew it was not but he would not listen to me. Eventually, i was able to get an MRI done of my right leg and that was when they noticed another tumor at the back of my leg above the knee on the sciatic nerve. Once again i went to see the surgeon who performed my last surgery and got that one successfully removed. That tumor was tested and came back with the same result MPNST. I did the same thing, radiation on the area and stuff. Then in April of 2020 not even a month after i finished radiation, there was a large knot in the back of my head that looked like the size of a softball. Once again i go back to the university hospital and find out this one is growing thru my skull and putting slight pressure on my brain which explained the bad headaches i was having. Had surgery for that to be removed in June 2020 and then had radiation done on the area yet again. That was when they decided to give me a full-body PET scan to see if there are any other potential problem areas that need to be monitored. They notice multiple spots in my lungs, one spot on my ribs, and another spot in my skull. So they decide to have me start Chemo in September 2020. I would go every 3 weeks for treatment and be admitted for each treatment for 3 days because of how long the medicine would be on an IV drip. The last treatment i had was in January 2021. We ran some scans to see how the areas looked. The spots in my lung along with the fluid that had started to build up along my right lung (Different story for a different day) had shrunk and the fluid was all but gone. The spot in my skull had very little change but that is because with that sarcoma being in the bone it takes much longer to show change. So i was left with the option to continue with the chemo ive been on as well as radiation for the skull sarcoma or go another route. Because of other factors, i have going on at the time i went with another route.   \n\n\n  \nSorry for the long answer and my life story but i just wanted to share it with you so that you can see what i have dealt with just incase you happen to have something similar.

I am also very insecure about the way I look even tho I have no tumors just a slightly big head Omg. This is me. I dont think I am autistic but i feel like i come across like it. I am always paranoid about how I am standing, if I am walking funny, if I do the right facial expressions or talk correctly. I am so glad I am not the only one. Today, due to the state of our world, most people have anxiety. \nWhat have you been told about yourself?\nSeveral people ARE in the autistic spectrum but their family's were able to help them forward (when there was no name for autiism). \nAll though you are older your can still have testing by a medical professional (not a Phd) and you may be able to get some clarity about your feelings. Same how old r u Ever since I first read about Asperger\u2019s I have felt I could potentially have it. It is a mild form of autism that can easily go undiagnosed. Sometimes it takes me a while to pick up on social cues and understand people. I feel like an idiot sometimes, especially after it is been explained multiple times but it just does not sink in. \n\nPS better to have a slightly big head than a too small head \ud83d\ude1c I often feel the same way, I feel like my brain is constantly telling me I am stupid, and that I do not understand things. I have a terrible memory most of the time too which does not help at all. To add on my parents do not really help they never say that you can do this by yourself for example I am going to collage next fall and they keep telling me get as much help as you need when I know I can handle a everything without help It is a parents job to worry. Having been through college, there were many things I should have gotten extra help on. The learning disability side of NF is the hardest for me. Online college was my saving grace and the first time in my entire life I actually did well.....even in maths. \n\nI wish you all the best in your college journey....and if you need clarification on anything do not hesitate to reach out to your professors. Most university level professors do not mind helping someone out as it actually shows you are interested and care about your grades. It also ensures the professor knows your name and usually helps with your grades. I feel your struggle. All through school when I had an IEP (Individual Education Program) People tried to tell me I had autism or ADHD because they did not understand NF. I have also found myself being insecure about my looks due to scars from my surgeries. My advice is to just know that we all have something that we do not like about ourselves but it makes us who we are. (Hope that does not sound to cliche) Rip me toooo! i would very often see myself on my friends\u2019 insta stories and i will be like... man is this how i actually laugh, or is this how i look like when i am surprised by something, bla bla... :/ it kind of sucks... to be honest, i am glad that it is mandatory to put on masks right now, so i can actually feel more \u201ccomfortable\u201d with my overall outlook:/ Oh gosh yes.  \n\nThis is a  NF thing.

There are a few documented instances of plexiforms regressing but all cases mention incorrect first measurement as a probable cause.\n\nA recent study showed that eating a polyphenol rich diet with curcumin supplementation reduced the size of participants' cutaneous and plexiform neurofibromas, but, the sample size was tiny (4 different groups of 3). Yeah, I had a tumor on my neck, and it is shrunk now, it is less than half the size, and my MRI reports say reduced size in my brain tumors  Mine did!!  Your what did what?

I noticed that soon after they injected the contrast I started itching on a neurofibroma. I was trying to refrain from scratching because I did not want to move but I scratched it a little. But it only got worse and worse I told myself I do not care I am going to scratch and it just got itchier and itchier. I noticed (by touch) that it seemed to have swelled. When I got out and looked like 3inches around the area was really red and the neurofibroma was larger, very swollen and really really hard. I was wondering if something like this has happened to anyone while getting an MRI. It is not uncommon to have a reaction to contrast. Did you let the MRI staff know right away? Be sure to contact your doctor to let them know as well. I have had contrast before and never had a reaction to it. It is possible you might be allergic to it. It would be good to mention to your doctor about your reaction to the contrast. In the future when your in the mri  and have a reaction to any kind of medicine or injection they give you, to let them know right away by using the panic squeeze thing they give you. I did she just brushed it off as nothing \ud83d\ude11. I also had an appointment with my neurologist/ NF specialist right after for the results. He was not sure. It just got back to normal not too long ago (about 8 hrs after the MRI). I let her know as soon as she pulled me out (it happened towards the end). She just brushed it off as nothing \ud83d\ude11. My neurologist/ NF specialist was not sure but made a note of it. I started off years ago getting small reactions like that. I cannot get the contrast now though, my reactions over time became too much. I would bring it up with a dr again, or at least ask them to make a note of it in your chart so everyone is prepared for the next time. For a while I was made to take a benadryl 15 minutes before any scans so perhaps they will advise somthing similar. Oh ya...NF1..is itchy enough...if were football players they would be a lot more concerned about the reaction. \nYou have to be an advocate for yourself. That sounds awful. I sorry that happened to you. It does not make me feel itchy or cause swelling but it makes me feel incredibly woozy and nauseous and I need help to my feet/walking afterwards. It sounds like you are allergic to the contrast. It is not an NF thing, some people are just allergic. Sorry that happened to you. Out of curiosity, if it was just the one neurofibroma, was it near the injection site? \ud83e\udd17\ud83d\udc9c It was on my upper chest (shoulder length) so it the neurofibroma was in the MRI machine. It was actually my very first one that was removed (more than 15yrs ago) and has a couple tiny ones growing around it. I do not thing anyone made a note. I will tell my primary care physician to make a note. Thank you for your feed back \ud83d\ude0a So true \ud83d\ude14 I just had an MRI with contrast a few days ago, and still do not feel. well.

I did not notice anything four or fives days ago.\nIs it possible for it to grow this big in just a few days? I would really appreciate your answers based on your experiences. Have to say as everyone is NF is different I have had one grow in about a week before It is different for everyone. Some tumors may take as little as a year to grow back, others may take five years or more and some may never grow back. Maybe its scar tissue? Can it be as hard as the tumor was? I know that everyone is NF is different, I was just curious if this can happen How much did it grow? \n\nAlso I am sorry about that :( Thank you, at least I can be prepared. You are welcome, I wish you the best. A little bit bigger than a chickpea. Thanks, I am sorry you are having to deal with the same thing. :( I saw an episode of dr pimple popper where she removed a lipoma (iirc) and there was a hard bit in there.

Can we kill them by starving them to death? \n\nHere is \"food for thought\"  not NF related but damn interesting. Your brain (and body) can run off ketones (as in a keto diet) yet these articles keep claiming you will die without glucose.  No.  If you research carnivore diet and keto diet, you will find a huge community of zero-carb, zero-glucose people surviving for years. I have been keto for 2 1/2 years now. Many positive changes in my body but I am not certain that it will affect tumor growth. My pet theory is that it helps. I would love to see research on it. NF2, at least, is related to fluid which comes out of nerve endings. This is not, IMHO, related to food intake - although a healthy and complete diet always helps general health.\nKeep in mind that, to the body, NF2 tumors are not \"a negative\". That is, they are very unlike cancer....they are more like having a low platelet count or thin blood where (the blood of the nerves leaks out and causes tumors)......\nSo it is a mutation - not a immune or health disorder which can be changed by diet. I am not speaking to NF1 since I know nothing about it. What sustains the fluid, then? Merlin (the gene) is a tumor suppressor. So normal people have that normal gene and it stops tumors from forming. NF2 means that gene does not stop tumors from forming.\n\nThese genes are proteins of a sort. Put in layman's terms, you would die before you starved your body of enough proteins to make the nerves stop doing their thing. No. Read the article. If you do not consume enough carbohydrates in your diet, your body will synthesize the glucose you need. Not eating these carbohydrates means that there is less carbohydrates for your body to use, and it uses energy to create the carbohydrates it needs to feed itself and survive. This is great for weight loss, but has absolutely no effect on the molecule that transports glucose to cells. The cell will get the glucose it wants by taking the glucose your body is creating to feed itself. Not feeding yourself carbohydrates has no effect on the chemical engineering of cancer.  You also have to look at the vitamins and minerals being absorbed in the body. Im no expert.", "I think I am growing more plexiform on my back but I am not sure.

I have not had an MRI in about 10 years now ( if that matters). When I was younger the migraines that I got were extremely sever, however as I aged they mellowed. The only two external growths that I have had we are on both of my elbows and they disappeared as quickly as they appeared. That is about it, if you have any questions do not hesitate to ask! Hey! \n\nSo happy to hear that you are doing ok! My son is two and has NF1.

My school experience had rough and smooth patches. I definitely struggled in some subjects and excelled in others. We noticed around the time we discovered that I had NF. \n\nI never had any behavioral issues. \n\nAnd I am a little shorter then average height. \n\nHope this helps! Yes this helps a lot! Thank you so much and happy NF awareness month! Why have not you had an MRI is so long? I have MRIs done at least once a year, mostly full body scans, as tumors are throughout my body. I was diagnosed 20 years ago in 1999. I also has learning problems in school I was diagnosed with dyslexia when I was nine. However it is anyone guess if the neurofibromatosis is the result of that, when my dad was nine he was diagnosed with a learning disability and was actually held back in third grade, I never was held back in any grade.\n\n I should also note that neither one of my parents had neurofibromatosis, but there is a possibility on both side of my family that there may have been an occurrence. My great grand father, my maternal grandmas father, he might have had it. My dad remembers his grand father have growths on his neck. Then on my moms side of the family, she has a distant cousin who had growths as well removed from their neck.\n\nI would say my height is pretty average I am 5\u20194, I am the oldest out of four siblings, my two youngest siblings about both taller then me, one is a sister and the other is a brother, out other sister who is number after me, is much shorter than all of us, she is 5\u20190 and no she has no medical condition. I was the only on born with neurofibromatosis. As I got older the headaches and migraines started becoming rarer occurrences. Before I stoped getting them id have multiple incapacitating migrants a month now ( and at the point when I stoped) I get maybe one or two a year. We felt that the tumors were not growing. Hmm interesting, I do not think anyone in my family has had it up to me. Although we can only trace our family back to my great grand parents on either side. However I think it would be very hard for it to be passed as a recessive gene for as many generations until I received it. Mine are always growing and in both 2014 and 2018 I have had tumors turn cancerous that needed to be removed. And tumors I have had removed have grown back. I have never had migraines, I do have the occasional headache, but nothing big.

Even without insurance I believe the kit would have cost me 200 dollars with insurance it was less than half that. Relative to cost of most medical stuff that is cheap.\n\nTalk to your doctor and they may either order the kit for you or set you up with a geneticist who will set you up.\n\nThe testing is easy. Its a saliva test that you just fill up a tube with spit and send it back. It would be best to see a neurologist, if your primary can refer you to one that would be a plus, As a warning\u2014some health insurance companies (mine, anyway) will only test if you have at least two symptoms/risk factors. \n\nIn my case, my only symptom was/is the caf\u00e9 spots. I qualified for testing because a family member had tested positive. \n\nMy kids, on the other hand, do not qualify for testing because they have no symptoms (even though they have a literal 50% chance of NF1) As I said in my other comment, The kits are not that expensive relative to my other medical costs.

It plays when there is nothing on. This is NF2 that I have, BTW The surgeons filled the cluster gap with the music? Tinnitus can manifest in many ways, it is not always a shrill beep/tone. For me, sometimes my tinnitus sounds like a bongo drum in a washing machine. Maybe this is your manifestation of tinnitus.\n\nFor clarification, I have had both auditory nerves removed, so this \"sound\" is purely created by my brain. This must be my right ear. Left ear still is working I have nf2 too, and underwent the same hearing nerve surgery and sometimes i hear an high pitched sound, like one of those dog whistles, but i believe that is pretty normal. You saying that you hear actual music?? That sounds neurological to me (no expert), you could try to get an mri scan to check other parts of your brain Can confirm. I have had tinnitus for over 20 years following NF2/VS removal. Most of the time, 99% or more, it is the shrill stuff, but on a few occasions I have had music-like tones.

I am in the states but it seems like the average additional cost of PGD here is about 6k. That is what we were quoted. The IVF cost varies a lot by region here though and unfortunately I live in a very every expensive area for it. It is completely not an option for us.

I was told by the geneticist that i needed to be screned for cancer especially breast cancer earlier as well as letting my neurologist know. However besides that the i have no other issues besides hearing loss (which my ENT) said was due to a sever sinuis infection that i took to long to come in feom treatment. And i have polycystic ovarian syndrom (pcos), asthma (since birth) and anemia, an just allergy and sinus problems.\n\nGoogle has been scary especially aince i only see the external symptoms and not much information that can happen to a person without the skin tumors etc.\n\nSo ANY help would be appreciated. If possible I would seek a Neurofibromatosis specialist, I have been seeing one since I was 15, which was when I was diagnosed. That was over twenty years ago. I generally have MRIs done every 1-3 years. I have only had four surgeries related to my Neurofibromatosis, the last two in 2014 and 2018 were to remove tumors that had turned cancerous in my right arm and leg. Both tumors were removed and I was good to go. Since June I have been on Koselugo, my specialist was able to get special approval for me to be on it, since it is only been fda approved for children.\n\nIf you have any questions let me know. Talk to people who have it. Never and I mean never read google since it will drain your ability to function. I am sorry you have been handed a genetic diseases diagnosis without the counselling of a genetic counsellor or an appointment with an Nf 1 specialist. Your geneticist could have gone into more details about what NF1 is and what it is means for your health.\n\nThe Nf1 gene,  called neurofibromin , is a gene involved in many cellular pathways and it regulates several phases of the cell life cycle. It is mainly know for its role in downregulating a pathway called RAS which is involved in cell proliferation. If NF1 is mutated , RAS is overactive, and this way we develop tumours because cell will not stop dividing.  These tumours can be cutaneous, subcutaneous, plexiform neurofibroma (you have these from birth, if you do not have one now, you will never develop it) and atypical deep neurofibromas . Then the cancers. Yes we have a. high risk of cancer and therefor we need high surveillance. Women should have breast MRI and not mammogram or ultrasound only, because not only is our risk higher but our cancers are harder to treat, so we need a more aggressive treatment. \n\nHowever our disease is far more than the tumours we are famous for. Given that nf1 regulates the cell cycle, it means it is basically involved in pretty much everything one way or the other. Sometimes , it is the end of life that is dysregulated. So for example, the renewal of bone cells, the bone cell turnover is off, and we have weaker bones. For this, we often have scoliosis in childhood or osteoporosis in later life, unrelated to lifestyle and for which again, the usual treatment does not really work for us, so we need to be more aggressive in preventing bone loss, more calcium, more vitamin d + K2, more exercise. \n\nThen of course, we are a neurological diseases and there are several implications with the brain. Here is what the latest book has to say about epilepsy: \n\n\u201c13.3 Epilepsy  \nThere is a tenfold increase in the likelihood of seizures in NF1 compared with the general population. Seizure frequency varies from 4% to 13% depending on the study design and ascertainment of patients \\. All seizure types are encountered; however, the commonest is complex partial seizures, suggesting underlying cortical dysgenesis \\. This is supported by a pathological study in which abnormal cerebral architecture, subcortical heterotopia, and glial nodules were found in patients with NF1 and cognitive impairment \\. \n\nOnset of epilepsy is reported from infancy to late middle age and is usually mild compared with other neurocutaneous disorders. As seizures may be secondary to other recognised complications of NF1 including parenchymal glioma and aqueduct stenosis, individuals presenting with a first seizure should have MRI brain imaging even if they have had previous normal neuroimaging. Children with NF1 and epilepsy are generally more difficult to treat with a single anti-epileptic drug than children with epilepsy in the general population. Conversely \u201cadults with NF1 usually have very mild seizures \\. Individuals with NF1 and seizures may be good candidates for epilepsy surgery \\. In the largest series of 12 patients with NF1 undergoing epilepsy surgery, eight were seizure-free at 1-year follow-up, and another individual had decreased seizure burden \\.\n\n  \nGlioneuronal tumours, such as ganglioglioma and dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumours (DNETs), have been reported in patients with NF1 and are almost always associated with seizures \\. In the largest epilepsy surgery series in NF1, 40% of the tumours resected were DNETs \\, whereas DNETs only account for 14\u201318% of histological diagnoses in other epilepsy series \\. DNETs are glioneuronal tumours that are cortically based and found most frequently in the temporal lobes. They are frequently found to co-occur with adjacent focal cortical dysplasia, suggesting a common developmental aetiology for both structural abnormalities.  \n\u201d  \nExcerpt From: Gianluca Tadini. \u201cMultidisciplinary Approach to Neurofibromatosis Type 1.\u201d Apple Books. \n\nWe have also vascular issue. The endothelial cells are again imperfect and what affect the heart will affect the brain. \n\nWe have an overactive immune system which could explain your asthma and allergies. \n\nNf1 is so complex and impossible to summarise in a post ( or even 10) . \n\nYou should see someone, or at the very least call the foundations that look after us. ( . They have a list of doctors (  , a section for newly diagnosed ( and quite a lot of resources, webinars, YouTube videos. ( \n\nI also like the webinars from NF network . ( Again, a ton of videos, find a doctor and so on. \n\nGoogle will not help you understand, because not only does it preferentially offer the extreme, but it will leave out material that has an intellectual property, meaning most medical papers and offer instead poor quality resources, or worst outdated stuff. \n\nDepending where you live, you can have great care or suboptimal care. Most primary care doctor have no clue about us and even geneticist who are not specialised do not keep up with the myriad of options we now have to manage better our disease. I live in Australia, and the ignorance would be laughable if it was not scary. I educate my doctors. \n\nThe medical literature will be found on pubmed ( but it will be vast and confusing if you start there. Start in the foundations , the videos, the conferences, and find an Nf doctor. then there are the social media. I am not on Facebook, I have browsed some open groups, and most of what I have read is wrong, so go there to meet people but not as a source of reliable information . There is a patient community called Inspire, where people share a bit more science than here, but overall I would Reddit is a good place to start meeting people because users will correct each other if misinformation is spread and several of us, are quite happy to share information and spread knowledge. \n\nWe are happy to guide you and expand on questions you might have. There are so many manifestations with every grade of severity, from  very mild to very severe, and this should give you hope, because if it is not the gene, but the microenvironment that determines the evolution and progression, we can try to control that to a certain extent. Are you based in the UK? If you are look up Nerve tumours uk. They have a great helpline you can call to ask a lot of random questions. The person who normally does it is great and is my Genetics person.  I would try and avoid Google as there is a lot of bad information out there. Lots go through like with NF without any major issues. How does one identify the tumours being cancerous when there is so many in the body (including unseen ones)? That Is why i joined here after hours of googling and freaking out :-) i dont know anyone personally that has it Thank you for all the information it is helpful! I did go to a geneticists which nothing in 2019 was found but she said she would contact me randomly as science progressed with any of my cells. So i recieved the letter in the mail last week identifying the NF1 specically at the 48th point (?) Then some random numbers after. And per the later was instructed to let my nuerologist know as well to see a specialistist for continued monitoring and test. It makes me wonder if my seziured and hearing loss is due to this... I am the type of person that must have answers so i am sure this journey will be difficult i hate the unknown which is why when i started having seziures in 2018 snd all my test can back clear why i started the journey with genetics. I am in the US. That sounds like a great program though! I was having extreme pain where the tumors were located. With my leg they could tell with mri scans that it was cancerous. The one in my arm with the mri they thought it might be cancerous, but I needed a biopsy to confirm. Good on you for being assertive and pushing for an answer. \n\nTo answer your question, seizures are not uncommon in NF1, but hearing loss usually belongs to another neurofibromatose (with an E it is a class of diseases)  called Nf2, in which a very small tumour called acoustic neuroma starts growing on the ear nerve.. There is no mistaking one for the other ion a genetic test as they are on a different chromosome) . In NF1, hearing loss is infrequent and more due to structural anomalies than tumours.  ( \n\nNf1 is not a shield for whatever ailment a random person might get, but Nf1 will always bring a new level of complexity for whatever we have, because there will now always be the question: is it NF1 related?  You should consult again with your ENT and put the diagnosis on the table and ask if it changes anything and if you could be a candidate for a cochlear implant. \n\n( \n\nHave you had a brain MRI ? IF yes, could you ask the neurologist to look at it again with the NF1 in mind? \n\nToo many doctors when you mention NF1 will only think of those images you saw on google, someone with a thousand of benign cutaneous tumours.  This is however only the visible tip of the iceberg. Some of us, have very few or no visible tumours  and a wide range of complications. We face our NF1 challenges and the apathy of the doctors we see who might have heard 10 min about NF1 during a lecture on genetic disease 10-20 years ago. It is almost worst to have a doctor anchored in outdated knowledge than one completely ignorant. \n\nMy advice would be to slowly build up your knowledge from good sources (not Facebook) , and then revisit the doctors who have treated you previous to your diagnosis, and ask if it changes anything and once you have dealt with the issues you have now consider adopting a preventative approach to the management of your NF1. It will mean, more targeted screening, an anti-inflammatory diet, probably a range of supplements . \n\n\\-vitamin D as the number of tumours is inertly correlated to vitamin D levels ( and you need vitamin D to maintain stronger bones with calcium and K2 as well ( \n\n\\- curcumin as a trial in Italy showed improvement in tumours ( preventing them might be a good option \n\n\\-  possibly L-Carnetine: we have an abnormal fat metabolism, meaning we store fat in our muscle cells, and many of  us are weaker because of that . L-Carnitine will rescue this myopathy (  BUT what the paper does not say is that carnitine supplementation raises levels of TMAO which is a risk factor for hear disease. Given we already have an increased risk, you should consider this. I do not take L-carnitine and just have a low fat diet. My body does not process fat well, I eat less of them. So Keto diets which are now popular are probably not a good idea if one has NF1. On the other hand, we process carbs extremely well, because ewe have an abnormal glucose metabolism, we have the opposite of diabetes, we have high insulin sensitivity. \n\nDiet has its place in nf1 for optimal management, but it will not be discussed or offered yet. Early days, and it will take a decade or two. You on the other hand, can start reading about it . We know inflammation is needed to start nf1 tumours. ( It would make sense to adopt an inflammation lowering diet.  I do. I follow an anticancer and anti-inflammatory high polyphenol diet. \n\nThis was to let you know that there are ways you can intervene to manage the onset of new manifestations. \n\nYou seems young to me, but you have to look ahead. We can prevent tumours, benign or malignant, to a certain extent, and we have to think about our dementia risk as well,  ( and dementia takes decades to build up. So when you are seeing your specialist, ask about which measures could be adopted to prevent it. I personally follow Drs Dean and Ayesha Sherzai's recommendations.\n\nThe \"setting up\" of the plan is tricky and mentally challenging, because you are faced with complications you had never considered, but once the plan of an optimal diet, optimal physical activity and sleep is done, your screening is planned for the year, you are good to focus on other things. Whatever could be done is done on the epigenome level, you can worry a whole lot less.  I cannot change or repair my mutated NF1 gene, but I can intervene where this gene matters. \n\nCellular and biochemical pathways are so complicated and intertwined, there is room for a little intervention. Not a fix, not clearing away the risk, but - at least this is what I hope for - trying to lessen the negative impact. Thia is great i appreciate it. I have set up an appointment to go back and get updated bloodwork and see my hematologist that i was seeking treatment for prior to covid as i have extremly low iron which i have always had. She is also an oncologist so figured it would be a great start. I will see my neurologist and allergy doctors separately as well to see if anything about this chages my treatmen plan. I figured if after research there are a couple specialist in neighbouring states that i can see if i dont feel like i am gettinf the correct help. Unfortunately i havent found any in VA. I like to think i am still you :-) i am 32 and my health didnt start taken a hit til my late 20s. So maybe knowing more will help me push better for more treatments and action as irs been set we cant change it but we can possible prevent certain things and catch things sooner to get ahead of the ball. \n\nI am sure me joining this group also helps :-) Iron is very interesting, or better said ,  every nutrient is very interesting. Whichever is tested in us, we are deficient. It is as if NF1 was a nutrient depletion disease as well. Most nutrient work in synergy . If you have low iron , you should probably check your B12, as B12 and iron are connected and  we , with NF1 , are deficient in B12  ( \n\nWhen it comes to iron, a 2005 paper (  had this view on our deficiency. - (It is locked but I have copied extracts for you) \n\n\" These coexisting diagnoses raise the question of whether this disappearing iron is somehow being used to aid in the growth of these patients\u00d5 neurofibromas. The most widely appreciated role of iron is its con- tribution to the heme molecule and its function in the transport of oxygen throughout the body. Iron also plays multiple other important roles in cellular growth \" .../....\n\n\"There have been several studies that comment on the utility of iron chelation or iron inhibition on the retar- dation of the neoplastic growth. Studies using several iron chelators have proven to arrest tumor cell growth in the G/S1 phase of various tumors including neuro- epithelioma, breast adenocarcinoma, and leukemia. This arrest in growth has been attributed to altered levels of cell protein signals in response to lower iron levels. Some of the actual mechanisms have yet to be understood \\.  \nIron metabolism and its impact on tumor origin, growth, and treatment is a topic of interest.  \" \n\nOn this note, curcumin is an iron chelator, it removes iron from the cells. \n\n\"Iron is an important growth factor in the cell and has important roles in the cell growth cycle. A variety of tumors experience growth retardation secondary to treatment with iron chelators or metals which block the action of iron. Patient pop- ulations with certain tumors demonstrate consistent evidence of otherwise unexplained iron deficiency. Thus, we suggest that neurofibroma growth might play a role in iron depletion. Are we simply aiding in the continued  \ngrowth of these tumors by supplementing the depleted iron?\" \n\n\\--------------------\n\nThis is one view, there are other possible explanations for iron deficiencies in NF1. If you cannot bring your iron levels up, you need to see if your deficiency is secondary to something. That something in NF1 is often a GIST, a non threatening tumour on the outside part of the colon to describe it in very basic terms. \n\nOr non NF1 related, if you have used a lot of antacid in the past, you might have favoured the proliferation of Helicobacter pylori in your stomach and this occasionally can result in severe iron deficiency. \n\nNutrients, micro - so vitamins and minerals -  together with the usual macros  fat, protein and carbs , have an altered metabolism in NF1. It is  noted, misunderstood and understudied. \n\nThis will not be addressed by your doctors, so you should test for these, and I would add the omega 3 index in the mix, which you need to do privately, and the cheapest is Omegaquant . When I tested mine, I was critically low at 3.8 . \n\nThis non-nf1 related presentation by Prof Bruce Ames ( is a bit long (over 1 hour) but explains well how deficiencies even minor can  cause  cellular pathway disruption and chromosome breaks . Every cellular pathway  needs micronutrients. In nf1 our nutrient utilisation is dysregulated (the fat, the glucose, the vitamin D, iron, b12,   ....) for unknown reasons and we are deficient every time someone tests us . I believe we need to pay attention to this and act. \n\nOver the course of the years, based on my blood test results,  I started supplementing more and more. So now I  take 1000 mcg B12 a day, 4000 iu vitamin D + 100 mcg K2, 2gr algae  EPA-DHA, occasionally calcium if my day was low on it (I use    to log my nutrients, totally free) , and twice/thrice a week 1 pill of quality multivitamin  (I take Thorne Basic 2, but only half a serving so 1 pill). \n\nI do all this with the knowledge of my doctors. I am followed by an oncologist for my NF1 management. I had a horrible experience at the Sydney Nf1 clinic, and have moved my care to someone proactive, after all, once we are diagnosed, a geneticist will not do much for us, our main threat are tumours, so an oncologist is a good call if you cannot find an NFologist. \n\nDepending on the level of care you will be able to get, you might want to consider or not (if your doctors are like Dr Kaleb Yohay for example, you do not need to do anything, he is amazing, if I was in the US, I would try to be followed by him) to look deeper into nF1 . Maybe start a new discussion to ask for doctor recommendation in your/or neighbouring state. \n\nIn my case, given how we are abandoned in Australia,  I decided to  enrol in clinical trials that benefit **me.** Mainly imaging, so whole body MRI, breast MRI, ... this allows me to benefit from higher surveillance that is not offered to me here and to have interviews with researchers and have an opportunity to ~~grill~~ chat with them. I also enrol in as many conferences and symposiums as possible, to know where the science is going and why. There is a big gap between research findings and change in protocol. Last year in 2020, the first ever drug was approved for NF1, a MEK inhibitor (MEKi) called Koselugo. We have known since 2001 that MEKi work. It took 19 years to make it available. Fair enough, it is drug, with nasty side effects, but other knowledge such as *inflammation being a driver for tumorigenesis in nf1* , I can act upon today, when I am at the supermarket and decide if I am putting a bunch of kale in my shopping basket or a steak, I do not have to wait 10-15 years for a dietary guideline that might never come .\n\nNf1 is an fascinating disease, so complex, and we cannot look at it in a reductionist way separating a body part or body system from the rest of the body. \n\nSorry, I believe I overdid it a bit, and you got more than you asked for. I hope however that it is enough to see how google gets it wrong is not a good source of information for us, and information is important because it will give you ways to manage your Nf1 in the best possible way. \n\nWhen you are ready for more,  I am happy  to guide you towards additional resources, books, guidelines from other countries, ... Inlove a lot of info lol whwn i saw the hematologist last year my b12 and vitamin d were low. Then covid hit so i didnt go back even though they wanted to start me on infusions (which again 15+ years with iron defiencey and no dr ever suggested this). So i called this morning to have bloodwork redone and then a week after that i meet with her so i will give her my new diagnosis and she were she wants to go with it. She is also an oncologist so figured i would start there. Once i complete this first step then schedule a followup with my nureologist. Its time to have my eyes tested anyway so going to do that as well. \n\nI ws diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome as well at 18 after finding \"cyst\" on my ovaries. However i read today a lot of women were misdiagnosed that have nf1 and they were actual tumors. So going to follow up on that as well. Feel like i am going down a rabbit hole like i did when i first started having seziures....\n\nCalled the geneticist and she said no further appointments with them or dr are needed because the form of nf1 i have is LIKELY benign so i dont need further treatment for it or see any specialist...hmmmmm There are several big red flags here that appeared the moment your geneticist threw your diagnosis in your face without the required counselling. Nobody sends a letter telling someone they have NF1. This fact alone shows that she is not the right person to look after you. One needs to be accompanied in this incredibly delicate diagnosis. \n\n\"Announcing the diagnosis of a genetic disorder such as NF1 is a critical event . .../...  Disclosing the diagnosis should be done in the setting of a well-planned, dedicated, face-to-face consultation which requires expertise and unlimited time. \n\nDepending on the age of the patient, the natural history, clinical picture, variability, prognosis, personalized treatment, complications and the warning signs that should prompt rapid medical attention must be reviewed with the child and parents. They should also be provided with the most recent scientific advances and the latest therapeutic and supportive care options, including their efficacy and limitations; as well as available validated NF1 resources such as books, pamphlets, reliable website addresses and support groups. Finally, they should be informed about the available neurofibromatosis foundations, centers and clinics for further guidance and multidisciplinary care. \" \n\n( \n\nSecond, in the medical literature , it is recognised that we are more than our tumours or lack of tumours. Still, rejoice that you do not have them now. This might or might change, but you certainly do not have to worry about ever developing thousand of them or being  severely affected by a plexiform . This said, in the last Nf1 books, yearly surveillance for everyone is warranted. Even mosaic, which is very specific category in why the mutation occurs in the post zygotic phase and therefor, not all cells are affected. You do not have to go crazy and wild on surveillance, but you should definitely see someone once a year and at the very least, be given a checklist of things you need to look for, such as high blood pressure. This is what Dr Bruce Korf - the most famous NF1 doctor who wrote the guidelines in the 1980s and whose lab until recently was the only one in the world to do genetic test : \n\n\u201c**In the absence of complications,** clinical evaluation should take place on a **yearly basis for both children and adults with NF1**, as annual examinations allow for early detection of complications, decreasing morbidity and improving quality of life. Clinical evaluation seems to be more useful in detecting complications than are routine screening investigations in **asymptomatic patients** \\.\u201d  \nExcerpt From: Gianluca Tadini. \u201cMultidisciplinary Approach to Neurofibromatosis Type 1.\u201d Apple Books. \n\nThird and the most shocking of all - I am assuming you are female because of your reference to breast cancer in an earlier post - what about the chat about having children and recommending IVF given how dominant NF1 is and how unpredictable it can be. You can be totally unaffected and have a child with a very severe case. For some parents, one of them was diagnosed after their child was diagnosed because they had sever bone deformities or a plexiform, the geneticist tested the parents and one of them had Nf1 and was unaware of it. \n\nFourth,  you found out you had Nf1 because you developed neurological sign,: epilepsy. You are not asymptomatic, It was  a manifestation brought you the diagnosis, how can she say you are benign. For many of us, the diagnosis of Nf1 came as an accidental finding while investigating mysterious manifestations.  Your loss of hearing is another likely sign. You are a symptomatic patient, even if you do not fit her idea of symptoms. \n\nThis are the French guidelines I follow  for my care and the extract about announcing the diagnosis was copied form there \n\n( \n\nThe way I see it , it is **good riddance.** You do not want to start your NF1 journey with a bad and ignorant doctor who obviously has a reductionist  (tumours only) view of Nf1 . \n\nYou will see your neurologist and haematologist soon. Ask them for a referral to see an NF1 clinic. Whoever you pick, you should try to find a kind and polite way to ask  1) when was the last time they attended an NF1 conference  or medical symposium and 2) how they keep up to date with Nf1 and the acceleration in new knowledge about our syndrome. \n\nIf you ever wish to have children, you need to do it through IVF and select embryos that do not carry your mutation. Do not risk it. So you need to see a geneticist at some point, but not the one you have now. Glad you understand :-) \n\nNo NFI clinic near me unfortunately. Closest one is in another state and 3 hours away. Plus they have tons of requirements before being seen. So figured i go to the local drs to run their test then take all those to them. They require imaging drs notes etc before scheduling appointment other wise they will refer you then you have to come back. You do not need an Nf1 clinic, you can receive excellent care from any doctor with an interest in Nf1. Call the CTF and NF network support line and look on their websites for a doctor near you. \n\nThere is no urgency, nothing bad is going to happen to you if you do not see someone now. Nf1 has been in you for decades, you can take the time to find the care that is right for you. No rush. \n\nYou have a couple of appointments soon, right? the neurologist and haematologist. Start there. \n\nI would still call my primary care doctor and request a genetic counselling, because NF1 comes with so many implications, for your health, children you might want or not, and also **legal stuff** for your medical insurance, and ... I do not know  how it works in the USA, but in Australia, you are legally required to disclose your diagnosis for mortgage insurance, life insurance, it will affect immigration to other countries if I ever wish to do so, it cuts me out certain profession such police, pilots, firefighter, astronaut (I know I am on the wrong side of 50 to wish a career change , ... but still  you get it) .  \n\nThis is why I really do not get your ~~crappy~~ doctor and I would make any further contact in a written form, arguing that it hard to recollect information given on the phone.  The questions would be : \n\n\\- Do I have a diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 or just a mutation on the gene Nf1. \n\n\\- Does this diagnosis need to be taken into account when I start planning a family \n\n \\- Can you confirm I do not need any type of surveillance or yearly check up\n\n\\- Does this diagnosis have legal implications? Do not look too much into NF via Google. You will see people with a variety of different issues, some you may never have to experience. It may also cause you to worry and be scared of what could be.  NF is progressive, so things may change somewhere down the line. I have a mild case of the disease, but have had my fair share of issues. I have had 27 brain surgeries (26 related to NF) and I do not worry at all. I am optimistic that I will live a long and healthy life. Just enjoy life and take every day at a time. Yea i agree. I have no spots...visable tumors etc. If it wasnt for random genetic screening i woulsnt know i had the mutated gene. Hey hon I have lived with nf all my life I found out 22 years ago.

This is correct as far as u know. This is correct NF in and of itself does not make you high risk. HOWEVER, particular complications of it may make you high risk. Depends on how your nf affects you. Not everyone with nf is affected the same way.

She sounds toxic. \n\nAs for your surgery, I hope you have someone to be there with you and is someone to support you. Surgery can be nerve wracking regardless of the complexity. I hope you all goes well. \n\nI will also be soon getting surgery a little lower on my spine. I have a large growth around S1 and S2.

It is really embarrassing, he is done it before and he asks more questions before I get a chance to Sometimes its good to have a second set of ears as you can hear somewhat different information. You might miss on a detail. That being said I agree that having parents at an appointment can be embarrassing.\n\nThat said surgery is a different beast all together. Even if its not a family member do you have anyone who can go with you? It would probably be my sister, even though we are not the best of friends. It be too much for my dad to sit there and wait all day for me. Good to hear you know where the source is or at least what could be the cause of it.

My NF has not been very visible most my life but now im slowly getting more and more bumps around my body including my face. All the ones on my face are pretty small but still they are coming in. Its been bringing me down alot. I feel the same way. I have been very stressed about them. I have seen so many more over the past year and it is really bringing me down as well. I feel the same. If it is any help, my SO and newer friends who did not know I had it did not take notice. Well, if asked they could see bumps but did not think it super odd, certainly did not judge. Some people have lots of moles. \n\nIt is tough. My dad had it and by my age was much farther along in visibility so I lucked out there. Mostly I just keep being myself as much as I can. I feel you. I was always told that getting through puberty would lead to a general rest until menopause (no plans for pregnancy), but I feel like A LOT showed up in the past few years, my mid-late twenties. To be honest, at first I thought I was just getting really bad backne because I was growing my hair out until I started noticing them other places. I am pretty self-conscious of them, but I feel like it is more linked to general poor body image. My husband has NF, and I truly did not notice the bumps on his face when we started dating. I figured they were moles and did not really think about them. He told me pretty early on about NF (which I had not heard of before) and I mean, I have seen all his bumps by now, and he has a few surgery scars now too. I have always, and still do, find him very attractive. He is really kind of the best.\nI do not mean to diminish your experience at all, or to suggest that you only care about your appearance for the sake of romance. I just hoped that telling you that helps a bit. I hope someone will look at me this way one day Hang in there , I am 37 and do not have many but it is coming. I feel the same way. But as I am getting older i realize if someone is going to only look at you solely for that, than they are not worth it. I know it is hard not to think about.

I am worried my teen NF2 kid is getting depressed that he cannot connect to world. He is on gadgets always, refuses to get involved and has lost interest.\nWith his minimal hearing, is there is any training on \u201clip reading\u201d? I am not talking about sign language. \nAlso, what is the best way to keep the kid engaged productively, with some academic work? What is wrong with sign language?\n\nMaybe the reason he is depressed, not interacting, an unproductive is because other people are expecting him to accommodate them when he should be accommodated. I am very sorry to read this. Have a look at Onno Faber if you are not already familiar with him. \n\n( \n\n(  and his YouTube channel ( \n\nTry also contacting the CTF and maybe one of the support worker can give you some guidance. \n\nOn the keeping a teen engaged, it is hard, Your son needs a project, a goal, a passion , something to work for and maybe putting his devices/gadgets to a good use and create something. You know him, what he likes, what he fears. \n\nI do not know where you are based . In UK (  or USA ( It is not always a realistic goal.  Like, yeah, sign language is ideal.  But it is also damn near useless if there is no deaf community in which to use the language.\n\nWe can all wax poetic about accomodations, but in my experience, nobody gives a damn unless it is something that people do not have to go out of their way to achieve.  I am going to be real with you.  Dealing with hearing loss, especially within the context of NF2, fucking sucks donkey balls.  I have been dealing with profound hearing loss for almost five years now, and it does not get any better or easier.  I have just learned how to deal and cope.\n\nUnfortunately, resources for the deaf/HoH do not really dwell much on people who have lost their hearing recently.  It mostly focuses on people who were born deaf/hoh or became such in their early childhood, and that is a completely different experience.\n\nNobody is good at lip reading.  That is a myth.  You can get \"better\" at it by learning how to handle the context around the conversation, but lip reading in itself will not get you very far.  It takes effort, because it requires you to be two steps ahead of the conversation, and sometimes you just will not have the energy to deal with that.  \n\nThere are days when I just cannot deal with stuff, and I shut down and focus on my phone or whatever because otherwise I would be overwhelmed.\n\nDoes he have a hearing aid?  Or a cochlear implant?  They help immensely, especially in regards to school.  Where are you from?  Here in the US, the vocational rehabilitation offices often cover the costs of hearing devices and such as part of their services.\n\nIt is also time to start seriously considering sign language.  If he is thinking about doing college or something like that, he would do well to gravitate to an area that has a thriving Deaf community.  It would help him adapt and figure out how to handle stuff on his own. I am not OP.  I am literally a person who had NF2 and lost my own hearing.  I have done what it takes to learn ASL, and know the benefits.  I know what it is like to become deaf, in particular as a late deafened individual.\n\nI struggled, because for the longest time, there was no one to talk in ASL with.  In fact, right now I have recently moved to an area that has no Deaf community and have not used ASL outside of my doctors appointments and vocational rehab meetings.\n\nYou will not learn any language, much less ASL, if there is no means to immerse yourself in it.  Unfortunately, many people do not live in an area that has a Deaf community to immerse themselves in.  I had to fight every step of the way to learn what I have learned, and I did it on my own, no classes or instructors.  I am proud of what I have managed to accomplish, but it has made me realize that not everyone can manage it.  In that regard, I have been exceedingly privileged.  I had the means to do it, and I was lucky enough to be supported by Deaf people at the time.  Not everyone has these benefits.\n\nThere is still a long long way to go before learning ASL alone can be adequate enough to meet every deaf person's needs.  The Deaf community is incredibly small, especially outside of urban centers.  He should definitely learn ASL because it is good to know, but it should not be sold as the panacea of deaf depression.  There is a reason why post-lingual deaf individuals tend to have horrid ASL adoption rates.  It is because learning a language is HARD.  I have been a sign language interpreter for 25 years, and in that time, I have lost count of how many deaf and hard of hearing people (probably hundreds) have told me that they wish that their families had let them learn to sign, and/or had learned to sign with them. Dozens of people I have known as friends or whom I have interpreted for have shared similar stories from the opposite perspective \u2014 saying that the only reason they have good strong relationships with their parents is because they learned to sign, and thus were able to communicate at a deep level with their deaf child. You can find countless similar stories on YouTube in the topic of language deprivation, deaf isolation, etc. A common theme is deaf children who thought that they would become hearing or die when they grew up, because they never met any deaf adults. And thus, they never had any deaf role models. This led many to be depressed.\n\nI am not suggesting that your son fits into these categories. I do not know anything about your son except that he is deaf, he does not use sign language, and he is unhappy. I also do not know where you live, or else I would give you location-specific referrals.\n\nYou would be surprised how many people will rally to support a deaf child. There is a terrific story told by Steve Hartman:\n\n\n\nAnd here is a poem by a deaf teacher (with English translation, starting at 1:09) called \u201cTo A Hearing Mother.\u201d The author is well-known and highly respected in the Deaf community. I beg you to watch it.\n\n\n\nWho knows. Your son might decide he does not want to learn sign language. But give it a try. It could change not just his mood, but his whole future \u2014 in a way that you will not regret. This is a wonderful perspective on the situation - Parents have to be deaf with their deaf kids.\nI agree to your point on sign language. What I feel is that person communicating to my kid has to know the sign language and I cannot expect everyone to know.\nHe is using other means like \u201cspeech to text converter\u201d app, google translate etc.\nBTW, I was in Philly, USA till recently but moved to home country to find some alternative medicine.\nThanks for your details. Sorry for what you have been going through. I understand to some extent on how you feel.\n\nI will try to look into sign language as option as well.\n\nMany thanks for your That is good stuff .. thanks a ton for sharing. Will explore more on the links you shared.\n\nI am determined to keep him focus on right things but have setback when he loses interest and withdraws. It is really really hard to coax him \u2639\ufe0f Feel better tools are available now for normal people to communicate except for complete deaf community conversations. ??? I do not understand Hmmm \u2026 it is extremely hard to find people who can communicate on sign language. I meant, sign language was not my preference because others should also know it. I said there are some Apps that can provide easier mode of understanding when in non-deaf group.", "Anyone here? Does anyone here have aspergers or autism? I was recently diagnosed with it, and my mum was curious whether more people with nf has it  My son has NF1 and is on the autism spectrum. Thank you for your reply. I read an article that chromosome 17 was tied to the autism spectrum which does not make sense at all, and it confused me a lot. So I thought I would do some research on my own\n I am not on the autism spectrum, but I did just (a few days ago) find out that there is a big overlap with social traits associated with autism spectrum disorders and NF1. I am trying to figure out more about it but so far all I have is a research/article that is written kind of densely, so I need to take time to parse it out.  I think and sometimes feel I might have it, but I was never diagnosed or tested as far as I know. And being 35 now, do not know if it would even be something to get tested for at this point. My son who has NF1 was recently diagnosed with autism. It does seem like there is a higher prevalence in people with NF. NF is heavily associated with a lot of learning disorders. Does not answer your question directly but may help. I was never diagnosed comorbid with anything, but always struggled with remembering to do things. Or I would do my homework and then lose it.  Yes, autism seems to be more prevalent in NF. I have NF1 and actually work for the local NF organization in my area. We have an article written about this. \n\n\n\nThere are also other articles you can check out under \"Learn\". I have ADHD and NF1. Not sure about the correlation there though. ", "How do you afford MRIs? I was diagnosed with NF about two years ago. I the surgeon who removed one of my tumors referred me to get an MRI, but insurance would barely cover it. I really think I should have one done, but the cost is outrageous. I do not understand why my insurance will not cover it. I am 21 and on my moms health insurance which is through her employer. We have a large deductible, but I really need this done. Any cheap alternatives? If your insurance is unable to cover it, check and see if the hospital offers financial aid, I know before I was put on Medicaid SSI, I was able to be put on financial aid through the hospital, it involved a little paper work, but they would then cover whatever my insurance did not cover and I never had to pay a penny.\n\nYou are other options are to look into better insurance which might be better in your situation or looking into being on disability or SSI to get on Medicaid or Medicare.\n\nI get MRI done once a year and they are usually full body ones. Can I ask how much it would cost? Just curious. I do not. My deductible is 5k per year. 10k, plus the cost of the doctor to read it was the last time I saw it as billed to my insurance I am personally very lucky. Although I am just about to turn 26, my father was able to put in a claim with his insurance. This is allowing me to remain a dependent on his heath care plan, which just happens to be a good one, as he works for the city.  \nI live in Arizona and am treated at Mayo Clinic. I recently needed an MRI/MRA with and without contrast and was having some last-minute insurance issues. I asked the person who called me about it how much it would be out of pocket and then I could appeal later and he just made a generally distressed noise and strongly advised against it. I ended up only getting the MRI, but I am really curious to see how much it would have been when it shows up. Holy fuck The more I lurk in this sub the more glad that I never have to deal with US healthcare. Here in Norway, the regular MRI's I used to have of my leg only cost me a 200NOK deductible each time, or about $25. You have to deal with it on this sub. Sometimes I am like \u201cwtf is this person talking about\u201d then I remember America. If you are in the US often time the reason things like this can be denied, or only partially covered, has to do with how it is coded. The codes are sent by the doctor/hospital to the insurance company and tell them things like why/what is being done. There are a good number of these codes and a lot are for very similar reasons. \n\nWhile it is frustrating insurance companies do have to \"protect\" themselves by ensuring that what you are asking for to be covered is relevant to your care, neccesary, and previously agreed to be covered by your plan. If the code for the MRI is wrong (or \"wrong\") it can be denied under this logic. Ask your doctor or hospital to see if the order can be resubmitted with a different (but still applicable) code Can I ask how you went about this? I am losing insurance on the 31st and I am honestly terrified. Talk to your doctor. My MRIs were denied this year, so my doctor tweaked the language on the authorization request and it was approved. Oh wow. Even that is a lot. \nIn Canada it is free thank goodness. I would never be able to afford healthcare anywhere else with having NF and multiple sclerosis. I feel lucky.

Probably buried somewhere along with people with other genetic conditions. NF being as rare and unknown to the average public there is most likely not a lot of research. No such thing as a perfect life. The grass is not always greener on the other side. Just because you think someone else life may be better than yours, does not mean it actually is. We all wear masks. No manner is were short or tall, rich or poor, healthy or not healthy, and so on. idk becuse it may depend on the size of the tumors and if they are bulled about it I got that theory that Nf causes depressions\nBecause people with low serotonin are more likely to become depressed.

I have recently been talking to a Navy Recruiter and filled out my medical questionnaire today. I have talked with multiple people in regards to this and ended up electing not to disclose it on my documents. My recruiter said he personally had some medical history he too did not disclose while applying. Basically as far as NF goes I do have minor hearing loss (defiantly waivable) and some bumps here and there. I have believe I heard that you would not be accepted due to having Neurofibromatosis. Now whether you choose to disclose it or not is totally up to you, but honesty is the best policy. That being said it is still all up to you, but I do believe the military will do a medical check themselves and it is very possible the military doctor will discover it. Are you in the US?\n\nIf so, NF is considered to be a disqualified for joining.\n\n( It is a disqualification. My dad discovered he had NF when applying for the military after high school and therefore was cut. He had no idea about it before. The doctors may give you an exam and discover it anyways, especially if you have some noticable symptoms. What you do is up to you though. You will not get wavier. Maybe 15 or 16 years ago they would have slid you in because they needed bodies desperately, but not now. Even if you had specialized skills they are in desperate need of in the military they will not provide you with the wavier. You are medically disqualified. I had to learn the hard way too. I am sorry :( Thanks for the link. I did see the article before but completely missed where is specifically mentioned NF. It is kind of disheartening, especially when everyone is different and they do not know the full history. I was actually planning on talking to my recruiter tomorrow to get it added, did not like the idea of trying to hide it and risk trouble in the future. Could not join Australian Navy. I was medically disqualified from joining the Navy back in 94' It is not about your history its about your future. They could spend all that time and money training you, then bam spinal tumor and you cannot run. Is there a way OP could work for the military branch ofh their choosing in some civilian capacity? Probably not what they want, but who knows. I have had NF since I was 1. I served in the Army. I did have to get medically cleared during processing but it did not bar me just because I had NF. Did you disclose it on your application prior to MEPS? And how long ago was this. Seems like now it is technically disqualifiable. Talked to the recruiter supervisor for my entire area today and he said he would personally keep my mouth shut if it is something that does not impact my day-to-day. Basically what I have is minor, at my yearly neurological exam I spend more time in the waiting room, then go in asks if any concerns, I say no then says see you next year, done in probably 2 min. But now I am leaning on saying I have it so if I get in I can still get covered and not have to hide it. I actually have wondered this and curious if anyone has any information. One thing I do know from experience, even if you go into the reserves you still need the full screening as if you enlisted. This was Jan of 2001 and I served until 2007 with it never coming up again. I disclosed it because I did not even think about it being a disqualifying event but that is how  I ended up spending 2 extra days at MEPS because the specialist was out. I only have a handful of neurofibromas and ADHD as my \"conditions\". Passed the physical and everything else related and the specialist checked me out for less than 2 minutes before he said I was cleared. Was this relatively recently? For those of you disqualified, did they even let you show your history or did they just give a blanket no statement. This was almost 9 years ago. I attempted to join the Air Force, and disclosed my condition. At the time I was fine, but this is a progressive disease, which is why it is disqualifying. It was a blank statement. If you have had any serious issues with the disease, you are pretty much disqualified. There are civil service jobs where you would be a civilian working for the military, check out ( I tired to join on 2001 and I was disqualified,  that was the marines they have a different image to uphold I guess.  I wish I would of tired a different brand but felt so depressed after getting disqualified.", "Another possible leg tumor Mom felt my leg and also feels a few small nodules in and around my calf. causing swelling and fluid aroubd my calf and ankle.

I would recommend going to your doctor to get it checked out. My neurologist always cautions me to watch out for any new/unexplained tingling or weakness in my extremities. Do you have an NF specialist? Heya! I am in the UK, so I do not have a personal specialist. but I go to the clinic in London once a year for a general checkup, but Covid stuff has put that on hold. I have got a contact number and email though, so I guess I should get in touch. Thanks! You should go see your doctor and tell them what is going on. It is unfortunately possible to lose strength over time, I have had that happen, but I have always had surgery done on my right arm twice, once in 2001 and in 2018.  With Covid, it is totally reasonable to want to avoid unnecessary trips to the doctor.

I have had struggles with tumors in my family, and I have one behind my right eye. I am scared the condition will worsen. I try not to let the thoughts flood my mind. To help not let my mind wander I listen to a lot of music, and read. Do not you have trouble reading ? Have you tried audio books.\n\nI cannot still decide whether to commit to any relationship, I understand the fear of death. And some say 50 50 chance to pass on. Many people has without knowing, until it start to grow. Its tough situation, if you are not born with it and suddenly develop. Please stay positive.\n\nedit spell check No problems reading. I read hardbacks,paperbacks, and have an ereader. I currently do not do audio. \nI am afraid of loosing sight in my good eye. I would say that is one of the things that scares me the most. I was born with NF, and people do not seem to understand the pains and struggles. \nI would say if you are in or seeking a relationship go for it. Do not let anything get in your way. I am so sorry to read about your struggles. I have also been told not to have kids. And I have heard a lot of otherwise progressive and open friends speak poorly about those with genetic conditions, which hurts even if they are not talking specifically about NF. But I love that there is this community where everyone can share and support each other. This past year has been rough. I hope you can see friends soon! How many bothers and sisters?\n\nDo you have it on your face? how many and how big?\n\nHave you underwent any experimental treatment? selumetinib \n\nPlease do not mind! I have 2 younger brothers. I think there is one on my face. Most fibromas are on my arms. They right now are small,but two are bothersome. So I plan on getting them looked at. No experiments, just MRI's I am probably due for one soon. What about you? I have definitely struggled with them. I have had others tell me not to have children and even though I have got only mild impacts from NF1, at least at the moment, I have experienced people picking on me about the symptoms I do have ( short, some skeletal differences, occasional relapse into speech impediments, a noticable growth on a very visible part of my body). \n\nI am married, but we do not have kids yet. Early in the relationship I was afraid to tell my now wife.  But it came up, I am not sure why, perhaps because of the neurofibroma or cf spots, and she was supportive. She sees it as just another part of a person she loves. We both have our health challenges and help each other through them and it is just one way we have of expressing our love. \n\nAs for how I overcame fears about relationships, I do not have a great answer as my experience was pretty specific. I met my wife at a moment in my life in which I had learned to be open to the friendship of those around me without thinking about anything other than that there was a person offering something of themselves and asking for the same. Seeing friendship as an expression of generosity helped me worry less about whether I was going to be dating someone or not and instead let me enter into relationships of different types  happy to just learn a bit about someone else and give them that chance too. That detachment made it less scary. But, at the same time, there was something completely different about my interactions with my now wife that neither of us could explain and it caught me completely off guard. \n\nSo, be open to friendship and give others the chance to accept you is my advice. You are probably a pretty awesome person who enriches the world and the lives of those who know you. You may encounter someone who really likes you but does not accept your NF. Unfortunately, that means that person may not be the right person to spend your life with ( but maybe...it depends on how open they are). But, there will be others you meet.\n\nI worry about kids having NF more than my wife does. I help myself through this by considering the fact that my brothers and I are happy to be alive, even if it is sometimes very tough. If we have kids, they will be deeply loved and cared for and helped through their challenges. And I hope they will bring good to the world. I have lots of them here are there, most are about 2 -3 cm dia. They never bothered me much. Never had any scan. Yearly physical examination.\n\nHave you underwent any surgeries?\n\nDo you every wish it to disappear, when you wake up one morning? My most recent surgery was for female issues. I do not think it is connected to the NF, but I am unsure. No surgeries for the NF itself. I did have a mediport in when i was young, but it was removed. I do wish things were different at times. I have big problems reading due to my awful eyesight, but I refuse to give up reading books. I love paper-/hardbacks and read them using a magnifying glass. I do not like paper books that much, new are okay but old books are bad dust and mold. See the positive side, your kids might not have it. Its luck. You have to take the leap of faith someday. &gt;I worry about kids having NF more than my wife does\n\nThis is interesting because right now I am in the process of finding out if nf1 runs in my family/if I have a mild case of it. I am a mom who wants more kids. When i think about having more, I feel too worried, like I should not.\n\n But when i think about if the one in question was my husband instead of me, I think I would still feel good about having more kids with him. So it is like its not entirely about passing on the condition, but some psychological guilt thing, when I am the one in question. I will be turning 38 this month. I take things one day at a time. I have had cancerous tumors, but both of those surgeries went well. Right now my doctor has me on Koselugo, I started it on June 1st, so it will be at least about four to six months until we know if it is shirking any of my tumors. \n\nThere is a 50% chance you would pass it on to your kids, but there ways to limit that, but that would cost money unfortunately. You could always look into adopting/fostering kids, there are a ton of kids out there of all ages in need of loving homes. I do not know that I have it yet, but I have a child who might, and so I dont know if he got it from one of us.\n\nMy husband brought up a good point. If we asked our child if he would rather have been born with this condition, or never be born, what do I think he would say? I think he would say he would want to be born. I know there are some who really struggle and might have times where they say they wish they had not been born, but I think most people with nf1 at most times in their lives are glad they got to be alive. I make it clear I do not want bio kids. I am cool dating single moms or adopting. Honestly as a man this is easy, if you are not only willing, but actively looking at locking down a woman with a kid or 2 already with no father present you will have options. Hi, I am the partner of someone with NF1 who recently had a difficult MPNST diagnosis. I do not really post on Reddit very often but I really wanted to comment here to say please do not let any of those worries prevent you from looking for a relationship. In terms of kids, not something I ever really wanted so it has not been a big concern for our relationship, but surrogacy/adoption/fostering/no kids are all great options. Just talk about this with any potential partner early-ish into the relationship, you never know what the other person wants until you ask, and most of the time there will be something that works for you both.\n\nBut mainly I just wanted to come here to say please please do not choose to not date and put yourself out there because you are worried about dying young. Firstly, that could happen to any of us, and it is just that those with medical conditions are forced to confront it more day to day - do not let the what if hold you back, because the what if for all of us really is 'what if I got hit by a bus tomorrow'.\n\nAlthough it is so so shitty that my partner has MPNST from her NF, I would never ever change the fact that we met and got together. We have only been together for 1.5 years and she was diagnosed 6 months ago, but I still cannot tell you how grateful I am that she came into my life. It breaks my heart to think that if she had had her diagnosis earlier she would not have gone on dating apps, for similar reasons that you talk about, and we never would have met. \n\nThis has all taught me to really live for today and find happiness where we can. There are so many people out there who are looking for connection and could find happiness with you. None of us knows what will come next, but do not hold yourself back from anything, that is not what life is about, honestly Sometimes i think that if I will go in a relationship and people hear about my condition NF1 and that it can be passed on children they will not go in a relationship and ofcourse I understand that because if the child has NF1 you have to take good care of the child. I also think that if we really love each other then it does not matter how the child is. Every child is unique and important. I have that too. I said that if I did something for too long I would feel pain in my arms/ shoulders and back and my friends said yes I have that too and that made me think I was overreacting but when I look back, I did not it did hurt and it was not because I overreacted but because I have NF1 and then sometimes you have those pains And both of those options are helping kids that need it. I do not think I want kids because I do not want to pass it down but I will marry someone that has kids already if that is who I fall for. Personally, one of the reasons I got a vasectomy was because I would not want to pass along shitty genes to any children. Plus I really, really do not like children, but still.\n\nToo many people are too selfish with kids. You can do so many things right and wrong for your children - good parents will squirrel away money throughout childhood for their kids' college fund, shitty parents will not. Most people would agree on this.\n\nWe need to expand that to \"good parents will recognize a genetic health risk to their future children and will not have kids if there is a sizable chance that they will have some horrible affliction, shitty parents will breed like trashy, selfish rabbits\". I am pretty open about it from the beginning. How I look at it is that it is a good way to tell a person\u2019s worth. If they are willing to accept that, you know they are a decent person. If they have zero interest after you tell them, you are better off without them anyways. The lady thing I want is it build a relationship only to tell them about it and they break up with me. i am a very mild case too and no one in my family has had it before. The condition is very common.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also have mild symptoms I pretty much live a \"normal life\" apart from regular doctors appointments.\n\nIf I pass it on to my kids I will definitely feel guilty for passing it on to them can you tell me more about the situation with your Koselugo?\n\nIm in Australia and my doctor said I am not elidgable for it since I am not a Kid and not having any major symptoms for it My only adult child has NF2 and we want him to marry and have a kid. He is losing hearing and balance. I think we can ensure the disease is not passed to kids through some method. Anyone know this? Well I have a boyfriend, so passing it on is not a concern as I have already told my boyfriend if we ever decide to marry and have children we are using his sperm. I also feel like it is important to tell your potential romantic partner know early on rather than sooner about your condition. As for death, once you accept your own mortality it becomes a lot less easier to not worry about. You are more likely to die in a car wreck tomorrow than NF taking your life. At least when we die we will not have to worry about neurofibromatosis anymore. And statistically speaking you are still going to go on to live a long life, even with NF. i think its called invitro fertilization or something like that I appreciate your feedback and honesty and I know it is something ill need to accept. Telling a partner about my condition is something I know I will have to do but the fear of being left over it is the major thing I am scared about.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRegarding kids, my situation differs from yours as I am straight and if I decide I do 100% want kids I want them to be mine and not adopt/ foster.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso in-vitro fertilisation is something ill need to do A lot of comments here, and IM Not sure if someone mentioned it! I live in NYC and my Neurologist told me that if I get married and decided to have kids, I should visit him to help make an appointment with a genetic doctor. There is a possibility that they can take a healthy sperm that doesnt have NF genes in it  and have a healthy kid. (I can make another post with more details , and try to remember all the information that was Shared with me)\n\nPS: Im 26M , Im single and been single my whole life. But I believe that if the other person likes you the way you ARE. There is nothing that can break you!! My husband has NF1 and was very open about it from the start. What matters most to me is the kind of person that you are and how you treat others. My husband is one of the kindest and genuinely caring people that I have ever met. He is my rock. \n\nAs far as children go, any child has a 50-50 chance of inheriting the condition. My husband's was actually a spontaneous mutation so no one else in his family has it. We talked for several years about what we wanted to do. I think part of our waiting was more due to my fears about pregnancy and labor as I am not a huge fan of discomfort and doctors. We talked about adopting either privately or fostering. We also talked about just staying childfree. \n\nWe finally decided to go the route of IVF with genetic testing. It is not an easy path to take and it is certainly not for everyone. It is expensive, emotionally draining, time consuming, and physically unpleasant. There is also no guarantees that you will end up with a baby at the end of the process. We are very fortunate to live in a drivable range to a highly successful clinic with some experience in genetic conditions. That was really important to us considering how much it costs. Part of what takes so long is the development of the genetic probe. We had to give samples and my husband's parents also sent samples. We also needed four embryo samples (arrested or developed) to complete our probe since we are dealing with a spontaneous mutation. We were lucky enough to have enough embryos from our first cycle to do the probe immediately, but some people may not have any or few embryos from that cycle since it is sort of an experiment to see how your body responds to hormones.  The embryos are frozen at day 5 or 6 (after taking the sample) and you wait for the results. It took us about a month to get those back. We opted to do the gene specific test and also the standard genetic screening for other issues that are not compatible with life. Sometimes you end up with no transferable embryos, maybe one, or more than one once those results come back. I am currently pregnant with our little miracle and praying that everything will continue to go smoothly. \n\nUltimately, you need to do whatever feels best for you and your partner. My doctor was able to get me approved. All I had to do was have a number of tests done, ekg, echo, blood work, eye test and mri scan. He did the rest. \n\nHe is really wanted me on something for a number of years. We did originally try to get me into one of the trials. The first one back in 2014, we were in the process of getting me into a trial, even signed paper work for it, but then we learned I had a cancerous tumor in my leg and was no longer able to partake in the trial. Then I was going to be part of the trial for Koselugo and we were in the process of getting me into that trial, when it got approved by the fda. I would have been one of a handful of adults on the trial. \n\nSince the fda only approved it for children, I needed to have special permission, which with the help of my doctor he was able to get me approved for it. I am not sure how things work in Australia with getting special approval for a medication. I do know that some insurance will not cover it, I had an issue with that, but I was temporarily placed in a free drug program, since in the insurance I had would not cover it, because they said the drug was for children. But I was recently switched back to my old insurance that should approve it once the free drug program the hospital enrolled me in runs out in August.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions would love to know if it works for you and any side effects on it.\n\napart from my major brain tumour I am worried about the one behind my eye which has slightly affected my vision and is causing a slight droop for my eye which is noticeable for me. My doctor said we will not know whether it is working for tumor shrinkage for at least 4-8 months.\n\nThe side effects I am having, is mostly acme, pealing and a rash on my face and neck. And a little bit on my back.\n\nOther side effects some have had are some have reported are hair lose, nausea, diarrhea, shortness of breath, some vision issues and tiredness. gee those are some pretty bad side effects pretty much chemo.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni think I could deal with everything apart from hairloss.\n\nmy hair is pretty much the only thing I like about my appearance I have not had any hair loss at all, but both my parents have thick hair, so I might be good on that front. My doctor did say they were seeing more of the rash and nausea side effect with most people, but some others (not everyone) did have the other side effects, but even those who did experience some hair loss, their hair did grow back, it was just a process of the body going through it. Wow ! that is sometime. No one want their children to suffer, but who would not want to have kids if there is a thin chance of not passing bad genes. Invest in stem cell gene therapy, that is the future, cure for all and everything. That Is true if you do not have major outbreak. Imagine people who are suffering from worse. Do you think they will want to pass that to their kids? That I do not know. it is so different for everyone. If people do not want to do that then I understand that completely. Do you want kids even there is 50% chance that  your children will get it? Beautifully written, thank you for sharing. I am really scared to have kids because of NF. 27yF\n\nI do not even know if I want kids. But knowing that it can make things worse or that it will be passed down turns me off it compleatly.I would be open to adopt or do surrogacy. \n\nMy partner is ok with this and is super supportive and calls me beautiful every single day. I do struggle feeling unsecure every so often. I fear that one day I will be a giant tumor and he will not even want to look at me anymore.\n\nNow that I am getting older kids and birth control are a big question about how it will affect my body. Birth control being the jig question now.\n\nThose that make fun of your or deny you anything because of NF? Fuck them! They are probably terrible people to be so low to treat someone else differently due to their medical conditions, skin colour, sexual orientation and anything else in that category! And those people are not worth your time! Surround yourself with love! :) Apologize for going off topic. I am concern about NF1 bumps I cannot see. How did you find about the brian tumors? i have had regular MRI's since i was started going through puberty. I live in Australia so MRI scans do not cost anything. Thank you for your response.  I live in the US so it will cost some money.  I live 43 years with NF1 and was only recently diagnosed about 3 years ago.  I have appt in 2 weeks to get a couple bumps removed from the back of my head with my dermatologist. I am going to bring it up with him. It makes me sad. I have NF and am on anti-depressants. I know many would not agree with me, but if you are not born, you would not exist and thus would not \u201cknow of life\u201d, ie. you do not have a \u201cmind\u201d. I am on strong anti-depressants because of my NF and have several difficulties I would not have without this disease.", "Top 10 advancements in NF research in 2020 (including first FDA approved drug for NF1 inoperable plexiform neurofibromas) ", "ADHD with NF. Testing as adult? Hi. I am a 24 y.o. woman with NF. Most of my tumors are internal (brain and spine.) Mostly things have been okay and when I was in school, I told I had some kind of learning disability but they were not precise.\n\nI did generally well, went to college and now I am working. While I am doing what I wanted (journalist) I have been having trouble with work: focusing, movingfrom task to task and remembering stuff that my editor wants me to do.\n\nIt is gotten bad enough that I got a written warning. I am scared of losing my job (They do not know about the NF.)\n\nI have been thinking that it is Some form of ADHD since the symptoms matched. I have not got a diagnosis yet, but I am seeing my neuro oncologist for my yearly exam in about a week. We are going to talk with him about treatment.\n\nI want to know how you guys might have been diagnosed and your treatment. I am a little nervous about going on meds for ADHD if that is the way it goes\n\nAdvice? You can always go undiagnosed with ADD/ADHD or learning disabilities until adulthood. I always worked hard in school and got good grades until I started struggling in college. Then, I decided to get tested. Found out I have an executive functioning learning disability. I have obviously had it throughout my entire life, but I worked so hard that it took longer to really see it. You can always get tested as an adult if you are struggling and worried. Signs may show up a bit later in life, especially if you have learned to adapt on your own when you were younger. Everyone is different. Yeah. Thanks for this.\n\nI think that is the plan to see if I need testing. Or to see if I can just get meds straight from my neuro.\n\nI did well in school but the working world, especially in an unpredictable job is not going so well.... That is understandable and it happens. I was not diagnosed with an attention disorder myself, but learning disability (so no meds will help). I have trouble with directions, focusing on one thing, more analytical subjects (math and science), etc. It actually can seem somewhat similar to ADD and ADHD. Also common in NF. I wish you luck and hope you find answers. Definitely sounds like things I struggle with. I was diagnosed at 13. I had been struggling to focus in school and socially for a few years but the teachers basically just blamed me. My mom finally figured it out. It sucks that there are such misconceptions about add and women like us go without the help we need for far too long. This sounds like what I struggled with until I was diagnosed at 13. I really struggled with math, so I was tested to see if I qualified for special education services when I was 10. I did not qualify for any learning related services. \nIn 7th grade, things just got worse. My dad took me to the doctor and I was diagnosed with ADHD. I was put on Vyvanse and  my grades in school went up. I went from failing math in middle school, to receiving a B in college algebra during my sophomore year of college. \nI would really talk to your doctor and see what he has to say. \nI am still on Vyvanse and have heard from other sources that it is one of the better medications for ADHD. I got tested when I was younger and nothing specific came up. My mom sent an email to my neurologist and I am seeing him next week; he thinks it is ADHD so we are going to figure things out then.\n\n\n\nThanks for the advice. Hi. I am 22, still in college, and I met with my neuro oncologist last week, and she got me  an appointment with a neuropsychiatrist. I am pretty sure I have ADHD, and I am also not sure if I should take meds, but if I will get the diagnose, and talked with the doctors, my thoughts will be more clear. As long as you are not diagnosed, I still recomment to change your diet, added sugar, processed foods and many other shit is really bad for an ADHD brain. Also EXERCISE, you need that too. \n\nI would like to follow your story, we are in a really similar shoe, moreover I do not know anyone with NF1.... \n\nsorry for my english", "Migraines. Migranes. Migranes! I am a 25 year old male. Born with NF (brought on by my dad) and since early teens, I have been suffering from migranes (with auras.) Some months I will have few (if any) but other months I will have many (some last 3 consecutive days) I had a brain scan when I was 14 which was 11 years ago back in a time where the intensity of the migranes, just, were not as bad...I have been getting them more frequently for the past two years to the point of them being unbarable. That pain right behind the eye. I need solutions I cannot take this and 1,200 mg of IB profen does not even touch it. I get migraines occasionally (not related to my NF) and the only thing that helps me is smoking weed. I would highly suggest trying.  Lol have you read my username? \ud83d\ude02 Does not help tbh Fuck lol I am not very observant Lmao it is all good man I would go get it checked out, better to be safe! Go get an MRI scan. \n\nIt is possible they are being caused by a tumour somewhere.  I used to get them in my early teens thru my 20s. I am 35 now and have not had one in a few years. The frequency started to decline in my late 20s. They were horrible. I ended up in the ER a few times needing IV meds to deal with it. They do make a epipen type injection of a migraine medication they used to give me in an IV in the ER. They did a spinal tap the first time I went to make sure I did not have an aneurysm. \n\nIt may or may not be NF related. I learned that doctors were observing more males in their teens and 20s experiencing this. I did find that a high dose of IB profen as soon as I felt one coming on could stop them but not always. Staying hydrated and being aware of the earliest signs is all I was able to do.  I think a lot of us NF or not smoke weed lol. You should go see your doctor who oversees your neurofibromatosis. It might be time to have another scan of your brain, so that they can be compared to the previous one", "Has anyone tried Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy? If so why did you do it, and did it help you in any way? I have Neurofibromatosis (1), chronic scoliosis, restrictive lung disease, and various other health conditions. I was high functioning, physically speaking for most of my life (20 years); although, two to three years ago I began developing extreme pain, neuropathy, &amp; fatigue that has only gotten worse. These issues have gotten so bad that I have had to quit my job and drop out of college. My doctors are of little help. All they do is prescribe opioids, but even the opioids stopped working months ago, and now I spend almost all day ever day lying in bed. \n\nI am trying to explore alternative avenues to deal with these chronic issues, and one thing that I was thinking about trying is hyperbaric oxygen therapy, especially since I have strictive lung disease, and I think getting an extra dose of oxygen might really help. \n\nHas anyone with Nf tried Hyperbaric Oxygen therapy, specifically for pain, neuropathy or fatigue. Please let me know what you guys thinks. I have a full body MRI twice a year for my entire life. I do have a 3.3 inch tumor on my spine. But it is a strange shape and very spread out, so it cannot be removed. I was on selumetinib for a year and a half before the drug even got FDA approval. \n\nUnfortunately, I was one of only 20% of participants who gained little to no improvement, or tumor shrinkage, from taking the drug (selumetinib) . Luckily, since trying Selumetinib a different NF drug was put out on the market known as Cabometyx. I have been on Cabometyx for a year now, but no improvement either. There are currently no other drugs out there to treat Neurofibromatosis, so I am pretty screwed. \n\nI do have a main doctor who acts as \u201cteam coach\u201d. I am lucky to go to one of the best hospitals in the nation, Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital, but even then NF is a very rare and little know disease, and ai have a very severe case, so they are basically out of ideas\u2026\n\nYes, I tried medical marijuana. Unfortunately, it did not help at all, but I am still taking 1,000 mg of CBD every day just incase.  \nI also tried ketamine infusions before that became a common wide spread treatment for severe pain, but that dod nothing. Then I tried lidocain infusions when it was just an small experimental type of treatment, and now ot is this new revolutionary form of pain treatment, butt hat did nothing to help with my pain either. \n\nI got botox injection to help with muscle spasticity due to spinal damage, but that has not helped. \n\nI tried medical grade capsaicin on my legs to help with my neuropathy. That didnt help and only gave me 1st degree burns. \n\nI tried gabapentin, zoloft, celexa, and a whole bunch of anti-depressants to try to treat my neuropathy, but nothing has helped. \n\nI have tried EVERYTHING, yet nothi try ng seems to work.

Thanks, though. ", "Leukemia and NF 1 First of all, I would like to thank everyone here as I finally got my 8 year old daughter diagnosed with NF1. Your stories, advice, reassurance, and recommendations were all so helpful and made the process that much easier for me and my family. I am here today because, unfortunately, two months after her official NF diagnosis my daughter was diagnosed with leukemia. We are currently on day 19 of her treatment, and we of course are praying and hopeful for a complete recovery.  \n\nWhen we got the leukemia diagnosis, I asked the oncologist if there was a link to the NF. She said no. She is the expert, of course, but when I googled I saw a research paper studying the connection. So that got me thinking...has anyone here ever heard of a link between leukemia and NF1? Or has anyone with NF1 also had leukemia?  Thanks in advance for any info anyone can provide. I am sorry to hear about your precious baby. \nCan you provide the study link? I am curious. I downloaded once genetic counseling book, and for NF1 it is stated that leukemia can also emerge There is a higher prevelance between  some cancers ( like leukemia) and NF1. That Is why regular check ups are important. Treatment stays the same for the most part I am far from an expert, but I have read that in some countries, people with NF1 actually cannot donate bone marrow because of the cancer risk associated. There might just be a really tiny chance of finding (potentially) cancerous marrow cells, but giving them to immunocompromised people (with leukaemia or other conditions) would just be too risky. Doctors just do not want that.\n\nWhat I am taking from this is that while NF1 is not directly linked to leukaemia like say, smoking and lung cancer, there might be a risk that is a bit above average.\n\nI hope your daughter's treatment goes well!! I am sorry about what you are going through. I have never heard of a link between the two and I have had cancerous Neurofibromatosis tumors removed in both 2014 and 2018. Thank you. Here is the link:  Wow. I would never been told that...not even the geneticist mentioned it. I had an appointment with an NF clinic in December, but now that will have to be postponed for another two years until all leukemia treatment is done. Thank you very much for the well wishes and the info! I had no idea! Thank you. Like I mentioned, even the oncologist/hematologist said there was not a link, so it does not seem to be so well known. I see a Neurofibromatosis specialist who pretty much lives and breathes Neurofibromatosis and he is never mentioned anything about there being a link. Unless this is something very new that they are just learning about I would say the is not a link. I hope treatment goes well, are there anu neurologist, endocinologist , dermatologist... at the hospital? Maybe you can have a talk with them. I dont go to a NF clinic but the doctor who treat me have a good insight in NF Yea, in Atlas of Genetic Diagnosis and Counseling by Harold Chen; by Springfield. But again, it does not have to be connected I think Leukemia is one of the associated cancers, and is mentioned several times in the new Nf1 Book (available on Libgen for free. Read here ( on how to use libgen )  \n\n\u201cNF1-associated tumors include cutaneous and plexiform neurofibromas, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, glomus tumors, pheochromocytomas, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, astrocytomas (reviewed by \\)\u201d \n\nand\n\n\u201cChildren with NF1 are predisposed to the development of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia, as well as acute lymphocytic leukemia, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

It is not important. What matters is that your daughter will get the best treatment.\n\nI am sorry you had the double shock of an NF1 diagnosis and cancer in such short time. I hope you have friends and family to support you. \n\nWhenever you feel the need to express your emotions without filters, come here, we will listen to you. \n\nBest wishes", "My Story, because reasons I subscribed to this subreddit and have yet to post much of anything, so I figured I would share my story.\n\nI am a 29 year old male living with NF. I was diagnosed at the age of 16. At the time I was playing foot ball (not well, but I was on the team). I had always been athletic but never cared about sports and was always uncoordinated. None the less, my friend at the time got me into the sport and as I started to progress, I of course was going through puberty, which is the point NF reared it is ugly head.\n\nIt started with a bowing of my left shin found at my physical. Scans found a cyst at the center of it and I was ordered by the doctor to not play football until a specialist took a look at it for fear it would snap. After weeks of being sidelined I finally seen a specialist in Detroit, who still makes me laugh when I think about him. We traveled across the state to see this specialist. he puts the MRI up on the light bored and says \"you see this?\" pointing to the obvious bowing and cyst. \"that is not normal\" \"...\" \"but go ahead and play\".\n\nIt was bitter sweet really, it felt like a waste of time, but I got the clear to play again. I got home in time to help my friend as a coaches assistant for the rocket league and raced my bike over to the field with my football in between my handle bars. A bump in the road knocked the ball loose and I ran over it with my back tire which flipped my bike and me into the air where I did the nicest shoulder check to the pavement. I was young and sprung right back up, but could not move my arm much. having just recently watched lethal weapon and being a dumb kid I figured I dislocated my shoulder and when I got the field I had my friend lift my arm to pop it back into place. this was immediately met with excruciating pain. So, I left to go to the urgent care. This also makes me laugh, as they took and Xray, and put it up on the board, and clearly you can see that my collar bone is nearly in two, and the doctor says \"I am going to have to get a specialist to look at this\" I know it is protocol, but again, I was a dumb kid and could not help but laugh as I had no medical training and I looked at it for 0.5 seconds and said \"there is your problem\".\n\nWell, football season that year was done for me, I was in a sling for a long time. but base ball season was just around the corner and I figured I would stay in shape and condition myself for that. I started working out and one day noticed I had lost some strength in my left leg, I figured I just pulled a muscle and nursed it a bit, but when baseball tryouts started, I hit the floor hard doing a shuffle exercise and decided I would go to the doctor. the reflex test showed no reflex in my left leg... tests where done and shown that I had weakening nerve connection to my calf, MRI's showed a tumor mass growing from my spine. (as a side note, I have always been a bit of a dare devil. at the time my leg starting to weaken, I still found it a good idea to do flips off of the gymnasium bleachers onto a pol-volt mat we got a hold of in gym class, my last jump, I over shot and my foot smashed on the floor and fractured my ankle... so all of my sophomore year I was in a sling or cast... my team mates started to speculate I was faking it lol)   \n\nNow, I have always had my inner demons. I, like any sane teen, struggled with depression. But mostly I never had the attention span to stay self loathing for long. When I was told the nerve damage was permanent, I held it together, but all voices started to sound like the peanuts adults after that, all that rang in my head was that I only had further loss of functions to look forward too, and they just want to wait and see, because surgery could make it worse. I feel like I checked out for the rest of the meeting with the doctor, and came too when my mom was in the drive threw at Mcdonalds and asked me what I wanted.... and I could do nothing but quiver my lips trying to hold back the tears. My mom of course hugged me and cried, which did not help my holding back. I remember honking behind us as we sat in the drive through hugging each other and crying for a few moments, I do not think I ate anything the rest of the day. \n\nKeep in mind that at this time, we had no idea really what NF was or to suspect it, but the idea got brought up since my Uncle and Aunt on my Mom's side had the disease. All I knew was my aunt was on disability for a learning disorder and my Uncle had a messed up eye... not exactly helping my demeanor.\n\nwell, I went to the NF clinic and they denied I had enough signs at the time, mostly because my mom had never been diagnosed, but we found the missing cafe olay to get the diagnoses. this eventually lead to finding Dr. Mckay Mckinnon, a surgeon at the university of Chicago, famous for removing a 200lb tumor from a woman. We found out from him, not only is my tumor much larger than we where led to believe, but it has invaded my glute and my bladder, and is only getting worse. I was signed up for surgery so fast my head was spinning. I lost my glute, half my bladder and a lot of tumor. Most of my Junior year was spent recuperating from the major surgery. The incision went from the back of my knee to the outer rim of my... rim.\n\nas the years went on, I have lost all mobility of my left foot, but with some ace wrap I can walk around. I am years over due for follow up scans, but as I progress in life I find it more and more difficult to take time off of work to spend tons of money to either be told I am fine, or worse, that I have more trouble ahead.\n\nI am currently a Medical Assistant, and now that I am in a profession, now that I am engaged to the woman of my dreams, now that I find myself with more responsibility, I am finding it more and more obvious that I have a memory problem.\n\nI have always been easily distracted, mostly by my own thoughts. I would get really excited, pull out my note pad and pen in class and think \"yes, I am going to pay attention, I am going to ace the test, I am going to get a scholarship, then I will be on my way to a great university and make a...\" the bell rings, I missed the lesson, and I have doodles all over the page I indented on making notes on.\n\nnow, what I find funny is, far too often I forget the simplest things seconds after someone tells me, yet I always did well on tests, most of my problems came from not remembering to do homework. but I doodled in class and drove the teachers crazy when they could not keep my attention, turn in any homework, but pass the class with my test scores. further more, I tend to do my best when I just blurt out the answer (I often blurt out things randomly, not always appropriate) but I do not tend to do well when I have to think about the answer. math is a good example. I did much worse with the show your work crap, but half the time I can solve the problem with what feels like not even thinking about it. I second guess myself and try to work out the problem in the method we are suppose to use and it takes forever, and I get 3 different answers before finding out I was write the first time.\n\nthe hard part, what I fear puts strain on my job and relationship, is that adult life is not multiple choice tests. I have a terrible sense of direction, I forget instructions and details almost instantly. I forget to make appointments, I forget to pay bills, I forget to look at our expenses. I find that as my awareness of my memory and attention issues blossoms, so does my anxiety and depression, further impeding my attention span, and it can be a vicious cycle.\n\nWhen things look their darkest, I have to keep in mind that I am working at a wonderful hospital with doctors that respect me and what I do, I am making a living with the woman of my dreams and although we hit hard times with expenses, we live in a great place and always make due. I want to eventually further my education and move up with my responsibilities, and if ever I have my self doubts, my future wife, and colleagues remind me of my hard work and accomplishments, I even had a world renowned cardiac surgeon compliment me and encourage me to keep moving forward. I will always struggle with my limitations, but I am thankful for the support I get, and the reminder that I am capable of more than I give myself credit for.  ", "Just frustrated and need to vent I have NF1 so I know my case is not as bad as it could be. My legs and torso/chest are covered in cafe -o- le spots. I actually quite like them! But I have a lot of bumps on my arms and some on my back. Lately, I have had some growing along my jawline and they have been growing. I also have a very large one on my neck and noticed a new ( still very small one ) pop up on my side on the ribs. I have been wanting to get the one on my neck removed for a few years now. I should have gotten it done when I had one on my back removed 2 years ago and I was still on my parent's insurance. The Dr did not recommend it do to possible scarring and that it could possibly grow back. Anyways 2 years later I have my own shitty insurance and it is been impossible to find a dermatologist that takes my insurance and knows NF! So basically if I want to get it removed by a dr who knows NF I am looking at paying everything out of pocket. \n\nAnyone else ever get frustrated with dealing with insurance and NF? Yeah. It is tough all over. Insurance itself can be shitty. Nf does not make it easier I know the feeling.\n\nI have NF2, and there is a grand total of two doctors in the whole state of Texas that specialize in my condition for adults.  There are a few more specialists, but they are all pediatrician doctors.\n\nThere was a time I had one of the marketplace health insurance plans, and I could not keep seeing my doctor as a result.  I had to go to a new one who had absolutely no knowledge of NF2, so his proposal was to just have me fly to Boston for my health check-ups.\n\nI was like \"my former doctor is literally down the street from here and he can literally tell you what I need for treatment, and you all want me to fly to Boston?\". Our health system is completely garbage. Even though I have had quite an interesting medical history, NF has never frustrated me. You just need to be positive. I am glad I got the few removed when I did, even though it left scarring and insurance did not cover it all. Within reason, the peace of mind is worth it. Scarring was pretty minimal, though, for mine. When I was on Medicaid, I needed basically permission to see my doctor who is out of state, who diagnosed me when I was 15 (I will be 37 next week). I had an issue with my last surgery in 2018, that was of a cancerous tumor, that the day of my surgery they decided not to approve it. Even though four years before they approved previous surgery with the very same surgeon. I, my primary doctor back home and the hospital in Chicago all filed appeals and thankfully it was approved and I was able to have the surgery done.\n\nI do not know what your situation is, since my dad applied for retirement and since I was already receiving SSI, I was able to apply off of him for RI and to be placed on Medicare, which means I will no longer need any permission to see my doctor in Chicago and will not need a referral all the time from my primary care doctor. Anyways depending on what your situation is and how bad your condition is, you might be eligible for disability where you could receive Medicaid or Medicare or maybe both. You are got to be shitting me with this comment. \nHow rude. Why do not you tell us you will pray for us. \n\nI will be positive that next time I look in the mirror I will hate myself even more. Meant absolutely no disrespect by my comment. Just answered the question. Did not answer it with thoughts on insurance though. Of course, I always want the best for you everyone. I have been through more than the average person with NF with surgeries. All I am saying is this disease has not stressed me out. Positivity is a great way to get yourself through tough situations. I know your insurance sucks, but if you do get them removed I would recommend a plastic surgeon over a dermatologist.  Neurofibromas typically grow too far under the skin for a dermatologist to properly remove. Being positive with NF gets you nowhere ....\nPerhaps I was a little kneejerk with my response and for that I do apologize. \nBut for my friends without insurance in the USA there only option is to wait for death, they cannot be insured. \nI too have experienced many surgeries and braces and bullying and threats against my person because of my NF. \nI believe telling someone who cannot see a doctor because their condition does not allow it to just think happy thoughts counteracts everything that they actually medically need.\nPostive thoughts might seem nice, but they are not going to 'fix us' I agree with you. I accept your apology but you did not necessarily need to give one. I can see how my response could upset people. I was not bothered by your response. Positivity has gotten me far. I have had 27 brain surgeries and I just kind of laugh when told I need one. Not sure why they cannot be insured. They should definitely look around because there is insurance out there for everyone. It is true that a lot of doctors do not know about NF. It is a relatively common disease affecting about 1 out of 3,000 births but not a lot of people know about it. NF affects everyone differently and I am not downplaying anyone\u2019s condition. For those having insurance issues, check out zocdoc.com you can find doctors by speciality and insurance. **I found links in your comment that were not hyperlinked:**\n\n* (\n\n*I did the honors for you.*\n\n***\n\n^( ^| ^( ^| ^&lt;3 I hope some can find assistance within the link. \nI am just sad because one of my beautiful friends is dying. She is in her early 30s and there is nothing much doctors are willing to do for her. Insurance no longer pays for her visits or MRIs. She cannot get proper home help. It just sucks. I get so fucking upset when she asks for help. (never money) she needs someone for physical help and all people offer is thoughts and prayers and to stay positive. \nMy friend is ready to die and I cannot help her with anything in her physical day to day life. \n\nI have personally feel ruined by this disease. \nI have had people (strangers) write me three page letters about what an inspiration I am to get out of the house when I look the way I do. \nI have had a boss say my husband must be very understanding to love me because of the way I am because not many people would. \nThat is not helping me postive at all. \n\nBut I am proud that with all that you have experienced that you are still able to see through it all in a positive light. \nThat is fantastic. Maybe one day I will have the same headspace. I am so sorry to hear about this. I know that NF can be difficult to deal with. You should definitely take a look at this site and see if you can find someone that would be willing to work with her. There has to be someone out there that will and hopefully her insurance will cover visits. This could help provide a little comfort. I will definitely pray for her.", "Only 1 big spot (allergic rush)  Just wondering if this can be nf. My son have some speech problems, bad at sports.", "Question for men with NF1 All my life there has been a large dent in my chest. I am curious to know if that has anything to do with NF1 and if anyone else has experienced that?", "Does all NF2 patient has Bilateral Acoustic Neuroma? ", "Optical glioma/brain tumour symptoms? Hello, I am 22 and up until now I have only been mildy affected cosmeticly by nf (type 1) However my eyesight has been getting progressively worse in my left eye. \n\nI noticed the vision began to decrease in the past three or four years maybe? I go to the opticians every year and all they have done is prescribe me slightly stronger glasses each time. They have shown no concern and said it is fairly common for the sight in one eye to be worse than the other. But my worry is how much worse it is and I am scared I could go blind eventually or that it is a tumour. \n\nEarlier this year I went to the hosptial to have some visual tests done and they too said they had no concerns and that they thought a scan to look in my head/eye did not seem necessary as if it was a tumour it would have effected my vision differently? Would it be worth getting a second opion? I would really rather not have any sort of mri or other scan done if I am honest \n\nBasically just asking if anyone has an optical glioma and when it was found as I was led to believe it was something that usually happened in early childhood. Any advice or anything would be greatly appreciated! Thank you Hi,\n\nGenerally, optic nerve glioma appear in early childhood and stop growing before puberty.  There are always exceptions of course. \n\nAn ophthalmologist would be the person to see regarding this, not an optometrist.\n\nAn MRI is the way to properly diagnose the tumor if it exists. There is no radiation from an MRI if that is your hangup.  My daughter has an optic nerve glioma and is completely blind in her left eye.  We had followed the scan and appointment schedule recommended by her NF specialist, having MRI's every 6 months until age 5, then were going to go to every 12months after that.  However,\n9 months into our first 12 month span, she told us she could not see out of her left eye. Long story short, she started chemotherapy 3 days later after emergency MRI's, being helicoptered to a children's hospital, and having surgery to place a chemo port in her chest.  She was 5 years old at the time.  Prior to this, every ophthalmologist exam and brain MRI had been perfect, nothing abnormal.\n\n\n\nI also have NF, and my own individual research after my daughter's optic nerve diagnosis has led me to believe the gliomas are so very much more likely in childhood. \n\n\nIf you have concerns about an optic nerve glioma, I would recommend scheduling with an ophthalmologist.  A neurologist with knowledge of NF may also be of help, my NF specialist always checks my eyes for abnormalities even though an ophthalmologist does a more thorough job. Is your Neurofibromatosis specialist also taking a look at your eyes? When I see my specialist he usually will take a quick look into my eyes, along with other tests he does with me, each year or every six months.  I do not see a specialist. I was not officially diagnosed until last year and am still waiting to see someone about it. I have had to try and contact a specialist myself as the doctor would not refer me to one as my case \"is not serious enough\" to be seen by one apparently. Very frustrating as I have things I would like to discuss and things checked over.  Hi, thanks for the information! I guess I shall try to get a referral to a ophthalmologist then and see if they can tell me what is going on with my eye. What will an ophthalmologist do exactly? Ealrier this year I was at the eye department (it could have been them I saw but I cannot remember) and they basically just did some visual tests and I had drops put into my eye. Hello. Sorry to hear hear what your daughter has been through. I hope you are both doing well.\n\nI am going to see if I can get a referral to an ophthalmologist and see if they can tell me what is causing the vision loss. I unfortunately do not see a specialist at this time and have been waiting for six months or so to even hear back from one let alone get an appointment but hopefully that will not be too much longer   How was your doctor able to officially diagnose you if they are not a specialist in Neurofibromatosis? I was not diagnosed until I was 15, my pediatrician at the time had always believed I might have it, but could never give an official diagnosis. Things began to progress during purburty causing her to become concerned and I ended up in Chicago where I was officially diagnosed, after Grand Rapids, Michigan told my pediatrician that I needed to go to Chicago as it sounded like I was progressing a lot more then they were capible of handling, \n\nHave you tried finding a specialist this way? \n\n\nIf you primary doctor is giving you problems and not listening to your concerns, I might switch primary doctors if your able to. In my case, mine had remained dormant for a number of years, I showed signs of it, but something conclusive until after I hit puberty and since then mine had progressed a lot. I have had four surgeries, the last two were for tumors that had become cancerous and I guess my concern is if your primary does not specialize in Neurofibromatosis they may not know what to look for. \n\nI will keep my fingers crossed that your able to find a specialist. It was a geneticist that diagnosed me. It was suspected I had it for a while too but never enough syptoms to actually get a diagnosis, until last year.\n\nThank you for the link but I am in the UK so I do not think it will be useful unfortunately.\n\nI will definitely try the doctors again though and see if they can get me an appointment with a specialist as I know there is a department at a hospital near me that does deal with nf it is just getting the referal which has been a problem.\n\nThank you. Sorry to hear about the surgeries you have had to go through, I hope you are doing okay now. \n Thank you. I am doing better, though something has been going on with my foot, similar to what was going on in 2007. Will find out more after I have my MRIs next week. I hope you are able to find a specialest.  The main difference between an ophthalmologist and an optometrist is that an ophthalmologist is more knowledgeable about the optic nerves themselves.  They will have special equipment and knowledge that can help detect early warning signs of glioma, etc.  Wow, I am sorry to hear that. That seems like a really aggressive glioma. My understanding are that ONGs are more much aggressive in the non-NF population.\n\nMay I ask why you were having routine MRIs if there was nothing apparently wrong? That much sedation seems like overkill for pure monitoring purposes.  My husband and I thought the MRI schedule was pretty excessive also but we were following the advice of our specialist (I have been seeing the same NF specialist for around 15 ago thru an NF clinic, my daughter sees the same).  Our daughter, however, is incredibly mature for her age, always has been, and after the emergency MRI where sedation was not an option due to us not knowing it was going to happen/she did not get to fast, she no longer uses sedation. She is almost 9 and has not been sedated since the optic nerve glioma diagnosis.  She holds still, and the hospital where she is treated has movie goggles and headphones she gets to use.\n\n\nHers was very aggressive and the quickness of its growth is pretty atypical.  The tumor responded well to chemo and we just celebrated 2 years cheno-free/stability. She is still blind in one eye as the optic nerve has had too much damage, but you would never know it by looking at her. She is advanced in school, plays sports, and is gifted with art. It is phenomenal how well she has adapted. Thanks for your story. It is amazing how kids can adapt to their circumstances.  My son is now 2.5 and has had two MRIs due to mild sphenoid wing dysplasia. Beyond that he has a few CNFs but that seems to be it.  Do you remember what she had for chemo? I was under the impression that chemo was pretty ineffective.  Avastin and Carboplatin.  She did Avastin every other week for the first 6 months, then every 4 weeks for 6 months and Carboplatin once every 4 weeks for 12 months. Both were during the same 12 month span.\n\n\nIt was successful; the tumor shrunk by about 60% and all blood supplies died. That is good to hear. My son's mri came back favorable to an optic glioma in the chiasm, we will be hearing from a neurooncologist shortly. Good to know there are modern chemo drugs effective for these tumors.  I wish you and your family the best during this time.  It all can be very scary.  I am on a support group on Facebook for parents of children with gliomas and have seen several different combinations of chemos used successfully.  If you need to vent or have any questions about what we went thru during my daughter's treatment, please feel free to reach out to me. Do you feel like effective treatment is a relatively recent phenomena in optic glioma?  Most of what I have read seemed pretty meh about it. Hard to know how old some of these articles are though.  Honestly, I am not sure. I grew up in the era where there was not much info about NF yet.  At the time of my diagnosis in the early 90's, they had just learned what chromosome NF was on (or so i am told).  Also, my parents kind of had the mentality of ignoring my NF issues and \"they will go away.\". With my daughter's glioma diagnosis, I started doing a lot more research and reading on the topic.  Prior to our experience, I was under the impression that chemo was only used for cancer, so her being on it for a benign tumor was initially confusing.\n\nIf effective treatment is relatively new, I am beyond grateful for it. Thanks for your perspective. My son is only 2.5 and is a spontaneous mutation so this is relatively new for us. I know MEK inhibitors for neurofibromas are on the horizon but am not caught up to date on glioma research.  Could you link me to the Facebook group?  I was born with an optic gleoma on my right optic chiasem...have been blind eh I would say 95% in my right eye since birth.... Had to go through a few rounds of chemo for it, but doing great now :) there is the Che and pains and all that but every day is a beautiful day!   So I know this was posted three months ago, but just found this sub and wanted to weigh in.  I am 36/F and see an NF specialist yearly.  I should go get my eyes checked out too, but the (different) doctor that specializes in NF and opthamology left such a bitter taste in my mouth last time.   Anyway, do you get yearly MRIs?  I know my MRIs show my optic gliomas, which thank goodness have never been a concern. THANK GOODNESS.  However, just this past August I was diagnosed with a grade I JPA brain tumor.  I was having headaches when waking and wooshy dizzy feelings.  Nothing with the eyesight.  I would talk to your NF or eye doctor.", "Hello, I am new here. Hi, My name is Clieve, 20 years old from Sweden. I guess this is a post where I aim to introduce myself. I was diagnosed with Nf-2 back in 2018. The doctors told me that it is pretty rare to have Nf-2 and that I am the only one in my city that has it (that they know of at least). \n\nAll info the doctors give me is pretty vague, especially since they have not encountered many people with my condition. I thought, therefore, that it would be a good idea to join a community of people who might share similar experiences as I. \n\nHope you all have a great day and I am happy I found this group (: Hey, fellow NF2er here. Welcome to the club, unfortunately. Things seem a little dead on this subreddit, so I would recommend the NF2 Just Us group on Facebook if you are looking for some more community and sharing of experiences and treatments.", "NF and Fatigue Does anyone know if NF and fatigue are related? I do not know if it is because I am generally very sedentary and slightly overweight, but going into my late 20\u2019s I have noticed I am always tired and need to rest/lay down multiple times a day. It seems like I cannot get enough sleep regardless of I get 7 hours or 12 hours of sleep. I just cannot seem to get and keep energized. It is possile, you might have a lower muscle tension , you need more energy because of this. Might also be balansen you need more energie to keep your joints stable Persistent fatigue, particularly for patients also experiencing chronic pain is very common with Neurofibromatosis Thyroid affects weight and makes you fatigued too so you may want your levels checked. I have hypothyroidism, before I was on meds I could barley make it through grocery shopping after work due to the fatigue. Neurofibromatosis does effect everyone differently, I have Neurofibromatosis and have a more severe case of it, but I never feel tired and feel the need to nap. It would be best to discuss this with your doctor. I hear it is possible but cause of it is unknown. Never been an issue with me. Fatigue can come from tons of places. It could be completely unrelated to NF1. \n\nAre you on a pain killer or gabapentin? Those can also lead to fatigue. It could be depression, diet, hormones, thyroid, weight, unhealthy sleep habits, lifestyle, or a litany of other things. \n\nTalk to your doctor about it they may have some solutions. Sounds like covid No this has been a constant for a few years now If you think and worry a lot about your condition it could be the worry that causes it rather than NF itself. I normally get extremely low anytime I know I have an upcoming appointment and it affects not only my sleep, but also my general happiness.\n\nI just had my last visit to the hospital for the year and am still a bit low despite having received positive news. It usually takes time for me to get back on track.  Then everything is fine until I get my next appointment. Yes, I have NF and hypothyroidism too.  The fatigue has not gone away since my thyroid levels have been fixed, so they are still trying to figure it out.", "Trying to understand more I am 23 and I was diagnosed with NF1 at a young age. I had scoliosis surgery at 13 which was from having NF. I have caf\u00e9 au lait patches and freckles all over my body and they also found a \u201cULO\u201d (unidentified light object) in my brain. \n\n As I am getting older I have noticed that my memory is also really bad for someone my age. Aside the more physical symptoms are there any kind of emotional or mental traits people seem to get? My sister and mum both also have NF but my dad does not and seems to think untidiness is a trait and I wondered how try this seems to be with other people?\n\nBeing so young I do not really remember much was said about it and I wanted to get a bigger understanding of this. I want to be able to explain to future people in my life what I could be/act like.  NF1 is correlated with developmental disabilities such as autism. But there is no causal effect for behaviors like untidiness. That is likely a learned trait. I am a super clean person, and have NF1. \nI do have ADHD, depression, and severe anxiety.and I wonder if the adhd is correlated with NF1, but there is no empirical evidence to support that. As far a the other things, I attribute that to childhood abuse.\nFor the most part, this disease is only characterized by fibromas (benign tumors) that grow on the nerves. They can be in or outside the body, and people typically show the cafe spots like you mentioned. \nAs far as behavior, there really is not any empirical evidence that says anything.  I would not call untidiness a trait, that more of a learne behavior. If you crew up in a messy house or no one have told you to clean your room and make your be that would carry over into adulthood.\n\nIf you feel you are have memory issues you should speak with you neurofibromatosis doctor, especially if you have been have a lot of headaches I think you should look into how you relate to executive dysfunction.  It is common among people with disabilities like autism and ADHD, both of which most of us have at least one of :)  Ahhh that seems to be a lot like me, that is really interesting. Thank you  Most of my family members who suffer NF seem to be forgetful, I think my sister is the worst but I have a yearly checkup soon so maybe it is worth talking to them about  That is so helpful thank you! I have neurofibromatosis and my family says I remember everything, even as a little kid I could name all my stuffed animals, which probably has helped me with remembering peoples names I have dealt with it my whole life and it certainly influences my untidiness. Part is also some childhood trauma surrounding cleaning, but I am working on short book/ zine on fighting executive dysfunction as an adult.  Unfortunately, most tips online assume you are a parent and the tips are not too applicable.\n\nI would be happy to chat with you (or anyone reading this) about where you struggle.  While I am technically not a professional, I have come a long way in my own journey with Executive Dysfunction, and am mad enough about how insulting some of the material out there is to want to offer an alternative.  Actually, attention deficits are really really common for people with NF1. You have to scroll a bit to get to that section of the article. \n\n Memory issues like forgetfulness but then you say \u201coh I cannot believe I forgot to stop at the store/do laundry/etc\u201d or like totally forgetting something happened? The first could be a symptom of something like ADHD (as is being messy). The later is much more concerning.   Omg, I had a feeling. Thank you!!!  It is usually listed as one of the main secondary symptoms.  I would say I am like I have forgotten where I have put my keys or wallet and I have forotten what you have just told me  That would be so much help thank you!! I had a look into Executive dysfunction and a lot of it seems like what I am and what I do, so it would be good to chat   Ok that is totally normal, at least for me.

I went to a NF event this weekend and found it very worthwhile, just to listen to the experts talk is great. A few of the medical team I see were there go caught up and actually rang them yesterday to arrange a few things to help get rid of the pain. We are not going to this years forum, but I have been to 4 of them over the years.  All I can say is go.  You will learn a lot, meet others with NF and many doctors, experts, and folks from the community who can answer whatever questions you have.

I have multiple times, and ended up needing multiple surgeries due to tumors around nerves in there. If possible Id go see a doctor and get a scan Also NF3 here. I have have a slight limp that comes and goes, but never as significant as you describe. It could just be due to pain, so take that with a grain of salt. Do consider that they may have missed the main culprit when they removed tumors a couple years ago (this was my experience). Thoughts are with you, sounds rough. Yes, I have had this going on for years, also with my right leg. I also had surgery on my spine, on my cervical spine to remove tumors pressing against it. This was done in 2006. Then in 2014 on my right upper leg I had cancerous tumors removed. They were able to remove all of the cancerous tumors, but did not remove all of the tumors. I still have a large mass on my right leg. If they removed it, there would be this big empty space in my leg, is what I was basically told.\n\nI do have balance issues, and my right leg is definitely weaker than my left. I have had my right leg give out, most times my left leg catches me, but not always. Stairs can be a challenge at times and I do walk with a limp. I do take two pain medications. \n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask. Does it hurt when your leg gives out? Ugh. Yeah I am supposed to be scanned every year but I lost my insurance when I lost my job. I know I need to get it checked but tbh I hate being around humans and definitely hate doctors and like many on here I am claustrophobic of MRIs now. It is not painful (Though I have grown accustom to pain), it just feels like I lose all strength and control of it.

I have a weird bump on my foot and I am assumed to have NF1 but it does not cause pain like a tumor would. My 2 year old does not talk but I kind of rubbed on it to see if it caused him pain and he did not show any signs  of pain Has he been diagnosed with Neurofibromatosis? Not all tumours cause pain, I have a big fibroma on the sole of my foot. It is been there for as long as I can remember, but it does not bother me. OP, as long as it does not suddenly become hard and painful, or does not seem to be growing your LO should be fine! Yes It is kind of hard tho. So it maybe something else. Okay, typical bumps do not just show up out of thin air, they are something to grow little by little over time. I would keep an eye on it and bring it up with the pediatrician. In that case, definitely check with your doctor, it is probably nothing, but better s to be sure! If you'recertain there was nothing there a few days ago and now he has this bump, it is unlikely to be a neurofibroma.

They are going to give an eye exam as well but  it is grown 6 millimeters in just 6 months. The plan going forward is another checkup in march and possibly chemotherapy if the growing persists anymore in the next couple of months. Luckily we go to Dr. Slopis which is a leading researcher on NF. I have known my wife since she was 15 with no tumors. We knew the risk having a child but we chose to have one anyway so I have been prepared for the possibility of bad news but my wife is also showing signs of a possible brain tumor as well. It is been a rough 6 months. I wish you all the best.  I am so sorry... I wish him a safe recovery... please stay strong  Thank you, staying strong for me comes easy.

What is your experience been? I just recently went to a spinal surgeon regarding some mid back pain I have had for about 2 years. I just got my MRI results yesterday which showed a herniated thoracic disc (likely what was causing the pain) but also 4 tumors on my intercostal nerves at various locations near my thoracic spine. The radiology report describes them as likely neurofibromas or schwannomas. I am suppose to be getting an MRI with contrast tomorrow, and then getting referred to a neurologist for further workup. The doctor told me that because I have more than one, this means that I have some form of neurofibromatosis. However, they cannot say which until I have my appointment with the neurologist. \n\nSo I am just here trying to gain some perspective from other folks who may be in a similar situation as me. It seems most of you have had a diagnosis from a young age, and it is hard to find experiences of anyone getting a diagnosis after 30. So if you are like me, I would love to hear your story. I was diagnosed at 15 with nf type 1. I am 36 now. If you have any questions ask away I was cleared as child. I was checked because my mom has it. Got diagnosed about a year ago at 33. It sucks because it changes my reproductive plans. I was also recently diagnosed in my 30s, which from what I understand is fairly rare. Going through all the various diagnostic testing is definitely a whirlwind and meant some big life changes. The best recommendation I have is to try to find a doctor who specializes in NF - I travel out of state to see mine, since no one anywhere closer to me knew enough. I found that a huge help to understand what was going on and what I need to plan for. PM me if you want to chat! I was diagnosed at 33 following my daughter\u2019s diagnosis. Obviously I have been lucky enough to be mildly affected but I do wish I would have know earlier. &gt;The doctor told me that because I have more than one, this means that I have some form of neurofibromatosis. \n\nAlthough the doctor may be truncating the explanation, you should know that an \"official\" diagnosis requires two items off of a checklist. Although I would not rule it out, based strictly on what you have provided in this post there is NOT enough information to diagnose you  with Neurofibromatosis of any type. \n\nHere is the criteria for NF1 specifically, 2 or more off this list is what is required for a clinical diagnosis. \n\nSix or more caf\u00e9-au-lait spots or hyperpigmented macules greater than 5 mm in diameter in prepubertal children and greater than 15 mm postpubertal\n\nAxillary or inguinal freckles (&gt;2)\u00a0\n\nTwo or more typical neurofibromas or one plexiform neurofibroma\n\nOptic nerve glioma\n\nTwo or more iris hamartomas (Lisch nodules), often identified only through slit-lamp examination by an ophthalmologist\n\nSphenoid dysplasia or typical long-bone abnormalities such as pseudarthrosis\n\nFirst-degree relative (eg, mother, father, sister, brother) with NF1 That is the criteria for type 1, but for type 2 and 3 there are different criteria. \n\nTrust me, I would be thrilled to ultimately not have a diagnosis of NF, but considering I have 4 neurofibromas/schwannomas, it unfortunately looks likely. More likely type 2 or 3 (since I do not have any of the cutaneous signs).\n\nThat is also why I am being referred to a NF clinic, so they can confirm the diagnosis.\n\nBut here is to hoping it is not, and just by some fluke I have 4 nerve sheath tumors and that is it. You are (mostly) correct, I should have been more clear that I was referring to NF1, but my primary point was his statement that you have more than one neurofibroma therefore you have some type of Neurofibromatosis is flatly untrue. \n\nThere is no such thing as Type 3. At one point in the 1970s (over 40 years ago) it was proposed as a name for what is now called schwannomatosis. Any information from a source still using the name NF3 or Type 3 should be accepted with a very large helping of skepticism as they are working from very outdated  and/or secondhand information.\n\nIt is not uncommon for individuals with NF1 to be diagnosed very late in life even in their 50 or 60s. It would be very surprising to have type 2 and not know until 34. Well sorry for using outdated terminology. Please re-read my comment and substitute any mention of type 3 with schwannomatosis. That was not directed at your use of it as I understand you are likely just learning about the disorder and relying on information you find online or are provided. I apologize if it read like I was targeting you that was certainly not my intent. More of a warning that if a doctor is using that terminology (or telling you that more than 1 fibroma is a difinitive diagnosis) you should be cautious.", "Anyone from Singapore/Malaysia/ neighbouring countries?

So it is defiantly something you need to have checked out.  Yeah, last doc I saw said I have about a 50% chance of losing my hearing but they cannot do anything about the tumor due to it is location and said it has around a 90% chance of growing back even worse.  Is this doctor familiar with neurofibromatosis? Have they removed other neurofibromatosis from anyone else. I ask this because I have had doctors freak out by my mri scans and wanted to amputate legs, but the doctors who are actually know about with neurofibromatosis and have removed these tumors knew the leg did not have to be amputated.  it is a neurologist so yeah. they do not freak out at my scans. nothings grown in the 14 years i have had it.

I recently got news that I have two tumors wrapping around my spinal cord from my L4-S1. When I asked why we were not being proactive about it the neurosurgeon showed me my MRI. The two tumors take up my entire body from back to front and would be too invasive to remove and they would not know what kind of damage it would do. Basically, only removing it when it is a last resort. Three neurosurgeons agree on this.\n\nReading between the lines I feel I am facing paralysis eventually from not removing the tumors or facing potential paralysis from the damage of surgery.\n\nWondering if anyone else is facing this or has faced this? I think there might be a third option: MEK inhibitors. \n\nThere are several of them, and so far, they seem very promising. Only one is approved as a drug for children, but all around the world, doctors are prescribing them  as compassionate or experimental care. \n\nDid any of the doctors you say mention them? No one mentioned that. Something I can definitely ask about though. It depend how fast they are growing. NF on spine are worse. nerve damage will cause loss of functionality and then there are chance of secondary infection and pain after surgery. Any luck with radiation? I am not sure if that is a viable option but, radiation can sometimes help to shrink tumors. I have some balance issues and cannot walk for long period of time. Back in 2006 I did have surgery done on my cervical spine to remove tumors that were pressing against it. I was told that if I did not have surgery I could wake up one morning unable to get out of bed and walk. I do have tumors that have since grown back, but based off MRIs from last year and as assessment of my balance and strength they are not going to go and do surgery right now. It is not how it was back in 2006, so they rather do a wait and see approach out of concerns of doing more harm than good. Do you know what kind of doctor I could look into for it?

No one knows what the future holds and there about a number of actors and actress with medical issues and deformities  that act. Here are 25 of them\n I am honestly not sure,  my mom does not seem to have them and I havent seen them on my daughter but they come up a lot in the nf group on facebook. For us guys, whatever fibromas we have after we are done with puberty is probably all we will ever have. They occur more frequently with hormone changes. I had a few grow 3-5 during puberty that were not there prior to starting it and since then I have not had any grow. I am 23 for reference. For women, they continue to develop them through pregnancy due to hormone changes. It is a progressive disease meaning that it gets worse as you age but chances are if your symptoms are mild once you are out of adolescence then you most likely will not develop anymore unless you are a woman and get pregnant as I previously mentioned. One thing to do, which I have neglected, is to go see a neurologist every year and also try to find a NF specialist in your area that you can see once a year. Go for yearly MRIs to track the growth of the fibromas, if there is any, and to make sure you are not developing any where they should not be. If you or anyone reading this has questions, feel free to reply or PM me and I will give the best advice I can. It is a rare disease so we have got to help each other out.", "Optic nerve glioma in elderly age over 60 One of my family member has been diagnosed with Optic nerve glioma, he is over 60, cannot see with his right eye, and it is a little blurry on the left. He will be starting radiotherapy on Feb and trying to protect his left vision. Does anyone knows anything about this type of tumor and radiotherapy able to advise or talk about your experience? Appreciate it. I am 29 and have an optic nerve glioma. Supposedly they remain stable post-puberty. I never received treatment. My daughter has it too and is being given Chemo to try to protect her vision. They dont give radio to young kids. \nThe glioma sheaths the optic nerve and therefore is difficult to remove. There is also no way of predicting the damage to vision.. Thank you for talking about your experience. I hope both you and your daughter are well.", "CALS without NF? Please help ease a first time mom\u2019s anxiety. Has anyone known a person who has multiple cafe au lait spots without a NF diagnosis? My 6 month old daughter has 6 very light irregular feathery smallish spots on her torso and legs. Otherwise our babe is right on track mentally and physically. We have seen a neurologist who basically said she might have it and to monitor her for now. I am a redhead covered in freckles and my partner is mixed, neither of us have NF. I am so anxious and beginning to feel heartbroken about my baby\u2019s future but I have also read that fair skinned children of redheads and biracial parents have been know to have CALS without NF. ( Many people around the globe have birthmarks, some more than one. More than 5 on a child that young can be worrying so I cannot imagine what you are going through. I was the 6 month old. My poor mother took me in for a check up and was given a potential diagnosis of a genetic disease. Thankfully my NF1 is mild but here are some more things to be on the look out for.\n1. Shorter than average\n2. Slightly larger head than average\n3. Freckles by armpit and groin\nThese are all things you can look for on your child and discuss with your doctor. When I was diagnosed at 6 months I was sent to a geneticist and neurologist to confirm and answer any questions my parents had so that may be worth asking about. This is scary I am sure, like I said I cannot fathom the pain as a parent getting told something like that but it is not a death sentence. Most people live average life-spans, and not everyone suffers the worst of it. Good luck and feel free the message me if you have any questions or concerns! Could also be a syndrom called \"legius syndrome\" it is similar to NF, just without the neurofibromas Relax, momma, and do not Google! My son was about your baby's age when I began to worry about the spots. I had him tested, to be sure, it came back with a mutation on NF1. He only has the spots and he is a bit shorter than average at this point (18 months), and his cognitive and neurological development is actually advanced compared to his age. We had an MRI, he does not have any cranial tumors for now. As others said, it can be just a birthmark, it can be legius syndrome, the easiest thing to get rid of the doubt is to get your baby tested. We do not have NF either (elwe have not been tested though) First stop looking things and up, reading up on it and especially do not look at all the pictures. \n\nI do have Neurofibromatosis, and neither one of my parents have it or even my three younger siblings. I was not fully diagnosed until I was 15, the other few times doctors tried to diagnose me results were inconclusive. Unfortunately all you can do is wait and take each day one day at a time. Enjoy this time with your daughter, kids grow up very fast and the last thing you need to be doing is worry about the what if\u2019s.\n\nIf you ever have any questions, feel free to ask. Hopefully this will put you more at ease. \n\nI am someone with many birthmarks that look like CALS. My 2 brothers, Father, 2 aunts, 1 grandfather all have birthmarks that resemble CALS. \n\nI have taken a genetics test and I did not test positive for NF1. I did this because at 30 I discovered strange tumor that is expected to be a Plexiform Neurofibroma. It is now believed I have what is called Mosaic or segmented NF1. \n\nSo despite my case, my brothers, father, aunts and grandfather are all fully healthy and living happily without any of the common symptoms of NF1 despite having what appear to be CALS. They are also NF1 negative. \n\nYou are doing the right thing and watching the CALS. And even if things do not turn out to be NF1 and it does not look like your children are developing any issues. Make sure to keep an eye on the situation. Because they may still have a more rare situation similar to mine.\n\nNext, even if your children do have NF1. That is not the end of the world. Many of the cases posted on the internet are the most extreme and visible cases. Remember NF1 can be almost completely invisible. They would not document images of something virtually invisible. Had you taken a picture of me, fully naked, you would have no idea I had a single issue. But that is the thing with NF1 it shows up very differently for everyone. Even with NF1 most of us live a mostly normal life. \n\nSo 2 last things, \n\nI am not sure where you are from, but I am in the US and was able to get a genetic test from Ambry Genetics for relatively cheap ($100) through my doctors. I believe even without insurance it would have cost $200. Considering what I have paid for most things that is cheap. It is not a bad idea to ask about getting a test done if that is affordable to you.\n\n2nd) there have been larger advancements in the world of NF recently. A new drug was released less than a year ago to help shrink unoperable tumors. There are multiple other drugs in clinical trials as well. This is not a cure but it is a large step in helping those most deeply impacted by NF1. Hopefully this is a sign for things to come. And your baby may grow up in a world where there are more options for treatment than we had growing up. \n\nI wish you and your children all the best. And again, you are doing all the right things. Do not panic. Just keep up healthy communication with your doctors and keep watching the spots. I was in your boat when my daughter was born. Just CALs so she was monitored for a few years. Her head size was always at the top of the charts while height and weigh was low (though following the appropriate curve). I have CALs too and always thought they were normal like birthmarks. Anyways after a few years I was tired of not knowing so got her tested and sure enough she had NF1, they said she probably got it from me and I tested positive too. I made it to being 34 years old not knowing I had it, keep in mind there are so many mild cases. The bad ones are what make the Google front page so that is why it is best not to Google. My daughter is 7 now and still has nothing else major going on.  I think CALs without NF happens but if it is 6 or more it is more like NF than not. My sister has NF1. I have 4 CALS but no NF1. Hey there - not OP but, was just informed my daughter\u2019s genetic test came back positive for NF1 mutation.  My husband and I will be tested to see if either one of us has it.  Neither one of us have any issues - I have only 1 CAL mark and he has none.  May i ask what steps you took if any, to help your daughter with her growth and development? I do not know too much about NF1 yet but, am wondering if lifestyle has anything to do with the progression of NF1. Thank you. We had the same experience with our baby gurl as you.  We saw a neurologist who had her tested.  Our results came back today positive for NF1.  As you can imagine, we are devastated.  I too went through the internet looking at pictures, watching videos, reading stories about NF1.  Everyone here said to stop googling, so I did.  Everyone here also said this diagnosis was not a life sentence.  Those two things have helped me a little.  I am super worried and scared for my little one but, i keep hearing it is best to catch this early so we can monitor it.  I am hoping that by the time my daughter hits puberty, there is more that is known about NF1 amd that there is some form of treatment for it. Good wishes to you.  Message me if you need anything. We did not take any, while she was low she followed the WHO growth chart curve pretty much exactly on track. Aside from that we have done annual eye exams since she was 1 to monitor her optic nerves and meet with the NF team at our hospital to monitor her too. By her age now she would have shown other symptoms if she was going to have them (like chance of optic nerve glioma has gone way down) so I am not as nervous as I used to be until she hits puberty as hormonal shifts are another trigger for tumor growth. Really the only thing that come up is anxiety/depression which is another symptom of NF but I suppose could also be from a family history of mental illness, we got a referral and thank goodness for that timing since COVID ended up really pushing her over the edge mental health wise. It is really just a wait and see disorder, which is hard to deal with as a parent. It is a struggle knowing all the things that could happen, it gets easier as time goes on to put it at the back of your mind. Thank you.  That is great to hear and definitely reassuring. My family also has a history of anxiety/depression however, neither me nor my husband suffer from it enough to require medication but, it is good to know that these can be side effects of NF1.  Is your daughter receiving any help with her anxiety and depression?  \nDo you know at one point after birth do babies with NF1 begin to have their growth affected? This far my baby seems to be right about average if not a little above average on the growth charts but then again she is only about 5 months so I am not sure if it is too early to tell if her size will be impacted.  \nI have so many questions and I know I should be asking our doctor but, it helps so much to hear from someone who has lived experience so I appreciate you taking the time.  Thank you! No problem when we first leaned of NF I was desperate to hear mild case stories so I am happy to share ours! She is been doing virtual therapy biweekly and we started her on CBD. She started back hybrid learning also which helped a ton, getting some normalcy back. Ctf.org is a great resource, we signed up with nuerofibromatosis Midwest and have gotten tons of helpful info from them. Not sure what region you are in but if you are in the US there should be a regional group. It might be a little to early to know for sure. Some symptoms develop later. She might also just have the CALS. I know it is hard but I would not wory too much.  There are People Who live there lives without ever knowing they have NF. Just follow up. Everything will be okay. Enjoy your time with your baby \n\nP.S do not trust google, everything seems to get worse when you do that.", "Developing support for parents of children with neurofibromatosis - research opportunity!

I have been terrible lately. I can see the impact it has on the people around me and I feel horrible for it.  I do not know if my meds are just off or what.  same! like i will be tying to retell a story that just happened a few hours ago or sometimes even 20 mins ago and i have to try really hard to think of the details.  I keep telling the same stories over and over again. Like I will tell my husband something one day, forget I told him, and repeat it the next, and the next. Sad to say this happens a lot.  How well are you sleeping? Did you start new medication recently?  been sleeping okay, though i am always tired no matter how much i sleep and i am not taking any new medications.  omg i do the same thing to my boyfriend sometimes!  Yes, I think it is pretty normal to have some minor trouble with the memory as an Nf1  patient,  I do not know about memory problems for people with  Nf2...  :-)   \n Yes. I always assumed it was due to the many surgeries. Yes I have a hard time of remembering something I do the day before me tooooo! like all the time. even if it is like something fun i did, it feels like it happened a life time ago with my memory if that makes sense ", "Having children I am an adult male who was lucky enough to marry a wonderful woman late in life. We have been married for a few years and now the issue of having kids has come up. I have NF1 and I know the risk of passing it on to my child if we had it naturally.  I do want children but she does not want to deal with the issues of having kids with NF so we are at a dilemma. I  am not getting any younger here and adoption costs more money than either one of us have so I do not know what to do. This is not a conversation Reddit can have for you nor is it something we can answer; we do not know you or your spouse. Any advice is not coming from a place of knowledge as it pertains to your relationship. I know this. This is more of me just venting since I have no one to talk to about it. Also, hearing other people who have NF and their stories does help. Instead of adopting what about fostering? While fostering you could save up for adoption. I have thought a lot about this as well, although I am not in a position to have kids at the moment. I think there is no way someone with NF1, like me, should risk having children. Ive been lucky and only had one tumor in my leg (i think you commented on another post of mine) but Ive seen what can happen and there is no way I would risk that happening to one of my children, especially since it would be my fault. I think our only options are adoption, fostering, or having the money to artificially inseminate with one of our sperm cells that doesnt have the nf1 mutation. Probably not what you wanted to here, but there it is. You are going to have to talk with her and your Neurofibromatosis doctors about this. There is a 50% chance you would pass the condition onto your children. There are medical related things that can be done to lessen the chances of the gene being passed, but that is something you would have to check to see if it would be covered under your insurance. Otherwise you only other option is adoption whether it be closed or an open adoption. You could also look into being a foster parent. i feel this HARD. i am 29f and want kids but also do not want to pass the gene onto my kid. i am also in no position finically to pay for adoption or IVF. Mine is also extreme mild, only cafe au lait i have had a few removed, and some bumps seen in good light.) so the thought of making it worse through pregnancy worries/scares me. 2 or my 3 kids got my NF.  No big deal.  They are amazing, smart happy children.  No regrets having them. I believe it is possible to screen for it prenatal. My husband and I have decided not to pass on my NF1. We tried naturally and I had a TFMR in April after the pregnancy tested positive for NF1. We do not feel like we want to go through that again so we are pursuing IVF with PGD now. They test the embryos and only transfer healthy ones back into me. I would not say that 2 out of 3 of your kids having a high risk of developing brain tumors, spinal cord tumors, eye tumors and blindness, and large and/or numerous growths all over their body is \u201cno big deal.\u201d We used Pre-implantation diagnosis.  It may be easier for the male, if they can separate the affected sperm now, and then do in vitro insemination. Hello,\n\nI have NF1 and the geneticist informed us that there is 50/50 chance that our kids will get NF1 - of which there is 1/7 chance they will get epilepsy.\n\nWe had options (please forgive me for not using the correct terms) - but we could either do IVF, which depending on your country, the health care might pay for.\n\nAlternatively, there are some testing that could have been done on the womb at about 12-17 weeks in.\n\nWe decided to do the IVF - this requires a few tests initially, including your own sperm and your parent\u2019s saliva. \n\nHopefully in a few months we would have our own healthy baby!\n\n\nPlease feel free to ask question and if I can, I will answer them! I have NF2. My wife and I are going though IVF (with PGD, etc) to screen out affected embryos. I am conflicted about it in some ways but I do find that it is the most ethical option. My father had NF2 and both my sister and I inherited it. I cannot and will not do the same. They cannot test the sperm individually. The way PGD works is by doing a biopsy of the already fertilized embryo. They take out a couple of cells from the part that will become the placenta and test that for the gene. They cannot test the sperm. They can test an embryo fertilized outside the womb (IVF with PGD). The options for having your own children also include testing a pregnancy and terminating. At least not yet? Testing sperm/egg cells for genes seems like something we should be able to do at this point, although it might be expensive. I can do a mail away DNA kit, surely a more advanced lab can check my sperm. I doubt it. To test it, they need to extract the DNA from it, and that destroys the cell. So sure they can test the individual sperm cells, but they cannot use them to fertilize an egg after.\n\nEdit: also, the place you send your cheek swab to for the mail away dna kits is still a very advanced lab. Well today I learned. I was holding out hope Id at least be able to do that. That is some shit. You can test the embryos though and one transfer the ones that do not have the gene. That is what we are doing. So like to invitro and check before installing the embryo in your partner? Yes, exactly. My husband and I will be starting it in the next few weeks and hopefully I will be pregnant with a healthy baby by the end of summer. \n\nWe have had two losses now, one a miscarriage at 7 weeks in December, and we ended our second pregnancy at 15 weeks in April to avoid passing on my NF1. We hoped to get lucky trying naturally, but after two losses we have decided to spend the money on IVF because it is been months of waiting and waiting for results, only to end in heartbreak. It is not if you dont make it.  I am 50, have NF and have add nothing major.  My kids are extremely happy, deal with the NF and have a life worth living. This would be my attitude toward life. My wife, on the other hand, does not want to deal with a child with a disability. I may be a bit biased due to a post I read a while ago on r/childfree, but I think it is extremely selfish to have children knowing that they very well may suffer from a debilitating condition for the rest of their life. Your children going to have or nf1 or nf2 its genitics, 50% for 1 50% for 2 Depends. My younger sister shows no signs of NF either do her kids but it not mean they do not have the genetic markers of NF There is a fifty fifty chance your kid would suffer things like tumors in their brain. If you would take a child and put them on a ride where half of the babies were dropped into tumor-causing ooze that would make them suffer for life, then sure, have a kid or two and watch them suffer instead of rescuing a needy child through adoption. Of course if you would do that to a child, maybe you should not be caring for any children, period. I am so sorry for your loss. My husband and I went through the same thing. I want to do the IVF with PGD but we are waiting a bit. Life turned upside down for us, at the time of the loss he also had a spinal cord tumor. I would love to hear how it all goes for you. I am so sorry for your loss as well. I hope your husband is doing better. \n\nOur egg retrieval was last week and we found out yesterday 9 embryos made it to biopsy and freeze! It will take a few weeks now to find out the results of the testing. BEST of luck. Let me know how it goes, rooting for you guys!", "Optic nerve glioma in adults (sorry for long post) Has anyone else been diagnosed with an optic nerve glioma in adulthood? \n\nI am 23 and have been having issues with my left eye for a while. for the most part my vision is fine, I can see clearly when looking through both eyes but if I were to cover my right eye and only look through my left my vision is somewhat blurred. It has been getting gradually worse for around 3/4 years I think. I have glasses (which were prescribed for watching telly/reading etc) and these correct the vision in my left eye. \n\nAnyway getting to the point, for the past two years I have had multiple eye tests and visual field tests done along with one mri earlier this year. Not a single person I have seen has been able to explain why I am having these problems until today... I received a call from an nf nurse and she said after a second review of my mri results they have now noticed a \"slight swelling\" on my optical nerve tract. She suggested I go back to the ophthalmologist for yet more tests and also have a yearly mri to keep a check on it.\n\nSo she did not say for certain I have a tumour there but it is looking like one could be in the early stages. So my question is has anyone else had one develop in adulthood? Is it possible I have always had it and it only started causing problems in the past few years? As soon as I got of the phone with her I looked up optical gliomas in adults and most of what I read said that when found in adults they are far more likely to be \"aggressive\" and can spread/develop into rarer and fatal cancers which really does not sound great. \n\nIf anyone has any info I would greatly appreciate it as today has put me in the most God awful mood. It depends how the vision is damaged by the glioma. If it is just the presence of the glioma causing obstruction, and it shrinks due to treatment, vision could improve. If the glioma has actually physically damaged your optic nerve, even complete response to treatment will not restore vision. I have had one since I was born \nAnd weirdly enough I am 22 and it has not grown to an extent to have them worried \nI have probably had at least 10 MRIs\nWhen i was younger I was getting them around every 4-6 months\nNow it is every couple years Typically, a new optic glioma does not develop past the age of 10. Usually they are diagnosed by age 5. Optic gliomas in children who do have them usually do not continue to progress past age 10 as well. You could have been born with it and it could have been lying dormant, but it is unlikely to suddenly grow and cause other problems like typical neurofibromas can. I have had NF1 since birth, and an Optic Nerve Glioma since 3. it did cause total blindness in my right eye. i have often wondered if there is a cure. ( i had chemo when i was young, but was allergic to the kind they gave me). all my searches have come up blank. i wish there was a cure.", "Birth control and tumor growth Is there any indication that birth control increases growth of tumors? I have been trying to do research on this subject myself, but I cannot find much information.   \nPlease note that I am not interested in personal anecdotes as much as scientific studies and evidence.  i have been on it for over a year consistently and before that i was on it/off it for years. i have never noticed anything different. i have always gotten off of it because it can make me crazy lol. but right now i am on lo estrin lo fe, it is worked the best for me.  Been on the pill as well. I did have one tumor grow during this period, but it is very unclear if it was related all to the birth control. On the same BC as little\\_foot\\_89. \n\nAlso found a study that says hormonal contraceptives do not harm, but it is a pretty small sample size: (\n\n&amp;#x200B; This is also the only one I have been able to find. It does not seem like it is a topic that is gotten any real research!\n\nI have heard tons of stories on both sides of the issue, and the general theory is 'if changes in hormones can trigger tumor growth, then birth control should trigger them' but I am not really sure how scientifically accurate that theory is lol...\n\nI am not sexually active so for now I am not even worrying about BC but I have considered taking it just to control my periods because they are hideously painful. I would talk to your neurologist if I were you. I talked to mine before I went on birth control because my periods were pretty painful. He said it was fine. \n\nI was already getting yearly MRIs so everything is pretty easy to monitor.\n\nMy bet is that with most things dealing with NF, each person\u2019s condition  is different so it is hard to get any hard results.\n \nAnd the thing is \u201chormonal changes can affect tumor growth,\u201d does not mean tumors will grow. There is some truth, that is why some people do not find out about their NF until puberty or they get pregnant but it is not the same for all people.\n\nI was on growth hormones for several years due to NF-related issues and mine did not grow at all/significantly during that time. (I did need to wear a back brace after but we are not sure how directly related that was to the hormones.)\n\nBasically, talk to your specialist/neurologist if you have one. They probably have a better answer.\n\n\n In studies, neirofibromas have often been found to express progesterone receptors (hence possible reason of progression during puberty).\n\n\n\nPersonally I will not use any form of hormonal BC, even IUDs with liw systemic dose. I know from experience my largest tumor is hormonally sensitive and risk is too high for the benefit. If you are in the UK you can get a homeless contraception. I think it is called the copper coil  You can get a copper IUD in the United States and Canada too. I assume in most countries that have one type, they have both.  Was just advice, glad to know though.  I was just adding to your info. Did you downvote me? No I literally just said it is good to know. I have not up voted nor down voted your comment. I was not sure whether we had all the same contraception methods so I suggested one, you confirmed you did..?  :) someone had downvotes me for some reason.

I have always wanted tattoos- especially on my back and hips. This also happens to be where i have hyperpigmentation and neurofibromas underneath. Does anyone have tattoo or know if it is ok do get one? It would be best to discuss this with your doctor. Neurofibromatosis effects us all differently, so I would be hard to say whether what worked fine for one would work for another. Tattoos wil have NO EFFECT on your NF in any way.  The only possible issue you may have is if you tattoo directly over a tumor it might hurt a little bit more for a few seconds. could also hinder or change MRI experience I am sorry but you are wrong.\n\nI had over 40 plus MRIs and I am covered in tattoos.\nIt is an old wives tale when they say the Black ink make you feel itchy and heat up.\n\nEdit:. Typo key word: \"could\"\n\nalso from what I understand, tattoo ink contains metals, some being ferromagnetic which key word, could cause issues with MRI machines and cause some pain on the person as the magnetic field generated by an MRI would attract all magnetic and ferromagnetic metals, causing the sensation that your skin is being pulled. \n\nThe heating would be the particles getting \"excited\" and increasing their speed*. \n\n* using mainstream terms. The metal oxide and tattooing will never do more than make it feel a little itchy that is absolutely it and that is extremely rare in of itself.\n\nWatch The MythBusters episode about it I have NF1 and tattoos some of my tattoos go over my spots and I have never had any issues \nBut always a good idea to speak to your doctor \"The supplier of the tattoo ink was contacted, and it was discovered that the dark tattoo ink contained high concentrations of iron oxide, which has been shown to be highly ferromagnetic.\"\n\n(\n\n\"Tattoo inks can contain titanium dioxide, lead, cobalt, chromium, manganese, zinc, copper, nickel and carbon black. They can also contain ferrous pigments such as iron oxides - and this is where an MRI can run into problems.\"\n\n(\n\n\"While millions of people with tattoos have MRIs every year without side effects, some adverse reactions have been reported. Researchers said there had been no systematic studies of how safe it is for people with tattoos to have an MRI. Reported side effects include a pulling sensation on tattooed skin because tattoo ink can contain pigments that are magnetic and interact with the MRI's strong magnetic fields. Tattoos may also absorb energy that would ordinarily be spread out, increasing burn risk, according to study researcher Nikolaus Weiskopf. He is director of the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig, Germany.\"\n\n(\n\n\n\"the ink in some tattoos can become a problem in the MRI machine:\n\nDuring MRI, skin or eye irritation \u2014 even first degree burns \u2014 can result when dyes in tattoos, even from tattooed eyeliner, heat up. Covering them is not likely to help, and if skin irritation or burning happens, the MRI must be stopped at once to avoid a burn.\n\nWhile it is not common, there are a handful of case reports and studies that look at burns\u2014some serious\u2014that have occurred inside an MRI machine. The likely culprit is the metallic, iron oxides found in some tattoo pigments.\n\n'These compounds can theoretically create an electric current that increases the local skin temperature, enough to cause a cutaneous burn,\u201d explain the authors of ( that reports on a professional football player who was burned in this way. The authors argue that this might be particularly important for sports doctors to pay attention to, \u201cgiven the frequent occurrence of cosmetic tattoos in athletes requiring magnetic resonance imaging to diagnose a musculoskeletal injury.'\"\n\n( BTW, there are MRI machines that are capable of taking an image even if you have hardware in your body. Also even if you have a spine nerve stimulator implanted.  \n\nI know this cause I have hardware in my neck myself.  So your argument against tattoos still falls flat.  That is correct, because all MRI machines are capable. I have fusions as well, and fun fact. Titanium is not magnetic and has properties that prevent it from being magnetized. I should mention you are arguing with a medical physicist. \n\n\"Titanium is a paramagnetic material that is not affected by the magnetic field of MRI. The risk of implant-based complications is very low, and MRI can be safely used in patients with implants.\" \n\n( And the risk of tattoo problems with the MRI machine are even lower than those within plant-based.  \n\nThat is my last point. Go on and enjoy your job as a medical psychologist psychiatrist physicist parapsychologist paleontologist nuclear physicist and anti-tattoo person.  \n\nKeep bragging about how great you are.  \n\nBTW I am a astro-psychologist, and medical director of the international space station. I never said I am great. I figured I should let you know that I studied all this stuff in college and currently work in the field. So I may know more than you in this particular topic. By no means am I better than anyone. \n\nI am not anti tattoo, nor did I say anything that would make you think I am. I just presented the facts as they are when it comes to risks and possible risks however small they may be. \n\n( is a real field. \n\nGood for you, please say hi to Chris Hadfield for me. Sometimes firsthand experience is worth a lot more than what you study in a book or learning the classroom I have a few tattoos. Really, just talk with your tattoo artist. They might just be unsure of what they are tattoing over. Most my artists have been cool why it. I have Beth thinking of incorporating a fibroma into a tattoo design. Like making out look like a volcano or something. I have NF 1 and I have 2 tattoos. You such talk to your doctor,but I did not talk to my neurologist about it because I did not what to.", "How did you guys find out you had NF? I did not realize there was a reddit. When I was two my pediatrician found multiple cafe-au-lait spots, and my head circumference was in the 96th percentile. So they did a more thorough exam, and found a deep tumor on my neck. inherited it. I had a sibling diagnosed and have a lot of the cafe-a-lait spots, so I sought out a geneticist who set up a test and formally diagnosed me. I am the 1st one in my family to get it and ill be the last. Im not going to have kids It was funny how I found out. I basically found out the same way but my pediatrician.  Like my pediatrician said do not tell anyone. My mom did and we got kicked from our health insurance. But she saw my big cafe au lait spots on my back. But I was blind in one eye which was caused by a tumor behind my right eye Pediatrician told my parents to have me checked for it and then a specialist determined I had it. I had a renal infarction in June which led to my blood pressure shooting up. So I went and saw a nephrologist about that, he mentioned it as a cause(since I have a lump on my thigh that I was going through the process of getting biopsied). I started looking more into it, checked boxes for a clinical diagnosis and then was formally diagnosed in December. Not sure if I am the first, since my parents do not feel the need to get tested. Never thought much about the cafe au lait spots or freckling, I just thought they were birth marks and I have freckles and moles all up and down my arms. \n\nLooking back at scans from cancer treatments there were notes made about neurofibromas, but as they were not lighting up or part of my cancer no one made much of it. Yea we thought  they were birth marks as well It was funny I had an eye doctor few years ago And this  was years after  I found out I had cancer and my eye doctor was trying to break the news I had cancer. Haha and I told the nurse to tell the doctor I had cancer. We had to leave  really fast  and he wanted me and my mom to sit down to tell us. One of the funniest things See that is why ill never have kids  cause I do not want any of them to experiences the pain I went through. So either jll adopt or never have kids Was diagnosed by doctor That Is not what I was asking. We all where diagnosed by doctors. I asked how did you find out You had NF I mean at a standard appointment he saw some stuff that lead to his diagnosis. There is no other way to find out. Cafe-au-lait spots, etc. Ah I see Well it is sort of a long story.\n\nIt was suspected I had it when I was born, I believe an eye doctor suspected I had it. I was born with a lazy right eye, so I had appointments for that early on. Other doctors also suspected it and when I was nine I went to the university of Michigan and they did some tests, but the results were inconclusive. My pediatrician continues to keep the thought of me having Neurofibromatosis in the back of her mind over the years, once I hit puberty and was 15, things tools off from there. This time I was sent to the university of Chicago, and had a bunch of tests done there, it was actually the last week of my freshmen year of highschool, so while my school allowed me to skip out on the majority of my final exams, I had all the hospital tests to do. The results from all those tests confirmed I had Neurofibromatosis. IVF with selective embryo implantation/ pre implantation genetic diagnosis, is also an option if you want biological kids. Just so you know the option is available.. I had been going to the hospital since early childhood and I always kind of knew there was something \"wtong\" with me. In elementary school, I underwent cytotoxine-therapy and my mother explained the reasons for it as good as one could explain it for a child, I guess.   \n\n\nBut, when I was off the chemo I kind of had the idea that I was cured and that everything was over and that all the visits to the hospital were just post-check ups. Probably not as much my fault as it was my parents for not having a second talk to me when I was a bit older and better explain my condition to me.   \n\n\nAnyways, when I got a bit older I remember that the school nurse in 8th or 9th grade gave us a \"general health form\" to fill out and since we were under 18, it had of course to be signed by a parent too. When I asked my father to sign it he asked me why I had put \"no\" on \"Any known medical conditions\" and I was like \"What do you mean? I am cured now, yes?\"   \n\n\nThen, when I was alone on the computer at night, I looked at that health form and googled that wierd, long word I had been told yo write; \"Neurofibromatosis\" and what I read actually shocked me.   \n\n\nThis actually caused some serious trust issues that I have not been able to fully repair and did a lot of harm to my self-perception.   \n\n\nMy only adivce to parents with children who are diagnosed with NF is to talk to them and explain to them what it is that is going on and not leave them to think there is nothing wrong and then have them find out by themselves. I was two months premature, and a neonatal nurse who happened to have a child with NF noticed that I had CALs and freckling so she suggested my mom have talk to the doctors about it. Yea my  mom hid I had cancer and I was going through it. Do just one day I asked my mom do I have cancer she said yea.", "Made a major decision Little update.

The road is not easy and in the long run, you will be better health-wise. Always remember to love yourself first and foremost. Hello, 25F here,\n\nI think a helpful thing would be to write out your anxieties and formulate those into questions. If you want medication for anxiety before ask about those options. \n\nAlso not sure your age or location but the United state insurance can be a bitch, I would make sure to have NPI, CPT codes, and DX codes just to make sure the place is In your network and you do not have any surprises \n\nI had a surgery this year and I work full time. I called my short term disability department and they said my surgery would be covered and I would have paid leave, half way through recovery was told my surgery is considered \u201celective\u201d and is not covered. I am in the process of appealing in and providing letters and medical history to help my case.\n\nI do not want to burden you with these extra things, but I have had issues with both of them. Not everyone does but just wanted to share my experience. \n\nI am sending positive vibes and energy your way. Like other have said be kind to yourself and you got this. I am definitely writing a list. I do it all the time then when I see the. NF team I can ask them the 20 odd questions. As the second I get in I forget. \n\nI am luckily in the UK so it is covered under the NHS. Yes I plan to be very honest with them. When I see them. \n\nI have had a few operations before  (7 I think) the first time I had to sign I had just turned 18. And was shocked when I did. I defo plan to do this. Update. I am sat in a hospital in Manchester waiting to see my NF team. I hope the plastics are here I have a list of questions after a worried after yesterday I am day on it and cannot wait to have it (no date yet but I would take an emergency cancellation). I am still what if I die during the operation. And a lot of small stuff that triggers me from past operations. But that is more mental health side I think.", "MRI to check for tumors near the spinal cord I am 21yo and I have 2 Neurofibromes. One is on my back the other is in my brain. About 6 months ago I started having back pain with slight dizziness. Since about a month by back pain became unbearable without Tramadol. I need low potent opioids to make it through the day without pain. My orthopedic therapist that I have consulted about a week ago order two MRI. The X-Rays were negative. On Tuesday I have my first MRI on the top of my spinal cord, at 12th Feburary I have the second MRI to check for the Tumours there. \nI am not afraid whether they find something. I just want to know what it is and if it is curable that caused my back pain. \nHas anyone else experience with back pain or tumors at their spinal cord? In 2006 I had tumors pressing against my cervical spine, it was causing some back pain and numbing and warmness sensation in both my ankles. I had the tumors removed, spent about a week in the hospital and two weeks recovery at home. \n\nUnfortunately there is no cure, but surgery can help and there has been a drug that was approved by the fda that has shown to reduce tumor size. I have just completed a round of tests that my doctor wanted done and hopefully all those show results that my doctor will feel that I can start the medication.\n\nI too take tramadol, along with hydrocodone for pain. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. I am tired and stoned, but I have had three surgeries do remove tumors from my spine. Pm me to remind me and I will hit you up tomorrow to chat. I have tumours on my lower spine. I get pain on and off but no other symptoms at this point. They were caught pretty early though, so not sure what I will cop further down the track when they are bigger :/ My back and spine are riddled with them. I have had some removed. I do not want to scare you, and keep in mind the operations were 27 and 15 years ago, but mine did not go too well. The operation went as planned, but I suffered partial paralyzation on the left side both times.  Mine were needed because not because I had pain, but because i was showing signs of paralyzation. so I guess it kind of worked out? \n\nAgain, this was a LONG time ago. Techniques and technology have come a long way and I was unlucky. The medical technology has definitely improved and medical errors decreased. It is still risky to operate at the spinal cord but it is a risk worth taking. Being paralyzed is the worst case scenario but being on opioids to make it through the day is not adequate either The important thing is to watch over them and make regular control MRIs I should have used the term \"treatable\". It is not sure whether I have tumors or not. My mental health is also severely impaired so the second theory would be psychosomatic pain. \nWhat is the name of the new drug? So that I can check wherter it is available in my country or not?\nI am from Germany and it is complicated to get Hydrocodone but Tramadol was really easy to get. Our system is kind of weird there . \nIt is called koselugo\n I have a ton of tumors in my spinal cord.  I get it MRI'd about once or twice a year to monitor them.", "Dermatologist neurofibroma removal? Today I went to a dermatologist to remove what I thought was a cyst but it turned out to be a neurofibroma. She said it would require two layers of stitches. Is this the best way to remove one or should I go somewhere else? I think the Johns Hopkins center for neurofibroma would be nearest to me but I am not sure they would deal with a little neurofibroma removal. I am 21 and this is the first one I have found but I spoke to my father and he forgot to tell me he has it and he believes my grandfather did as well. Sounds like he has been having them since birth and a dermatologist basically told them they were no big deal. I also thought both my dad and I had ADHD or some kind of attention deficiency so this explains why Adderall did not work for me. What kind of care should I be seeking? I think a brain and spine mri to look for issues is generally recommended. If you are a women you will want to start your breast cancer screening early. It is probably worth getting established with a specialist to get an initial screening plan and then from there it may be little to manage. Got it. Do you know what the threshold for a mild case is? I probably should get my dad to a specialist as well. There is a lot of great info on CTF.org, they might be able to help out with finding specialists near you as well. Usually I think you would see a geneticist or a neurologist, my son is 5 and has NF. **I found links in your comment that were not hyperlinked:**\n\n* (\n\n*I did the honors for you.*\n\n***\n\n^( ^| ^( ^| ^&lt;3 If you made it this long without knowing you have it then you are probably mild. The majority of issues develop before your are 18. You could always end up with tumors in a place that causes issues later in life but it is less likely. Plexiform neurofibromas are present at birth I have had small fibromas removed at the dermatologist, but never a larger one. They typically do not want to touch them. Do you know how deep the small fibroma was? I do not know if I trust the dermatologist to go so deep as to require two layers of stitches Not very deep...never had to get stitches on mine...but you could tell where they were removed Plastic Surgeon is best. Never had success with Derms. How do you find one that knows how to deal with neurofibromas? Need to research them online or call them: where are you located? MD. I would try Johns Hopkins. Call the NF specialist there to see if they can recommend one for you. If you have adhd Adderall *should* work for you. It is literally an ADHD medicine. I do not understand why you think it explains it bit working. From my preliminary research today, it seems that NF1 ADHD does not straightforwardly = ADHD. Even though NF1 people can definitely be diagnosed as ADHD because ADHD diagnosis is based exclusively on behavioral criteria, the etiology (cause) and developmental course of NF1 ADHD and pure ADHD must be assumed to be different. I am not saying that ADHD medicine could not work for some people but it did not work for me and it seems somewhat plausible that NF could have something to do with it. I will take it out of my original post to not mislead people because it was just an afterthought connection I thought could be there. You should see a neurologist who is familiar with Neurofibromatosis, I myself have been seeing a specialist since I was 15 and have continued to see over these last 20 plus years. I generally have yearly MRIs, sometimes just of certain areas that are of concern or full body scans. I unfortunately have tumors all throughout my body, I have had four surgeries, two of which were to remove cancerous tumors in both 2014 and 2018. Right now we are keeping an eye on ones that have grown back on my cervical spine, I had had surgery for that in 2006. My doctor want to try to get me on a new drug that was approved by the fda for Neurofibromatosis to help shrink tumors.\n\nIf you have questions let me know. Best to consult with a Neurofibromatosis specialist who can recommend a surgeon. Many years ago back when I was in highschool, my parents chose for me to have surgery at home in our town instead of with one in Chicago that was about two hours ago. The surgeon told my parents that he was familiar with Neurofibromatosis and had done surgery on other with it before. That ended up being a total lie, because once he cut me open and saw how difficult it actually was to remove the tumor, he never wanted to do it again and told my mom just that. For six months my arm turned green and felt numb, ever since we have had my other surgeries done in Chicago, but surgeons my Neurofibromatosis specialist hand picked. There actually could be some merit to your theory. The structural aspects of adhd in the brain could be different in the nf1 brain, though it seems unlikely. Not every medication works for every person. They believe its highly hormonal based, so pregnancy could also cause problems to raise. I am still stuck on \"forgot to tell me.\" Even for a mild case like me, I had more intensive screanings when I was younger and still see a specialist every year. How could he just \u201cforget to tell you\u201d? Seriously? Wow I am so sorry to hear this. I wish doctor\u2019s did not lie and experiment on people let alone a Highschool kid. I think unfortunately his dermatologist and PCP led him to believe neurofibromatosis was more of a minor pesky skin condition. Yeah, my parents were pretty angry. My family could have found out about our NF1 many years sooner if the first doctor who mentioned something about it did not gloss over it to the extent that my mom thought he meant that \"if you have a lot of birthmarks you have an increased risk of skin cancer\"", "NF misdiagnosis? I am new here. For context im a teenager whos family has history of NF. For my whole life doctors said I had NF1 because i have cafe au lait spots but recently got genetic testing done and the results came back negative. Im a bit confused because it seems too coincidental that I have one of the key identifiers of the condition and a 50/50 chance of having it but somehow dont have it. How accurate are these tests? A genetic test *should* be definitive, but false negatives do happen. It might be worth asking for a section NF test because the likelihood of getting two false negatives in a row is negligible. There are similar conditions that are often misdiagnosed as NF1. People with Legius syndrome for example can have cafe au lait spots, but do not develop neurofibromas. Have your family had a genetic diagnosis of NF1? Was the test one of those you can do at home or through your doctor? It was by legitimate medical team Not formal genetic diagnosis,  but clinical diagnosis because its fairly clear with the neurofibromas and cafe au lait spots that they have NF1 It could not hurt to get a second test done. I was 15 before I was officially diagnosed. I was tested two times previously (as a baby and when I was 9) and the results were inconclusive. Yeah im prob going to get tested again soon imma have to meet with genetic counselor again and have my mom tested as well Sounds like a plan. Interesting, well I see you are planning some additional tests so keep us updated on what you find out! Genetic Testing for the NF1 gene has about an 80% chance of being \"positive\" i.e. finding an abnormality in the gene for neurofibromin. If you have a family history, more than 6 Cafe au lait spots &gt; 1.5 cm in diameter you have a rather definitive diagnosis of NF1. Even other etiologies of cafe au lait spots, like Legius syndrome, are fairly easy to exclude in teenagers and older. If you have had an ophthalmologic exam, they can tell you whether you have Lisch nodules. At your age, if you have NF1 there is a good likelihood you have axillary or inguinal freckling. If you DO NOT have these other features, your diagnosis may be incorrect. They will likely explain this at your appointment, but labs like Invitae will test your mother for free if they find a pathologic variant on your test. So it MAY be cheaper to get a retest if you really think you need it, then get your mother's later. Do you have bone abnormalities or dystrophic scoliosis?  Have you ever had brain MRIs? MRI could show ectasia of an optic nerve, or optic glioma, another diagnostic criterion. There may also be NF1 spots, previously known as unidentified bright objects,, which are pretty common on MR imaging of people with NF1. I get MRIs every year and so far nothing has showed up. At my last visit at my eye doctor they said I had no lisch nodules. My original neurologist said I had freckling but the genetic counsellor couldnt find any and neither could I which is why we did the test which came negative. I have my next MRI like next week. On one of my MRIs there was a little bright spot but they said it was insignificant and sometimes just happens so i dont know To clarify my previous answer, the test has an 80% chance of being positive if you have clinically diagnosed NF1.\nGiven your family history and multiple cafe au lait spots, I think the most likely explanation is you have NF1, your abnormality did not come up on testing, and you have mild NF1 (there is wide variation in how NF1 presents in each individual, as you very like may know already \ud83d\ude42).\nHowever, it definitely seems worth testing duo (you and mom) or trio if possible (you and both parents). To clarify my previous answer, the test has an 80% chance of being positive if you have clinically diagnosed NF1.\nGiven your family history and multiple cafe au lait spots, I think the most likely explanation is you have NF1, your abnormality did not come up on testing, and you have mild NF1 (there is wide variation in how NF1 presents in each individual, as you very likely may know already \ud83d\ude42).\nHowever, it definitely seems worth testing duo (you and mom) or trio if possible (you and both parents). Do you have dark skin? It can be harder to distinguish some skin findings, especially if your skin is quite dark. Yeah im mixed race so i can see where its hard for skin findings. And yea im prob going to do duo testing as soon as I can to get a clear conclusion. And my assumption is also that,  i prob just have an extremely mild case. I rlly dont think it can be Legions or anything like that bc its so statistically low Hey, what do you mean when you say results were inconclusive? Did you do a blood draw? Was the sample bad or results were mixed (if that is a thing?). I do not know. I was a baby, all I know is doctors could not say whether I had it or did not have it. When I was nine all I really remember was them looking at my birthmarks and the small peanut size bumps on my head. I knew nothing of why I was really there. \n\nIt was until I was 15 and was taken somewhere else to be tested that, I knew why. If you are mixed race, you will find this statement by Dr Korf interesting : \n\n( \n\n\"We do see occasional healthy children with as many as six caf\u00e9-au-lait spots, though usually these spots are usually relatively indistinct and have irregular margins. Often these children have fair skin and red hair, or have parents of different ancestry, with one having darker skin than the other.\u00a0 These children tend to be healthy and do not have any underlying medical problem as far as is known.\" \n\nYou say you have NF in your family, but unless it is your father or mother, the familiarity is less important. \n\nSince 2014, a consortium of doctors are pushing for a review of the diagnostic criteria.\n\nCafe au lait spots are an hallmark  of Nf, but not everyone with NF has them (I do not have a single one) and not everybody with CAL has nf. \n\nI would take the negative test as a strong optimistic indicator you might not have Nf1 after all The same thing just happened to me. I meet the clinical diagnosis based off of skin findings. However, my genetic tests all came back negative. My geneticist said that I likely just have mosaic NF1, which is where only some of your cells have the mutation rather than all the cells in your body. This could potentially explain why some milder presentations of NF1 often only have dermatologic symptoms without learning disabilities, bone abnormalities, or lisch nodules.", "Any one in here active on xbox one Is anyone in here active on xbox one?

When notable figures had some ongoing condition, it is usually mentioned somewhere when you are reading about them. There is also a lot of celebrities with chronic conditions who talk about those conditions, but apparently none with nf. And i know many people with it only have bumps and spots in hidden areas, but surely plenty would have them on their arms, necks etc, and I have just never seen it irl. \n\nThe statistics and real life observations just do not seem to jibe. I feel the heck out of this...and think about it daily..\n\nnever in all my 28 years of being alive/ dealing with it (made itself painfully present 4 days after birth lol)\n\nbut in all that time, never met another person who has is/ knows of it...\n\nand yet, its commonish ???? It is common genetic condition yes but its freaking rare still. If you live in city where there is 300 000 people there is only 100-150 people whit nf1. You may have seen couple of them but you just did not now they had it because most of us have it mild. Like you said many of us have only bumps.\nMany have only handful of them or little bit more. \n\nThat could be one reason why people in the past did not really now if somebody had it and did not really care about it.\nAnd if there was someone whit severe case of it in the past.. that poor sole... if you read history you now what they did to people who looked different like that. So there is not almost any reason why people would write about people whit nf in the past like middle ages. While he was not a celebrity himself (I do not think so anyway), Gillian Anderson's brother had NF1. Ever since his passing, she is been fairly active when it comes to charities benefiting NF research, and so on.\n\nBut yeah, like others have said, it may be a common-ish rare disease, but it is still... well, rare. It actually is not that common, it is a rare genetic condition. I have only met 1 person who had it, and she lived in my neighbourhood and her mom was a friends of my aunt. The odds that this happened are very low i can imagine. It is not common at all, it is identified by the EU as rare.

We do not even know the first case of nf. I too am from Australia. I work in health care and I have come across 4 other people with NF1 in my life (late 30s).  Headline incidence says 1in 3000, which isnt considered \"rare\". I find alot of people dont know about NF1, particularly new monitoring protocols and new clinical trials.  Clinicians here seem satisfied by diagnosing via clinical examination which to me seems outdated. yeah when ever i see a doctor I feel like im getting handballed from one to another regularly get different information for each different one I see. some things that have occurred to be doctors act like they have never seen it which does not give me confidence going forward My fianc\u00e9 said basically the same thing the one time we actually DID meet someone else with it.

You either have it or you do not. There is no carrier genes. You need to see a doctor to get diagnosed. As others have said I would see your doctor. Depending where you are there might be  NF charity which might also be able to help", "Testing negative for nf1 I was recently diagnosis( clinically) with nf1. My symptoms looks mild...is there any hope for getting a negative result,when doing the gene test.  What does negative really mean? I was also clinically diagnosed. I have a large Plexiform neurofibroma and Caf\u00e9-au-lait spots. But I tested negative for NF1 in my genetic test. My doctors believe I have what is called Mosaic NF1. Which means part of my body has NF1 or atleast did during development. Which is the cause of the Neurofibroma. Do u have neurofibromas around your body? I have 1 large one growing off my spine that is it. Is it possible that I got have Mosaic NF1 as well? I got Neurofibroma around my body and cafe au lait spots Is it possible? Yes. Likely? No. I was told by my doctor im a very rare case. \n\nWhat you need to do is continue to talk to your doctors and see what they say. Find out what your test says and move forward. Being NF1 can be a challenge but it is not the end of the world. Ohh okay thanks for the help! I also have mosaic/segmental NF1. It is clinically diagnosed right now (quite recently) and I have had a blood draw for genetic testing. Results are pending. If it comes back negative, which is the assumption, they will take a small sample from the affected area and send it to the University of Alabama. Apparently they have a specialized lab that can analyze the cells and identify whether they have the NF mutation.\n\nIt is been fascinating to learn about. I was so relieved to have an answer about what these weird nodules are.\n\nI was told the usual presentation of NF1 affects perhaps 1 in 3,000 while a mosaic case is estimated to be around 1 in 36,000. They are not certain because of course lots of those cases are never identified. I am also very recent. I just found out 3 months ago that I even have a neurofibroma.\n\nI am getting work done at MD Anderson in Houston. I will be heading back soon for a biopsy. Good luck! Not really your same case as i have type 2 and not 1 like you, but as far as i understood the disease is diagnosed clinically rather than by means of genetic testing. Genetic may help what 'variation' you have or the severity of it. In fact i was negative for segmental (or puntiform, i always confuse them) mutations even though my symptoms are very clear cut nf2 (although mild). As far as i was told there is really no positive or negative, but it is rather a 'how much we have to dig before we identify a mutation', the deeper the milder the symptoms, and if you test negative for segmental mutations you have very good chances of generating healthy offspring I had to take 3 gene test because my case is kind of special. They said to me (if i can remember it correctly) that I have lots of segments of my DNA affected by it but in such a low quantity or something like that. I want to ask again because it was not easy to understand. So I do not have any extreme visible symptoms except for esclerosis and some spots. The worst part is a brain tumor, tho. Yes biopsy is the right course of action. UAB or in your case even Md Anderson researchers may be able to perform a deep sequencing on the tissue+ histology and confirm it. It is an easy experiment, you will have concrete answers after that test. Also, your positive attitude is a motivation for all of us. Thank you! Do you or your spouse also carry your daughter\u2019s mutation? She got it from me, and I probably got it from my dad. I did not get diagnosed until I was an adult, but I have allll the clinical signs (many cafe au lait spots, neurofibromas - including a rather large one that I am getting removed next week, lisch nodules in the eyes). We have not done genetic testing on me since the geneticist said I definitely have it anyway, but my sister got tested (she has cafe spots but no neurofibromas) and she has it also. I think I have this. I was diagnosed with it when I was 12. But only because my Aunty saw this spots on my chest and she is a doctor. I than had to visit the doctor every year until I was 18 or 19. Where I was dismissed.\n\nI think I have a relatively mild condition. I have lots of cafe spots and a few lumps but they are quite small.\n\nI should go see a doctor about it as it been 10 years. I did have an MRI last year. Do you have any symptoms? Or you one of those rare mild cases? I have heard of mosaic or segmental NF1 but your case seems something really interesting. If you do not mind me asking, at what age did you discover you have NF1 mutation? Just earlier this year - late 30s. It is interesting how some people only find out about their NF1 after having kids who show symptoms. 1 in 3000 is not that rare. I wish prenatal screenings was default for NF1 mutation. The gene is huge with many variants so it would not be very accurate screening, but at least deletions /duplications would be caught easily. I was actually diagnosed before my daughter was, but it was because of a prenatal visit when pregnant with my son. I had a nurse practitioner that day instead of one of the OBGYNs or midwives at my hospital, and when she was checking baby's heartbeat she noticed the birthmark on my abdomen and asked me if I had others like it. I was like \"yeah I have got tons of them, why?\" and she got all concerned and told me about NF1 and referred me to dermatology (who referred me to ophthalmology, who referred me to genetics). Cannot even count how many other medical professionals had seen that same cafe spot or my neurofibroma before she said something about it. \n\nI am very grateful to that NP because without her catching my NF1 signs, my daughter would not have been diagnosed either.  It is so important to know in the first few years of life since problems like optic gliomas tend to show up early and the outcomes are much better the earlier you start treatment. Some cafe au lait spots, esclerosis (who affected me in two zones, one operated), a few little neurofibromas on my head, lisch nodules and nothing more visible... Wow, super lucky to have a knowledgeable NP to notice your NF1. I wish all OBs were taught in med school about NF, and other diseases that can be passed on to offsprings. So interesting. What lead to the NF1 diagnosis in late 30s? I have had nodules growing just under the skin around my left ear since my early-mid 20s. They are small, but I keep getting more and more (from one, to two, and now there are about half a dozen even after having three removed). I have asked tons of doctors what they are over the years, and gotten lots of shrugs and no interest in following up.\n\nEarly this year, I saw a specialist for something else who was finally puzzled enough about the nodules to want to solve the mystery. That led to an excisional biopsy on three of them, and they were all neurofibromas. My neurologist had consistently dismissed them as nothing for years, so the surprise on her face was gratifying, to say the least.\n\nI was clinically diagnosed by an NF specialist, and we are in the midst of genetic testing right now. My blood test came back negative, as expected. Now we are going to take out another nodule and some skin and check for NF1 in those cells, which the specialist believes will show the mutation. Do you have segmental or mosaic NF1? I guess you will find out when they do genetic testing on biopsy tissue. Exactly. Currently clinically diagnosed with mosaic NF1. I am having unrelated brain surgery next week, and while I am under they are going to biopsy some suspected neurofibromas to test.", "(TW; blood) ...this is the avocado sized tumor that was removed from my neck a few years back, it was growing rapidly, so the fear of it being cancerous was high (no cancer) but nerves were damaged, causing the left side of my lynx to be paralyzed..  losing my voice was one of the most painful experiences of my life..\n\nto not recognize ones own voice is very very surreal.\n\nI guess I just wanted to say, do not worry about the cafe au lait spots..

I have a lot of caffe latte spots on my back at times I can become insecure when I take of my top, pretty much my whole chest is full of dots. I have a caffe latte spots on my face, one on each side and one on my fore head, it looks obvious but people tend to be nice about it. \n\nI had surgery last year to remove a big tumour under my right nipple which is healed up nicely. \n\nI have a tumour right inside the bottom of my penis next to my pelvic bone which is obvious and tends to be painful when touching.

", "Husband of wife who was recently diagnosed with NF2 Hello, I am new here. My wife was recently diagnosed with nf2 at 31 years old. We have a 2 year old daughter and a 3 month old son. She has an 11mm tumor on her left side and 2.5 mm tumor on her right side. She has already lost hearing on the left side but can hear well on her right side. We have no knowledge of family history with nf2. We live near Sarasota in Florida. I want to help her any way I can we are really lost and looking for guidance/support. Any information or insight from previous experience would be very much appreciated.  The best you can do is be there for her and let her know that you love her no matter what. You should also have your children tested if you have not already, unfortunately there is a 50% chance of passing it on.\n\nI was diagnosed with Neurofibromatosis twenty years ago when I was 15. There is no family history, other than the possibility of my moms second cousins father may of had Neurofibromatosis, but no one knows for sure. They remember him having tumors removed from his neck.\n\nI have had four surgeries to remove nf tumors.\n\n2001 - lower right arm to remove tumors \n\n2007 - spine upper neck to remove tumor pressing against spine \n\n2014 - upper right leg to remove high grade cancerous tumor \n\n2018 - upper right arm to remove low grade cancerous tumor \n\nI have yearly MRI scans, typically mine are full body, also I am having an issue and then the scans are just for where I am having the issue or what could be affected from the issue.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask\n You both should learn ASL, it is better to be prepared for when she loses her hearing. There is a new trial for a promising drug called axitinib. It is a pill that you take daily in order to suppress/shrink the tumors. \n\nHave your kids and wife tested. Especially brain and cervical spine MRI. \n\nOn a positive note: this condition is quite manageable. Assuming no immediate action is needed (like surgery), it is just a matter of monitoring it with scans every six months. \n\nIf any of your kids or your wife needs bilateral acoustic neuroma treatment, see about axitinib first before radiotherapy or surgery if at all possible. These procedures have a tendency to invoke deafness in the corresponding ear.  Thank you for your support.  Thank you I will look into it. Do you have any insight on going about learning sign language? I am sure there is plenty of ways out there that a simple google search would address, but any insight from experience would be helpful. Thanks! You are welcome  Come on down to the various subs: /r/deaf /r/asl /r/hardofhearing /r/monohearing etc. Lots to read and learn.  See also: Avastin. I am currently taking this (my second round). It does work but it is not a \"miracle\" drug. I was diagnosed at 18, I am 29 now so close to your guys age. Had to remove 2 acoustic neuromas, and went deaf at 22. I wear an abi (auditory brainstem implant). In my experience with nf2 I find that pain, physically and mentally, is inevitable, but a strong resolve will go a long way. Just be the same as you guys are now. The whole sympathy thing gets irritating, and I find being yourself helps. Too much change can fuck things up. A good support system is very effective. I have friends who know somewhat of what I am going through (I tend to hide my emotions a bit) but it is the same as usual. They do not treat me any different. You seem to have that support already, but later on your wife will be fatigued because the pain does that so you just got to let her rest. That is very important. \n\nWhen it comes to medicine I do not follow what other nf2ers take. A lot of pills is bullshit. I have taken a lot in those 10 years, but cut down a lot. CBD and cannabis is my preferred medicine. Helps like no other pill can with positive side effects. I just took a 100mg CBD pill and pain just disappeared. \n\nI wish you the best and throw any questions my way and the community. Nf2 is a bitch, but it does not have to take over your life. It is an everyday battle.  Thanks for the info. It is good to know there are ways to manage the pain besides a bunch of pills. I wish you well, and appreciate your input. ", "Pre-Genetic testing advice Hello!\nMy 3yr old son recently had his annual checkup and the pediatrician brought up NF as a possibility due to CAL spots. We met with some doctors who are suggesting genetic testing.\n\nLooking towards the future and I want to make sure we are doing everything we possibly can so that he gets any help he may need. I know that GINA helps with discrimination when getting primary health insurance yet life and long term care insurance can be problematic. \n\n1.) Has anyone found life or long term care insurance problematic or necessary post-diagnosis?\n2.) Any other words of advice for other things we should do before getting an official diagnosis?\n\nAny help or guidance is very appreciated! Thank you! Whetr do you live? this can depend on the country United States I was born in 1983, doctors thought I had it, but results were always inconclusive. I was even checked again in 1992 or 1993, but my parents received the same inconclusive results. It was not until 1999 when I was 15 that I was firmly diagnosed. It is believed that puberty is what really set things off for me. Back when I was growing up and on my parents insurance we had Blue Cross. \n\nNow as I got older and could no longer be on their plan, we continued with me being on Blue Cross, but it was kind of costly. Eventually I was approved for SSI and was able to receive Medicaid. Which was great. The only downside is they prefer you to stay in network and not go out of state for anything. My Neurofibromatosis specialist who I have been seeing since I was 15 is out of state. So I always needed basically permission with my Medicaid insurance provider, which my primary local doctor would have to pleas the case with them to allow me to go to my appointments or even have even major needed surgeries done at the out of state hospital. (I could tell you a story that probably piss you off about the insurance heads, they definitely made my surgeon upset)\n\nOnce my dad applied for retirement, I was then able to get on Medicare, which is accepted throughout the United States, so no more needing permission to see my out of state doctor.\n\nNow my situation is like this, because of how I am effected by Neurofibromatosis. Some people are not effected as much as others, while others have pretty severe cases of it. Unfortunately there really is no way to know just how someone will be effected by it.\n\n\nIf you have any questions let me know. I have never had any problems with having life insurance or health insurance. I do have a very mild case though and do not see any specialist for it. Wow!\n\nThis is all so new to me.\nThank you for helping me gain insight into what is potentially to come!\n\nAs I read about the protection GINA is supposed to provide I am also finding out how loopholes are exploited. For example, (supposedly) the insurance company can no longer use genetic conditions as an excuse to charge a patient more BUT they can offer \u201cwell being cash back\u201d programs. These programs give money in an HSA for belonging to a gym or getting your cholesterol tested. These programs do not have to consider people with pre-existing conditions as eligible.\n\nI have read that some people will get a life insurance policy before they get genetic testing because the results could effect rates or eligibility.\n\nHave you heard of any programs that you wish you knew about before diagnosis or any helpful resources? I have been doing a lot of reading on the CTF website. That is so awesome to hear!\n\nThe doctor told us that our son will most likely need yearly dermatologist and ophthalmology visits. \n\nDoes this advice make sense? Unfortunately, no I have never heard of any programs that perhaps could have helped me and my parents. I would love if you could PM me your experience with the insurance company as it relates to your surgery! For some people. I have very mild fibromas that do not cause problems and showed up after pregnancy and cafe spots . Not who you responded to, but wanted to comment. The advice of your son needing yearly visits absolutely makes sense. The yearly visits are used more for screening potential issues. It is definitely NOT a guarantee that the things you read about will happen or will even most likely happen. These visits are put into place so if things *should* happen, then you will not only catch it early, but you will also be able to monitor the progression of adverse symptoms sooner than you would if you were not as strict with screening. For example with ophthalmology they will be screening for optic gliomas. Many kids will not even get these, but if they do they will catch it early, and one of the 1st routes to take in the treatment of these is to watch and wait to see how it progresses. If he is getting biannual to yearly visits, then you will be able to do both these things much more efficiently/quickly than if you were not as strict with screenings. Depending on how NF manifests in his case, his visits will get more spaced out as he gets older. Insurance will hopefully help with many of these visits, because the doctors who screen for potential issues will fall under the \"specialist\" category, and labs and imaging studies will be more expensive, especially since they are used more often than a typical pediatric patient. I have a 3-month old who has been tested (we are awaiting results) for NF.  Her doctor told my husband and me that should my daughter test positive, she will need to see a neurologist yearly. Sorry for the ignorance.\n\nDoes this mean that there is a tie to hormones?\nDid teenage years coincide with any progress in your NF? My teenage years had no affect on my NF. But for some reason pregnancy made some fibromas grow. Only on my abdomen. For my mom she grew fibromas all over her body after pregnancy. Are they recommending a brain and spine MRI?\n\nDid they recommend setting up any type of savings account (like an HSA) to help pay for medical expenses? From what our neurologist explained, depending on the results of the genetic test, she may/May not recommend an MRI.  I gather that if NF1 is confirmed, an MRI will not be immediate for two reasons: my little one did great on the examination done by the neurologist, and she is too young for an MRI (MRI in children this young requires sedation).  \nBecause a diagnosis was not confirmed, a treatment plan and/or recommendations of any additional resources were not discussed.  Any needs/expenses related to NF1 will depend on the severity of it but, and is a personal choice.  However, an HSA account would not be a bad idea.  My employer offers one so perhaps that is something we would look into if need be.", "Leg pains I often wake up with excruciating leg pain. Sometimes it just omg leg or both. Does anyone else feel this. I do not know if it is from sleeping or just something else. I have Broughton it up with my doctor for my NF and they have not dont much really. Thank guys The fact that your waking up with intense pain in the middle of the night concerns me. Has your doctor ordered any MRIs? Does this doctor specialize in Neurofibromatosis?\n\nIn both 2014 and 2018, I had intense pain in my right leg (2014) it would hurt to even drive and go out to dinner and sit with the family and then in my right arm I had a burning pain that would wake me up in the middle of the night (2018). Both times my doctor ordered MRIs, and these tumors turned out to be cancerous, which both of them were thankfully removed. I would ask your doctor about having an MRI done to make sure everything is okay. Yes my doc does specialize in NF my own problem is that I am at school right now and I am only able to see him I am early June but hopefully I will be able to do something soon I would contact him then, my doctor has mailed orders that I can take to whatever hospital I need to and I can have the MRIs done without seeing him. Either the hospital can mail the disc to your doctor or they can make copies and you can mail them. I have done it many time. Thank you You are welcome, good luck I get leg pain primarily at night. It is more restless leg syndrome for me than anything. My legs just feel like they need to move and like they need to be stretched and it is only at night...but tumours are always at the back of my mind", "Subcutaneous Fibroma So hello! I have been diagnosed with NF1 my whole 23 years of life. And my yearly exam/MRI was always \u201cLooks good! See you next year!\u201d But this time they found two fibromas in my abdomen, both seemed to concern the doctor enough to have them removed. I will be getting a PET scan first, which if any of you all have had one I would love to hear your experience. But my larger worry is the actually procedure, have any of you all had fibromas removed that were not visible to the outside? I know everyone is different but it eases my mind to know more, and I cannot find anything online.  I hate having to wait a weekend to hear more back from my doctor ", "NF and transgender? Anyone else have NF and is also transgender? Have you/are you/do you plan on medically transitioning/transitioned? \n\nI am just curious since I have never met someone else who is also trans and also has NF  I am trans!  Ftm, also have these questions I am not a trans, but I know a guy/girl   with nf1 who is trans, and he/she live with female parts now,   but I do not think being trans have something to do with Nf1/2, (maybe I am wrong) But GL in the future  :-)    I am on HRT and MTF  I plan on transitioning as well! I was told that HRT would not affect my tumours. Even if it did I would still transition; I would rather die young/er and happy than live miserably.  Me, I am ftm but have decided hrt treatment as I was told the hormone change would cause tumor growth, I was actually going to post the same question! Because of the MF stuff I just identify as agender/nonbinary and for those really close to me I tell them I am transmasculine because I have not come out yet. Its great to finally know that is there are others in the NF community who are trans too!!!", "As a person that has NF, would you ever chose as a life partner or date a person that has NF ? \n\n( More interesting to know is someone \"normal\" would date someone with NF. I have an incredibly loving husband. Obviously this disorder gets passed down somehow so people with NF find partners. I would, it did not happen that I ended up with a partner who also had it but, I would not not date someone if they had it.\nEdit: Spelling and grammar I do not understand your comment, can you please explain, because i. The first sentence you say you would, and at the end you say that you would not Does you have NF or your husband ? I would not have turned down my partner if they had it. They do not have it. I would most definitely date someone else with NF but I would not have children with them. What im shocked this is even a question wow I misread the question and voted no by accident lol. My girlfriend of 7 years has NF so yeah id date someone with NF. I am happily with someone now so this is N/A.\n\nI would only date them if they were extremely discreet about it. If they were keen on creating awareness and open about their condition (the condition we share) - then I would not. And if they spoke openly about their condition then I would not.\n\nI am very discreet about having this. So this would cause us to clash because our values would be so different - I could not see it working based on this. I have it My husband does not have it but I would never have chosen someone with it because it was already hard enough to have a healthy child without NF. Do you also have NF? Are you a girl or a boy? Why it is so important for you to be discreet about it. I am also very discreet, only my family and 2 close friends know, and they found out very late in our friendship It is a question because let us be honest, every person with NF asked themselves this question at some point.\nFor instance,  I personally could not be  with someone that have NF , because I know how damaged I am mentally and emotionally, and I need someone healthy as a partner in order to have a healthy relationship, not another screwed up person like me that has no confidence or has only dark thoughts Oh wow i mean i have nf and Do not find that it affects me one bit. Nor my sisters. Its one thing to want someone who is not mentally damaged as you say but im not sure it correlates with having NF. That would never even ne a criteria for me Ngl tho the posts here are freaking me out \ud83e\udd23 never thought nf was a big deal till i came here and now im seeing how people are being severely affected by it its literally shocking to me.\nI have an appointment in 1.5 weeks and now im going to have a lot of questions lol Yeah I personally do not want to have my own children because of NF. It may suck but to me it feels selfish knowing that my kids would have a 50% chance of inheriting my bad gene. It means that you do not have a server form.of NF and you do not really know how it is or what I am talking about How does NF affect you other than spots and tumors Thousands of bumps and lumps ranging from small to large from head to foot. Oh wow i have a few but they dont hurt. Do yours? Also the ones im noticing are all pretty new (under 5 years) so im thinking i might develop more :/\nWhen did you start growing yours They mostly itch, so they bleed a lot. I do not remember when I started growing them because it is all I have ever known. So you had thousands your whole life basically? I do not have tumors, just a few small ( like 5) under the skin fibrosis ( they look like pimples) and noticable only when light hits from a side. I have a lot of spots tho and freckles, which for me is enough to mess with my head And damn i didnt know they could bleed :0 In my other comment I was referring to people that have it way worse than me and you The earliest I remember was when I was 2 and I had to have brain surgery because a tumor had grown over my optic nerve and was moving into my brain. Yes the ones on my tummy are kind of like how you described. I can see them when i point my flashlight under the tummy and kind of like pinples but not really.\n\nI think its crazy how we both see our freckles. I really like my spots tbh i just dont like the tumors :/\nBut the spots and freckles i find make my skin special like a cute inverse cow \ud83e\udd23 How old are you Do you have a lot of spots, or only a few? Ok gotcha. I mean i get it but regardless i want to do in vitro for my kids. My husband does not have nf but even if he did i dont see why itd make a difference. For example me n you seem like we have the same severity but we have completely different outlooks/ways it affects us.\nSo it is not so much a question of whether or not someone has NF, more so how they deal with it/how it affects them. Kite a lot. Definitely too many to count.  One boob has like probably 100 small ones and 1-2 really large ones (the size of like 2 thumbs) Oh why. I have an optic nerve glioma as well but didnt need to remove it. Just had lots of MRIs to monitor its growth Wow* No. She only has cafe au lait spots and lisch nodules so really limited disease. We are planning to go with ivf when we have kids. I am an adult female.\n\nIt just is. Personal health of any nature is an intimate topic. I do not even discuss it with my family or friends. \n\nIf someone were to ask me about it - I would play \u201cdumb\u201d or just politely tell them - sorry but you are asking a \u201cno-go zone\u201d question. \n\nYes there are people with all types of conditions that will stand up and create awareness for whatever they are living with. That is fine - it is neither right or wrong. \n\nThere is no right or wrong way of dealing with what you are living with it. Some people choose to do it openly and some people do not. I have a lot of big ones, and Small ones , their is no part of my body that does not have them:)) picture a dalmatian.\nI do not have them on my face. But the ones that bother me the most are the spots on my butt and the small spots under my armpitS, I also have on my boobs, they appeared recently, but it does not bother me that much. Well, mine was growing and migrating, so I am blind in my right eye. 35 Dalmatians are so frikin cuteee.\nI think its cute like vitaligo but kind of inversed. You should try looking at it from anither perspective cause there seriously nothing unattractive about freckles and spots Oh wow youre fully blond in one eye?\nI can see now the huge range in severity of NF1 Yes. Since I was two. Ivf with someone else's egg? Or with her egg but a healthy one? Also will be a surrogate mother? Because the pregnancy can affect the person with NF. If I will have a baby, it will be through a surrogate, with a healthy egg collected from me and the sperm of my partner, or I will take an egg from a donor and the sperm of my partner and ask the help of a surrogate. Thank you, you are a sweet person \ud83d\ude1a Would try to find a healthy egg if feasible. Given how mild her disease she feels comfortable getting pregnant. Shes almost 30 and has had a completely normal life, zero neurofibromas or other complications. Very lucky. Of course, just make me sad to see it affecting you so badly because its just such a small thing and really does not define you one bit. I never even think about my spots tbh. Its just us :) our beautiful colorful skin ahah Oh wow you have been through a lot as a kid it seems. Hope you are doing ok \ud83d\ude0a It is very hard most days, but I try. Totally relate to this.\n\nI was actually planning on staying single my entire life but I had a chance encounter with the person I am in a relationship with today. You are so right, thank you for being inspiring to me and to others Sprry to hear that, i truly am?\nWhat is hard on you? Physically or mentally? Both? \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95 Definitely both. So mentally its hard for you to accept how you look ?\nSorry if im Askin too much. No need to answer. \nWell if it helps you to talk i like to listen so you van dm me Yes, it very hard to accept how I look because I was bullied and beat up for it. Sorry people truly are disgusting. They really are. Honestly I have spent my whole life praying that I could have 24 hours where I felt normal and pretty. It would be my preference, I am 100% on not having kids because of my having it and feel like there would be more understanding of how I think. Honestly yea i hated school too.\nI can imagine how much it hurts. I have some of my own horrible insecurities and i remember crying to God too to make me pretty. I remember literally using those exact words. And that pain is aweful so i understand what you mean and i hope that you are learning to accept yourself more for who you are. Your body is just your body and its not YOU..\nSending you hugs \ud83e\udd17 ((Hugs)) Sure, as long as they are okay with knowing I noped out of ever wanting kids a long time ago. I would most likely not to date someone with NF. Just my preference. I have a very mild case and am very open about it.  I have spoken in front of a lot of people about my condition.", "What happens after surgery? I do not have neurofibromatosis (that I know of anyway) but I have a schwannoma and read that was common with it so I thought I would ask here. I have had weakness in my left shoulder for years but figured that was because it was my non dominant side and I was being a hypochondriac. Earlier this year I found a lump above my collar bone that we thought was a lymph node but the biopsy came back as a benign schwannoma. Following the biopsy I had sharp shooting pains in my arm and a deep continuous ache in my shoulder. First I thought they must have damaged something with the needle, but now maybe it is the tumor itself giving me problems. I have surgery next week to get it removed and I am wondering if this will fix the issue with my arm. I cannot get a straight answer from the doctor. He said we should remove it to prevent future damage, but will not say whether it will fix the damage that is already occurred. Obviously they will have to cut through nerves to remove the tumor. I am scared it will make it worse. Could it be permanent damage? I have an active lifestyle and I cannot imagine living with the constant pain I have been in the last few weeks. Experiences? After a long bout of pain in my right shoulder/ deltoid area, I had a fist size tumor removed from my right axilia nerve.  That is the nerve that controls the deltoid muscle so when it was cut out along with the tumor the end result was a paralyzed deltoid muscle. \n\nOn 11 years,  I still have a paralyzed front and middle deltoid but the aft deltoid responds to some control.  Overall there are a few things I seem unable to do, but i am living an active life full of activity.  Hockey,  skiing,  golf,  photography, and i work a full time labour intensive job. \n\nThe first thing I said when walking from a 5 hour surgery, where they cut my pectoral muscle down into my arm pit was \"my shoulder does not hurt are not more\". To me that was the most important part!\n\nGood luck, ask lots of questions,  confirm how much will be removed, and if they can do reconstructive surgery on the nerve they are cutting out. Thank you so much for the response. I am glad to hear the pain went away. Sad to say I am more concerned about that than if I lose a little bit of function. If you are lucky, the nerve it is attached to will just be a sensation nerve, add my other 3 have been.  Only the axilia cyst was a muscular control nerve.", "Blood donation. Doctors  and nurses told me that I cannot donate blood even if I have not a malignant tumour. They say that blood volume difference can affect undetected micro-fibromes in eyes anda can be dangerous. \n\nI read in nf websites that we can donate, but all the doctors I visit ( neurologist) and nurse who work in blood donation areas say me that this is not true\n\nI feel frustrate for cannot donate blood or organs. I have had NF all my life I donate blood every few months. Since I am O+  I try to donate since it goes to people who need it. I am sorry that doctors say that you cannot since I know you want to help others. I donate blood and platelets all the time with the Red Cross, one time a tech 2nd guessed if NF prevented me from donating and did not find it on the cannot donate list when they double checked. When I had asked my dr I was told its completely fine to donate, regardless they test the blood before using it so even if there was concerns they would be vaught before the blood was used Wow... that is confusing! I have a photo that send me a nurse when I ask where they write NF cant....maybe is diferent depending on the country?? I cannot understand!! Maybe depends of the country? I saw the list, and I have a photo! That is frustrating Iom reading more people here than can donate and now I am very confuse, because I saw the list avoiding nf patients. Maybe different protocols in different countries? That is crazy :/\n\nI will insist Hmmm maybe. I am in the United States I have NF 1 and donated blood for over 30 years until I got cancer. Red Cross has tons of questions to stop you from donating blood if they think you present ANY risk to anybody.  NF is not on that list, so I give. Hope all is going ok with that. You can donate. Get a second opinion. Thank you. Starting on my 5th year after diagnosis. Good and bad days but I am grateful for each one. I have been told I am ok to donate.... also in US The US does not care about it is people so I would not 100% rely on our information just saying \ud83d\ude15", "First post on this page Hello everyone, \nFirstly I would like to say that I hope that everyone is well and staying safe along with your loved ones and friends. \nI was diagnosed with NF 1 as an infant, the worst of my symptoms have been having clusters of birth marks and a few small lumps, I have been very lucky that they have not been in any dangerous areas. \nI am a 28 year old male, and I am a clean and sober alcoholic and drug addict. I spent a lot of my life being very self conscious of my body, but as I have gotten older my birthmarks have mostly faded and I have not had any new lumps grow for as long as I can remember. I have had brain scans up until my teenage years and they have never found anything. \nI have not had a drink since May 2018 and I have not abused or used prescription pills or drugs for almost 4 months now. I owe my life to the rooms of AA as I have found a group of people who are recovering alcoholics and addicts who are staying clean and sober one day at a time and dealing with their trauma and pain and getting through life just like me. \n\nI am wondering if anyone has had onset\u2019s of growths and troubles with NF later on life? How likely am I to have complications as I go through life just trying to survive one day at a time. \n\nI feel like I was dealt a real shitty hand in life as I did not choose to have NF and I certainly did not choose to become an alcoholic or a drug addict. I have been in a few relationships, I finished high school and did a bachelor degree. \n\nMost days I do not even think about NF as it is not currently causing me any problems. \n\nI am wondering, are there support groups like AA where people with NF can share their stories which each other. I am 49 years old and have been symptom free all my life until the past year. So yes, even though you do not have any symptoms right now they can certainly start at any point in your life. The key is to find a good NF clinic close to where you live. Thank you for sharing, may I ask what symptoms you have just started to get out of nowhere? \nI do not want to live in fear that any day I could get a growth in my brain and I am done for, \nThat is why I live each day, just for today, one day at a time. \nI am in Melbourne in Australia, \nNot sure if we have NF clinics, but we have geneticists specialist doctors and neurologists to treat NF. \nI got a free MRI scan through the neurologist and there was not any growths in my back, (chronic back pain) but I have not had a brain scan for a long time, \nHow often is it recommend to get an MRI scan of the brain to make sure there are not any growths there? Unfortunately Neurofibromatosis effects everyone differently and there really is no way of knowing how it will effect one later in life. In my case mine has gotten worse as I have gotten older, but do not think that will happen with you, as it effects all of us differently. If you have any questions feel free to ask. Thanks for sharing, are there any support networks or meetings available for people with NF can share like we do in AA?\nThose meetings are so helpful for me as I can share my story and relate to everyone else\u2019s shares. \n\nI can deal with more neurofibromas and stuff like that, it just depends on where they are and if they cause any discomfort. \n\nDo you mind me asking at what age did you notice it starting to progressive get worse? There are groups out there I am sure, but this is the only one that I am part out. My condition though was not awesome when I was diagnosed. It really got worse when I was 23, but I had balance issues before that and a large mass on my right leg that has continued to grow throughout the years. i do not think about mine most days. i have a few lumps but they are all under the skin so invisible  except one on my head and that is covered by my hair. i had one removed on my side as it was malignant but that was a while back. so far no other real issues \n\ni have the birthmarks too. i was self conscious about them for years but at the end of the day, if people want to state or pass comment that makes them look ignorant not us. \n\ni have quite a mild form and as others have said everyone is different. the best you can do is find a doctor who is aware of what it is as there are a few from my experience that do not know what it is. maybe ask for a referral to a clinic if there is one? \n\ncongratulations on the sobriety btw. i have never had an addiction issue but i went teetotal for my mental health and it helps. I have a weird limp and weakness in my right arm. Nothing too serious at this point. Although this past week 2 doctors want a brain mri. \ud83d\ude2c Thank you for sharing, \nSymptom wise, it is sounds like we are very much alike, \nI am going to get a referral to a specialist and get some more MRI scans.\n\nYou are totally right, \nI was in my early 20s when I stopped being self conscious about it all, \nCan get pretty fit and tanned so ask I have gotten older, it is barely visible. \n\nHope it stays like this for you and stays mild. \n\nThank you, I work my recovery hard with AA, I have a sponsor and I am doing a 12 step program. \nYou can be thankful that you did not get dealt that card as well because I am telling you, I am very lucky to be alive, I am 28, written off two cars, but times wasted on booze or somehow substance affected, and I was not injured, and no other cars have been involved, so I am so thankful, I should be dead 100 time\u2019s over, the about if hospitalisations I have had from pushing it too far. I have no off switch what so ever, \n\nI would I do not drink or drug or smash prescription pills one day at a time I have so many guarantees, I can go to bed knowing that I am not going to black out and make a cunt of myself, or get behind the wheel of my car and put myself and others at risk, I know that I am safe. \nJust for today, one day at a time. The thought of drugging or drinking is so ingrained with all the consequences that I do not even find myself having that argument. My understanding is that women are more likely than men to experience significant changes in NF1 condition because they experience hormonal changes during pregnancy and menopause That can trigger new NF1 symptoms.  But, as others have said, NF1 is different for everyone.  \nHere are some resources you may find helpful:\n\nNetwork that is much like Reddit but for medical concerns and has an active NF1 group:\n\n\nNational NF network for the US that may be able to help you find resources for your area:\n\n\nFacebook group:\n Thank you so much!", "Does anyone else feel they are getting mentally slower as they get older. I feel that I cannot do simple reading and writing anymore.. thanks  Same How old are you talking? I have got the same question as truth copy. Some mild level of slowing down is typical for everyone (even non NFers) as we age. But if the rate is fast and early it might warrant a chat with your neurologist. Especially if it has lasted more than a week or so and you are not suffering from any external stressors (which can also temporarily impact cognition).

Do you know what you want to study?", "I am am 18 I have only had one tumor and it has been removed. Should I expect more down the line or is it different with each person  You will probably get more, but sounds like your case is mild. Lots of people have serious complications by 18 which sounds like you avoided so far. Do not worry about the future so much. You will be fine even with new tumors. You will be able to deal w them. While everyone with NF is different from how it affects us. I try and not think about it too much as there is a lot of information out there which is incorrect and you can scare yourself. I know I have in the past. Depends on the severity of your NF. I got my first  tumor removed around 17-18, now I am full of sub-cutaneous (not on the skin or visible) tumors everywhere, and I have had many major surgeries since then to get other tumors removed. When u were 18 was it only one Have you had your blood draw yet?  Check for Chromosome 17? You will get more NF 1 is progressive, meaning it almost always gets worse. But from what I have been reading / heard, worse doesnt exactly mean you will be covered in tumors. Worse could just as easily mean 3-4 new small ones in the next decade.\n\nYou will most likely get more but in 2/3 of cases it will not be too bad or noticeable. I had 3 subcutaneous ones before I turned 20 (all of which were removed and did not come back). In my mid 20s I developed around 6 small ones on my chest that kind of look like pimples. People do not comment on them so they probably think nothing of it. I have pea sized ones here and there (one one my back, two on my feet, all subcutaneous), which came about late 20s-early 30s. \n\nNow in my mid 30s I am noticing more but very very small and they can only be seen direct, severe lighting. But overall no one will look at me and think anything is \"wrong\", except maybe ask why I have some insect bite looking lumps on my body (mostly right leg). \n\nNF1 has a super wide expression range. Some people will only get a few bumps, some many, but most people who have NF1 are believed to only have a mild case and it will not have much of an impact in everyday life. \n\nI have learned to always remember that people you see online will usually be people who are more affected severely, making bad cases seem more common. But most people who have no trouble with it are not going online to seek support. \n\nThat being said, I cannot tell you how your condition will progress, and there is no point worrying over it. Just live your best life and deal with problems as they come instead of worrying about something that might not even come. Hard, I know. I am trying my best to remember this as well. It is different for every person. I am 36. And I have had four surgeries related to my Neurofibromatosis to remove tumors. The last two were in 2014 and 2018, while the ones before that were in 2001 and 2006.", "Vestibular Schwannoma... NF2? Hi everyone! I (M32) was diagnosed with a unilateral vestibular Schwannoma in March and had it removed in April. In June my 10 year old paternal half brother was diagnosed with a tectum glioma on his brain stem.\n\nObviously I am now suspecting a NF2 mutation, as two brothers having head tumours seems like quite a coincidence. My doctor claims an MRI of my spine will rule out NF2 mutations if no tumours are found. I have the MRI booked in two weeks.\n\nBut I am still not convinced - is it possible I have an NF2 mutation without spinal tumours? How reliable is genetic testing to find a mutation? How was your Neurofibromatosis discovered?\n\nThank you for helping me understand this! With our son (7yo), NF2 was discovered by genetic testing after a meningioma (discovered through epileptic seizures). Genetic testing seems the best/most reliable way to know for sure. As far as we know, there are no tumors in his spine (yet). They suspect VS to be there as well, but they are still very small.\n\nAs I understood, VS in NF2 are almost always bilateral though. Yes, you can have nf2 and no spinal tumours because two third of Nf2 patients develop spinal tumours meaning once third will not. \n\n( \n\n( \n\nDo the genetic test and in the main time, take Sulforaphane to try to prevent a vestibular schwannoma in the other ear . \n\n(  \"Sulforaphane, a natural component of broccoli, inhibits vestibular schwannoma growth in vitro and in vivo \"\n\nYou need it as a supplement or broccoli sprouts. The brand used in clinical trials is Avmacol because it includes myrosinase which is needed. \n\nA natural food high in Sulforaphane is Moringa and an easy way to consume it is Moringa tea\n\nI have NF1 so a completely different disease, but I read a lot about Nf2 too. True but a delay in detection between the first and contralateral tumours is not uncommon.\n\n (\n\nSo no vestibular schwannomas have been detected in your son yet? Read my post about Sulforaphane in this discussion and maybe talk to your son's doctor about taking it as a preventative measure. Interesting. I had never heard of that. I did some digging and found a page about NF and sulforaphane. One thing to mention, though, is that they say:\n\n&gt;**Many foods and herbal options taken in concentrated forms have been found to be more harmful than helpful.**\n\n I had seen and went to look at the paper and the references cited and the enormous amount given to a trout in the 90s that would be very hard to replicate in a humans. \n\nIt is not only Sulforaphane but everything that has the potential to harm. Autophagy obtained by fasting is great to prevent cancer unless it feeds cancer . A diet rich in antioxidant is great unless you have cancer and receiving chemo in which case, it might make things worse , even an over the counter iron supplement will promote cancer in certain conditions, and the list goes on and on and on. \n\nThis is why it is important to talk to doctor because right now in Nf2, hearing loss is almost an absolute certainty, and it is devastating for most and somehow so much worse then if you are born deaf . If there is one compound which has the potential to save and preserve hearing by inhibiting the growth of a Vestibular Schwannoma, it is something that needs to be considered. \n\nThere are currently 79 clinical trials for Sulforaphane,  25 of which for cancer, so I doubt they would do 25 trials for Sulforaphane and cancer if there was doubts about safety .", "About 16 new CAL spots, but no other symptoms? Hey guys! I am 20, and a few days ago I discovered some CAL spots on the groin and torso area. I do not know how long they have been there. Maybe a year, with some younger months-old ones? Anyway, I have like 10. They are really light, the and many have unusual shapes (like uneven edges, so they are not oval like many I have seen on Google). I do not have any other symptoms of NF1 and it is not in my family. \n\nDo you think it likely that I do have NF1, and the other symptoms are yet to come? I am not asking for a diagnosis, I am actually seeing a neurologist in a few hours. Just wanted to get tips earlier to know what I am in for. CALs usually stop appearing in nf kids by age 2-3. I have a lot of CALs, and that is it that I know of. I am not even sure when they have appeared or if more appeared in adulthood.. but I was just diagnosed at 33 years old following my daughter\u2019s diagnosis, so it is certainly possible to not know till adulthood that you have it.", "Golf Outing for NF! I need donation to host this event! ", "NF1 and pain Hi all! So glad this subreddit exists. I am 21F Definitely feels like I am the only one sometimes haha. \nI was diagnosed in 2016 with NF1. I have tumors (subcutaneous) all along my right side subcostal and above my ribs. They are pretty large. I have had surgery twice for removal because of how large they got. It seems after my second surgery (in 2017?) I have been experiencing a lot more pain. I get random stabbing pains in the area near the surgical site. They only last about 30-60secs. \nI was wondering if anyone else experiences this?  It is really hard to give a fair answer on this.  I have had pain prior to surgeries like you described, but once the tumors were excised the pain ceased. I would follow up with your doctor or surgeon to see if they can do anything else for you. It sounds like nerve spasms or a pinched nerve. I would also get a second opinion from a specialist or neurologist. Most have little training dealing with nf. I have been lucky to get good surgeons who were able to help me. Fyi, I am 40 with about 8 surgeries from nf so far. Mostly minor, twice under sedation.  I am experiencing the same after a surgery I had in 2012. Over the past couple years the pain has come back and is worse than it was originally. This is not uncommon with NF tumors/tumor removal, unfortunately. They can grow back or grow bigger, grow differently.  Or in rare cases can become cancerous I do, I have had four surgeries between 2001-2018. Two of which were to remove cancerous tumors.

(I am not talking about the cafe au lait spots)   :-)  I have tumors all over. I have large ones in both my legs. The biggest one is in my right leg which some of it was removed in 2014, but not all of it. I have a large one on the right side of my neck. I also have a large on my right upper arm which will likely have to be removed because it may be cancerious like the one I had removed in my leg in  2014. I also have a fairly large mass in my pelvis. I have a number of smaller ones through out my body. My doctor says my case is one of the most serve cases. It sucks but I take it day by day.  When did your plexiforms first present, if you do not mind me asking?  I am not too sure, I did not start havin MRIs until I was 15 in 1999. I did have bumps on my head growing up as a little kid and when I was 9 my parents took my to see doctors at the University of Michigan to have them take a look, but tests results were inconclusive. \n\nNow the plexiforms tumor that I had in my right leg that had been there since my early teens and had continue to grow and then in 2014 part of it became cancerous and was causing extreme pain. I got a tiny one on my chest and cheek. Im 24 years old. NF is more likely to be worse when your a teenager. Mine is on my leg like below my butt I have got a small one on the back of my head. It is not noticeable unless someone gets in my hair like a hairdresser.  3 vertebrae long, between my spine and muscle. Have not had an MRI in my back in 3 years so not sure.

Had an appointment on April 8th, when neurosurgeon was report they called and moved my appointment earlier to the 28th, if there is another cancellation on how many come in even sooner. There is a large extradural fusiform mass arising within the central spinal canal on the left side.  I believe this is a exturdural based on its appearance.  It results in significant mass effect on the the call sac, with significant narrowing.  This also results in some some deformity of the nerve root sleeve within the spinal canal superior to this. The left foramen is widened, and this soft tissue neurofibroma extends into the posterior aspect of the left psoas muscle.  The overall size of this measures 6.9cm \u00d7 2.1cm. It has a somewhat dumbbell shape.  It undergoes heterogeneous enhancement.  There is a smaller one arising from the right L2 nerve root sleeve also extending into the posterior aspect of the right psoas muscle.

I am 27 and I was diagnosed with NF at 7ish(?). It was an expected diagnosis since my father's side of the family has NF. \n\nNow, we are all pretty lucky, we do not have severe cases, just moderate. But since mine is progressing pretty quickly, we keep trying to find doctors that have experience with NF, but they are hard/ nearly impossible to come by. \n\nANYWAY, I just received my test results from my most recent MRI, and I am not a doctor by any means, so the verbage is throwing me. I have figured out some of it via a Google search. Is there anyone who can help me figure out exactly what this report is saying? \n\nEx: \n- Estimated craniocaudal dimension measures **cm\n- The plexiform neurofibroma is largely T1 hypointense and heterogeneously T2 hyperintense\n\nThere is some others, bit those are my main two.\n\n\n I was diagnosed when I was 15, doctors always thought I had it, but back then test results were always inconclusive. I am the only one in my family that has it. It is possiblea distant relative may of had it, but no one knows for sure, they just remember that relative having tumors.\n\nI have had four surgeries removed from 2001-2018. The last two were to remove tumors that had become cancerous. I see my nf doctor in Chicago at least once a year, sometimes twice. I have yearly full body MRI scans.\n\nAs for your report it would be best to ask the doctor who made the report. If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask. I am lucky in the sense that almost all of my tumors are inner muscle and located in the right leg and thigh. I have not developed the skin lesions as of yet, but I know that is coming. I am trying to keep up with annual MRIs of the leg, but when the neurologists I see do not really know much more about NF than I do, it is hard to stay with a doctor long enough for an MRI referral. \n\nDue to the nature of my tumors, I cannot really get most of them removed since it will cause nerve damage and prevent use of my leg. (Eventually I will lose use anyway and have to have the whole leg amputated)\n\nI was seeing a neuro-oncologist at MUSC who I was talking witg about the sheath surgery and amputation, but he basically refused the latter surgery and \"closed\" my case. Now I am going to try someone at University of Augusta, but who knows where that will lead.\n\nWhat were your removal surgeries like? Did you feel like it improved things for you? How is your doctor in Chicago? \n\nSorry to inundate you with questions, I am immensely curious!! My doctor is Chicago was awesome, much better then the doctor here in my home town. When I was 17 or 18 they saw my MRI scans and wanted my right leg amputated, so my parents took me back to Chicago to the doctor who diagnosed me and he looked over the scans and said no I did not need to have my leg removed. I am 35 now, so for me personally make damn sure that the doctor who decides that a leg or any part of your body needs to be removed is very femilair with Neurofibromatosis.\n\nNow as for if the four surgeries I have improved my life, they were all preventative and mandatory. The first one was actually done on my right lower arm by a doctor who lied to my parents, he told them he had done these surgery\u2019s before, but he had not and after the surgery there was a period of time that my arm would turn green and was numb.\n\nThe other three surgeries were all done in Chicago. One in 2007  to remove tumors that were pressing against my spine, doctors there were concerned that I could wake up one day and not be able to move and get out of bed. The other two were cancerous, in 2014 I had a large cancerous tumor removed from my right leg. It was causing a huge amount of pain. And then in 2018, I had an egg shaped tumor removed from my right up arm that was cancerous and that was causing a lot of pain. I still experience pain, but not the pain I had been when I had the cancerous tumors.\n\nSurgeons familiar will generally not remove Neurofibromatosis unless there is a needed reason, because these tumors can grow back and because of the risks that come with removing them, because of how they would wrapped around the nerves. Also be wary of a doctor who is not knowledgeable of Neurofibromatosis that wants you to do chemo/radiation, as that can make the condition even worse. Thank you so much for answering my questions, I know just how frustrating it can be to have to answer them all the time.\n\nI was offered a low-dose chemo/radiation experimental procedure almost 10 years ago, but it fell through the day before I went up to Philadelphia for the procedure, so I guess it is a good thing that did not work out!\n\nI hate that some of your tumors were malignant, but I am do glad to know that you were able to get them removed! (Except for that doctor that lied, wtf was up with that guy?? What a gross jerk)\n\nDo you mind if I ask you more questions about how your condition manifests itself? I could DM you so that you do not have to reveal everything to the audience of Reddit, but I am so, so curious how NF affects others, since it affects my family differently than it does me. It would be awesome if someone knew what I was experiencing. If not, that is perfectly fine and I understand!\n\nThanks again, you are awesome! It seems mine manifested sometime during purburty, I always had the birthmarks and a few bumps since birth, but the on switched flipped once I hit purburty and from then on tumors have been growing in number and size. \n\nOver the years I have noticed a change in what I am physically able to do. I can only walk and stand for so long. I am not able to drive for long period of time and I can get very restless sitting for period of time, so I need to be able to get up and move around and sit down at my own will. My right leg has been giving out on me a lot more, so cane is probably in my future. Climbing ladders is out of the question as my balance is not so great. I have good days and bad days just like others have.  That is so fascinating, thank you for sharing. I know that eventually I will lose movement in my foot and ankle, preventing me from properly walking without \"dragging\" my foot. I am not looking forward to that, but I have to be so thankful for what I have not experienced. \n\nI am sorry that you have had the handle struggle that you have been through, but I am so glad to hear just how well-prepared you are on the subject with yourself and your doctors. It gives me some hope!\n\nThank you for taking the time to share your story with me. It is taught me a lot You are welcome. I wish you the best of luck. Oh my god thank you! I realized that I have never read my reports and decided to read mine from last week and I learned a lot! It took a good amount of deciphering, but I could not get some of it to make sense at all.  Hey just in case you do not get the answers you are looking for here or are just looking for more information/resources in general, I encourage you to check out the Children\u2019s Tumor Foundation (ignore the poor branding, they do plenty for adults with NF too). Their website is ctf.org.  I have been to their site before! I saw that they had this huge event in Atlanta and I wanted to go, but ultimately decided not to since I am not a child. \n\nThank you! I will check them out! Great! If you have any specific questions about the organization, please feel free to reach out to me at any time. I volunteer with them (mostly through their endurance program) but also have a family member who works there. ", "a rant. I am just beginning to realize how shitty my life is. Sure, I have a good job and an amazing husband but I do not have control of my life because of NF. I was told that I have a mild case. Okay, so okay, good I have a mild case but I still have NF. It does not matter to me if it is mild because here I am in sadness that will never go away. I am just trying to survive the day and make it to bed at night without feel like I am going to just end it all. My childhood was great and so was my teenage years. Sure, I did not have much friends as I was the awkward outcast type. Young adult was great as I met my husband. Now I am in my 30s and I realize that my life sucks. I mean, truly sucks. I am not going to lie. I am not going to sugarcoat and say I am happy because I am not. It is very hard for people around me to understand what I am going through. My family is so arrogant of what I have and they act like I am dying. Truth is, I am dying. I may not appear to me dying, but each and every day I put a fake smile on my face and act like everything is okay.  They say I am looking for sympathy and crying out for attention. Simply this: I am not. I am expressing how much I hate my life. I am expressing that I cannot live like this much longer. This is not going to get any better. I am not going to hope that this NF will clear up because it will not. My family acts like I do not have it bad. I do have it bad. Every single day. \n\nAnnouncements fly and people we know are getting pregnant left and right. I cry and have to lock myself in the bedroom. Oh, I cry on my way to work now. Every day is filled with me crying. No. I will not act like I have it all. I do not. So here I am. Trying to survive. All I want is to be a mother like most females. No. I do not want to adopt. I want to experience pregnancy -- STRESSED free like everyone else. I want to have my head in the clouds. I want to see that big fat positive and be surprised by it all. I want to just enjoy life. Truth is... I have never enjoyed life. NF robbed me and my life and my happiness. You can still have kids, it is a 50/50 chance either way. Nf runs in my family, my grandfather had it and passed it on to my mother and 1 of my 2 uncles. My mom had me and my brother and we both have it. I know it can be hard. But you have to think of it as you may have NF but NF doesnt have you. Theres facebook groups for those who have NF, maybe check them out. Perhaps your parents were being honest with you about your condition. I knew from the moment I was diagnosed, that was something that was brought up by my doctor. \n\nYes having this condition does suck, but it does not help you to dwell on it and let it consume you. It just causes stress, and stress is one of the worst things for anyone. Try looking at the good thing you have in life. You mentioned before you have a loving husband. That is something that should not be taken for granted. Life is too short to dwell on the things you cannot do, try looking at the things you can do. \n\nIf you want to be pregnant and have biological children, it is possible, but yes there are many things to consider. Both to your health and the health of your child. There are things that can be done to prevent passing the condition on to your child, it does however cost money. But if that is something that is important to you, then discus your options with your doctor. Medicine and technology is changing every day. We already have one drug that is been approved by the fda to help shrink tumors. It is only a manner of time until they find other ways to treat this condition.\n\nAnd just remember there is nothing wrong with adopting a child either, yes they did not come from your belly, but that would not mean they would be any less yours. Adoption can be a great thing and there are some many children out there needing a family, something to love them.\n\nIt sounds like you have a lot of love to give, best to share it. Have you considered In Vitro Fertilization? Is there such a thing as IVF and having a surrogate? With IVF, you can almost guarantee your child would not have NF and if a surrogate carried the baby, then you would not have to risk the pain and tumor growth that hormones would cause. The idea sounds expensive but maybe it could be a goal to save up and work hard for. I am no doctor and I know nothing about pregnancy but I thought it was an interesting idea \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Osteopenia in NF patients I had a bone density test about a month ago and the results came back and said I had Osteopenia. Osteopenia is the beginning stage of Osteoporosis. This does not mean I will osteoporosis, it just means if I do not care about it now, I will have it later in life. Have any of you that have NF1 been told this? My genetics doctor informed me of the increased risk of early onset bone loss. I had my first scan about 2 years ago at 28ish. It was normal and he said he would order a new scan every couple of years. I just added a vitamin d supplement to my daily multivitamin, just to bump up my bone health. I was told, for the first time last year (in my late 30s) that this was a risk in NF1 cases and I should have DEXA scan to establish a baseline so this can be tracked later in life. I have not done so, but mostly because I figure it is pretty low priority in the pandemic. As stuff gets back to normal I will do it. Not going to lie, I was hoping to lose more weight before I did it because then it would be interesting info from a body fat perspective too (athletes sometimes have these scans done for that reason). As it is I know need to lose at least 20 pounds and I do not need a machine to tell me that.", "drinking alcohol Should I avoid drinking alcohol?? i noticed that with the tumors i have had removed, alcohol makes those areas red and itchy does drinking make the condition worse or increase growth? If you notice doing something makes things worse, why would you continue to do that thing?\n\nIf there is a correlation between drinking alcohol and symptoms appearing, you might want to stop drinking alcohol.\n\nYou will need to speak with your neurosurgeon regarding whether it causes an increase in growths rates or not. heyy could i ask tho, by \u201cremoving\u201d, does it mean you had the procedure done by electrossecation? or was it  by normal surgical means ? yeah! i am pretty sure that is what i had done. i went to a plastic surgeon who specializes in nf :) Not that I am aware of, I have have a number of tumors removed, including cancerous ones, but I do not really drink alcohol that much. I never could get the taste for it, most drink grasshopper, spiked lemonade or not your fathers root beer. I have only had one removed, but need several removed. I do notice when I am dehydrated my fibromas get red, itchy and kind of swollen. Since alcohol is dehydrating, do the same trick people do to help curb a hangover. Drink a TON more water whenever you drink. At least a 1:1 ratio. I have had 9 surgeries to remove tumors. I was not a heavy drinker but it has no connection what so ever. you must just be allergic to alcohol. have not had tumors removed, but my tumor areas do not have that issue when drinking Evidence has been mixed, but some studies have concluded that there is a link between alcohol use and tumor growth. See ( for example. You do not need to avoid drinking alcohol. I drink relatively often and it does not affect my condition at all. Who was your surgeon? Broadly yes, you should avoid drinking alcohol.  But that has nothing to do with NF.", "Nf type 1 uk female This is the first time I have ever posted online about my nf, Ive finally taken the plunge and booked in with a genetics councillor as I have always tried to pretend I do not have it. What can I expect from this I am moderately affected by this with a fair few tumours but they are more surface purple ones. I would love to speak to some more people who are going through this. It depresses me so much that I was dealt this hand in life, I am constantly looking at other girls my age with jealousy for their perfect skin ", "Itching. ", "Nauseousness Anyone else get nausea from NF1? I have been waking up with nausea for a little while now. Just wondering if it was related Did this just start? And do you have any spot where you have a tumor that the pain has become increasingly more painful than normal? It is been on and off for the last few months. As far as pain getting worse goes, a few years (3 or4) ago I did not feel any pain, but now, I feel quite a bit if pain. It is not really one particular spot though. Okay, the only reason I ask is because back in 2014, I had really bad burning pain in my leg and I would get sick after eating and feel fine afterwards and be good to eat again. The tumor in my leg turned out to be cancerous and needed to be removed. Once it was removed that pain went away and I only had my regular pain that I have learned to live with. I also stopped getting sick.\n\nNow I do feel dizzy every so often and I have medication I can taken when I feel that way and that helps. It is called meclizine \n\nI would contact your doctor and let them know how you are feeling, just to figure out what going on. It could just be the flu, but to be on the safe side you should get yourself checked out.\n\nI hope you feel better. If you have any questions let me know. Yeah, I actually have a doctor's appointment tomorrow. I have not been able to get to one for a while cause there is like only one in my state who specializes in NF. Hopefully it is nothing too serious.\nThank you for your help You are welcome. I actually see my specialist out of state, mostly because when I was 15 and my pediatrician wanted me to see one the Neurofibromatosis clinic that is in my state said that no I need go to Chicago. I guess it was because how my condition pretty much got jump started when I hit puberty. It was always believe I had it, as I had the birthmarks, but when ever I had been tested previously results were inconclusive.\n\nThat is great, that you are seeing your doctor tomorrow. I hope it all goes well and you start feeling better. I have nausea at random times of the day, sometimes from cars and sometimes for no apparent reason. They did an MRI and it was inconclusive so idk maybe an NF thing maybe not Same...I will get nauseous for no reason at all...never correlated it with NF though, but could potentially be a thing Nauseous pretty regularly as well here (NF1) - wake up dizzy/nauseous or just that strange constant queasiness. If it gets really bad, I take a gravol. Sometimes, I cannot even walk or move because it is so bad, I just try to stay still until it quiets down. It is the worst kind of discomfort for me - I can manage the pain and push through it, but nausea is so rough. I find that very cold things helps sometimes (ice cubes, sour popsicles like raspberry or lemon), salty or vinegary things like pickles or plain chips as well, but it depends on the severity of the nausea. \n\nTake it easy. \u2764", "Medical marijuana I have been trying to do some research on my NF and I came across and article about medical weed and how it helps with tumor pain I also started reading about the marijuana oils made for specific things to help shrink cancerous cells and tumors, I was wondering if anyone has done these oils and seen a difference in the size of and numbers of the tumors? I have not used the oils much so I cannot say for certain if it is true. I do highly recommend using medical cannabis for dealing with pain though. I am hoping they do enough research on the oils with nf tumors, it would be delightful if it does indeed shrink the tumors and reduce the growth of them. I know there is no miracle cure but it would be nice. I have heard nothing about it deceasing the size of tumors, there are however drug trials going in that are showing 20-40% of tumor shrinkage. There was a big announcement of one being close to being FDA approved back in November. I can vouch that smoking a ton of weed does not shrink tumors. Really!? I was in the Thalidomide Study back in the 90s. Unfortunately it did not show enough results Hi there, smoking cannabis does not shrink tumors but certain cannabinoids in cannabis have tumor suppressing qualities and there are tons of studies to back that up. I suggest (if you are interested) you start with sublingual CBD/THC oil (tincture) full-spectrum and whole-plant. from a respected brand. if you are in California, I own a company that gives out free bottles of CBD oil to Neurofibromatosis patients! You can find me on Instagram  I know smoking will not do much, just ideally for pain, I am talking about tinctures concentrated oils. I have done a lot of reading about the tinctures, I live in illinois where it is completely legal now. I have only read about people with cancer taking the tincture and it helping shrink the cancer growth and their tumors. That is why I got on here I wanted to see if it helped with nf tumors as well. I really wish it would help with the reduction of them that way people could live without the tumors getting in the way of their everyday life. But keep in mind, It is not a sure thing that cannabis tincture will shrink all tumor growth or kill cancer cells, if any at all. As much passion that I have for the plant, I cannot lie and say that \u2018it is a cure all, miracle\u2019 I have NF, a really bad case. I am sure many can relate when I say, NF SUCKS lol. It never shrunk any tumors but has helped me in every other way. Cannabis products are great for pain management, depression relief, helps nausea and appetite. NF patients really benefit from cannabis for nerve pain relief to the decrease of physiological issues (depression, anxiety) which NF is notorious for. Not to mention the sleep benefits!! I highly recommend tincture products but remember full-spectrum, and whole-plant are important. (Lab tested too.) I am so glad to hear about Illinois legalizing! I am happy to hear that it helps with nerve pain because that is what really gets to me sometimes, and the depression and anxiety are most definitely there too. And I was glad when they finally made it recreational but I was on the medically list anyways for having nf, sad thing is here they want a arm and leg for just getting the card and the whole process cost just as much as getting the card. Now that its recreational i do not have to go through all those hoops but I am hoping since they made it recreational the process and price for obtaining a card will be less difficult. Illinois is still in the \"bible belt\" and people still do not and will not understand how it helps people. Thank you for taking the time to talk to me and give me information! My pleasure!! I hope you find some relief. keep on keeping on \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude4f Yeah, there are at least four different trials going on right now. My doctor may try to get me into one. I was supposed to be in one back in 2014, but because I had a cancerous tumor show up that prevented me from being accepted. Smoking weed helps me with my nerve pain It helps with my tumor pain.  Not like opiates, but I am only 26, so I plan to stay off of those for as long as possible. I am happy you choose to stay off the opiates! It does more damage to your organs then weed will. I am always hearing bad things about pills so I most deff stay away if I can just smoke or take tinctures. I have been approved for medical marijuana here in New York. The THC is very good for pain and inflammation. The CBD component of medical marijuana is excellent for pain and spasticity. I tend to use full medical marijuana more towards the evenings, and especially right before bed, because THC is also excellent in promoting sleep. But during the day, especially if I have to be able to function fully, I use CBD oil.\n\nBut you should absolutely consult with a doctor before using anything that\\`s \"over-the-counter.\"\n\nI hope you found this helpful.", "Our Second Hackathon For NF \u2014 SVAI | Just thought it would be cool to share here! ", "Running Tests for NF on Our Son: UPDATE First of all, thank you all so much for your kind words and advice. I am feeling much better about this all.\n\nFor those of you who have not read my last post and care to, here is the link: \n\n\n\nLong story short, our five year old has several (at least 7) large cafe-au-lait spots and we are now running various tests to see if he has signs of NF.\n\nWe just got back from the ophthalmologist, who gave our son an all clear as far as his eyes go. He said he sees no signs of NF--no lisch nodules or signs of pressure. So\u2026what does this mean? Is this typical at his age, if he has NF? I have read that most of the symptoms other than the CALs do not appear until later in life, but I thought the lisch nodules might be evident, even at this age. \n\nWe have the MRI tomorrow, and he seems a-okay. Excited even. He can have food up until 5am, so I told him I would get up at 4am to make him a big breakfast of his choice. He is pretty thrilled about that.  The procedure sounds like it will be relatively easy. They will give him a fast-acting sedative through an IV, so he should be ready to go 15-20 minutes after the scan. That makes me feel a good deal better. Here is hoping for some good results there!\n\nTL;DR: Five-year-old son has lots of CALs, but just heard from the ophthalmologist that his eyes are clear for symptoms of NF (No lisch nodules or indications of pressure). What does this mean as far as a diagnosis?", "Does anyone have a BAHA for single sided deafness? This is a total shot in the dark, but does anyone have experience with Bone-Anchored Hearing devices for single sided deafness (SSD)?\n\nI have NF2, and have been deaf in my left ear since 19, and now in my early 30s, a new hearing doctor suggested a BAHA as a potential option, since at my most recent hearing test, I was able to \u201chear\u201d sounds from the left in my right ear if it was transmitted through my skull.\n\nI am researching them like crazy, watching Youtube reviews, finding old forum posts in medical groups, etc. to get as much info as possible, but I figured I might see if anyone had any current experience with one and would not mind letting me pick their brain a little bit. Here is my (super oddly specific) questions:\n\n-Do you have any problems resting the area with the abutment on someone? Any pain/pressure? This is (again) oddly specific, but when I curl up with my husband, I rest the \u2018bad\u2019 side of my head on his shoulder so my \u2018good\u2019 side is up, and I can hear him/room noise.\n\n-Can you feel/sense the abutment on your head? Not with hands/fingers, but just - sitting, is there a sensation of something there?\n\n-What is the difference in sounds between normal hearing and that coming through the device? Is it mechanical or computerized sounding? Can you tell the difference in sound coming through natural hearing and that coming through the device?\n\n-Do you have any improvement in figuring out the direction of sound with the BAHA?\n\n-Does it give you any pain or general discomfort overall?\n\n-Has it caused any pain or discomfort in your \u2018good\u2019 ear?\n\n-When the device is not attached, is there any feedback/sound/whatever through just the abutment? Say if it is brushing against clothes collars, etc.\n\n-I know they do not generally improve loud settings, but does it help you at all say in restaurants? I am sure that is very situational, but just in general.\n\n-Do you feel like it was a worthwhile improvement in your life overall? (That sounds silly maybe, I know, but I have been SSD for so long that I am mostly adjusted, and just deal with the oddness that happens, so I am wondering if you feel like it was worth the surgery/any discomfort, etc.)", "How many of you here had vasectomy or tubal to prevent from passing on NF1?

I did PGD IVF after I have his second baby I am getting a tubal so there is no risk of passing it on. If I had known before I had kids, I might have considered it.

Discuss everything with your doctor. It is not weird. They cannot help you with something you do not tell them about. Good luck. I do and I hate it If it bothers you or is causing you pain definitely talk with your doctor about it. They may want to take a look at it and have X-ray/scan done of it as well.

She is in her early 30s and her family is financially supporting her treatment, which includes having tumors removed weekly, sometimes more than once a week -- often at a cost of a couple hundred dollars each time. I am new to this community and have not done much research yet. Are there any foundations or groups that can assist with finances? Health insurance does not cover treatment, family has said. They have started a GoFundMe but I am not optimistic that will be helpful. Any advice at all - about the disease or support groups, financial assistance -- would be appreciated.  I have neurofibromatosis and my insurance covers my surgeries related to my neurofibromatosis, granted they would prefer I do it within the state of Michigan, but I was diagnosed 20 years ago by my specialist in Chicago and trust him, being the first surgery I had was done locally in Michigan, by a doctor who lied to my parents about having done surgeries on people with Neurofibromatosis, so my last three have all been done in Chicago by surgeons recommended by my specialist.\n\nAre the surgeries she is having done cosmetic? That is the only reason I can think of why insurance would not cover. My body is covered with tumors, but I only have surgeries that are absolutely necessary. Thank you. This seems helpful. I will share with my family.  From what I understand, most of her tumors have appeared in her head, near her eyes and in her brain -- both causing great pain and affecting her vision. It is always a quick out-patient procedure. I dont have much detailed information, but I believe she gets scanned daily and they monitor all the ones that show up, and remove them if they are causing immense pain and are in dangerous areas -- and if they can safely remove them. Then insurance should be covering it. However I am surprised that she is getting daily MRI scans, I have never heard of anyone getting them daily. My doctors only have had me have full body scans at least once a year if not every six months or when I am have a complication.\n\nHopefully she is able to figure out what is going on with the insurance \n\n Check out ctf.org (children's tumor foundation.) It has a bunch of info that may be able to help. You can also search Facebook for support groups. Search NF, neurofibromatosis, and schwannomatosis (spelling, sorry) and see what pops up. Maybe switch to an NF clinic for specialists. \n\nBest wishes  I have never actually heard of anyone getting tumors removed weekly.  I would think that the recovery, even for a simple neurosurgery is such that you want to space them out more than that.  It does seem like they should remove more tumors during longer operations instead of these quick outpatient procedures.  Of course, I could be totally misunderstanding the types of tumors/operations she is having. I have schwannomatosis, also in my early 30s. Currently have three tumors on my optic nerves. I cannot imagine having surgery every week. That sounds dangerous. I am not sure you have all your information right. Schwannomas grow on the nerve. There is no way anyone is having these removed weekly. You have to be put to sleep and operated on. Unless it is an emergency, no surgeon will put you under anesthesia that often. \n\nDoes this person maybe have NF1 and the tumours are superficial and just below the surface of the skin?  \n\nPerhaps you may want to look into the facts a little more carefully.  ", "Please wake up! I am not talking about neuropathy, pins and needles, or loss of sensation.  My question is, does anybody have a limb that feels like it is asleep?

The fucking leg is asleep. \n\nThe same thing is starting to happen with my right arm. This is the reason why I am going through chemo, and if this does not work, I am going to ask to try a stronger chemo.  \n\nI think surgery would be a waste of time at this point, because I am having problems in more than just one place on my body. Since September my right foot has been feeling like it is asleep, it also has a warming sensation going on. I do have tumors that have grown back on me cervical spine, but they are not pressing against my spine like that were over ten years ago. \n\nI would however be wary of chemo or radiation unless it is absolutely necessary, both can make neurofibromatosis worse. Right now my specialist is looking into getting me into a drug trail.", "Tremors? Does any one else have tremors? I have NF1 and have also had slight tremors but lately it is gotten much worse. I have had labs done before and everything was normal. I have had them on and off, oddly they were a lot worse years ago, in the early 2000s, but for some reason they stopped and no I was not put on any medication for it. I do take medication for pain and blood pressure. I have had a few surgeries, including one that was in 2006 or 2007 to remove tumors that were pressing against my cervical spine. I can only guess that maybe that was the root cause of the tremors I had. Before you go off the rails and get upset about it. I would ask if you are eating right and getting enough sleep. Also, caffiene and energy drinks can cause tremors as well. I was getting what I thought were tremors, but it was just too many energy drinks. I often times have hours or even days where my hands tremble. I also have nf type one. Never thought these could be connected I think I just may have benign tremors but it is gotten worse. I just always wonder if an odd symptom I am experiencing is related to my NF1. I am not followed by a neurologist because my case is pretty mild. I experience tremors when ever I am very nervous. I used to get them more frequently but not anymore since U drastically cut back on caffeine and quit smoking. Do you smoke or drink a lot of caffeine? Potassium from bananas and lemon water are good for the nervous system do you get enough potassium? I do not smoke and have cut back on caffeine. I probably do not get enough potassium. Worth a shot... do you stay hydrated? I do not know if any of this stuff is a fix. But it seems to help me.", "Has anyone had a tumor mistaken for a mastiod? Hey guys. This is a bit of an odd question. But I had an MRI a few months ago, and got the results back from it. Apparently they think I have a mastoid. Normally I would just be okay, and wait to see the ear/nose/throat doctor about it. But the thing is- this is what happened last time too. And the E/N/T doctor told me that I did not have a mastoid, and that the neurologist sends people to him for that all the time.  \n\nNot important to the question or anything, but I did not even find out about them thinking it was a mastoid from the neurologist, I found out through the anesthesiologist when I went to get top surgery. I actually still have not heard from the neurologist. My family doctor said he would contact the guy over a month ago, and yet here we are. \n\nAnyway. My question is; have any of you had this happen? What should I do? This has not happened to me before exactly. I have had tumors wrongly diagnosed. Not often but a few times so that can happen.\n\nIs it possible to find a new dr. Or get a second opinion? If the neurologist is not getting back to your pcp and has been wrong in the past i think that warrants finding a new neurologist. I did find a 2nd one a while ago. But that one does not work in my city anymore. We only have the one here. I have been meaning to ask my doctor if I can get recommended to one outside of the city I am in for years.  As both neurologist, and the only back doctor here have told me pain I have is caused by me being fat. And not scoliosis or any internal tumors I may have. I would ask your pcp for a referral to a differnt neurologist. Just tell them your not getting the care you require. You may have to go farther like you stated outside of your city. Its hard to find any doctor that knows about nf. On fb there are groups that you can search where you live to find drs That know about it. I hope you can find a good doctor. Dont be afraid to keep looking until you find a good fit. That can make all the difference in your health. Yeah. Like I said I have been wanting to do that for a while but I am scared to for some reason. You know? Like I do not want to seem like a bad patient and piss people off. I think if the neurologist sends me to the E/N/T again I will ask for a second opinion. \n\nI have an unrelated appointment at the Drs office today to get a testosterone injection. I will see if I can be brave enough to bring it up then. I can understand that, if you feel up to it I would bring it up. Honestly the dr. Cant say no if your in the USA anyway. I normally tell people if they forget to bring it up at an appointment or feel uncomfortable you can send an email to the doctor later to ask.  Best of luck. I hope you csn find a good fit.", "How often should you see an NF specialist? 36/m NF1 since birth So I was diagnosed with NF1 at birth or very shortly after that.  I remember as a kid seeing a specialist and/or a group of specialists?  I just remember having to travel over an hour to go have people poke and prod at me.  Anyway, when I hit puberty that is when I got my first neurofibroma tumor.  I have quite a lot more now but as long as I dont have pressure put directly on it, they dont bother me.  I get my eyes checked/dilated every year. \n\nMy question is, should I go see someone who specializes in NF every few years?  Is there anything as an adult that I should keep an eye out for? Like is there complications that can still arise?  I assume I am OK but came across an post or something recently that made me think back and I think the last time I saw a specialist was when I joined the military in Jan 2001.  \n\nGlad I found this sub as while I havent really needed any support, its nice to know there is a sub in case I do.  I see my specialist at least 1-3 times a year, I have yearly MRIs. I was diagnosed at 15, I am 35 now and have seen the same specialist ever since I was diagnosed.\n\nI have had four surgeries one in 2001 to remove tumors in lower right arm, another in either late 2006 or early 2007 to remove tumors pressing against cervical spine, one in 2014 to remove a cancerous tumors from my right upper leg, one in 2018 to remove cancerous tumors in right upper arm.  Do you have NF1 or NF2?  Was there something specific that let them know the tumor was cancerous?  All of mine are along nerves and most are just under the skin but not enough to where they raise my skin.   I have NF 1, I have having a lot of pain more than normal, with my leg a MRI they knew right away it was cancerous. With my arm, it was more difficult they could tell based off the MRI, I needed a biopsy for that one in order for them to tell.\n\nAll of mine are under the skin too, but many of them are raised. I have a large mass in my right leg still even after they removed the cancerous portion, they could not remove all of it otherwise I would have been left with a huge empty space in my leg that would not have been good. The tumor they removed from my arm last year was a bit bigger than an egg. ahh ok.. that makes me feel a little better.  All of mine are super small, probably under 1/2 inch long and even less wide. I think my biggest one was the first one I have an its in my calf.  It used to hurt anytime I brushed up against anything but as I matured and my muscles got bigger, its still there but the muscle sort of protects it.  \n\nThanks for responding btw You are welcome I have never gone to see a specialist.  I just sort of deal with pain and get used to it.  Is it worth seeing a specialist? How do you find one in your area?\n\nMy primary care physician game me some drugs that I take sometimes to help numb the pain but I only take them if it gets bad and not for more than a day or two.  this is a great tool to help find a doctor near you\n\n( See, I do not even have any real pain unless pressure is directly put on the tumors.  I never thought I needed to see a specialist but then again, I dont get regular checkups as often as I should. But, I realized that I hadnt been to a NF specialist in almost 20 years and realized I didnt have anyone to ask how often I should go or if I really needed to, which is why I asked here since I know every case is different.  I use to see my specialist at the cancer hospital in Houston, up until\nmy insurance no longer covered it. So last I saw an actual specialist was ten years ago.\nI have not noticed any new growths or new pains. So I assume nothing has changed.  I am 23. I get an MRI once a year, and then get it/myself examined by a specialist. I used to go more often when I was younger but things have stabilized since then.\n\nIt might be good to get an MRI to make sure there is nothing internal that can be a problem. Like even if you do not feel it, you can still have internal tumors and it is better to deal with them before they cause major issues if possible.\n\nI had surgery about a year and a half ago to remove an internal tumor that had grown at the recommendation of a specialist. It was not cancerous, but it had grown a few years back and they were observing it, and decided it should probably come out.\n\nI did not know I had it.\n\n&amp;#x200B; I used to see a specialist every year up until 18, then as needed. It went in stages based on what is more likely to occur, so checking for scoliosis during teenagers, then eye clinic for optic tumours etc. (I am in the UK and think this maybe standard NHS procedure).\n\nI started having dizzy spells at 13, so was given yearly MRIs after they found a mass on the back of my brain, this was followed up by a meeting with my main geneticist. \n\nNow i just see my regular GP, as and when, who has some basic knowledge of NF and contacts my local genetics nurse for more information as needed.\n My daughter just met with the NF team at our local children\u2019s hospital which is how I ended up diagnosed NF1 as well. They told me just to follow up with my primary doctor and have her do annual neurological exams and order screenings/tests as needed, as well as go for eye exams. Added on to that are mammograms starting at 30 for females, I do not know if they recommend earlier screenings for anything for men though.  yeah..I knew the eye doctor thing, which is the one doc I have been good about seeing yearly or at minimum every other year I saw my first NF specialist a few months ago at 31 and she did not say anything about early mammograms. Might just be case by case dependent.  Once a year with the neurologist, and since today, because everything is stable every two year for the neurosurgeon. NF1 since birth and have never seen an NF specialist. Granted my eye doctor growing up was familiar with NF so he knew about lisch nodules, I have never seen an actual specialist. I know I should, but I tend to scout out regular docs who are familiar with it. They just recently changed the recommendation about a year or 2 ago according to my daughter\u2019s geneticist. She said being a woman alone puts you at a risk and NF just increases it a bit.  The responses I am seeing here are \"I go X times a year\" and \"I have never seen one\"\n\nThe emphasis there should be on the \"I\". As I am sure you are aware, NF has a wide range of severity and not every patient has all of the symptoms. You can have one manifestation very severely and next to none of the next.\n\nPersonally I see a neurologist twice a year, a pain management doctor every few months, and a neurosurgeon if I have specific concerns or if not every 12-24 months for an MRI. My primary care doc is also aware of the condition and if I see her she asks about it, but does not activly treat me for it. \n\nIf you have any specific concerns (eg new or worsening symptoms) talk to your primary care doctor and they can recommend if it is appropriate to see a specialist.\n\nThat said an MRI every few years to monitor changes that you cannot feel is never going to be a bad idea. I have seen a neurological every year since I was diagnosed.  After an unrelated illness when I was 13, two spots in my brain where found after an MRI.  For a long time I had yearly MRIs, which were changed to every two years and now due to no change other than a slight reduction, they will be every three years unless something changes.\n\nI have a dermatologist I see when I need to and usually go to get some of the tumours removed at least once a year. The tumors that you mention,  are they not neourofibromas?  I am quite certain that is what they are... never had a specialist confirm that but they are along my nerves and move...they are also pretty much all less than 1/2 in\n I just found out a few years ago that I have NF1.  I found out because my children have it too.  My childrens Dr noticed the cafe brown spots on my daughter and ordered blood work for her.   I have yet to see a specialist,  I am in the process of filling out paperwork so I can schedule an appointment. I take them once a year to the NF1 clinic they hold at Texas Children's.   The Drs that see my children work for BCM.  And I am thinking about getting seen by one of the Drs there. I do have Neourofibromas and they are at minimum the size of a golf ball or slightly larger than that. Yeah I was seen yearly as a kid.  From my research as an adult, I learned that with NF1, if you are going to have complications it will be during childhood/puberty.  That Is when I started getting my neurofibromas.  I think I might have been taken to that clinic as a child.  All I know is once a year, we would drive a long way and then I would get seen by 4-5 doctors and do different tests and was poked and prodded and I have one memory of standing on the table in my underwear.  Wow, I have live with this my whole life and I am 36 now.  It was not up until like 3 years ago or so that I knew I had NF1 because my daughter which was several months old was diagnosed and then was tested for NF1.  Here in Houston the Drs at Baylor hold a clinic at Texas Children's Hospital. And she also gets seen by an ophthalmologist.  She has like 3 spots on the white of one of her eyes.  Looks like I need to a geneticist as soon as I can.                                        \n\nOne question though, do by any chance also have a heart murmur? I ask because both of my little ones have NF1 and also have a hear murmur.  Just curious if it is coincidence or just if it also relates to NF1. I was diagnosed as an infant.  I dont think it would have been noticed otherwise.  I never had any medical issues from NF besides the fibromas.  I did/do have ADHD but never took meds for it because I didnt like how they made me feel and I didnt want to try to get used to them.  No heart murmur.  The one thing I have been good about is seeing an ophthalmologist yearly because I know if they can find issues early it can be treated.  I am a lot worse about seeing a GP each year and as mentioned in my first post.  I havent seen a NF specialist in almost 20 years. ", "Kind Of random... Does anyone else experience more pain &amp; swelling than normal after having received an injection? My toddler was recently diagnosed &amp; she had vaccines yesterday &amp; her thighs seem to be really bothering her...walking slowly &amp; being very guarded of her legs. I was just wondering if there was a correlation since nerves are definitely involved when getting an injection. Having a child so young with NF1 is so hard because she can only communicate but so much, so everything feels like a guessing game. not particularly I am fine with needles tho For my son with NF1, I skipped and/or delayed the vaccines.  No point taking further health risks. Part of NF is a compromised immune system. I am medically exempt from certain live vaccines, but I will get every vaccine possible... I would not recommend that. Please vaccinate your kids, and talk to their doctor if you are worried there may be risks before entirely ruling out a recommended  vaccine. This is a very troubling conclusion to have reached. No.  I skip most vaccines and the few they have had were delayed by months and years.  Why would my conclusion be troubling?  The recommended shots schedule my American doctor advises is only used in America, which is 5% of the world population.  So 95% of the world is not talking to American doctors about an American vaccination schedule, which you are indirectly advising to me. My son experienced similar reactions with his shots. I did not want to skip any because of the fact that he already has a compromised immune system so we modified his vaccine schedule. He has had all the vaccines, but he never gets more than one injection at a time. We space them out by at least 4 weeks. For example when it was time for him to get his 2yr shots he got the MMR then in 4 weeks he received his HIB. I cannot remember the others but we went back a couple more times. It is inconvenient for sure but he seems much more comfortable and that is worth it. Since we started it he has not had any problems other than a very slight fever with one of them. See, I feel *not* vaccinating is a health risk...not only to my child, but to those around her who are also immunocompromised. Agree to disagree\ud83d\ude43 Thank you so much for your response! I am 100% pro vax, so not vaccinating is definitely not an option, but a modified vax schedule I am down with. I am glad to hear spacing them out helped your son. She is bounced back now &amp; is getting around just fine, aside from the clumsiness that comes along with NF1.\n\nIf you do not mind, may I ask what you &amp; your son\u2019s life has been like with NF1 so far? My daughter has 2 fibromas, but they are very small &amp; not a concern at this time. The main symptoms she is currently displaying (other than the cafe ol\u00e9 spots &amp; clumsiness) are more behavioral. She does not like to be touched, including being washed during bath time, &amp; her tantrums are like the terrible 2\u2019s on steroids. I know this is a tough age as it is, so it is hard to separate what is normal from what is NF1 related. She also has difficulty with swallowing, meaning she gags &amp; vomits very easily &amp; can not tolerate certain textures, such as bananas. Her neuro would like for her to do speech therapy to strengthen the muscles involved, but so far, that is the only plan in place. I appreciate any experience you are willing to share! Sure, but feelings do not matter to me when it comes to protecting my children.  I read the packaging insert paperwork that comes with vaccinations, study the data from World Health Organization, etc. My son was on reflux meds until he turned 4. He will be 5 in 2 weeks. He also gagged and vomited a ton. He is very clumsy also!  We do toddler yoga daily. He loves it. His behavior is his biggest issue. He is my third child (fifth I have raised) and by far the most difficult. Intellectually he is great, but emotionally he is very delayed. He acts more like a 2yr old. Temper tantrums are ridiculous. Glad you vaccinate. Feel free to ask anything.", "Derm said new-mutation neurofibromatosis is usually less severe. I cannot find anything about that online though. Is it true? Pretty much just title No, I do not think so. Nf1 has around 3500 mutations and a phenotype has been established for maybe 12 of them or so. We know that the location of the mutation can be an indicator of severity, so for example individuals carrying constitutional missense variants affecting one of 5 neighboring NF1 codons Leu844, Cys845, Ala846, Leu847, and Gly848, located outside of the central GAP-Related Domain known to downregulate Ras-GTP to Ras-GDP, have a high prevalence of a severe phenotype, including plexiform and symptomatic spinal neurofibromas, symptomatic optic pathway gliomas, malignant neoplasms as well as bone abnormalities .  Micro deletion will also have a more severe phenotype, since several more genes are involved. \n\nUp until recently the genetic test was quite expensive and only done in Korf's lab and would be used scarcely in many countries in the world, especially when following the old (and outdated) criteria, and parents would be told to wait for the emergence of the second criteria needed. In severe cases, such as tibial dysplasia, plexiform neurofibroma, optic glioma, the genetic test would be deemed unnecessary because Nf1 had been diagnosed on clinical criteria.  Therefor we do no know which mutations the severe cases have unless they are involved in a research project. Severe cases are not tested.   Genetic counsellors advise parents against testing  telling them a test would not bring answers. \n\nNow that the gene test price has dropped significantly for just a few hundred $ and is widely available, combined with pressure from  parents reading about caf\u00e9 au lait spots on the internet to diagnose their children, the test is used more and more, and new variants are continuously been identified. If the individual had not performed the test, they might never have been diagnosed since many of our manifestations are unclear. \n\nBottom line, there is a stronger consensus that we have a higher frequency than previously thought and that we are closer to a 1/2000 incidence instead of the previous rate given \n\n( \n\nBy testing more people, we are discovering more mutations. It does not mean they are less severe than old mutations, given the current tendency to only test when there is doubt. A severe case would not warrant a genetic test. This is why the new criteria push for a wider genetic testing. \n\nIt is also clearer now that our disease should not be classified based on neurofibromas only since they represent a mere 35% of our complications even if they are the most impactful on daily quality of life. Up until recently the severity was rated based on the number of neurofibromas, yet would ignore the brain tumours, bone issues, cognition and so on. Our life expectation is affected regardless of the number of neurofibromas. \n\nIf you look at the Pearson twins, identical twins, same DNA, same Nf1 mutation, extreme difference in manifestations. If you look at Neil, you might think, he does not have a severe case compared to his brother Adam, until you consider cognition and brain function as well. Great video on them here ( \n\nIt is also that the severity of a mutations is dependent on the microenvironment and other factors, such as the recent confirmed involvement of the T-cells. \n\nI could go on forever on why I think your dermatologist is incorrect (and problem ill informed) but to make it short. You test when in doubt, in severe cases, there is no doubt, but no test on severe cases means also no mutations to compare. So would it be beneficial at all to test myself, even if I have been diagnosed for several decades? \nIt might or might not say anything about the severity, but at least they might get some extra data? Nobody collects the data. \n\nI would love to see a more advanced version of the NF registry which allows for more details, and cross referencing with mutations, with a request to update every 10 years, adding the new manifestations or a worsening of some. \n\nThe NF1 registry is horrible and vague . There is a possibility to upload my test, but not to type it , nor try search for people with my mutation. \n\nIt comes down to money which is very scarce for nf1 research and also very redundant and repetitive. There is not a global transnational will to look deeper into this. Finland is great about nf1 data. The research on cancer came from them and now is confirmed worldwide. They are now raising the alarm about dementia, so better to take early action for prevention. Database will use the Mendelian classification of  standard terminology as being \u201cpathogenic,\u201d \u201clikely pathogenic,\u201d \u201cuncertain significance,\u201d \u201clikely benign,\u201d or \u201cbenign.\u201d  \nSo far, with the few exceptions of research studies or initiatives such as the Stanford one, there is no phenotyping of the mutations. Researchers and epidemiologist have been calling and shouting for more detailed and additional genetic, clinical work up with a collaboration between the clinical laboratory, the health care provider and families to improve variant classification and description.  A whole chapter in the new Nf1 book calls for more molecular diagnosis and data. \n\nThere is not a follow up and updating of evolution of the manifestations, their numbers and severity. When I was 20 I had maybe ten neurofibromas. At 45  hundreds, so depending when you tested me, my mutation could be very mild or not mild.  Now past 50, I am very mild again, so my mutation responds well to the microenvironment and no attention in any database is given to that. \n\nNew mutations are tested in young people when their symptoms are mild. If a child has a a sphenoid wing dysplasia and a plexiform, they do not test, because it is evident it has NF1. On the Australian health page it says :  \"Even though NF1 is a genetic condition, genetic testing is not used to diagnose the condition, as it is not widely available and is expensive. Children at risk of having NF1 will have signs of the condition by the age of five.  \"  They will not know the mutation of that kid with a tibial dysplasia and CALs because she will not be tested. \n\nIn addition to that, it is well documented that the care for children with NF1 is great and then fades into nothing or difficult once they become adult. They struggle to find a doctor. How their mutation evolves from when it was identified is completely forgotten . I talked to the husband of a woman with NF1 who died of a heart attack caused by a undetected pheochromocytoma, a well known but totally ignored complication of Nf1. Nobody is going to add the pheo to her mutation.  Pheochromocytoma are not even listed in the databases. \n\nThe most famous one, the Nf1 registry is very vague, does not include any of the manifestations highlighted in the last decades, or for variations of theses.   I do not have a single CAL but have weird  and very dark hyperpigmentation. So how do I answer the NF1 registry question do you have CALs, yes or no ? I did not have scoliosis but kyphosis as a child. So again, yes or no , to the question have you ever been diagnosed with scoliosis....yes?no?  You cannot add your mutation, but only upload the file with the test result, but how is it ross-referenced then.  I cannot research people with my mutation. The NF1 gene is a tumour suppressor gene but many non-tumoral phenotypes can be present and they are not contemplated in this kind of database.\n\nI was tested at UAB. The sheet that accompanied my blood had zero info on it . I saw it , I was there, I asked to see it.  I am no longer in the care of the same doctor so in the improbable hypothesis my doctor did create a file for me, he has no way of knowing how nf1 is evolving for me and my mutation. \n\nThere are initiatives and attempts, I agree with that. In my view the system is imperfect and will not bring a genotype=phenotype as it is. \n\nHappy to be corrected. Hopeful to be corrected. Well said re the NF registry.  They are a gateway, not an end point.  We are currently involved in multiple research projects that have all reached us via this registry.  I try to enroll in any research that we can reasonably participate in so that we can be a part of helping to improve knowledge.  One that we are in currently is identifying the specific gene mutations of participants and tracking them over time to see what trends, if any, there are in the long term in order to see if specific mutations are indicative of any particular progression over time.  \nI encourage all to register and to participate in the studies that reach out as you are able.  It is a great way to help the entire community.", "25 and have not seen a specialist I was born with NF1 and have tumors littered throughout my body. I noticed, though, that they are getting worse. This kind of frightens me. \n\nI have never seen a specialist for this condition (money issues) and besides a brain MRI (clear except the optic nerve), I have never had any tests done. \n\nI am finally making an appointment at NYU as I finally have health insurance through my dad\u2019s job until July.  What I want to know is, what can arise from untreated/unmonitored Neurofibromatosis? I just do not want to go in there with a \u2018it will not happen to me\u2019 attitude, if that makes sense. \n\nSome info that may be informant\nI am 25 y/o Caucasian female who inherited the condition from my mom (whose quite ill.) I have Crohn\u2019s disease and receive Entyvio through a medical study at no cost to me. Otherwise have not been diagnosed with anything (but have not seen any doctors so...)  I have NF1 and have two checkup a year. And a MRI scan every 16/18 months just to monitor it. \n\nI have large plexiforms (the growths) on my face and have started taking a Selfie-A-Day of them to monitor how they are growing this is little project I am doing on my own.\n\nI would make a list of all the things you would like to take about as I forget then I get to the hospital.\n\nHope everything works out okay when you go to NYU.\n\nMy experience is based on NHS in the UK\n\n I was diagnosed when I was 15 and have been seeing the specialist who diagnosed me for the last twenty years. I have tumors all throughout my body. This can effect everyone differently some people have a light or mild case, while other have a more serve case. My doctor feels I am in the more serve case.\n\nBy not seeing someone and have regular MRI, you can be putting yourself at risk for not have your tumor progress monitored. These tumors can continue to go in both size and numbers, and can cause problems depending on where they are growing. \n\nSeveral years back I had tumors crushing against my cervical spine, thanks to regualr MRI scans this was found out. Otherwise if they were not caught or removed I could have woken up one morning unable to get out of bed.\n\nOther things that can unfortunately happen to some is these tumors can turn cancerous, I have had this happen to me twice. In 2014 I had a cancerous tumors removed from my upper right leg. They were able to remove the cancerous parts of the tumors, unfortunately they could not remove all of the mass. I still have a large mass.\n\nThen in 2018 of last April I had a cancerous tumor removed from my upper right arm. This one required a biopsy, because they could not tell based off the MRI. There was also concerned based on how the tumor was wrapped around the nerves that I might have lost use of my right hand. Thankful they did not happen.\n\nRight now the tumors have grown back on my cervical spine, but are not not pressing/crushing against it right now, so were keeping an eye on it.\n\nThere are other risk, especially if you have a lot of headaches. I always get asked about headaches when ever I see my specialist, but I am not having any out of ordinary then a plain old headaches. But there are risks for people with neurofibromatosis where tumors can grow on our brain and cause problems.\n\nIf you have any questions please ask away. I hope I did not frighten you, but felt I should be honest about my condition and why it is important for me to see my specialist on a regular bases.  Please do not freak out, but not having a Specialists can be really harmful to your health. \n\nYou could have not necessary misdiagnoses but not have the right kind of tests to catch everything that could potential happen to you.\n\nTumors in unexpected places. \n\nI was diagnose with NF1 at birth and did not have the first real problem until Six when the school nurse did the Scoliosis Health Check . My curve was pretty bad and I had health insurance through my Parent's  Work (military) and was able to monitor the curve of the spine; but my Parent was getting out and so went the health insurance. \n\nNow Military Doctors are notorious for being bad and the Pediatrician on I had was bad and not a Specialists in NF1.\n\nHe told my Parents that I should not curve anymore and everything was all good. It was not and within three years I would have major surgery to correct the spin to basically save my life. \n\n\\\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs an Adult I had lost my insurances and could  not monitor my decease like I should be capable of doing, plus at the time this is a Preexisting Condition making Insurance very difficult to obtain.  As result I had many complication that resulted in an emergency visit and emergency surgery to remove a tumor.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTry to take this year to find an insurance that will take you to keep up with your care; in the meantime take full advantage of what you have until it runs out.  Do not be frighten this disease is manageable with the right care at times and you can live a full life. \n\nGood Luck and Take Care. \n\n&amp;#x200B; All of this advice is great and exactly what I wanted to say, but it is also important to note that if you do not receive regular MRIs to monitor your progress, you will not qualify for any studies or experimental procedures that you may be interested in down the road (if that is what you care to do). \n\nI lost my qualification for a medical study using low doses of chemo the day before it started because it turned out my MRIs were not done consistently in the past. The study required annual films, so I was dropped. \n\nJust something to consider to potentially make future-you have an easier time. \n\nI hope everything works out! NYU is a great choice; I have been going there for my specialist my whole life. (23 y/o female) I used to go every 3 to 4 months when I was little. Now I go once a year for a brain/spine scan.\n\nI do not know what kind of complications can arise from unmonitored NF since it is different for everyone. \n\nThe issue with your NF not being monitored is that you could be at risk for having a harmful tumor in a place you cannot see. And NF should be monitored because tumors can go bad at any time, They might catch something that you did not know about because it is internal and was not bothering you before. Or they might recommend getting some tumors removed.   \n\nIt is different for everyone.\n\nI have been monitored throughout my childhood and while most things have not changed; they did catch a that an internal tumor grew and determined it needed to be removed. It was not causing me harm at the time, but they took out to reduce the risk in the future (and make sure it was benign.

I know the tumour(s) are benign but that fraction of a chance they will turn malignant, scares me. Is it worth the money getting them cut out? Is it worth the risks? What makes it worse is that I have no one to talk about it with. I am the only person that I know with NF1, and it does not help to have a completely disconnected and unsupportive mother who could not think twice about you.\n\n\nI still remember in school being called names like *Spot the Dog* or *Connect the Dots* because of all the horrible, nasty cafe au lait spots. I do not want these spots. They do not make me special. They make me ugly and I look like someone threw hundreds and thousands at me. I hate it. I cannot bare to look in the mirror because all I see are spots. \n\nThis is just driving me insane. NF1 does not make me special. It does not make me unique. It makes me a walking, spotted, potentially cancerous idiot. I wish that I never was diagnosed with it. But wishes are dreams, and dreams are pretend.", "question on online dating... ", "NF1 and talking My two year old son was diagnosed with NF1 around 6 months ago. He not talking yet at all just mostly babbling. (We have him in speech therapy) \n\nCould NF1 be a contributing factor in him talking late? It is possible as Neurofibromatosis effects everyone differently. It would be best to discuss with your sons doctor. I was diagnosed with Neurofibromatosis when I was 15, but it was always believed I had it, but test results were always inconclusive.\n\nIf you have any questions let me know. I have had it since I was around 6 as well and mom just never took me to the dr for it because she said she did not see a need for it because \u201cyou cannot get rid of it\u201d \n\nSo I am so lost on how it can effect me and him.  His doctor keeps bringing up things like autism but I believe I have read some where that NF could show autistic like traits. My son did not start until he was 3 and a half, and we found later he has a pretty significant learning delay as well. Get him in early education and intervention asap I have not heard anything about that with autism. I have been seeing my Neurofibromatosis specialist since the day he diagnosed me, he never mentioned anything about that to either my parents or myself. I am sorry your mom did not take your condition serious enough. While yes you cannot get rid of it, unfortunately it can cause a lot of problems. I have had four surgeries related to my Neurofibromatosis, one was done as a precaution, while the other three needed to happen. \n\nThere is good news though, the fda recently approved a drug that can help shirk the tumors. It is only approved for children right now, but my doctor is hoping to get me on it sometime in 2021. I need to have a number of tests done and then hopefully after that I will be able to be put on it. \n\nAnyways, if you have any more questions, let me know. Do you know the name of the drug so I can mention it to his doctor Do not know if there was a correlation, but I was born with NF1 (diagnosed before I was one) and I could not talk until I was almost 4. I did have to go through speech therapy all through out elementary school (from age 3/4 to almost 12), I am now 21 and I am fine for the most part except when I start talking fast.  Yea my son has NF1 and he spoke in his own babble language until he was 5/6. He needed intensive speech therapy. But he is extremely eloquent  now, if that makes you feel better. Sorry about your mother. I was diagnosed and my mother did the same when I was 5.\nMy 2 sons both have nf1 and both have autism. The younger 1 was diagnosed at 1.5 y . he is 7 now and only really started talking in complete sentences at around 5.5/ 6. \nI had the same question about nf having asd like symptoms and the Drs told me yes. To me, having both diagnosis does not matter. You will end up going to Regional Center and getting more resources. Later if he grows out of it, they could always put it as being misdiagnosed with ASD.  Thank you You are welcome That is pretty amazing. I was diagnosed when I was a baby with NF1. I also did not speak until I was almost 3, and even then minimally. Do not be to concerned, some people just speak late. If you are concerned speak to his doctor and see what they say Yes it is I have NF1 and I was very early to talk and very late to walk. So much so that I would discuss with my mom about how I wanted to keep crawling. More anecdotal evidence for you: I have NF1 and was talking by 2. I would say yes, according to my medical records I did not start speaking to late 3 early 4. It said I communicated by babbling or using my hands by pointing Yes, NF1 can cause speech delays.  Someone else linked to CTF which is extremely helpful.  \nHere is another link to there that is specifically about learning difficulties with NF1.  Keep in mind how variable presentation is with NF.  ( It absolutely can contribute to speech delay, other developmental delays,, learning disabilities, ADHD, and other cognition and psychological challenges.

I have always had several easily visible brown specks in my green irises, and have had a few routine eye exams with an optometrist and an ophthalmologist... If my brown spots were lisch nodules, would they have been able to tell? Would i know by now? \n\nOr is that a special test that is only done if they are specifically looking for neurofibromatosis Neurofibroma is genetic or spontaneous mutation. Which category you come under, check it yourself.\n\nClick some close up picture, date it and keep it for reference if there is any change you can know it. A regular eye exam to my knowledge will show the lisch nodules. An optometrist would use a slit lamp to determine if they are lisch nodules, or just regular pigmentation. I would think they would say something by now, but it cannot hurt to ask about it next time you go in. Yes they do any regular eye doctor or regular MD should recognize this and refer you for further testing. Depends. I had multiple eye exams over the course of decades by both ophthalmologists and optometrists, including one I specifically went to asking to look for Lisch nodules while I was waiting for a genetic test result, and they were never detected. \n\nThen after my positive test, I was sent to an ophthalmologist specialising in Nf1 and he was able to detect them. Freckles of the eyes and Lisch nodules are different in their shape. I also also green/brown eyes, which apparently makes it harder to detect. What is the difference in shape? A Lisch nodule is dome-shaped growth whereas a freckle will lie flat on the iris as they have no mass. Okay, so lisch nodules will look like a 3 dimensional bump. Thanks I personally dont think most optometrists would know about NF1 so no. The most recent guy i saw was a really well known, highly regarded ophthalmologist.

If that makes any Sense... I have had three confirmed thus far. One removed (about the size of a mutant lemon), and two are being watched. Curcumin is helpful, turmeric powder is great source of curcumin. In the ( they only had 3 people on the combination of both curcumin with the Med diet. They found a reduction in both cutaneous and internal neurofibroma volume for the people who ingested a combination of both, but no change for the people who took either one or the other. Other studies that I have read for tumor reduction without NF, have shown that people can take up to a couple of grams without adverse effects (mainly gastro problems or issues with not wanting to take high volume of pills). I have seen a few of studies about tumor volume with around 1800 mg as the amount of curcumin. They suggest that it is the combination of both curcumin with the higher volume of polyphenols that the Mediterranean diet contains, that make the combination work so well with NF. \n\nI have a mild case of NF, and have taken curcumin from 1400-2250mg for the past two years. I do not consistently stay on the Med diet, but during the times that I have, I felt like I have done better.

I went to a surgeon in Pennsylvania.  Did you have to make a special claim for it to be covered or did you just walk in and asked them to remove it and they just simply covered it? whenever i called they asked me if it was medical or cosmetic, i told them what it was for (NF and explained they were tumors)  they were extremely nice about it and said that would fall under medical.  Not any doctor should be removing these tumors. The tumors are tangled in your nerve. The first surgery I had done was by a doctor who lied to my parents saying he had removed these types of tumors.

I have tried a bunch of different meds over the past year for pain associated with my plexiform neurofibroma (gabapentin, nortripyline, Cymbalta, Lyrica) but none of them worked for me. My neurologist suggested I give cannabis a try. Anyone have product recommendations? Not looking to get high, and I do not want to smoke, so probably looking for an edible or tincture. There are medicine with canabiss that does not have the \"funny\" effects  because they have the \"painkiller\" component *( cannabidiol (CDB) )* and doen't have the  adictive and psychotropic effect (*tetrahidrocannabinol (THC) ).*  Ask your doctor if he can give you. I think is better than cannabis because the dose is more controled and have only the positive effects of cannabis.\n\nAnd remember,  some people say that cannabis *(joints, the THC component)* is not dangerous, but can \"wake\" mental disorders that you have latents. I am not a antijoint warrior, but I think is good have all the information before make a choice :) I use Wyld 20:1(CBD:THC) for day time. And for the last week Tasty's Sleepy Blackberry 1:1:1(THC:CBD:CBN). Was doing Gr\u00f6n before for night, but the store has been out. The CBN helps with sleep. The Wyld I can feel a little but overall it is not that bad. And the sleep one's I am out for, super nice to not wake with pain.\n\nBut talk with the employee's at the dispensary. They will be able to point you in the right direction. There are also oils and lotions; I use an oil stick at night and carry one that is almost like a chapstick size to work. I cannot say whether cannabis will work or not, I have taking hydrocodone and tramadol for pain and that helps me with every day pain. Thanks! Do oils and lotions only work very locally, or are they effective for more widespread pain in your experience? The person I spoke with at a dispensary did actually mention a brand of lotions. They only seem to work locally and only help a little, but sometimes that is all I needed. Hey, you just gave a good amount of dangerous disinformation about Marijuana. THC is not an addictive chemical compound and cannot \"wake\" mental disorders. That is just a misconception due to many people starting to smoke in their teens or early twenties, which happens to coincide with when most of those are typically identified and diagnosed &gt;hemical compound and cannot \"wake\" mental disorders.

There are not problem with medicinal cannabis and for the doctors is \"easy\" suggest because you can buy. Some doctor suggest, but you know. THe risk's percepcion is different between different doctors. After using ALL of the medications you mentioned my daughter started having Ketamine infusions and oral Ketamine tablets for break thru pain. After several years the infusions became less effective so the pain doctor encouraged her to use CBD products instead of chemicals. She uses CBD  oils and mixes them with epsom salts and soaks most days. Sometimes she also uses creams. The main problem is the products are so so costly in our state. Make sure you actually go to a Cannabis doctor and go to a dispensary as opposed to just any old CBD that you see at a store. I have been using the Feel Collection from the Rise dispensary....they opened a new dispensary near me which I will be going to as soon as I get my card renewed.....\n\nGo to the dispensary and tell them about your pain concerns and what you are looking for. For me it is sleep, energy, and pain. They are well-versed in their products, and most actually to classes to learn about cannabis. They can provide recommendations...the cannabis doctor can usually do the same. May I ask what kind of pains are you going through? I have this pins and middle, numbing, extreme sensitive to touch like pain. I take lyrica. 3x a day(not really helping). And yes, time to time I do take a drags of the cannabis oil. It helps on its own way, putting me in this relaxing state. The pain tho, does not go away. I have used marijuana in the past for pain, but just for transparency I am a huge fan either way. \n\nIt definitely helps. The CBD-heavy strains are best for pain. I have never tried a CBD-only strain, tho I have tried CBD tinctures/edibles and I found them to be \"good, not great\".\n\nLook into a dry herb vaporizer. I am currently using ( which has been amazing. They heat up the plant material to the point where the trichomes (little mushroom-shaped crystals if you look through a microscope at weed) are vaporized but the actual plant material is not combusted, so there is no carcinogens/smoke/etc. Plus when you are done with the current load in the vape you can save it up and cook with it! It is a mix: sometimes stabbing, sometimes stinging, sometimes aching. One of my toes is extremely, extremely sensitive to touch.

Being right handed ..you can imagine how annoying life can get. This mix of pain just started happening a year and a half ago. I always thought it is because of my weight gain? Or maybe because of my weight gain it is causing one of the neurofibromas to press on one of the nerves? Neways.. thanks for sharing :) I have nf and smoking weed has completely made my back pain and pain from the neurofibromas go away. If you look on leafly you can find specific strains both THC and CBD to help with certain things (pain, anxiety, hunger, etc)! white runtz is my fav strain so far I can vouch for Rise/GTI products.

What do you think, what removal technique would make the smallest scar? Surgical, freezing,laser? Ask your doctor CO2 laser will leave a white spot on the location of the neurofibroma. You can see an example of the white scar it will leave behind here ( last picture on the right. \n\nMy understanding is that surgical incision offers the best cosmetic result but is not doable when you have multiple neurofibromas to remove. For a  single neurofibroma, it is however probably the best solution. I would go with a plastic surgeon or a specialised dermatologist. I had two small surgeries on my face,  one performed by a plastic surgeon (no scarring as he went through hairline) and the other by a specialised dermatologist ( invisible scar unless I point it to you) . They know how to cut to minimise scarring, how to stitch avoiding the classical ladder. \n\nDepending where you live, you health insurance might refuse to pay unless you have it remove for pain, possibly also intolerable pruritus, but pain is a safer guess.  If asked \"why\" you want it removed, answer \" it hurts\" (when rubbing with trousers, sitting, walking, ...) \n\nGood luck The dermatologists here do not remove fibromas,they send you to surgeons, who do not use laser or freezing. Only docs, who are not covered by insurance do laser and other techniques but you have to pay for consultation. \nMaybe someone here had a same sized fibroma who can tell me how big scar he/she had after the removal. I had a tumor on my left thigh, and they had to remove it surgically. For me the tumor was to big and left a concave type scar. \n\nTalk to your doctor and surgeon to see if they can do it laparoscopically. 7mm might allow for a laparoscopic procedure, might be a hair too big. \n\nUnfortunately, I do not think the removal of tumors can be done with freezing them or lasering them off. \n\nIf you are looking for a great surgeon, feel free to PM me. That would be best to ask a surgeon who is familiar with Neurofibromatosis. There are places that will shave them off and that does not really leave a scar. However, it does not get the root of the fibroma so they will grow back eventually. Getting them cut out at the root so they will not grow back in that exact same spot will always leave a small scar. If you are diligent about scar cream though, they should not be too bad. It is really a matter of would you rather chance them growing back or have scars. I work in the NF community so I know it can be a personal choice. Some people do not care if they eventually grow back because they have so many anyways and getting them shaved off is easier. Others would rather get them at the root while they can, even though it is only a tiny spot they cannot grow back, they feel better about it and would rather have a scar. Also, maybe that fibroma is particularly painful. You just have to weigh the options. Thank you for your answer! Thank you for your answer! Thank you for your answer! you are welcome I have only ever that removed surgically. 99% of the time I am out of the hospital same day.\n\nBut as other people said ask your doctor You are welcome! I have had some removed myself and am getting more removed next month by getting them cut out. The woman I went to uses a laser like tool that cuts them at the root and cauterizes the wound at the same time so it is faster. It does leave a slight white scar that is slightly raised. How noticeable the scars are also depends on how big/deep the fibromas were and the location as well. I have a few that you cannot even tell they were there and some were you can see some marks. Silicone scar cream really helps reduce the scars.", "Tubal Ligation or Endometrial ablation for NF1? So I have got a question for women with NF1, and or doctors (if they are on here?). I do not plan to ever have children by birth, both due to my own reasons and more so due to NF1. I know pregnancy can cause you NF to get even worse, and there is a strong chance the child will also have it. So because of that, I want tubal ligation. But, I know there is basically no doctor who would do it for an unmarried woman with no kids. Do you think my specialist would encourage it if I wanted it? I talked to her recently and she told me all the risks of a pregnancy with NF. I am young, (19) but I truly do not want children unless I adopt later in life. Is it even possible to have my tubes tied even later when I am married with 0 kids? /r/childfree has a list of providers that are more willing to do sterilization. A specialist will generally support what you want to do. I used donor eggs to conceive a NF-free baby. If there is no one near you who will do a tubal,  you could consider an IUD as a longer term option. I had a tubal ligation at 23, single and no kids. That was 15 years ago.\n\nYou may have to give it a couple of tries to find the right doctor, but they exist. You deserve to make that choice for your own body.\n\nAnother person mentioned the resources at r/childfree and they really are excellent. They have guides to getting a surgeon to agree to do the surgery, lists of such surgeons, and they are a really supportive community for any questions/concerns you might have.\n\nI wish you the best of luck. thank you so much! I appreciate the help. I was worried people would judge me for wanting this done so young. Some people might, but I personally have not run into many. I chose to get sterilized largely because of medical reasons too, and later once I got married we decided to be child free. Getting my tubal ligation was one of the best decisions I have ever made.\n\nJust remember that people judging you do not understand your reality and reasons for making your choices. And, you do not have to explain or justify yourself to anyone. Whether or not you decide to adopt or have kids in a different way in the future, your reproductive decisions are valid and no one else's business.\n\nIt is a big choice. It is okay to take all the time you need to make it, especially since there are other forms of effective contraception you can use in the meantime. But if you are confident sterilization is right for you, do not second-guess yourself just because you are young.\n\nTake care friend. Something about an IUD just makes me cringe, the pain of putting it in, taking it out, the risks it may have... But I know everything has its risks. I just feel the surgery would be the best route for me to take. I did not have the intent to question you getting the tubal. But just if you are in a medically underserved area, it is a stopgap measure. Hey feel free to message me more. I am a 25F in Minnesota and I scheduled my tubal ligation and will be having it in October. I have been asking for one since I was 19. I found an OB who was in full support for me to get one. I saw your comment about the IUD, I left the same way. I have one child, but I had a tubal ligation after she was born. My doc was fine with it. This is a struggle for everyone with NF, I believe. There are multiple options for having a child, and it does not necessarily have to be biological. Adoption is a great option. If that is the path you choose for medical reasons, then there should be a specialist willing to assist you in your journey. \n\nYou can still potentially have a biological child if you choose to. One option is to do this via in-vitro (they can isolate the NF gene and then test the egg to ensure you would not be passing the gene on to the child) However, this does not mean there is no risk to you as the mother, which I am sure your physician told you about. So while your child may be fine, you could still deal with increased tumor growth, high blood pressure and other health issues. Another option, would be to have a surrogate (if you know someone willing to do this for you or go through an organization that helps families find reputable surrogates). They would still be able to test the egg, ensure the child would be NF free and then still have a child if you choose to do so.\n\nWhatever you choose, it is your choice and the doctors should not judge you or try to talk you out of your decision. You need to do what is right for you and your health. Hope you find a physician that is able to help.", "Exsperience with steroid shots for neurofibroma? I have a neurofibroma on my L4-L5 spinal nerve root. It causes pain from hip to knee and makes me walk with a limp. After seeing 3 neurosurgeons it is been determined that surgery at this point would do more harm than good. The proposed solution is getting steroid shots for the pain. Of course I got this news right before the long weekend. \ud83d\ude29\n\nHas anyone in here had a similar treatment? Needles dont scare me so I am not worried about that. I am just curious what to expect.  Will I need to do physical therapy? \nI had a steroid shot and some PT for some muscle atrophy in my upper arm last year.\nIt would be pretty awesome if PT was part of treatment since my insurance covers it. I dont know what any of that is honestly. They were going to send me to a neuro oncologist but opted to do steroid shots instead. I actually still have not heard from the clinic yet.", "Glioma Recovery Good evening, all!\n\nI have been plagued by one particular glioma under my right ring fingernail for some time. It is at a point where I am going to have it removed. The tumor is small, but growing under the nail, the pressure is intense. (3mm). I have had tumors removed all over my body with no issues... but this one makes me wonder. What can I expect from recovery? It is minor - outpatient. But I need my hands for my job.\n\nBest case scenario would be they remove the nail and it feels about like having an ingrown toenail fixed and then cutting out the tumor which should be painless. At least initially. ;-)\n\nI have gliomas under at least three other fingernails, so I am hoping this is the only one I need to get done.\n\nThanks in advance. :-)", "Marijuana for pain management Does anyone else use Marijuana for pain? I have been using it for the past few years. RSO can do wonders!\n\nAlso, anyone else in the Denver area? It is very rare to meet someone else who has NF here it feels like or at least someone willing to admit it. Not in Denver but I used to. It helped to an extent but the overall side effects I got just were not worth It. I hated feeling \"high\" and it just overall made me sad and depressed. Plus the smell is something awful. If I were to do it again I would stick to edibles with a higher CBD concentrate. Though I see where it is beneficial for others. Just not for me. \n\nI honestly got the best pain management from exercising. Going for walks/runs has done wonders for me. I use these pain medications for my pain management for my neurofibromatosis \n\nHyrocodone I take this twice a day\n\nTramadol I take this twice a day\n\nDuloxetine I take this once a day, this one is basicly a nerve blocker\n\nI still have some pain, some days are better then others. My neurofibromatosis doctor whose in Chicago has never talk about Marijuana with me, but I most likely would not take it even if it were an option. I am currently in chicago as well.  The last time I talked to my doctor he actually said he would not sign off on the legal card for me. My girlfriend has NF and just tried it for the first time with positive results. She told me she was able to rest without pain and fall asleep much more easily. Hearing this brought so much joy to my heart. These things can be basically impossible for her sometimes. We are going to look into getting her a medical marijuana card. Everyday It is seriously a wonder drug, just make sure you know how each strain effects you before trying to do anything on it. Different strains are very different. Try to find a hybrid strain that is not too strong, you are still going to want to function somewhat normally. most doctors womt sign off in it, the people who run clincs or hospitals  cant mame money off it..  you need to find a special marjuana doctor to do it. majority of time insurance will not cover it and it is still cash only business Is there any reason you would not try? I personally prefer it to opioids, I am\nStill able to function normally, it is not hard on my body, and I feel better. The only down side is needing to get off of it to apply for jobs. I am not opposed to other people using it for medical reasons, but I just prefer not to use it. It can make you high, and feel weird, and for some people it can cause you to lean toward harder drugs. I have been taking hyrocodone for 10 years and it is been working just fine for me. It does not make me feel high or weird or bother me in anyway Ok, I was just genuinely curious. I used it to get off of pills for similar reasons you do not want to try marijuana. OxyContin has been a problem for me in the past, I try to avoid pain pills and stick with something healthier and natural.  OxyContin was what they first gave me for at home use, it was fine the first day, but the second and third day it made me feel dizzy and sick to my stomach. I said I wanted what was given to me in the hospital after I had surgery and that ended up being what I am taking now. No side effects at all. Oxy may work for some people, but it was way too much for me. I guess because it is a lot newer then Vicodin it is more powerful or something. Vicodin is an older drug so perhaps they have all the bugs worked out of it, but then there is how every drug effects everyone differently. I take over 3000 mg of pain killers of all different types and it does not even touch my pain and when I smoke weed it is works so much better trying to see if my doctor with give me a medical marijuana card", "Got some of my fibromas removed. I did not know they will be that big! ", "Always wondered what it was but after doing hours of researching, I am pretty sure I have NF I mean this is neurofibroma, yes? I have one on my other shoulder too. I wish forget to bring it up to my primary care doctor. You should definitely speak with your primary care. Most of us on here, including myself, are not medical professionals. We cannot diagnose you. Does not look like it. Talk to your doctor. Check for cafe au lait spot (birthmarks), if you have 6+ that is usually an indication of neurofibromatosis.  \n\n\nNone of my subcutaneous fibromas have ever caused discoloration of the skin, no matter how large they grow. Could very easily just be a large zit tbh. Getting a single fibroma or two later in life would be extremely rare, usually you would have already found several (not sure how old you are, but even at 15 this is usually the case).  \n\n\nCutaneous fibromas usually present more spherical as they grow, not just a slightly raised area and red discoloration. Again, talk to your doctor. This is no place for medical advice.  \n\n\nIf it is a fibroma and it is not causing you harm, you can leave it (as we typically have dozens throughout our bodies, and if they are not extremely bothering you, we just deal with them because surgery is expensive). Even if we all said \"yes it is a fibroma!\" that might be leaning towards falsely diagnosing something that you would then choose to leave alone, something which might need your attention. Go to a doctor, not reddit. As others have said, speak to health care professional only they can give you a definitive answer. It does not look like any of the neurofibromas I have, but I would make an appointment to put your mind at ease.  ", "Update: we had our neurology consult today About 2 months ago I posted on here asking what to expect for a neurology consult for my 7 year old who officially has over 6 spots, I think he is up to 9-10 now. \n\nAnyway it was interesting. He did a full neuro exam and skin exam and in the end basically was like he does not have 2 clinical signs for a NF diagnosis, but he does have enough CALs and freckling other places, and big head (he has always had that). So basically could not diagnose NF or cross it off the list. He recommended genetic testing for NF and Legius syndrome. He also made a referral to an ophthalmologist.  We spoke with genetics and neuropsychology.  The plan at this point I guess is if it comes back as Legius we do not have to do anymore follow up. If he comes back negative for both we will continue to be followed for a few years in case he managed to be part of that 5% not identified in the NF testing.   So we are still in that wait and see for another 3-4 weeks but I am glad we went. I appreciate the insight this group has given me and what a great source of support and information, hoping I do not need to officially follow though. Doctors were not able to fully diagnose me until I was 15, puberty ends up being like a on switch for me. When I was born doctors always thought I had it, but could not diagnose me. When I was nine my parents took me to the university of Michigan, where they ran some test, I do not really remember much about that appointment other than pointing out where I had bumps on my head. They still could not say one way or the other. \n\nThen when I was 15, my pediatrician who always firmly believed I had it was seeing more and more signs of it and wanted me to see a specialist. She first contacted a nf clinic in Grand Rapids, Michigan, told them what was going on and they said that I needed to go to Chicago to see the specialist there. He happened to be one of the top specialist for Neurofibromatosis. \n\nHopefully all turns out well for your family and son. If you ever have any questions, let me know. Thank you for your response. Your story hits close to home as we traveled to Grand Rapids today to be seen. They also told me puberty could be a big changing point. I am really hoping the tests give us an answer before then. I hope so to. I recently got genetic testing and it was very cheap relative to most medical expenses. I believe I got it through ambry genetics. My genetic testing results came back negative. But there is the possibility of what is called mosaic or segmented NF1. Where part of my body has NF1.\n\nJust as an FWI im 29 and went through what your son went through early. Had spots, a slightly larger head. But nothing else. My spine was normal, my cognitive abilities were fine. It was not until I was 29 that I started experiencing pain and we found a tumor deep inside me which based on the doctor is or is not a plexiform neurofibroma. Thank you for sharing. Something to keep in mind for sure. Hello there, thank you so much for the update.  \nWe too had a consult with neurology just yesterday and were told the same thing as you were.  My little one is 3 months old and she was born with multiple CAL spots.  Like your son\u2019s neurologist, ours was unable to diagnose due to lack of visible symptoms so she too completed the genetic testing and results should be in in about 6-8 weeks.  In addition to NF1, my daughter is also being tested for Legius syndrome.  \nPlease keep us posted on the outcome of your son\u2019s genetic testing.  We will be seeing the neurologist again in 1 month as my daughter was diagnosed with mild ptosis in her left eye and the doctor wants to make sure it is just physical asymmetry and not anything else.  Then we will see her again a month later for the genetic testing results. Did not the neurologist refer your kid to have an MRI? Seems strange to me. No referral for a MRI, just ophthalmology at this point. I get the feeling that if his genetic testing comes back positive for NF we will have more screenings. Neuropsych mentioned that If he tests positive they would do a full evaluation.", "Curious about NF1 &amp; the Keto lifestyle. Has it improved or adversely affected NF1 symptoms.? I had good success with Keto. Better functioning cognitive processes. Maintained my weight, although as mentioned in another post, at lower weights my neurofibromas show more. So it is a catch 22. I liked Keto and did it for several months. I maintained a healthy weight. Was able to be active. Had what I felt was a better functioning brain. Although that could be the lower weight and active lifestyle.    Although I could not tell if Keto was causing more neurofibromas to develop or it was just the decreasing percentage of body fat and increased muscle mass pushing the bumps to the surface of the skin.  Very interested!  I personally have not done the Keto diet/lifestyle but I have fluctuated in weight over the years particularly when I was younger and working out. I was a student-athlete and did have to bulk up in order to improve in my sport. I did notice that at the time my bumps were more pronounce and noticeable and this could be what be happening to you right now. I do not believe that Keto lifestyle is causing the increase in bumps but I would check with your doctor to make sure. NF2 and keto here, checking in. My docs have not discouraged me to continue. So far (~1.5 years in), there have been no adverse effects to tumor growth (at least not that I can tell) and there are many, many positive side effects like increased mental clarity, better sleep,  and more energy. My pet theory (of which I have no evidence) is that keto might be useful in starving tumors.  Stupid question, but what is \"keto\" :-)  You might find this small study interesting:\n\n\n Not a doctor and about as far from keto as you can get... but I do know that when I am in good shape, and when I keep body fat in check, my bumps are more pronounced.  Keto is a type of \u201cdiet\u201d or lifestyle. It is a very low carb high fat moderate protein diet. Hard to follow and easy to cheat on by accident. The idea of the diet is to teach your body to burn fat for energy by putting it into Ketosis.  Thank you. I know that they have prescribed it for cancer patients and some people with epilepsy although you have to be extremely careful with it based of the medicine or treatment prescribed for those conditions. \n\nI felt healthier when on Keto until I experienced a severe case of fatigue and Rhabdomyolysis due to some intense training and long runs. Dehydration did not help. ", "Do any of you guys have inverted walking/poor coordination? \n\n( I somewhat do My legs muscles are kind of left really tight so one of my feet turns inward My son with NF has very poor coordination and muscle tone.  And he runs funny.  (Seriously-it is LOL funny you watch!) We were told that this was not unusual, AND that the chemo he is been treated with also has this a long term side effect (maybe permanent).  AND he is blind in one eye so has very poor depth perception and trouble with balance.  \nAdd all that up and you get a 12 year old who cannot ride a bike, catch a ball, get a basketball within 10 yards of the net.....and so on!  But, it does improve some when he pushes himself.  He is learning to ride a 3-wheel scooter.  He is getting better at catching balls, though they have to be the super squishy kind.  \nBut boy does he have some hand:eye coordination when it comes to video games!! \nSo to answer your question, yes.  But the source is 3-fold and it is impossible to know exactly which did what to my little dude\u2019s coordination. But, all 3 causes have definitely contributed. 10 yards is 9.14 meters", "Fun fact: \u795e\u7d4c\u7dda\u7dad\u816b\u75c7 is Japanese Kanji meaning for Neurofibromatosis, these mean \u795e= gods \u7d4c = experience \u7dda = line \u7dad = fiber \u816b = tumor \u75c7 = illness Our tumor illness of our fiber line helps us experience god.\n\nBut in real talk, \u795e\u7d4c\u7dda\u7dad = nerve fiber. \u816b = tumor. \u75c7 = illness.\n\nNerve fiber tumor illness... not as poetic. I find this oddly inspirational. ", "NF Neurofibroma removal Hello to everybody, I hope you are all travelling well and that you and your families are safe.\n\nToday I had a day surgery, and had nine pea sized neurofibromas removed from all around my body. Two in the fingers, one in the left side of the neck one on my right clavicle bone, two in my left forearm and two from my back. It was just a day surgery and I was home not too long after waking up from the general anaesthetic. \n\nThe recovery as in post op, Is far more \n hard-core than I expected. My right hand is completely bandaged up and I cannot use it for anything for a whole week. My left forearm is bandaged and taped up like a plaster cast. So I am going to have to give myself sponge bath\u2018s over the next week. I am  relying on friends and family to cook for me, to wash up for me, to shop for me. I am very fortunate to have such good friends and family. \n \nAnyway I am just wondering if anyone else has had multiple neurofibromas Removed in one hit and how long they have taken to recover.\n\nThanks Removed six once, but I have only had local anaesthetics when I have taken mine. A snip in the skin, an electric scalpel to cut the little fuckers out, sewn back up and slapped on a surgical bandaid. Most of the times \"recovery\" was spending maybe 10-15 minutes to sip on a cup of coffee.\n\nThe closest to your experience was when I had to stop the growth in my femur, which took about a month to fully recover. Surgery was mid december and I was still humping around on crutches on new year. That is pretty hardcore having 6 of the fuckers out one by one with local. I have no idea what kind of surgical tools he used, but o guess I will find out next week when I see him. \n\nI forgot to mention I also had one taken out of my leg, a rather small sized one, bigger than a pea, and it was in my left thigh right in the quad muscle area. \n\nI remember when even I knocked that one of something it would hurt like fuck, \n\nAnd I am glad the ones in my left fingers are gone, fuck me, I play bass and when I was to use my right index finger to play a low note while my right hand is playing a higher note up the next. \n\nSo happy to say goodbye to those cunts of things.!\n\nWhen did you get them cut out? And have you had any grow back? \nAlso, what is the benefit of using an electric scalpel over a regular one? Does it cauterise the area where the neurofibroma was nesting?? Yeah, electric scalpels cauterize as you cut. It is been a few years since I removed some last time, one has come back but is way less annoying than what it was, so that one in particular I do not mind so far. There is one on my hip that I have considered for a while to deal with, but for now I will wait for the corona business to die off first. Thanks for sharing, I hope my surgeon did the same, although when you start to get to the fingers and having a lump growing on the right hand side on the middle of your finger, then another lump in the side of the index finger. Because finger surgery takes so much longer than all the other ones.\n\nAny scarring for you? I honestly do not give a fuck if I get scars, if they are scars then I can monitor The area and see if anything is going back. \n\nSounds like a plan, \n\nRona had been pretty chill in Victoria over the past 2 weeks. I think we are 20 something days of zero cases and deaths, \nSo I have been able to get a fair few surgeries done to my private health insurance. Some scars yeah, but mostly on my hip/thighs area and I prefer shorts when bathing anyways. The ones on my collarbones are damn near invisible, going to take good light and me pointing them out for anyone to notice them, props to that surgeon. I have only had 2 removed at a walk in clinic! They used local as well, cut them off and sent me packing. Very good to hear, \nI led to Believe that the scar in might be too bad at all, just a White and fine talking scar. \n \nProps to the surgeon, I am sure mine is as well versed and trained in it. \n\nHave you ever have any grow back? And how long ago did you get them removed? Would have hurt I can imagine,\nDepending on where the local is going in.\n\nHow long ago was that and have they grown back? As I said earlier, I have noticed one that came back but it is tolerable. \n\nI have taken one from the rim of my hip bone that was chafing, I just had it cut out. Sorry mate did t read your post properly, I am so glad for you that it is not as annoying and as painful as it was. \n\nI have been trying to find a rouge figure of what is the % of chance of them growing back. \nAny ideas on that? I know that they grow back, just do not know how many of them are in favour of growing back. The VA removed 4 from my face and I have very light scaring. Local and a scalpel. The shots in the face were the worst part. I had seven small all over removed. Overall very happy with results. One in my arm was bigger, and the stitches stretched ever so slightly. Holding my arm out was too much I guess.\n\nBut still definitely easy on the conscience. Some were more cosmetic but one in my back and groin were aggravated constantly. I have had four surgeries related to my nf, but they were a whole lot bigger than a pea and the last two were cancerous. \n\nThe first surgery I had was on my right lower arm to remove to two tumors. It was stitched up and bandaged. It probably took a week for it to be pretty good, though this doctor lied to my parents about having removed these types of tumors before, he had not and when he saw how bad it was he told my mom after the survey he would never do another surgery on me again. For six months my arms turned a shade of green where it had been cut open.\n\nEvery surgery after that was done in Chicago, by surgeons who knew exactly what they were doing. \n\nMy next surgery was on my cervical spine, to remove tumor that were crushing it. Had they not been removed I could have woken up one day unable to get out of bed. I was in the hospital about a week, and then about two weeks removed at home.\n\nSome years later, I had to have surgery to remove a large mass on my upper right leg that had become cancerous. I was in the hospital I believe about 4-5 days until they let me go home and it was about two weeks recovery at home.\n\nThen four years after that surgery I had, a cancerous tumor removed from my upper right arm. I was able to go home that night and it was like two weeks recovery at home. Sounds like that would have hurt like a bitch, \nHow long ago did you get them removed and have any of them grown back? Sounds quite similar to myself, the one in my arm was the biggest. \n\nIf you do not mind me asking,\nHow long ago did you get this done and have any of them grown back? \n\nThanks, hope they do not grow back and that you are travelling alright. Wow, sounds like you have been through the ringer with NF growths, \n\nI hope that you are ok today and feeling ok about everything,\n\nDo you mind me asking if any of them have grown back? I hope that they do not, \nWishing you all the best. This was 2 1/2 years ago. None have grown back, at least not noticeably. There is always the smattering of many teeny ones to be upset about but I kind of just accept that. But the larger ones removed was great for me. Thank you, unfortunately I have had some grow back, the ones on my cervical spine have and right now were keep an eye on them. They are not pressing against my spine like they were before. And I know the ones in my arms and legs to come degree have grown back in some form. Thanks for letting me know, \n\nHow long did they take to grow back? \n\nI hope that the ones near your spine do not cause you any more trouble, good to keep an eye on them. \n\nI spent 10 years drinking and drugging and not keeping an eye on them at all, no brain or body scans. But in the last 2 years, I have been on top of my health while being clean and sober.\nIn the last 6 months I have had 5 procedure done, 2 of them related to NF and the others were other things. That is great you are staying clean and keeping your health in check, both are important. \n\nI am not sure on how long it took them to grow back, I first had my surgery on my cervical spine back in 2006, then in 2018 I had a scan of my cervical spine again, because I started having the same feeling in my ankle that I had back in 2006, where it would feel warm and numbing. And that is when we saw that the tumors had started growing back. Then a couple months ago I had another mri of my cervical spine and it had not changed too much. I was told back in 2006 that I may need to have the same surgery again in 15-30 years. I suppose that can give an idea of a range that doctor may see with tumors growing back, but it does effect everyone differently. So I would not be surprised if some see it much sooner than that. Thanks for sharing, wishing you all the best! You are welcome and the same to you as well. I have been lucky in that I have never had any visible on my body. Just very recently have I developed two on my chest and one very small on my back. Those on my chest are only pimple-sized and have not grown or changed for years and my neurologist has never suggested they should be removed. Sorry for this late reply,  no regrowth as of yet and that was probably 4 or 5 years ago give or take.", "Trial looking at using MEK inhibitors to combat cutaneous (dermal) neurofibroma growth is now recruiting \n\nFor those unaware, Selumetinib ( and (  It could hit the market for the plexiform indicator as early as 12 months from now.\n\nI have spoken to others on the ( and they have reported similar reduction in plexiform size to those on Selumetinib, and one individual on the trial mentioned that their cutaneous neurofibromas have all but disappeared also.\n\nAs a result of the exciting news coming from the plexiform trials, trial NCT02839720 is now recruiting to study the effect more formally for cutaneous neurofibromas.

Your doctors will have to write a letter to insurance and they most likely will reject it. That is when you write a letter if you have visible raises send photos. Insurance respond better when the person writes a letter than the doctor. Ah, I see. My PCP has already referred me to a dermatologist but I already expect that this particular specialist will not be the last to whom I am referred. Good to know that an oncologist would be a for sure step in the right direction - we will see how familiar this dermatologist is with NF (I have seen one previously who merely removed two tumors but did not really explain anything or provide any information on the condition - more of a \"yea I will just keep hacking away once they are big enough\" approach which obviously it would be best to avoid in the first place). Maybe they will be able to send me directly to oncology or neurology..  You need a neurologist first. Then they may send you to an oncologist because only chemo has possibility of shrinking them right now. But the oncologist needs to know about NF. As does the dermatologist. And the hacking method is bad. You could end up with paralyzed limbs and amputations.  Word. How long have you been taking medication for NF? Do you live in CA? Nope do not live in CA but The DMV! And about 17 years. At this point my doctor said it is time to become \"agressive\" You live in the Department of Motor Vehicles?? (Sorry for being too lazy to comb through your post history) or maybe that is a place not in the US?\n\nAlso, to what extent have you seen progression? I am 28 now and feel like I am noticed by them more frequently as of late. I imagine this process of fibroma development and growth continues in one direction; namely that they grow in size and prevalence. Has that been your experience?\n\nLastly, what does \"becoming aggressive\" entail? DMV means dc md va area. I am 25. So, and it is the same. The odd thing is my tumors for the most part are very very small. But they are EVERYWHERE. Some like the one near my heart are about the size of a softball. Being aggressive mean no more using medication to cover up pain. Basically I will have to change my lifestyle mainly diet, because I do exercise. alongside the MEKinhibitor.\n Oh yeah I would say I have got something similar going (what with the plethora of tiny bumps located all over basically). I only know of the ones I can see or feel immediately beneath my skin though - I have never had any radiology performed for them. And damn sorry about that one near your heart that is scary. How did you come to know of it? Lately I have come to suspect that there may be something pressing on my left lung somewhere; I cannot always feel a sensation but with certain movements and positions I can.\n\nBy the way you are being super helpful and I really appreciate it. I trip out about being able to feel them and the weirdly specific acute stingy pain that happens sometimes.\n\nI am pretty active physically as well but had no idea that diet could play a role in the expression of NF.. Well it is a digestive thing for diet I was not too healthy and I found out when I was eating better foods I felt less pain and my neurologist said I need to stop consuming so much sugar I would add about a half cup of sugar to 10 oz of coffee. I found out about thw tumors because I have gotten MRIs, it is how they keep up with the growth and such because rapid growth of tumors can be something bad but also sometimes they just grow. If you feel something could be pressing up against your lung you need to say something. Also you need MRIs because with NF1 there is a possibility of sheath tumors.  Another thing with lifestyle is sleep. My pain clinic doctor pointed out that a lack of sleep can increase the possibility of pain as well as depression. And I am glad to help.  For sure. I take Adderall and I suspect that it is begun to exacerbate the condition's expression. Just wondering I f you have any experience with this. Nope. Addarall Is for ADHD right? Some people with NF also get learning disablities. Did you have to do the neuropsychological test that takes about 7 hours?  I did not. I was diagnosed at 19 in like 2009/2010 and it was brief. I had already read the DSM and realized I fit the bill. Idk if that affected my interaction with the doctor (it was someone I had already seen in high school). I see. Well If you need any info I good. Also the just ask foundation and the children's tumor foundation is good.", "Anyone taking avastin or trametinib? Both are being recommended for my son who has NF and has optic pathway gliomas. Curious as to others experience with either of them. So my son was diagnosed with bilateral OPG in December.  In Canada, the first line of treatment is Vinblastine monotherapy.  In recent trials, it was found to have a 90% chance of preventing further tumor growth.  Vinblastine monotherapy also has less side effects than Avastin.  He is only been on Vinblastine for 2 months, so we have not yet had our first follow-up MRI.  I can say that his side effects have been basically zero - we have to watch his white blood cell count closely but beyond that, I have not detected a single side effect.\n\n\nHowever, Trametinib, or MEK inhibitors in general, are a VERY promising new type of drug for many NF-1 symptoms.  It is expected that Selumetinib, another MEK inhibitor, will be the very first approved drug for NF-1 later this year, for the plexiform neurofibroma indication.\n\nMEK inhibitors have also shown much promise in treating gliomas.  Our oncologist has stated that if, after his first follow up MRI, they are not seeing the response they are looking, they will be flipping him to the Trametinib trial as the next line of treatment.\n\nWe were offered a Vinblastine + Avastin clinical trial instead of Vinblastine monotherapy, but declined, mostly because it would involve going to a different hospital that was much further away, and the results are expected to be good with Vinblastine on its own. Avastin, second go-around. We are targeting acoustic neuromas though.  I was the 2nd NF2 patient to ever be treated with Avastin, back in 2007. It did amazing things for my hearing, and I know it is just gotten better since then. I would strongly recommend it. Are you using Dr. Plotkin at MGH? Thanks for the insight. We are in Colorado so getting treatment at Children\u2019s Hospital in Denver. Thank you. Our NF1 team seems very much in favor of trametinib and sounds like a pretty low risk profile with mostly skin rashes as the primary side effect. I am concerned about giving chemo drugs to a 4 year old but seems that the gliomas are not stable and his visual acuity is being affected, so we will do what we need to do. I will get more info from them about viniblastine. What is really nice about trametinib is that it is given orally (it is just a pill) so you can do it all at home. Vinblastine means getting a port installed surgically plus weekly trips to the hospital, although getting the vinblastine only takes about 5 minutes!  I was on Avastin 8y ago when I was 18yo and it was still experimental. It was a 24mo study to see how effective it was for acoustic neuromas.\n\nGood news: I did not have any tumor growth or surgeries for nearly 5y!!\n\nBad news: Avastin REALLY screws up your GI (I became lactose intolerant and had extremely bad nausea), and it can cause a lot of weight loss; I went from 125lbs to 95lbs in 7mo.\n\nBut that is a really, *really* small price to pay for 5y of extra, normal, liveable life.\n\nI am 26yo now and just moved to PHX so I can try to get back on Avastin long term now. I have had two surgeries here at Barrows clinic by Dr. Spetzler (he literally wrote the book on CNS surgery but just retired). The guy saved my life.\n\nBut Avastin, it is a great stopgap for all NF tumors. Definitely worth it.\n\nAdvice to everyone though: when they ask to install a port for chemo or do IVs every other week, *do the port*. My veins are blown from the IVs. Avastin is really bad for your veins, which is mostly because of the kind of drug it it (antiangiogenesis, so it inhibits the creation of blood vessels. That is what basically starves and kills the tumors).\n\nBut if any of you ever are offered Avastin for NF, do it. It will duck a bit, but two years of slight uncomfort yeild amazing results. Hey, I know Dr. Plotkin! Genius. Absolute Genius. I have NF1 with large plexiform neurofiboma on my face and neck. The research on MEK inhibitors is promising, and my neurologist has ordered trametinib. There are a few more steps, but I am hoping I can start taking it in a couple of months. I do have concerns about potential side effects, but am willing to give it a try.", "Uh\u2026 how normal is swelling after NF1 removal surgery\u2026 particularly those who got it removed in the abdomen or leg or arm?

But at this appt, the doc showed no concern for the swelling/bulge at incision site. It has not gone down\u2026 should I be worried???", "Selumetinib (Koselugo) denied Hi all, I have NF1 and have a large disfiguring plexiform on the right side of my face. Trametinib did not quite work out, but I was happy to hear selumetinib finally received FDA approval. However, although my neurologist agrees on this as treatment and ordered it, my insurance has denied to cover the tests necessary to ensure I will not suffer the worst side effects when I take it and furthermore denied the prior authorization for the drug itself.  \n\nWe are appealing the decision (possibly have to appeal to the drug company itself for access), and I do not need any advice on that. I just want to post my frustration that even after such a great breakthrough, the barriers and gatekeepers for obtaining treatments remain. How long would you have to be on the drug? That is so frustrating:( \nI hope they get back to you quickly so you can start treatment. \nHealthcare is a joke! \nI have a horrible tumor on my side that causes pain and my insurance denied coverage for me to have an mri so the doctors know more about what they are dealing with (I cannot find a specialist in network). So, looks like my stuck with it lol. \nIt is such BS. \nI wish you all the best though! I do not understand why insurance companies feel they can pick and choose who gets what based on such little information!\n\nI sincerely hope that when you fight it it gets approved! check out this AstraZeneca site for access info ( I have a large plexiform on the ride side of my face also. I want to do the study but I know my wife and her insurance will say no to it As long as I want/need results. One clinical trial indicated at least baseline results in tumor shrinkage for 70% of patients--but the drug is only effective as long as it is being taken. Tumors that shrank while under treatment re-grew for patients who stopped taking the drug. Which means unless other treatments become available, it is real long-term. Interesting so it will always regrew to its original growth size? I have one in buttock , foot and tspine. I hope the adult trial ends soon. I understand there may be concerns you and your wife would have to discuss, but it really bothers me that we have to worry at all about insurance denying us even the chance. Drug trials under clinical study are one thing, but Selumetinib has gone through all that and has just been FDA approved. Insurance should not be an obstacle. thanks! Not sure if will always be the case or what rate, but seems likely. Here is the research I was referring to:   \n\nThere are more recent studies I think, but this is a good place to start.\n\nQuoting the bit about regrowth:  \n\"Slow tumor regrowth after the maximum response had been reached has been observed in several patients, most of whom had required at least one dose reduction as a result of toxic effects (Figure 2B and 2C, and Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). This finding suggests a dose-dependent effect of MEK inhibition on neurofibroma growth. The clinical course of Patient 7 (Figure 3B), who had disease that was responsive to treatment with selumetinib but who subsequently had tumor growth during a period of drug interruption due to toxic effects, highlights the fact that prolonged administration of selumetinib will be necessary among patients with progressive tumors.\"", "Community in UT doing fundraiser for young girl with NF1.

All in all, he is still himself, but sometimes he gets so quiet I cannot help to think to myself how can I help him, give him support in this situation? How can I find information for NF2 side effects like styes or muscular atrophy? Here is a place to start:  The effects of tumor load and surgeries are so numerous that it is often difficult to sort them all out. One thing leads to another. Our family member has all of the above plus neuropathy and other things......most of these things are not specific in any way to NF2, but are the results of the surgeries and nerve damage (nerves being squeezed, cut off, etc.). \n\nWe have been dealing with it for over 20 years - and have researched it heavily during those many years.

Basically, I have plexiform neurofibromas in my right foot and my entire back and right rib cage. According to my genetics doctor, this results in me being unable to safely transition via hormones, as it would raise my risk of them turning into sarcomas exponentially. Combine this with High Functioning Autism, and I kind of have no way to ever really work, no way to transition because Medicaid and Medicare do not cover \"cosmetic\" surgeries even if deemed medically necessary, and thus being on SSI I have no way to pay for the transition even if it is all done cosmetically. \n\nI did not come here to rant about me being trans, but I had to point out there is more that this condition affects than just someone is physical status. It can also impact their ability to adjust to a psychological one.....  Good luck Wait i have NF and im transitioning with hormones...but now inhave sheath tumors on my spine...was it the T..? I think you should get a second opinion from a neurosurgeon. it is actually Estrogen that does it.  Really? I knew a transgirl with NF1 who was on hormones. I found a study where they sampled neurofibromas and it was a 1 in 6 chance that hormone receptors, more specifically steroid and sex hormone receptors, were in a neurofibroma. So the odds are in favor of not getting sarcomas still, just the chance of it happening have skyrocketed...\n\nFrom what I am reading, it seems growth hormones during puberty and adolescence are major contributors to the growth of neurofibromas.\n\nThe doctor actually told me that in cases of women with NF, during pregnancy, they have a higher risk of the neurofibromas turning malignant. I should at least see if they can do a biopsy of one of my tumors (I would almost certainly have to be asleep), and see if they can test it for estrogen receptors. If they are not there, I should be in the clear. Wow i never knew that...i wish you the bestin all of this! I thought it was the progestin that does it! I could be wrong, but I was told to take birth control with lower progestin.  Hm... it might be that, i do not know. I am debating taking the risk or not, but I am leaning on not because... I would rather not drag my family and friends through the shitshow that is malignant cancer. I have not heard the malignant part, but I do know they fibromas can grow, or you develop more during pregnancy and puberty when hormone levels are higher. I am so sorry you have to go through this.

I do understand they are mainly a \"cosmetic\" issue but I am struggling a lot with it at the moment I have tumors all throughout my body, but only have had four surgeries related to my Neurofibromatosis. My specialist will only have been have surgery when it is absolutely necessary, because of the difficulty of removing these tumors and because more harm than good can be done depending on the location. I can understand that for the ones within the body, but for the ones on the skin it seems an easy (ish) fix to remove them put emphasis on the pain Unfortunately with any surgery there are risks I do not live in UK, I live in Central Europe under Universal Healthcare. From my experience, it depends on the doctor. I got scolded by one for asking to some of the neurofibroms be removed because the were at the waist line and irritated by the waist band.

I went to the doctors for what I thought was carpal tunnel and every test came back that I was fine. After visiting several doctors, in may 2019 we discovered I had complete loss of temperature feeling in my hands. I couple feel pressure, but no hot or cold difference. An MRI later &amp; further research they found two tumors sandwiching my spinal cord at the C1-2 level. Had to get surgery right then. The surgery gave me my feeling back, etc. Every doctor after looking at my medical history, MRIs and biopsy of neurofibromas all say it all points to NF. So I asked to get genetically tested. I got referred to another genetic counselor who said she also thought it was NF, but like stated above I did not \u201cqualify\u201d so she approved/suggested to my insurance to get tested.\n\nI got the genetic test in the middle of 2019. They told me it might take a long time...So I waited. \n\n2021. (I changed jobs and switched insurance so they apparently did not call me with my test results???) I called and asked if it was ever completed. They said yes and that my results were inconclusive. She said that when they look at the specific gene that causes NF there was a gene mutation, but on that has never been reported before. She said she would talk with a geneticist that specialized in NF. They talked and got back to me that while I do not \u201cqualify\u201d and the test is inconclusive, he would absolutely say I have NF.\n\nI just feel really defeated at this moment.  It sounds like you have a variant of unknown significance which is a thing that can happen with genetic disorders. If the most recent geneticists are saying you have it then you have it. Have you seen a neurologist? That is how I was diagnosed.   \nHello, I Think you have seen  \nthe pitfulls of diagnosing NF1 via clinical presentation as well as genetic testing.  \nSome other things to consider with a NF1 differential diagnosis, and may be worth looking  \nup include:  \nRasopathies  \nLegius sydnrome  \nNeurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome\n\n  \nThe community is forming a greater understanding of how Rasopathies manefiest and how the The MAPK/ERK pathway influences growth and cellular response.   \n  \n  \n", "First time poster part of this has gotten hard. Should I be concerned? ", "Anyone with nf2 want to try something? I recently spent nearly $20,000 developing something that I think will help people with nf2. Does anyone want to try it out? If you live in the US then hit me up and I will send some out free of charge. Extra points if you have an MRI coming up in the next few months. \n\nThis is non pharmaceutical. Could you please go into detail? Your post comes across as rather spammy. Yeah, I can see how it might but I am not sure how to better word that. I am not selling anything. I will happily go into more detail in a pm, but basic gist is that I identified a supplement that inhibits something called YAP.. the problem is that it does not last long in the body so I had to make it in an extended release capsule. That required a minimum order amount and is why it cost me so much. Because this supplement is already available online, there is not a lot of incentive for a pharmaceutical company to do human trials on it or anything. So the only way we will ever know if it works is to just try it out. It had to be an extended release form because it needs to be supplied to the tumor cells 24 hours a day. If it is not then there is a lysosomal response which kicks in and supplies ATP to the tumor cell and basically rescues it. So the idea is that the capsules should last 8 hours and can be taken three times a day to cover a 24-hour period. Otherwise it would basically wear off in your sleep and have no effect on the tumors. This post sounds extremely sketchy. I dont advise anyone take OP up on this. And I do advise the mods take this post down. You can read my explanation in reply to another commenter. Idk what to tell you dude, I am asking people to try a benign supplement to see if it works. People can ask their doctors too, IDC. Or they can do nothing new and just follow their current medical recommendations and just accept those results. I have also got scientific papers to back up my reasoning behind everything. Either it works or it does not\ud83e\udd37. Do you have any credentials to be performing medical trials? Dude, I am not doing an irb and paying six figures for a human trial. This is not a pharmaceutical. It is something they sell at GNC. Thousands of people already take it and there are zero fatalities from it on record, even at outrageous dosages. But no, I am not a doctor. I am just a researcher. Again, people can ask their doctors and I am not advising anyone to alter or stop anything that their doctor is currently advising. What is the name of the product? I will send you a private message with the name. If I am correct and this is a good Yap inhibitor then there are some people who should not be taking it, so I am hesitant to mention it here in the comments in fear that someone with certain conditions might decide to try it and it aggregates another issue. Or some other decides to feed her kid a bunch of it or something. I do not want this to become like fenbendazole or ivermectin or something that people just start taking like crazy. I hope this makes sense. Here is a good article that, after reading it, might illuminate why I would be hesitant to do so. \n\n I do not have NF2. I just feel nobody is going to trust someone without proving their credentials. This is literally sold in stores, just not in time release form. Does the person at the nutrition store need credentials to sell it to you? It is fine if nobody wants it because I am not an MD. I am frankly not wanting to send it to anyone who will not wipe their own ass unless a doctor tells them to. I would not take anything like this without consulting with a doctor. I am lucky enough where I do not need to take anything for NF. As a doctor id advise no one be this guys guinea pig. Mods please take this post down. \n\nOP if you think you can help folks then you can conduct an approved randomized control trial for your supplement. Otherwise dont post stuff like this. You do not even f****** care what it is do you? You did not even ask. You just swung your big doctor dick around. Are you going to call all of the supplement stores that this is sold in and tell them to pull it from the shelves and stop treating people like guinea pigs? I merely took an existing supplement and made it time release. I cannot believe that you would not encourage somebody to try this. I mean your success rate so far is 0%. You seem really reasonable im surprised millions arent lining up to take your miracle drug. You realize I am not selling anything, right? I seriously doubt you are a doctor. At least not an MD.

But, most worrisome is a new Astrocytoma on hi middle brain (brain stem). Talking to his NF clinic tomorrow, and will have more details then, but today his Neuro-Opthamologist was obviously concerned.  Anybody else been through this one? No. But i wish our health system can offer me that kind of check up Hi OP, I wish I had some positive personal experience to share with you. I would just like to ask how you are doing and how the conversation with the NF clinic went. I have an Astrocytoma on my brain stem as well. It was discovered when I was 16 (I have just turned 34). I had surgery and 80% of it was removed, as if they removed anymore the outcome would not have been good.\n\nI had six weeks of radiation treatment (celebrated my 17th birthday during this. They threw a 'party' for me). This ended up killing the cysts inside the tumour and shrank it somewhat.

How does anyone here deal with nerve pain specifically my spine and head  I get headaches a lot and usually if I am home, I will lay down. Or I will just take an aspirin to reprieve the pain Yeah I get headaches a fair bit. Also have a lump at the back of my skull that will ache randomly or when pressed. Other than that I do not really have any other issues.  Lots of weed I take amitriptyline for nerve pain and imitrex for migraines. Use to take neurotin which helps a lot of people but did not help me at all.  I get both occasionally. I get an MRI done every year and my doctors say nothing deadly. Nerve pain in my spine and back, headaches, scoliosis, and hyper mobility in my knees. I hurt every day and the only cure that has worked for me is cannabis, I am currently trying to move to a state where it is legal, but job prospects are not great. I have no idea how to get it medically in my state. I would love to If it is not legal in your state you have to buy it on the black market. If you do not know anyone who smokes it can be challenging. I am currently trying to move to Colorado so I can smoke legally. We have medical but that is it. I need to look into getting a card  a lot of this pain can be caused by slipped discs in your spinal cord. \n\nThis was my case. I had the constant back pain, the nerve pain shooting down my legs, all that stuff.\n\nI would highly recommend seeing a chiropractor. Mine was one that practiced holistic medicine along with adjustments. Honestly, it was amazing to get adjusted 2/3 times a week. My headaches went away, I could stand on my feet for longer then an hour at a time... Definitely do whatever you can to get a card, marijuana is a miracle drug. I would kill to have the ability to buy it legally. I take Venlafaxine for my nerve pain which helps more than any other medication I have tried.\n\nAs other commenters are saying weed does help a lot. I ate a lot of pills called \"gabapentin\" as an alternative for normal painkillers, but it didnt work as well, I wish I could try Weed but that is unfortunately ilegal in denmark,  I wish you good luck to find a product that can help you reduce your pain, Love From Denmark ( I have nf1)  I am actually on that now. I just had it upped  Well When i ate them I would have less pain but it was not worth it, It is not fun being high on pills most of the time :) I feel you it is killing me  Was is sober???? It is so good to know that all the pain and aches I feel are normal - sometimes, I feel like I am just being a big baby and should just suck it up (headaches, nerve pain, numbness/tingling in body parts and so many joint aches). The docs have done scans and stuff but the system is slow where I am so consults take forever. Most of them just say that there is not much they can do and I just get regular scans to monitor all the nodules and bumps in various areas. \n\nFor aches, heat seems to help ease some pain, but only temporarily. I started doing hot yoga a year and a half ago in hopes that it would help my joints and aches - it helps a little, the heat especially but the pain is still there, unfortunately. For me, ibuprofen does not help. :( Hang in there. Hopefully you can find some relief soon.  I take pain medicine prescribed by my doctor, but if you are having a lot of pain in your head and spine, you should really talk with your doctors. Those can be high risk areas to concerned about with pain.  Did the neurotin make you sleep a lot? Like 15 or more hours a day but you still needed to take a nap in the 9 hours you were awake? That is all I got from it was sleeping constantly. I took myself off of it because I could not handle always being tired and sleeping for days on end it seemed.  Ugh yes. I was a zombie I also got super intense stomach pains and was always hungry while on it. I had not it. I was always hungry and sleepy. But I had no energy to eat/cook.  My doctor when I stopped it got pissed and told me I stopped taking it too soon I should have waited. I am not sure if she wanted me to wait till I was in a coma or what but it is the last time I saw that doctor.  Mine just kept increasing my dose till I put my foot down and asked for a new med. it took several different meds till I found one that works fairly well for me.  I am glad you are seeing that doctor anymore ! That is crazy that she got mad at you! You know your body better than anyone.  Glad you stopped it too. I tell them when they ask about hurting myself I tell them the closest I came to it was while on neurontin I had no life no energy all I did was sleep. I picked someone up one day and it was only a 5 minute ride to get them I had to have them drive home because I could not keep my eyes open. That is not normal. \nI am retrying Lyrica right now because I have been on some many I have forgotten what I have taken. \nMy primary doctor says that too you know what is going on in your body better than anyone else so you tell me if it is time for MRI's or to see a surgeon.

I sent a dm", "My two month old with CALS When my daughter was born two months ago she had two little birthmarks. One on her chest and one by her neck. We thought they were so cute until her 1 month checkup and by then she had six. Her pediatrician told us about NF1 but not to be alarmed since she did not have too many spots. \n\nWell, now she is two months old and she probably has 16-17 spots that I can see. We will he talking to him about it tomorrow, but is anyone out there able to calm my fears? \nShe is seemingly healthy and developing on track I am just so worried. And another question, does this mean our future children will have NF1? My daughter is almost 30 and I was not aware of her NF until she was about eleven. I had her participate as her other siblings would but I always encouraged her to let me know how she was feeling, mentally and physically. If you decide to have her genetically tested, and you should, no matter the outcome, just do not be afraid. I have several other children and each female child was born with birthmark  but only one offspring has NF ( the others were never tested). My son was born with some CALs, and as he got older he got some more. We suspected NF1 which was finally confirmed maybe at age 2 by genetic testing. He is in first grade now and loves math. Do not freak out. I had many spots as a baby, but in 1991/2, it was not as well-known so we found out when I was nine months. \n\nI have a milder form of it so I have spots and the fibromas. I did have some developmental delays, mainly in maths, but nothing that was detrimental to me or that I even realized was NF until later in life. \n\nCheck near her armpits and groin area for \u2018spotting\u2019 aka smaller birthmarks grouped together...that is a sign of it as well. I definitely had that as a baby. If she had any purplish spots that is also a sign. \n\nAt 29, I am living a relatively normal life albeit getting brain MRIs every couple of years to check for tumours. They found one in 2001, had surgery in 2002 to remove it, and gamma knife in 2003 to get rid of the rest. Some days I forgot that I have it, tbh. \n\nIf she does, you have a great community here as well as the Children\u2019s Tumor Foundation and other similar groups. Thank you. Did you have to do brain scans? Thank you for your story Ok thank you. Was it brain surgery you had? A high number of caf\u00e9 au lait spots raises the suspicion of nf1 or another condition called Legius, but it is not a certainty. Therefor, it might be prudent to do a genetic test. There are old guidelines written in the 1980s who states a list of criteria for diagnosis, but given that the symptoms listed appear spreader over years sometimes a decade, it is unwise to stick to these guidelines given a genetic test is available in 2020. \n\nIt is normal to be worried, however nn Nf1 diagnosis does not need to be catastrophic . Many of us are absolutely fine, enjoying an happy life, with kids and fulfilling careers. I was so mild, I was only diagnosed in my 40s and you would not know by looking at me. Like me, there are many out there totally unaware. It is not rare for adults to only be diagnosed after one of their children is diagnosed. \n\nShe can be healthy and problem free. \n\nNF1 is a genetic disorder meaning it affect a gene called nf1. It is a dominant gene, so if a parent has it, there is a 50% chance of transmission. However NF1 has an extremely high rate of spontaneous mutations, slightly higher than 50% kids with nf1 are spontaneous mutations, so unless one of you, mum or dad, has nf1, the chances of future children having it is 1:2500. \n\nTomorrow, at your paediatrician appointment you will probably be referred to a geneticist or a neurologist at a specialised centre, from there you will be advised on the utility of the genetic test and like a previous poster, I strongly advise in insisting into having one. The newest NF1 book published this year and written by all the experts is calling for a revision of the old diagnostic criteria which would prevent delayed diagnosis. \n\nGood luck at your appointment tomorrow It was yes Not initially, no. Official diagnosis can be made either by genetic testing or by meeting at least 2 of the diagnostic criteria. CALs are one, and he eventually developed one or two small fibromas (tiny bump under skin) that met the 2nd criteria. When I was born doctor also thought I had it as I had the birth marks, but they were never able to fully diagnose me. It was not until I was 15 that I was fully diagnosed. For some people puberty can be like a on switch. My childhood was pretty normal, I was diagnosed with dyslexia when I was 9 which Neurofibromatosis can cause, but my dad was also diagnosed with dyslexia when he was 9 or 10.\n\nNeurofibromatosis can effect everyone differently some will hardly be effected, while others like me are not so lucky. Best to speak with your sons doctor and if there is enough reason to seek out a Neurofibromatosis specialist.\n\nIf you have any questions let me know. Hey there -\nI too have a two month old with 11+ CALS all over her body and today her pediatrician mentioned the possibility of NF1. My girl is also developing well and meeting most of her milestones.  Her doctor basically told us that we should basically just keep an eye on her skin and wait until she is 12-18 months for her to be diagnosed.  I came home and googled - which I know I should not have but I knew nothing a about it that I felt I had to.  My mind is racing and I cannot imagine waiting a whole year or year and a half before learning more.  \nWere you able to get any additional information on your baby? I saw a lot of comments suggesting genetic testing, which I would definitely want to do on my little girl.  Is this something you are pursuing? \nThank you \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb We got her eyes tested because he said there can be tumors growing in the eyes. We are waiting for the geneticist to call us back to schedule. I would be more direct with your pediatrician and say you want answers Thanks for your response.  I hope your baby\u2019s eye exam goes well.  I was so in shock at her appointment that I felt I could have advocated more for my baby.  I am actually  considering switching pediatricians and pursuing genetic testing and an eye exam even if we have to pay out of pocket.  I am trying to find other Mother\u2019s who may have been or are in similar situations to gain insight, advice and of course some hope.  Good luck to you and your little one. You too!! Hi u/GreenTurtle0528 , I have a 5mo daughter who is getting tested for NF1 due to her CALs. My 3yo son has one CAL. Now that you say your other non-NF1 kids have a birthmark, I feel a bit relieved about by son's CAL. Did you ever worry about your other kids having NF1 and thought to get them genetically tested? Am I just being paranoid about my son's one borthmark? No, my Mom also had birth marks in the same spot. Two of my grand-daughters also have the same birthmark as one of their paternal aunts. Please do not be afraid but just be aware. I am so glad I found this thread. My son is 12 months old. He had a couple of CALS at birth and they have increased in number since that time (3 large on trunk, several scattered on both legs). Developmentally on track. Large head size (80-90th percentile, but dad also has big head!) and he is only in 4th percentile for length (parents are average height). \nPedi recently referred us to dermatologist, still waiting for appointment. No mention was made of NF, but seems pretty obvious. There is no family history that I know of. I plan on pursuing eye exam and genetic testing. \nI have been worried sick, but reading everyone is stories and experiences has been extraordinarily helpful... especially knowing we are not alone in this. Hey there - if it brings you any comfort, my sleepless nights of worry have subsided some. I have learned that NF is not ever really a condition of urgency but I definitely believe in pursuing answers sooner than later.  I have read a lot of adults do not realize they have NF until they have babies who have been diagnosed and go to genetic testing.\nI took my baby girl to see a dermatologist a couple of weeks ago.  He said the CALS do not look \u201csuspicious\u201d but that he would like her to see a neurologist to (hopefully) rule out NF.  I think he was just trying to keep us from\nWorrying.  After a few set backs with referrals, we were finally able to book an appointment with the neurologist for next week. \nMy baby girl is meeting most of her milestones, although I am concerned about her motor skills - she does not seem to be doing the things most babies her age \u201cshould\u201d be doing.  She also has a larger than average head - about 75th percentile but both my husband and I have big heads.  I am not sure if her height is quite within normal range.  I come from a super petite family, while my husband is quite the opposite so I guess it can be a toss up?  Not sure.\nPlease keep us posted on the progress with your little one.  Message me if you want to talk! Thank you so much. I hope everything goes well at your appointment next week! Thank you!!", "URGENT!!!!

Thanks for the info. Agreed but she will know which doctors you would want to look at up here depending on what area of expertise you need. Yes, Aurora CO.  Since more complicated cases involve children, and since NF is now diagnosed in early childhood you will often find that peds is the only place to find NF clinics.  I highly recommend going there.  They are going to be seeing NF cases constantly and should be very on top of the latest research.  Do not let the peds label put you off....hospitals have to put the NF docs in SOME department.

I now finally have the funds to do it but I am not sure if I can with Nf1? \nAnyone have any experience w this ?", "NF2 with Vestibular Schwannomas and a few Meningiomas. Hello everyone,\n\nI was diagnosed with NF2, 4 years ago at the age of 26. I had experienced nothing severe besides a paralyzed vocal cord. Since then my symptoms have gone downhill. My hearing in my right ear has gotten terrible, the verbal recognition in that ear specifically is shot, so a hearing aid would not help. At night I often fall over when I walk. The doctors have me on Diamox for reduction of pain and pressure swelling my optic nerves. Recently when i have been drinking any liquid, the pressure builds in my ear, similar the feeling of ears popping on a place or going over a mountain.  All in all, I feel glad my life is somewhat normal. I just wanted to introduce myself to the community, I am glad to have found this subreddit. Welcome. I am 34 with NF2. I have lost the hearing in both of my ears, but have ABIs that do an amazing job, letting my function very fully in life. My balance also sucks, especially at night. Feel free to ask me any questions, either here or privately. I assume they have done MRI's and decided not yet to remove or debunk the head tumors? Make sure you get the proper opinions on that (from real NF2 experts) because having pressure build up inside your head is not good. \n\nDeafness is likely with NF2....because those tumors are on the hearing nerves. But late stage deafness (at your age) can be dealt with easier these days due to technology. My wife learned sign and so did our NF2 family member, but these days I just talk normally and my phone displays big text....so we can have more detailed conversation. \n\nBut, please, have them check on your tumors....pressure does not sound good. Our first surgeries were for the same reason - one of them had gotten really large (at 22 year old). I go to the Johns Hopkins Neurofibromatosis clinic, Dr Blakely is one of the top physicians in the field and Shannon Langmead is an excellent provider as well. I go twice a year. My next visit is in a few days actually. How long did it take you to get accustomed to the ABIs and relearning your hearing? I would say it took about a year. But it also keeps improving. At this point I can have some telephone conversations, and can listen to music. The technology keeps getting better and better.", "My squeaker is broken.. Does anyone else here have a paralyzed vocal cord? \n\nOr know how to deal with the shortness of breath and inability to speak for very long? \n\n(I have NF2 and my dad had the same paralysis problems) I had one due to surgery complications, I did speech-therapy and after a year or so it came back. I still have issues with it if I talk for too long, but other than just keeping quiet when I feel I have hit my limit, there is little advice I can give you. I suppose if I would do my speech-practice I might improve it again. I have no shortness of breath that I am aware off.\n\nI have NF1 though. I have never heard of this but it sounds similar to what I am experiencing now. Can you elaborate a bit? It is been an issue for a while. I finally had a test done where they stick a camera down my throat to check when I started having trouble with shortness of breath. \n\nBasically my voice is really raspy and quiet and I use up all my air very quickly. I am almost incapable of screaming and it comes out more like a rattly raised voice. \n\nI have an unproductive cough. \n\nBasically I have a smokers voice and cough despite never having smoked.  Thank you for the description. I am sorry you have to go through that. Anything that that you do that helps? Weirdly enough, I play saxophone. Bari especially helps with regulating how I use my air. So I still run out of breath super fast, but playing a wind instrument helps a bit with constantly being low on air. : WOULD", "Recently officially diagnosed with nf1, what should I expect with \u201cpain\u201d and tumors? Sorry if I seem rude. I have been recently diagnosed and I have had a hard time dealing with it. I am 23 now but I have kind of knew I had it from a very young age. My parents never took me to a doctor for an official diagnosis, but when I was around a year old they suspected I had it and the doctor suggested they take me in for testing. \n\n\nI just cannot stop thinking of the worst case scenario. It is been running in my mind all week. I know I am able to do everything I want to do with NF,  but I have wanted to do adult gymnastics, axe throwing, rock climbing, hiking, martial arts, ect. \nI have heard a ton of things about pain with NF so I am worried that this will put a dent in my plans. \n\n\nThank you for any help or advice you may have for me, thank you. I am sorry if I come off as offensive, I am still learning about this. The good news is you did not mention currently having any pain. :) Go ahead and live your life as you want! It is tough, but do not worry about pain you do not even have. You can cross that bridge when you come to it. Not rude at all. We all fear what could be, but there is a lot to be said for keeping positive. I just found out I have NF1 in December, I am 39. I only had a few of the clinical signs(freckling   \n and CAL spots) until a tumor in the last two years. Recently, the pain that I have had from a tumor was greatly alleviated with topical CBD oil. If you are able to get where you live, I would recommend that. I also take gummies at night, also CBD, to help sleep. In most of them there is so little THC to matter. After a few weeks of the strain I have, no more pain, for the last three weeks.\n\nJust keep doing what you want and take breaks if you need too. Like if you pulled a muscle or something. Do not worry about what could be, I know that is easier said than done, but you may never have any tumors grow. You wont know until it happens, unfortunately. I was able to play sports most of my life apart from BJJ could never do it due to have fibromas on my neck but the others on my body do not cause issues unless and are bumped to hit.\n\nbaring all the negativity and obviously signs on our bodies we pretty much live a normal life. Not rude at all. I can tell you that while I have a significant amount of tumors around my spine at 34, they have not changed or multiplied in over 15 years. I am no expert, but based on my conversations with people at NF conferences, most started developing their worst symptoms in their teenage years. If you made it to 23 without it affecting your mobility, I really think you will be fine. Just go on and keep living your life to the fullest and get checked out by an NF specialist if you develop pain that other doctors cannot explain. I am 33, I have tumors in my brain, spine, pelvis, neck eyes I was forced to stop doing the things like rock climbing, kayaking, now I like fast cars and other fast things. It can be different for everyone, so you experience will likely differ from others and vice verse. I have tumors all throughout my body. Most of my pain is in my legs and occasionally my back. I take two different pain medications twice a day. I also have weakness in both my legs and arms, along with having some balance issues. \n\nIf you have any questions let me know. I was not diagnosed until I was 15, though it was always suspected I had, but test results were inconclusive when I was tested when I was younger. I am more than twice as old as you, and I do not have any pain. I am very sporty, very active, love the gym, so on that front, the only aches I have come from my activities and not my Nf1 if you see what I mean. \n\nSo far, I am managing to keep my tumours under control with diet and as a preventative measure, I started taking ketotifen a few months ago. I live in Australia, and six months per year I wear a bikini, and no-one can tell I have Nf1. I had far more tumours 5 years ago that I have now. \n\nHere however the care of nf1 is almost non-existent, so I educate myself with books, research, conferences, ... and try to stay up to date with the guidelines and warnings coming from other countries and I apply them to myself . \n\nTo give you an example, the French guidelines warn about poor bone density, so I went (and paid) for a DEXA scan, and I am in the yellow, despite all my weight training, so I supplement more and will redo the scan after one year so see if there is an improvement / worsening . \n\nI do not wait for symptoms for any of the complications we have, I try to anticipate them. I do blood tests and supplement accordingly, I talk to other people around the world who are managing their nf1 and so on. \n\nYou do not have to sit and wait helpless and hopeless for your nf1 to unfold, there are steps you can **try** that **might** mitigate the severity of your manifestations. \n\nIf you have not seen it yet, start here ( on diet. Figured I would jump in to say that I have nf1 and I go rock climbing multiple times a week.\n\nSometimes my back gets a bit sore and stiff, but that is more because I do not warm up properly. Im 24 and I was diagnosed at 5 years old. I think the thing I am realizing I am going to struggle with most is opening up to guys to tell them that kids may never happen. Most guys want them eventually. The fact people can google NF1 to and see some pretty extreme symptoms is horrible to contend with to.\n\nI have painful headaches sometimes but rarely, and I have tumors located on my spinal column, jugular area, brain and pituitary gland. I live a very 'normal life' however I have battled treatment-resistant depression for 10+ years, whether that is down to genetics or NF1 i do not know.\n\nYou mention you want to do those sports- that is great you can totally do that- if your comfortable- there is no issue there. The only thing i will say is I am super uncoordinated and basically a moron when it comes to balance, which is a classic sign of NF1 (motor delays) Your diet actually helped you reduce tumors? Yes. In my mid 40s , I  had a wave of new flat and nascent neurofibromas and it scared me because I feared that whatever caused the onset of them  would trigger some internal neurofibromas as well, so I adopted a high polyphenols diet and the new ones went away. \n\nIf you look at the pictures of the paper I linked above, it is a clinical trial, so whilst my anecdote is just an anecdote which someone can believe or not, a published study is a whole different level. \n\nIn the trial , in addition to the cutaneous neurofibromas, there was a 28% reduction in the volume of a plexiform. Thanks for the info, I will do more research about it! My  young daughter has NF1 so it might be good to start her off on a diet. Talk to your doctor first, because curcumin is an iron chelator (it removes iron from the cells) . Iron is involved in neurofibromas development. \n\nResearch ketotifen also as a safe and cheap preventative measure. It is a mast cell stabiliser and Dr Riccardi is convinced it can prevent severe manifestations. \n\nIn this NF network webinar, Dr Kaleb Yohay talks about both curcumin and ketotifen as something that might help.  ( (1h14' at the very end) .", "Headaches and bump on side of head I always had this bump on the side of my head covering my hair. It is above my ear so no one can see it since hair is covering it. Recently, it had gotten bigger and there is some feeling there. When I push on it the bump hurts. I feel like if I bring this up to my nf nurse that she will deny any tests as she did in the future. I would like to get a MRI done to check it out since I am concerned. \n\nMy personality has changed as well. I am more depressed and tired even if I get enough sleep. If you are in the US please find a neurologist who works with NF patients. It is possible that the nurse and the neurologist are not NF specialists. \nYour pain can make you depressed. (Psychiatrists can now prescribe a particular pain releif tablet for depression also.) The nurse is a NF specialist and keeps telling me I do not need it. I just want a MRI. I have not had one in 15 years. I am concerned about it but I get dismissed every single time. I feel like the pain radiating if that makes sense. It is not throbbing but there is a sensation there where the bump is. The nurse I see is a nurse that is a specialist with NF. She works at a well known hospital so the fact that she is not giving me a chance to get a MRI is really pissing me off. I have headaches every so often but for the last week it is been bad. Where the bump resides there is this radiating pain associated with it. It is not throbbing but I do need medicine to dim the pain. It is not like super painful but its noticeable where I need to just sleep in the bed because I do not feel like doing anything. How can I bring this up to her? Is this concerning? What is the pain relief medication that also helps depression?! i would flat out as her for an MRI for peace of mind, explain to her all of your concerns with the changes you have experienced and if she shrugs you off, ask for a referral to another NF specialist/neurologist that will take you seriously. I would prefer you discuss with your personal psychiatrist. She (or he) will immediately know the medication to prescribe. You should speak with your doctor. I know my Neurofibromatosis specialist that I see regularly ask about headaches and I have a few bumps on my head many which have been there since I was a young kid. Duloxetine Have you had this bump since birth or since later childhood (around 8 or older)? Has't thee hadst this jowl since birth 'r since anon childhood (around 10 'r older)?\n\n***\n\n\n\n^(I am a bot and I swapp'd some of thy words with Shakespeare words.)\n\nCommands: `!ShakespeareInsult`, `!fordo`, `!optout` I heard back from the specialist and was bombarded with questions. I feel like I was being shut off and that I will not get a MRI. I am a little bit peeved so I did respond and asked if I could have a doctor who would be willing to listen to me and give me an order to get a MRI. \n\nNot sure why this is being so difficult to get a routine MRI done. I thought those who have NF should get routines ones done anyways. My hair is pulled back and I do feel some sensation where the bump is. I hope this does not mean that it is too late to get removed. I am young and I do not want to die. I have had this for a few years. I am not even sure when I just thought I would mentioned it. It has gotten bigger and harder. Is that a bad sign? That is not necessarily bad, but it is a sign that someone should do a thorough assessment of the area. Based on the history you have given of the area, it may be a neurofibroma that has had a change. This should be evaluated. That may require MRI. It is difficult to say since I have not examined you.\nIt sounds like your current NF nurse is not taking your concerns seriously enough for your liking. You may want to establish care elsewhere with a physician or other clinician, though I know NF specialists are often hard to find.", "Shine a Light Book Drive for NF - Please share!

That is the thing about NF, it is kind of random. If she is never had major problems other than the cafe au lait and neurofibromas, I would say consider yourselves lucky. I have spent about the last decade of my 13 year old legally blind son's life getting chemo for him. NF is different for everyone and I am sure over time she will talk more about it. It is not something with an instruction book or list on what can or will happen. \nMine is super mild at 43 I have spots and a few bumps. My husband does not pay it any mind or ask much unless I have something going on. \nMy son has it, fairly mild so he is well aware of certain aspects. Ctf.org is a great place to start your search for information. Optic glioma? Yes. Optic glioma at 3. About 8 more over the next 8 years. His newest we got laser ablation surgery on, and now we are off chemo :) 8 optic glioma??? That is insane No, the optic glioma was the first tumor. The others were all over. The one we just had surgery on was in his brain. Neurofibromatosis can effect each person differently, so what happens to one person, may not happen your girlfriend. Some people have a mild case, some have a serve case and other are in the middle.\n\nI was not diagnosed until I was 15 and over the last twenty years I have had four surgeries, the last two were in 2014 and last April 2018, to remove tumors that had turned cancerous.\n\nI do walk with a limp, and have weakness that have progressed over the years.

I have no family history, couple years ago I was searching my body for cafe marks, I found ''6'' marks, all atypical/very-very faint and only 4 of them are 1cm+. I went to a derm twice over a period of 3 years, she concluded atleast 1-2 of them are hyperpigmentation (not birthmarks). I have no groin/armpit or any freckling in general, no neuro growths, normal MRI, no other symptoms. She checked my eye's for lisch nodules twice in two years, I have nothing except two flat-black freckles, one in each eye. I read hazel eyes can sometimes be harder to locate, I even went out of my way to buy a 16x magnifying glass to check with a flash-light in real time aswell as taken HD up-close photos, could not find/notice any change over 3 years let alone a single hint, in case she was indeed wrong (paranoid i know). I have never mentioned it but I get yearly eye check-ups, no ones ever even mentioned it either.  \n\n\nMy question is, if I indeed have 6 birthmarks, is it just nothing, and if I did have NF1 would it be safe to say I have a extremely-mild case that will remain around the same?  \n\n\nI am male, half IRISH, half ITALIAN.

I am a little confused about these differences. My dr. Did not know crap. It somewhat depends on your age.\nAlthough NF is progressive and can always get worse or have periods where \"new\" symptoms can appear (or previously unnoticed symptoms get worse) most of the time an influx of new fibromas would appear during a period of significant hormone changes.\n\nFor most individuals this occurs during childhood, and puberty. For women it can include pregnancy and menopause. But can also be triggered by significant stress.\n\nNot a for sure thing, but as a general rule patients do not experience too many new symptoms past young adulthoox,  but will always be at the risk of increased symptoms.\n\nTldr, if you are in your 20s or later and have not experienced any of the cutaneous fibromas I would not be too concerned with the possibility of their sudden appearance.", "What is your TL;DR explanation of your NF?

But was just after come advice from real experiences! \n\nBackground: our daughter stopped walking one day at 21 months, and we were taken to the hospital where the doctor noticed cafe au lait spot - we were previously told that due to her being mixed ethnicity these were her birth marks. Anyway we were then referred to the genetics team and paeds. She started walking after 8 or so hours in ED so they said more than likely that was transient synovitis. \n\nShe is now 2.5 years old, we have been on yearly paeds appointments, developmentally, she is grand, nil issues, makes friends, has a wild imagination and we have been told she is ahead of her mile stones. Because of this, the paeds Dr said that if she did not have these cafe au lait spots clustered under her arm pit she would not be under yearly review, and also that she will not be cleared from NF until she is 8. Her eye tests have come back fine too. I am just wondering, what sort of things do you notice in this age bracket? And also, had anyone had these cafe au lait spot and then been cleared of NF? \n\nWe are wanting to have another baby as well, and the paeds lady said my partner is more than likely the carrier - suspected NF, but not being followed up on. That each pregnancy would be a 50/50 of NF, I know there is varying degrees of NF, but for those who have it severely, what kind of impact does it have on your daily life? Thank you ::))  Hi. \n\nI cannot remember when I was a baby (lol) but I found out I had NF around the time I was 10 years old. I was not affected by it before than. I had the spots though, but thought nothing of them.   As you know everyone experiences NF in a different way. I personally do not have any C A spots under my arms though *freckling* in the arm pits and groin is a common sign of NF so keep an eye out for that.\n\nI only have a fairly mild case so my life is not too badly affected by it. \nFingers crossed your daughter is OK!  My son was diagnosed at 5 because of cafe au lair spots, although because there were so few, and because he had no other outward signs of the condition, we were offered a genetic test to tell us for sure if he had it. After it came back positive both myself and my wife also took the tests (cheek swans mailed out to us and then posted back).\n\nWe are in the UK so this was free on the NHS, access may vary in other countries, but if I were you I would look into getting your daughter (and husband) checked, if only for peace of mind. The test will just give you a yes/no, it cannot tell you anything about the severity of the condition, but I think it is good to know for sure. 1. No I do not have kids, I do have three siblings, but none of them have it. I have never been in a relationship either. I am just not at all interested in dating.\n\n2. It does unfortunately stop me from doing things. I cannot drive for long periods of times. I have trouble walking/standing for long period of time. My streagth has lessened over the years. I need to be able to get up and move around and then sit down when I need to. But this is not the case dr everyone, I just have one of the more serve cases according to my doctor.\n\n3. Yes, it causes nerve pain. The pain can be different for everyone. It can cause problem with bowel as my doctor always asking me about that, but I have had no issues. It can cause learning problem, which I am dyslexic, but so is my dad so I may have gotten that from him. And it can cause high blood pressure, which I do have, but high blood pressure runs in my dads side of the family. It does cause poor balaunce which at times I do have poor balaunce. And sadly sometimes the tumors can become cancerous. I ended up having a cancerous tumor removed from my right leg in 2014. I did not have chemo or radiation as that according doctor who specializes in nf said it can make nf worse.\n\n5. The only thing that it ever stopped me from doing in jumping in the pool. In 2007 I had surgery done on my spine to remove tumors that were pressing against it and ever since I just felt like I could not jump into the pool. I still go swimming in the pool, but just no jumping in.  Thank you very much, I appreciate it. All the best for the future ::)) Thank you. The same to you.  I got diagnosed at 9 months because of my cafe au lait spots and the markings under the armpit and near my groin. My question is does she have any raised bumps (kind of like purple pimples) anywhere on her body? Or raised pieces of flesh (still purple in colour) that look like scar tissue? \n\nHonestly, that is the only thing that makes my NF stick out. My eyes have always looked fine, but I do get annual checks. At her age I had no real signs, beyond my marks. \n\nI did get MRI's every other year to rule out tumours, which I did develop on my brain at the age of 9. Even when I had that I had no symptoms, and it would have never been caught had I not gotten the MRIs. I do not mean to scare you with any of this, I am just saying my story. \n\nSometimes symptoms hide, as some people do not know they have it until later in life. Even if they do rule her out at the age of 8 I would continue to get check ups every couple of years to be safe, but I am just a worrier about those type of things. For most people, they live normal lives without any issues. You would never know. \n\nBest of luck. ", "Disabled Parking Permits I have schwannomatosis, had one tumor removed from my brachial plexus, and have 3 more tumors in the L1-2 region of my spine.  I have been dealing with pain for quite a while.  Recently, after having to hobble up and down a Seattle hill to get to and from my car and work, I decided to ask my doctor is she would approve a disabled parking permit and she did.  It has changed my life.  I no longer have to park a long distance and walk if I cannot that day.  That means that I have more days of being in less pain because I do not have to push myself all the time.  If anyone here is experiencing pain and difficulty walking, I would encourage you to at least talk to your doctor about it.  It could make a huge difference in your quality of life, and disabled parking permits are not just for people in wheelchairs.   What is sad is that a lot of people do not see it that way. I am a perfectly healthy looking 26 year old who has a disable permit as well because of pain and many refer to it as \u2018princess parking\u2019. It irks me just because they do not know what I am going through because if it is not pain it is vertigo.  I know.  It took me a while to get over myself and even ask, because I felt like I am \"not disabled enough.\"  But what does that even mean?  That is why I thought I would bring it up, because I know that other people might feel the same way and just need to hear that it is okay.  \n\nAlso, my sister and I refer to it privately as \"gimpy parking,\" and I know that is offensive, but my friends in wheelchairs are the ones that taught me the phrase.  In any case, since that phrase is offensive, I am going to start using the phrase \"princess parking.\"  Hell, yeah.  I am a Princess.  Bow down, and let me park in the good spots. Hahah love it! If you ever come to Walt Disney World it will really be useful. Dang you get free valet parking and right up at the parks. It is fantastic ", "6 month old came back positive After seeing her spots and being encouraged here to have the genetic testing done, it had been confirmed my daughter has NF1. Now I do not know what to do....\n\nMy wife and I are now looking through things and trying to figure out our path forwards but the google searches are not that encouraging. Any advice for us on what to expect? You can expect your daughter will live a normal full life.  Do not be scared,  looking up NF1 on Google sucks.  Do not do that ! \n\nI am 38 , I have 3 beautiful daughters,  one has NF1.  I take her to normal eye check ups. But that is about it right now. To add to this, my dad is one of 3 and the only one with NF. He is in his 50s and just starting to have issues aside from migraines and bad vision (cancer scare)  \nI am 25 and one of 2 (currently pregnant) and have no issues aside from migraines and eye issues. Do not Google ever. Just watch and monitor and live your life. NF is not the be all end all. I am 21 years old. I am a junior in college and about to o be a senior. I am a cancer survivor and have been since 2009. I have own had two authors due to NF. NF can be bad and can be good. I have been connected with so many amazing people here and through discord. I love having NF and will not change it for the world. Please continue to reach out and or PM me! I am 21 years old and am in college and had NF1 since I was basically a few weeks old. The only issues I had, which may not even be NF related, is that my speaking ability was delayed a few years, but I took speech therapy all through elementary school and I am fine now. In terms of testing, my doctor's recommend semi routine blood test (up until I was 10ish) to make sure nothing bad happened. Other than that I just been monitoring my body and getting yearly checkups to make sure nothing is abnormal. Oh goodness, that is a hard thing to hear for sure. My heart goes out to you all and I was in your shoes 6 years ago.  The thing is, NF is such a different experience for each person. She may never have any sort of issue associated with the condition, or she could have some challenges.  There is no way to predict the future, so try not to waste energy on worry.\n\nHere are a couple of things I would offer as advice: \n\nGet involved with the Neurofibromatosis network &amp; The Childrens Tumor Foundation to learn more &amp; connect with other families. Some of my daughters best friends are from those orgs.\n\nGet in touch with your local NF Clinic - if you are not already aware, there is a network of docs &amp; specialists across the US that are closely familiar with NF. There is usually one in each state.\n\nStop googling. Please stop. You can drive yourself crazy with all of the different variables that go on with NF. My husband and I just try to take one NF issue at a time with our daughter, see specialists when needed, and stay in touch with the NF doc. No GOOGLING! ;) \n\nWhen all else fails, take a breath and hug that sweet baby. Please PM me if you want to talk. By eye issues....I have ocular migraine that have not ever been tracked down for a cause, my wife and I are both being tested now for nf1 to see if we are carriers As others have said Google tends to show the worst of the worst cases. Fortunately for most of us we live basically normal lives. Keep going to specialists monitor her development but otherwise let her live her normal life. I wish you the best I am 46 and live life to the fullest One of you has to have an \"active\" case of NF to pass it. If neither of you have it, your child is a spontaneous mutation. You would know if you have NF Thank you, our doctor has referred us to the NF specialist at the children\u2019s hospital here. Just hard not to go directly to dr google right? I have been reading on the children\u2019s tumor site since you posted. Thank you for that, it is a much better resource than what I had been looking at Thank you everyone for your posts, I will try not to go to Dr Google for a while till my mind catches up with what is going on. Our doctor reached out this afternoon and our kiddo has an appointment for her eyes, a neurologist appointment and an appointment with the NF specialist here in the next couple months so I am sure I will be reaching out for help as we navigate all this I love this :) I will for sure be reaching out a lot for help going forward, just need to wrap my head around it all You are so welcome! Children\u2019s Tumor Foundation has tons of activities for kids too (in the before times, of course). We thought it was super important that our daughter gets to know kids with a similar experience so she did not feel alone.  \n\nThe NF clinics are a godsend and a wonderful resource for the \u201cis this a fibroma or a normal kid thing\u201d questions. My advice is to stop googling and stop looking things up. Continue living your lives as you had before the diagnosis. Make sure to keep her up to date with her doctors appointments. If you have not already find her a doctor who specializes in Neurofibromatosis.\n\nThough doctors always suspected I had Neurofibromatosis as I showed signs, results for me were always inconclusive. It was not until I was 15 that I was diagnosed. I am 37 now. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. I have a beautiful life.  I have checkups,  I monitor changes.  There have been some rough parts, but all that makes me a unique person with unique perspective.\nEdit: typo I am diagnosed and I am 28 and I do not think I have ever really had issues... am I just lucky or should I prepare to be hit with a Mack truck? I will tell you about my experience \n\nHi. I am 28 years old female and I have not had any major issues. I have only had 2 surgeries to take out benign Tumors. One on my wrist and one on my left gut/love handle. They were just hurting me so I had them surgically removed. So far they have not grown back and it is been about 7 years for my gut/love handle and 10+ for my wrist. My wrist sometimes still hurt from where the tumor is but I think that is just because from just having NF1.\n\nA few other things I always had headaches frequently. It was in the same area for years. I have even had a MRI scan to check on my head but they found nothing. I had  sharp back pains as well and had a scan but they found nothing. But recently I have been going to a chiropractor and surprisingly they worked with people who has NF. (At least my doctors) and that helped with my headaches. \n\nI also think I have a slight speech impairment. So sometimes people think I have an accent but I do not lol. My voice is just distinctive and I do not know any other language. \n\nI know sometimes NF can lead to learning disability. I would not really say I have that but it does takes me a little more time to understand/learn something. \n\nAs for vision nothing are wrong with my eyes. I wear glasses but I just have bad eyesight due to just having bad eyesight lol. \n\nOther than that. I live a normal life style. I know online can get really scary and they bring out the worse cases. I do not have huge bumps sticking outside my skin I thank God for. But I do have a lot of spots on my body. Mostly on my back and tummy area so it is covered. And some on my face but people think I just have freckles!\n\nI know it can be very different from people to people. But again, most can live a normal life style and I hope your little one can too! Hope for the best! When you google NF1 it is a little scary because it shows you the worse of the worse.. I am 28 and have had NF1 since I was a baby. My case has been fairly mild .. I have cafe lua spots around my\nBody but nothing extreme, and I had to get two cyst removed thru out the years. Went to many different specialist thru our my younger days as a kid because my mother wanted all the info and test she could possibly get. Havent been to a NF1 doctor in about 15 years. There is a chance that I can give NF1 to my children but my partner and I plan on taking that chance and having multiple. My advice is to not use google and find a specialist. There are many out there that can help :) NF1 is a dominant mutation. You either have it , or do not. You cannot be a carrier. I am 20F, and inherited NF1 from my mother. Both my brother and I have NF1.  It can vary greatly. My brother had minor learning difficulties as a child that he quickly overcame and now he faces no issues whatsoever. \n\nI myself deal with a lot of chronic pain from the tumors and I am starting to develop the visible bumps. It can be difficult to feel good about yourself when it can cause visible deformities so there is that. This brings back memories! My daughter was diagnosed around 6 months as well. Shes 3 now and other than 1 visible tumor on her back, she has no other symptoms. \n\nI spent so many sleepless nights worrying about her. Like others have said.. dont google! If you do google, keep in mind that the pictures you see are extreme cases. Hi I am a little late but you do not have to worry. She can just have a normal life and google makes it much more worse then it is. In some countries there are special communities where you also can talk and see more information. My tip is only to give her check every few years to see if everything is alright. This is what most people will have, or I had to do", "What nutrition markers to check for? Hi all,\n\nHope everyone is well. My 2 year old was diagnosed with NF1 almost 2 years ago. I have been talking with a nutritionist about her diet. What do you folks keep an eye on in terms of nutrition levels through a blood draw? On my radar is: Vitamin D, Calcium, and Magnesium. What else?\n\nThanks! Well done for taking the initiative and being proactive on the diet front. I would suggest you do this with a registered dietician who has to go through formal training and testing instead of a nutritionist as it is a title that is not protected and anyone can call themselves a nutritionist. Some might be good, some might be bad and if they agree on you testing for calcium, it is a sign they are bad, because serum calcium will tell you nothing. Serum calcium (as opposed to skeletal calcium) is  tightly controlled and corrected by the body. Unless there is a disease such as thyroid or in the gut, the levels of blood calcium are homeostatic and maintained , the body will flush out excess calcium through gut or kidney, and pull calcium from bones is there is too little. \n\nNow to your question. You need to look for the micronutrients important for the immune system and the neurological system and they are **Vitamin D, Vitamin B12 , folate studies, iron studies, Omega 3 index (**this one will be cheaper with omegaquant, it is a prick test**) , zinc** . I have regular blood test and these are the ones I get\n\nTo get an idea of the daily dietary intake from food, ( is an excellent free resource but you need to be aware that we seem nutrients in a food and the body's ability to extract and use them are two different things.  \n\nWe  do not process two out of the three macronutrients in a normal way. We have an abnormal glucose metabolism (we are extremely insulin sensitive)  and an abnormal lipid metabolism (we store fat in muscle). In the same way, I believe, we do not process several micronutrients in a normal way. Whatever we are tested for, we are always deficient compared to general population independently of dietary intake.  \n\nI hope that our nutritional profile and needs will one day be looked at by researchers as a whole, instead of single nutrient or function. Thank you. So helpful as always. How do you test for calcium levels if not through serum calcium? Are there ways to test skeletal calcium or not really? I would speak a Neurofibromatosis specialist or someone familiar with the condition. I have been living with Neurofibromatosis for 38 years, I was diagnosed when I was 15. I have been able to eat everything my mom cooked at home. The second one. You cannot measure skeletal calcium with a blood test but you can with different types of imaging, some fancy CT or the classic DEXA scan which should also give an idea of bone calcium. \n\nYou can measure several bone markers in blood, such as bone formation, resorption , turnover but I do not think it is warranted here. I do not do them. I have however a yearly DEXA scan to monitor bone loss. \n\nWe know our poor bone quality is not due to dietary calcium intake. Still, it is a good idea to increase our calcium rich food and to supplement with vitamin D and K2. Micronutrients act in synergy and are often co-factor to one another. Given our bone capital is mainly created in the first two decades, and terminates once we reach the age of 30, it is vital for us to optimise our bones in the early years with diet and exercise. \n\nBone health is incredibly complicated. Calcium and magnesium compete for absorption and transport, and the ratio will favour the higher, so to minimise this, if taking both, they should be taken separately, in natural food, however, they are usually balanced. \n\nYour daughter is 2, plenty of time to optimise bone, ideally have calcium rich food at the same time of protein, because proteins matter for bones. I eat firm tofu (with calcium as firming agent so I get the calcium from soy and calcium from calcium sulphate) , which combines both calcium and protein for example . Plant sources of calcium need to be understood, because one , such as spinach, might have a good content of calcium on paper, but its oxalate content means you will not absorb 75% of it. Again a way of testing your nutritionist, if she recommends spinach ditch her/him\n\nBrenda Davis has written a good book on nutrients from plants. It is called becoming vegan. Even non-vegan can benefit from it. I have never heard of that. I have had NF1 since birth (26 now) and eat whatever I want. Be careful trying to control your child's diet too much. You can cause an eating disorder in her. What sort of issues outside would occur if certain levels are too high or too low? It is not something I test for it never been mentioned by my specialists they basically say do not worry about stuff like that x I do not know that it is at a level where clinicians are recommending these kinds of life choices. But there is some research on vitamin D levels being lower for people with lots of neurofibromas. And a Mediterranean diet being linked to better outcomes for people with NF1. I am sure there are people here who have more of an expertise on this. I like posts from u/BooksAndCoffeeNf1 Thank you. Luckily I do a lot of research about these things and actually do a lot for my health outside of what the NF team tell me. I take a vitamin D supplement. Here in the U.K., checking these kinds of levels just is not done. I am documenting my Nf journey on a blog and Instagram. X I read a study last week about plants and meningiomas. The minerals (?), from lemon, citrus fruits, fresh ginger and mushrooms shows a reduction in meningiomas so I have incorporated those in to my life some more. Well ginger because I drink lemon water and eat fruit daily. I also take a lot of mushroom supplements x In 1999, for the first time, a study reported that inhibiting MEK  blocked the NF1 cells proliferation. ( \n\nIt took **22 years** for that discovery to be translated into the first ever approved drug for NF1 , Koselugo.  Twenty-two years even if the drug test on existing MEK inhibitors for cancer were started in 2001 for NF1.  This is the normal time frame of discoveries in research being translated into a change in protocol or guideline. 15-20 years is the absolute minimum. \n\nWe have known for more than a decade than inflammation is linked to neurofibromatosis ( . What we know since 2019 is that inflammation is **needed** to drive neurofirboma formation.    ( \n\nIn 2017 , an Italian study demonstrated how a high polyphenol Mediterranean diet improved number and volume of neurofibromas and plexiform when complemented with curcumin. (  If you take the time to look at the pictures, it is quite impressive. \n\nIn Italy, the NF1 clinics now offer nutritional advice as part of their services \"un approccio dietetico-nutrizionale alle sindromi genetiche con aumentato rischio tumorale (per esempio, le neurofibromatosi).     \" ( a dietary-nutritional approach to genetic syndromes with increased tumor risk (for example, neurofibromatosis). \n\nMany single studies have looked at one nutrient or the other in nf1 and found that we were deficient in anything that is looked at. Slowly correlation/association are being identified such as the one for vitamin D for example. The levels of vitamin D are inversely correlated to the burden of neurofibromas (   . The paper I just linked is from 2019 .... but we know about the role of Vitamin D in NF1 gene expression since 1994 ( (click on pdf and look at the table)  . That is a sweet **25 years .**  \n\nAnd I could on and on and on. \n\nWe understand and define vitamin as \" you do not have this one and you will get this disease\" missing the fact that every vitamin and mineral  influences hundreds of genes, boosting or reducing their expression.  A deficiency in a vitamin can cause chromosome damage such as folate deficiency for example  causing DNA instability.  ( In Nf1 we need to protect ourselves from DNA damage to prevent the famous second hit on the functioning copy of Nf1 gene we have. So eating leafy greens protects my DNA from damage, good to know. \n\nResearch is fund-starved in NF1 and nutrition is highly complicated. People do not want to make sacrifices and give up their ice-cream or burger. They want a pill. The university of Minnesota understands that and they are going to repeat the Italian study high polyphenol and curcumin minus the \"Mediterranean diet \" part, offering a higher polyphenol olive oil and stronger curcumin pill and the reason given to skip the diet part, was exactly that, people do not want to make an effort. \n\nStill , it is good that 4 years after the first study on diet , a second one will soon start, even if the \"diet \" part is missing. \n\nBases on the available science, it seems that  increasing inflammation-lowering food high in polyphenols such as vegetables, fruits, legumes, spices can maybe - hopefully -  help controlling the severity of our manifestations. In addition to this specific NF1 recommendations , given our high cancer risk (59.6 %) , the same diet might offer some protection (thousands and thousands of papers on pubmed)  . In addition to that, given the emerging science on our increased risk of dementia, again that same diet might lower said risk (hundreds and hundreds of paper on pubmed) . \n\nAs I said earlier, it takes 15-20 years for guidelines to change or in the case of nutrition to be created. So maybe **in 2037** (20 years after the Italian study ) , we will be told to supplement with this or that , eat this , do not eat that.  One can wait, or one can start adding some blueberries, spinach , lentils, fresh herbs in our trolley  at the next supermarket trip.  And during one of the annual check up or random blood test, start looking at vitamin D levels for example.  Nothing crazy or drastic. I would love to read you if you feel like sharing your blog (in a private message if you prefer to do so) . Thank you so much for sharing so much detailed information I will be sure to be referring back to this over time! This must have taken you so long! I do agree we need to research diet and supplements, I completely cut out sugar, processed foods and most animal products and my overall quality of life improved massively. It was not a sustainable life choice for me, so I relaxed that a little and do 80/20 now. I have written a blog about that which I may update today actually as I have since had a meningioma removed. I know it seems like my work \u201cis not working\u201d but leaving my consultant and her team speechless because I had no symptoms and some other positive news from them, I am saying ok we have not stopped the growth yet but I have handled it like a rock star. X x So this post was written in 2019, since then overall my quality of life has remained stable, but as I say I had a large meningioma surprise me this year! I will include that in here one day, but for now just letting you know here because this is such a positive post, what happened when I changed my diet etc was such a wonderful change and I felt so well, finding out this year I had a meningioma really took the wind from my sails I work so hard on my lifestyle it was so devastating to me. However as I said before, trying to look at the good news that came with the meningioma x \n\n I did write a lot but obviously I did not write enough. One word: sulforaphane . \n\nThis is the compound that seems to work better for NF2 \n\n( \n\n( \n\nAnd supporting a disease with diet means exactly that \" supporting\" , trying to minimise complications. Nobody ever said, me included, \"just eat a carrot  or whatever and all will be fine\"  . This is nonsense. You should not believe your work and research on diet is less worthy because you had a meningioma. You have a tumour inducing disorder, so you with NF2 and me with Nf1, we will get tumours, but they might be small, manageable, operable and asymptomatic. We might delay their onset and we might prevent all the other complications as well. \n\nOur tumours are the result of a cascade of events that happen on several biochemical pathways. When they occur, it is not one protein or one enzyme alone. \n\nI have managed to reduce my neurofibromas with diet, but as I get older, and my immune systems weakens, my SIRTUINS become less effective and efficient, I will accumulate errors and mutations , and I might get new ones, but so far I am confident that even if cannot avoid tumours 100%, I will have avoided many of them. \n\nBy following a plant rich whole food diet, without ultra-processed or inflammatory food you are giving your body and yourself the best chances at minimising the impact NF will have on you. \n\nWell done. Just read your post on your blog . Your story on how your tumours became smaller and softer is so inspiring. Thank you for sharing it. I have talked with several people around the world that support their NF with some diet changes. \n\nI have been doing it since March 2017. I did it as a cancer preventing diet and like you, I was surprised when my neurofibromas went away. The Italian study was only published later around July , so what I had experienced was not found in the literature. I was shocked in a what-the-heck is going on, how did this happen, why and what made it happen. \n\nFour years and thousands of medical papers later, I still do not know the exact why, how and what, but the more I read, the more annoyed I become that nobody ever told us that diet matters. Thank you so much. I very much mirror your behaviour and thoughts around diet! Even if it only improves quality of life, surely that is the job of our Doctors to point us in that discretion x x Thank you so much for all of your advice and taking your time to share this.

I only expected about 45 mins. I had no idea of time or what day it was. Glad this part over for the year for you.  Best of luck on your results! was it a full body scan? I never had one of those. Only partial ones. Do not they have music? It was a brain (I am not sure if they found one l) a neck and spine. I had music for the first 30 minutes then it went quite so I was left with my thoughts. The people performing the MRI typically do not examine the results, just take them to your doctor. Yes I agree that was my attempt at humour. They only way I can get through days like today. These long ones are terrible, I completely agree and feel for you. I have been getting MRIs of my brain/spine, with/without contrast for about 25 years.\n\nI would encourage you to look into meditation and mindfulness. This might sound ridiculous, but I have been able to train myself to kind of zone out for most of the MRI, or at least sleep through most of it. \n\nThe meditation/mindfulness is also very helpful for dealing with the general stress/bullshit of NF2, outside of the MRI tube as well. :-) Yes I have looked into it before but never really done much. But I thought of it all today from closing my eyes , breathing exercises and thinking how good the McDonald\u2019s was going to be later just anything else than the scan.  \n\nI did learn there is no radiation on an MRI. 2 1/2 hours is normal for me. The longest I have been in one is four hours. I had a full body one done (first without, then with contrast) and it took almost 3 hours. I ended up falling asleep in the machine! I woke up very confused \ud83d\ude02 I was in one for about that long before, I have a spot in the brain they are monitoring and a few plexiform one in my leg and a bunch in my back.\n\nIt was the worst one I had ever done, I can normally sleep ( that hum and the temp lulls me to sleep.\n\nSo they did the first set then came in and tied my feet together so I kept them still.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nat about 1 hour 45 minutes into it my back (which like many is messed up) stated killing me being stuck on that hard surface, the last hour was an agonizing pain to the point I was in tears by the time I got out of the machine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni feel you, it is not fun I had a brain, spine, and one full leg scan once. I think it was meant to last 3-3.5 hours? Two thirds of the way through they commed in to tell me to stop fidgeting my leg, I told them I was not moving it, they then decided to end the scan and get me out so I could stretch and stop the shaking. Fun times! I had one done recently after getting my cochlear implant installed, and it literally took five hours because they had to go super slow.  I could not even get all of the scans done because I was there past their closing time. Most do offer music, but given all the noise the MRI makes for the scans you cannot really hear the music, at least in my experience you do not. Odd. I can hear the music just fine. Must be a different system. Maybe Yes I was confused had to ask a few times how long was I in and what time it was. If you are having issues lying still it is possible to be put into narcosis, but that shit just messes your head up and leaves you drowsy. Yeah I would but can react badly to it. If I had know it was that long I would of refused so it was best I never knew how long. MRI scans do indeed suck, but unfortunately those of us who have the diagnose just have to get used to regular check ups as it is very important to detect changes in time.

I watched this youtube video and it inspired some ideas\u2026.. I would even be willing to let a researcher use crispr on me as an experiment if it makes it worse it makes it worse at least it would be research about the technology on this horrible disease we have.   Hi Colorado,\n            \nResearcher in the NF1 field here. Great question, there are certainly promising applications for CRISPR to treat any genetic disease such as NF1, whether it is caused by a random mutation or familial inheritance. There are a number of labs using CRISPR to develop new therapies for NF1, so hope is on the horizon that some of these will pan out. If you are serious about being the first to try any of these new therapies, find an ( near you and register with them to be included for clinical trials. One of the major hurdles in designing clinical trials for NF1 is the lack of patient participants, so you would be more than welcome wherever you live. \n\nThe main hurdle in NF1 CRISPR is delivery - we need to make sure the CRISPR machinery goes exactly where we want it to go. Neurofibromin (the protein that is encoded by the NF1 gene mutated in neurofibromatosis) is a GIANT protein. Parts of the protein match really closely with other proteins that are essential for us to be healthy, so we are worried about off target effects. We also still do not have a great idea about what mutations in NF1 cause what phenotype, and if it is even worth it to go in and start repairing individual components of the NF1 gene. The answer to that is probably going to be only in some situations. \n\nHope I answered your question, open to any questions you or anyone reading this may have. I am very serious about being the first or one of the first.   We must find a cure for this disease! Unfortunately it is very very difficult to try these things right away in humans. Your best bet is the research clinics above, if you want to DM me your closest clinic I can see if there is any CRISPR or other clinical trials ongoing. I understand, I sent you a DM! Awesome post! Never heard of it, but I have been on Koselugo since June and I feel that it is working. I will likely know within the next couple of months when I am sure my doctor will want new MRIs done.

Now my new insurance does, but the way I was put on the drug program to receive the medication for free was done by my doctor office special pharmacy, they applied me for the program and I was temporarily approved for it.

And what are you most excited about when it comes to NF treatments (crispr or other)? Thanks \ud83d\ude0a I knew someone who passed away from NF2 and wanted to try helping find a cure with my own set of skills. I am excited for any therapy beyond pharma companies trying to repurpose their failed kinase inhibitors for NF1. While selumetinib has been a great drug for some patients, it is not that innovative. It failed 6 clinical trials before it worked in NF1. We know enough about NF that we can start to design specific drugs for the disease and there is a lot of great work being done in both the small molecule therapeutic space, the gene editing space, and the biology space of better defining why NF occurs (and most importantly why it metastasizes) Thanks for your work. I am sorry about your friend passing. Hey, if you would not mind, do you know if there is been any progress on nonsense suppression, either for nf1 or in general?\n\nLast I read was Ataluren flopping in phase 3 for CF. Excellent question. You are pretty much up to date with where the nonsense suppression field is at after the failed Ataluren trial. There has been promise using it in muscular dystrophy though. For NF1, we still do not really know how much neurofibromin protein is needed to restore NF1 patients back to a healthy state. We actually now think that nonsense mutations lead to more severe disease phenotypes, so there could still be promise for these types of therapies even if we cannot restore protein level to completely cure a patient. If I see any new studies pop up I will come back here to let you know. Yeah, that is what I was thinking. Too bad. My son's got a nonsense mutation and a moderate phenotype - he is only 5 but already has optic gliomas and a few cutaneous neurofibromas. No plexiforms thankfully.\n\nPTC therapy is weird, I remember reading a publication that mentioned that even the specific codon causing the premature termination could affect the success rate of therapy when using Gentamicin. ", "Internal \u2018tumor\u2019 problems Did anybody had problems with tumors internal in there body and how could you be helpt?\n\nI apparently have a small one in my foot between the bones from two toes.  I cannot walk on that foot on a normal way.  I mostly do not walk at all anymore (I also had a broken bone before around the same place(?)). And the little I walk inside the house, I only use the outside of my foot.\nThe last status of the hospital is that they maybe can do a operation but they actually said it is20/25% that it will be helpful. And now Im kind of freaking out because I cannot walk, move, stand long. And 20/25% does not sound hopeful and the waiting list is up to a year! thanks to covid.  They will try to move me up but still I do not know. \nI want to try to convince some people to try to get a second opinion because I do not think this person is familiar with NF (the local hospital where I was when the bone was broken send me to a larger hospital and that doctor did not understand why I was there) .\nI just hope somebody can give some good own experience because I am over the point of breaking down and the thought of never being able to walk anymore really scares me. I would get the opinion of someone who is familiar with Neurofibromatosis, because these tumors can be very hard to remove and a doctor and surgeon who is not at all familiar with these tumors and how they wrap themselves around the nerve could be overwhelmed. \n\nYears ago when I was in highschool, I needed to have surgery on my arm to remove nf tumors. This surgeon lied to my parents and myself that he had removed nf tumors in other people before. It turns out he had not and when he opened my arm up, he saw how difficult it was. He still did the surgery, but told my mom that he would never preform another surgery on me again. I would get a second opinion if you can. I have a lot of issues with my internal tumors. While they try to leave them alone when they can, if they are causing you that much pain it warrants somthing being done. \n\nI am sorry your having such a hard time. You may want to first find an NF neurologist. Then an (MD) NF physical therapist who can prescribe a padibob (which is a form of arch/foot support) fitted to your foot. A brace company can form the padibob to not press on your tumors. My daughter had a set  prescribed to help her walk  more firmly (She has tumors in her feet, hands and everywhere).\n After I sent a copy of her PT doctor's prescription the insurance paid their percentage of the claim. \nKeep copies of your handd written prescriptions that may be challenged by the insurance company. The problem I am running into is that there are not really a lot of doctors familiar with it.  I went to the hospital last year to get more information and basically it was just \u201ccome by when something is wrong\u201d. And no extra information :(. The rules with Insurance up properly for every different here or in the Netherlands but sometimes maybe easier.\nI am trying to get send to a other hospital or at least a second Opinion. \nI googled brace and found something that maybe can help. Sort of puzzle (med surge puzzle) that can maybe help. Maybe just buy it myself to try That is unfortunate. If possible I would really look for a specialist, as it does someone like something is going on and you should get it looked it. Did some research and going to discuss with somebody.  Send that person about 10 links to websites that I should visit a specialist and that they advice to have checkups and stuff like that.  I hope it will at least give me a second opinion on my foot.  And besides that finally more information Hopefully it all works out for you. I wish you the best that you get the help that you need.", "Am is it just me or does it happen to you as well? A while back I decided to go the gym and start working out. I didnt really change my diet much other then less soda. I started to notice more bumps growing around my body the more I worked out. Has this happened to you at all? I want to give working out another try and was wondering if this was just in my head. As I am losing weight I have been discovering more. I do not know if they were already there and I can just see them now I have noticed that my \"bumps\" tend to go up and down in accordance to my weight fluctuations. I think its just that depending on your fat content they become more or less visible. I literally lift every day and see no difference That Is what I was thinking. I was think my fat was just hiding them Thanks for the feedback! Has diet affected you at all. Ive heard high protein diets cause tumor growth. Since you lift i assume you eat lots of protein Yeah my diet is pretty good. Lots of protein, zero alcohol, zero soda, zero dairy, low fat, low sugar. I have many bumps but they are like small mosquito bite shaped. I have some larger ones but most are about that size and do not increase with my exercise regimen, If your lift weights it is possible the tumors you have are move around. That is one of the reasons why my neurofibromatosis doctor has given me a weight limit and that I should not ever lift weights other than maybe the 3-5 pound ones. Now this would likely vary from person to person as neurofibromatosis effects everyone differently Your doctor is a pos. Lift like your life depends on it because it goddamn does. Being fit will help you so much more than that shitty doctor. I have been lifting since I was 13 and am now 40. Fitness will get you through so much and help you recover from surgery if you have it. I am nearly shaking with anger that your doctor would mislead you. I am furious. I would gladly yell at that fumble fuck for you. You are a horrible person. You have absolutely no idea how much my doctor has done for me, how much he has helped me. You have no idea how severe my neurofibromatosis is. I have pain all the time. My body is covered in tumors. I have had cancerous tumors removed. So the next time you want to bad mouth someone doctor, a person who is a total stranger to you. I suggest you just keep your lips sealed. \n\nNot everyone who has neurofibromatosis is the same. Some people have it way worse than you. So yes I have restrictions on how much I can lift, you are lucky you do not. I also have nf with tumors all over my body. Lifting has saved my life. 3-5 libs will cause no change and is not exercise in any way, shape, or form. Good luck to you in your life. Ctf.org if you want to educate yourself or find a doctor who will actually help you. My doctor is great, so again keep you opinion to yourself. My doctor is one of the top in the field, he written papers and numerous other things. We are all effected differently. And lifting weights is not the only way to stay hit and healthy. So stop with your pigheaded attitude towards my and towards my doctor. You know nothing about me or my doctor. You do not know the size of my tumors, you do not know each and every one of their locations, you do not know what I experience each and every day and you do not know my doctor, who has done way more for me than you will ever possibly know. You have no idea, so shut the f up unless you want to apologize, but I highly doubt you can do that. Good luck to you. I hope you get the treatment you need. Remember, you got angry at someone who wanted to stand up for you. Goodbye. I am getting the treatment I need and you did not stand up for me. My doctor is the top in the state, the only one who sees adult patients with neurofibromatosis. So do not think you did me any favors. Get it, through that thick skull of yours, the world does not revolve around you, people are not all like your nor is anyone who has neurofibromatosis, it effects everyone differently. We are all not the same. You have no idea what is in my medical file, so do not think you know what is best for me. Worry about yourself!", "Do any of you find having a \"good looking\" body worth it? By this I do not mean being excessively fat or anything, but more so, fit or muscular. I recently dropped around 60 pounds, now all that excess weight I have sits on me at some places. While I do look good in clothes, when I take them off, not so much lol. I cannot really justify in my head to build muscle because due to my condition my skin looks like crap anyways, so whenever I go to the gym I just do cardio. Does anyone else share this obscure thought with me? I go to the gym to body build. building muscle and making my muscles stronger is something that I am in control of.  Hell yes. It is totally worth it. People do not notice those bumps as much as you think. They will notice the difference between a sad, dumpy, lonely person with low self confidence and someone who works hard to make themselves healthy and happy. It is all about confidence.  Even if you feel like you do not look good, being fit and strong is good for your overall health which would make it worth while. My doctor recommended being active so that if something did go wrong, I would be in the best position to deal with it.  I would rather be as healthy as I can be than not. Would you rather be a fit person who happens to have NF, or do you want to look like somebody who does not respect themselves and also has NF on top of that? Also if you have a healthier lifestyle, your cells will be healthier in general.  Late to the party but yes. I have worked out in the gym since I was 15, I will be 34 in March. It has done and still does so much more for than just build muscle. It is a huge mental stress reliever. Also since I was never very good at team sports it gave me something I could excel at as an individual through dedication alone. Gaining muscle will make you feel confident even if you are not happy with your skin but you will get more out of it than that. If you want I could lay out a program for you if you want to give it a try.\n Hey dude no problem! And if you could lay out a program I would appreciate it.

I talked with my doctor but they are never sure what to tell me. \n\nAlso, did you perform any test for NF on the foetus? \n\nThank you for your answers and support I gave birth to three children. One has NF1 like me. While pregnant the tumors grew like crazy thousands of them large and tiny. Talk to your doctor and get genetic counseling. I am 31 and have NF1 and had my little girl 6months ago. I was fine with no tumours but mine is quite mild. I nearly did go for tests when I was pregnant but they are risks of miscarriage so never had one although when my little girl was born they took bloods and found out she does have NF1 as well. I am in almost exactly the same spot as you are u/lexdokmai. Currently at an age where I really need to decide what to do in terms of pregnancy. I am terrified that if I will become pregnant, my neurofibromas will grow so explosively that it will do irreversible damage. I find this to be such a difficult decision. I am currently 26 weeks pregnant with my first and there has not been anything new growth. A study from last year looked at the growth of neurofibromas during pregnancy and here are the conclusions: \n\n\"Growth of plexiform and cutaneous neurofibromas in pregnant patients is not significantly different compared to non-pregnant patients. Cutaneous neurofibromas show a significant increase in growth over time in both, pregnant and non-pregnant patients and NF1 related clinical symptoms do not significantly aggravate during the course of pregnancy.\" \n\nYou can read the whole study here. ( \n\nI personally saw a handful, 5 or 6 new neurofibromas . Would have I had them  if I had not been pregnant, who knows. \n\nAt the time of my pregnancies, I did not know I had Nf, so did not test, but I now know that my two late miscarriages were probably caused by my NF1. We have a higher risk of miscarriage and still birth. \n\nTest are not only available during pregnancy but also BEFORE. You can have Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis shortened in PGD so that only embryos not carrying the mutation are implanted.

And it is sounding like Michigan is going to end the school year. The one good thing about the school at work at, for the kiddos anyways is that since it is a private catholic school the bishop already said that the online learning the teachers and kids have been doing will count. Not so sure about the public school it was stated earlier that it would not count, but I have feeling that is going to have to change, because otherwise what is the point of all the kids and teachers doing the online learning if it will not count? \n\nThe one thing I am bummed about is, because this whole virus thing happened, I was in the process of being able to be put into a trial. Just needed to get back with me about an appointment to come in and go over stuff. Sadly not the first time my chance at a trial was put to a hold. Back in 2014 I was going to be in one, but then I was diagnosed with a cancerous tumor in my leg. Hopefully once this virus thing is gone and things get back to normal, they will be able to do the trial still.

Guess who did not know about that? Me. \n\nI am super scatterbrained right now, but the guy I talked to from radiology or neurology said he checked everything and he did see something small come up in the scans, but it is not a fibroma so that is good and it is looking like that is not something to raise too much concern about. He did mention a narrowing of the proximal left middle cerebral artery (I had to check my online chart again to cross-check that), which he wants me to get checked out by a specialist to play it safe since apparently this kind of thing is common with those who have NF1 (or NF in general).

It is shameful that medical professionals have decided that they know better than you what is best for your life, and that at 31 (!) you apparently still cannot be trusted to know your own mind.\n\nThat said, if you want to try an IUD instead or in the interim while you are pursuing a permanent procedure, I would suggest talking to your primary care doctor or gynecologist. I have not heard that NF is a risk factor or contraindication to certain IUDs, but I do not know.\n\nI had an IUD before my tubal ligation, but it was the non-hormonal kind (Paragard) so it did not help with regulating cycles.

Mirena and Kyleena are made by the same company. Find a new Dr.  It is your choice  not anyone else  and you should not be made to feel anything but support from you medical team regardless of their personal feelings. the IUD is a great option for people with NF1. progesterone-based birth control pills / nexplanon cause progesterone to circulate throughout your body, increasing risk of tumor growth. the IUD makes the progesterone stay in your reproductive organs mainly. i think it would be a better option.  \n\n\nthe thing about being told \"you are young\" genuinely pisses me off. you need to see a better specialist. the fact individuals with uteruses are being refused autonomy in 2020 amazes me. you are in control and you deserve the choice on whether or not to have kids. i recommend using your nf1 as the reason for removing your uterus if that is what you are aiming for, because i guess \"i simply do not want kids\" is not enough nowadays. yuck. Thank you so much! I feel the same way about the IUD and the additional progesterone. I really do not want an IUD, they know that too. They still kind of pushed it on me, and made it seem like nothing else was available or an option. It is disheartening to have to push for what I think is better for my body. I know my rights, and it is so hard to find a doctor who is willing to take my health and feelings seriously. Thank you!! It is really frustrating that I cannot seem to find a doctor that will actually listen. They are fully aware of why I want this done. Even my Cardiologist agreed that it would not be a bad choice for me. (I see a heart doctor and was placed on a heart monitor, every time I am on my cycle my heart rate is high and it causes Sinus tachycardia.) so my Cardiologist think it is linked to my cycle. She is running a bunch of blood test to check my hormones. If we can eliminate my cycle my health could greatly improve. Even with them knowing this it is still a battle. I really appreciate all this information! I have a note book I have wrote all the information I have gotten and learned. I am taking it with me and pushing for this. I know my insurance will cover what their suppose to so I know that will not be an issue thankfully. I am pulling for you! I agree the IUD is great for people with NF with the research I have done and been told about on this post. Myself and my cardiologist think my cycle is causing Sinus Tachycardia.

If you are not on them already, talk to your doctor. More and more treatments are available then most doctors know. See a second doctor or even a third. Get specialized treatment. \n\nIt is tough. I know. \n\nAlso, mental health. If you are not seeing a therapist, do so. Please. My pain had gotten worse ass well, I have just been prescribed gabapentin and it has been helping me greatly. I have been on Gabapentin for years now. As of today actually, I am coming off the Gabapentin and am switching to Lyrica.  It is the only option for now. I have to talk with my neurologist and get another EMG of my right and left arms.   My pain management doctor also wants to see the images of my last MRI of my cervical spine. Also if my neurosurgeon approves it I can get a epidural shot to try and block the pain.  Until all that is taken care of, which will be hard cause the docs do not want people in the office unless it is absolutely necessary., it is just a waiting game. I do 'see' a therapist every two weeks, but I just found out the due to insurance stuff, I now have to find new one.  Last year I had 12 treatments of Avastin, but there was no change in the size of any of my tumors.  The worst part is that starting the day after my first treatment, I have had the chills come and go all day every day.  I am am always cold and get goose bumps almost all the time. None of my doctors can explain it.  I also feel that most people just blow it off like it is no big deal, that is what upsets me the most.\n\nI also told my doctor that I do NOT want any type of opiate.  I was addicted to them for over ten years, and lost those years of my life. My last MRI's (of my brain, cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine) was last October.  It was right after six months of Avastin treatments, which did nothing to shrink any of my tumors. \n\nI also have had MRI's of my chest.  Tumors were found.  I had an ultrasound of my heart and a stress test and those results did not show any problems.  At least my heart is healthy. Oh, I cannot forget an EMG of my right arm ( those tests suck ), and was originally told I had carpel tunnel.  This was followed up by the MRI's of my arm, and of course there are tumors there as well. Sorry to hear that it is taking so long. It seemed like nobody wanted to help my pain and finally got prescribed gabapentin hopefully it keeps working. Yes, I too have tumors all throughout my body. On the 9th of next month, my nf spiciest has me set to see a neuro surgeon, I have tumors on my cervical spine again and will likely need another surgery. I had surgery on my cervical spine back in 2006. \n\nI also take two different pain medications, if the MRIs are not showing anything that would raise concerns to have surgery, maybe you could talk with your doctor about medication that could help. Keep on going, fam. It is hard. And everyone has a different experience which is part of the maddening process. Between the two of us we would have vastly different experiences with the same disease process. This is a small community here and we are not very active, but know that you do have support here or at the very least a few people willing to listen. Like you said, most people do not realize that this disorder affects people very differently.  One person can differ totally from another.  I have had my own sister say to me, \"Tommy\" ( my twin brother ), can do so and so, so why cannot you. If he can do it you should be able to do it. Pisses me off. Your sister is just ignorant.  She really needs to be sat down and have it explained to her. When I had my Avastin treatment, he put down that I had a brain mass, so insurance would cover it. According to what I saw from the billing department, each treatment cost over 100,000 dollars. Mika, have you been offered Ketamine infusions coupled with Ketamine tablets (for break-thru pain)? I did special K 27 years ago, made me feel drunk You mentioned Ketamine.  Just now I got a Rx in the mail of different creams to use prescribed by my pain management doctor.  One of them contains 5% Ketamine, 4% Gabapentin, and 10% Dimethyl Sulfoxide.  I use to take Gabapentin until yesterday, I switched to Lyrica cause I felt the Gabapentin was not working anymore.  I was on the max dose of 1,200mg 3X daily.\n\nThe other  creams just have other similar ingredients, I think.\n\nHow was your Ketamine given to you?\n\nIn my other comment I was saying that Ketamine use to be called \"Special K\".  It would come in a vial.  You would put it in a pain and 'cook' it until it turned into a powder.  You would then snort it, and it would give you a high.  This was 23 years ago and was a very stupid thing to do. My daughter had Ketamine infusions at the hospital. Her pain doctor also had Ketamine tabs made for her (which  dissolved under her tongue) . Hi was given Ketamine cream. I am sorry the pain is so rough. \nFind a reputable pain management practice.  They may not be able to completely get rid of the pain, but they should be able to reduce it to a more manageable level.   And it is not just meds that they can give you.  There are lots of procedures such as nerve root blocks and rhyzotomies which prevent the pain signal from reaching your brain.  \nI do not recommend opioids for routine pain management.  I have experienced first hand how over time they not only become less effective, requiring you to take more, but they also confuse your brain about pain, making your brain react even more acutely to pain sensation.  Taken occasionally is no problem but daily will eventually increase your pain. I see pain management once a month. I told them no opioids.  I was on Gabapentin for 3 years and it stopped working, just this month I switched to Lyrica.  I think it helps.  I might have a nerve block around C6 but need approval from my Neurosurgeon first. Two years ago he did not recommend it, but I am going to ask again and get more info.  Last year's I had 6 months of treatment, 12 infusions of Avastin, but sadly none of the tumors shrank.", "NF or Fibro What was once believed to be fibromyalgia my doctors now believe is attributed to my NF. \n\nHas anyone on here dealt/or is dealing with .....intense pain, especially located in one part of the body, vertigo, memory issues, and plain old fatigue? I know NF comes with A LOT of underlying issues (because fibromas just are not enough) but was wondering if anyone else has these symptoms or similar? I have a cyst in my spine that is causing pain in my abdomen \n\nBut I mainly have back pain and daily headaches I am so worried about a tumour on my spine due to the pain I experience but insurance will not get me an MRI until I get X-rays Just so you know even if it is there they might not do anything, I have plexiforms against the spine that they will not touch because although they are causing pain they are not threatening and it is extremely invasive. \n\nNF as you know is just a pain to deal with. My mom has all of the above symptoms that you mentioned. She has plexiform NF2. I had a tumor on my tibia that caused a break, had to have surgery 15 or so years ago. I have all the symptoms you listed above. Pain especially in my leg, but also in most of my fingers as well. What do you do to manage it? Sadly, nothing. There is not much I can do in Ohio. Painkiller Rx are very hard to get, and our Medical Marijuana bill in absolutely trash. So I just kind of live with it. I am in FL and am waiting for everything to be approved by our marijuana bill....hoping that helps Hope it helps you. :)", "Neurofibromas on breast Title basically. I (19F) have several fibromas on both breast (both under and on the skin). I know NF comes with an increased risk of breast cancer, so I am a bit concerned. \n\nAnyone else have this? \n\nTagged NSFW just in case.", "Pain management. What do you guys do for pain management.  I have several plexiforms in my neck and back. I am trying to see what other people use for pain management. I usually just use Tylenol 500mgs. But lately the Tylenol has not been helping. I do not want to start using opiates or narcotics. Are there any non narcotic or opiates that anyone would recommend bringing up to my pyshician? I take Tramadol 50mg twice a day and Hydrocodone/Acetaminophen 7.5-325 T twice a day (but I can take it up to three if needed). The tramadol is more of a helper, I have been on the Hydrocodone since 2006/2007 and it really helps with the pain. Tramadol I have been on since 2014. I have tumors all throughout my body.\n\nIf you are seeing an increase of pain, I would let your doctor know, especially if you have not had an mri in a while. In both 2014 and 2018 I was having an increase of pain where my pain med was not helping. In 2014 I had a cancerous tumor and that was what was causing the new increase in pain, once it was removed that pain went away and I was back to the normal pain i have grown accustomed to that my pain medications is able to help with. \n\nThen in 2018 I again was experiencing similar pain that I had four year before, but in my right arm. That tumor was also cancerous and once removed I again was back to normal or at least my normal.\n\nI have started taking Koselugo, which is the new fda approved drug for children, but I was able with the help of my doctor get approved to take the drug. I have been on it since June 1st. I have noticed maybe a little bit less pain, but not enough for me to go off my meds. My doctor said we likely will not know if the drug works for me for at least 6-8 months.\n\nIf you have any questions let me know I am on 40mg on Amitriptyline and 2 4 times a day cocodomol 30/50. But it is not helping at the moment. I have just requested an appointment with the pain clinic so waiting but it is about a 14 week wait.", "Question for those of us who are a bit older. They say that NF can shorten your life span, so at the age of 43 it is something I think about from time to time. I will say that my mom who has NF and MS is alive at 75. She not in great condition but can still cook Sunday dinner. Do you worry yourself?  I do. I am 34 about to have major spinal surgery at the end of September. I always knew I would at some point, but that I would be older. I am more concerned about my mobility than my life expectancy. I am 37, I do not worry or think about it one bit. I take each day one day at a time, for all I know I could be hit by a bus next week or little to be 90. And I have have two surgeries to remove cancerous tumors and also have has tumors on my cervical spine. I myself have already had two major surgeries on my lumbar spine to remove tumors, in 2000 and 2008.  I also had the same type of surgery on my cervical in 2006.  As of now I have a rather large tumor at L3 that is affecting my left leg.  I have several neuropathy and weakness.  My neurosurgeon said he can remove most of it but cannot guarantee that it will help or even make my leg weaker.  There is no way I am having surgery unless it gets to the point where the tumor might cripple me. I have not heard in any detail that NF on its own has a significant impact on life span, although of course it is going to depend where neurofibromas or other growths appear. That said, risk-averse life insurance companies will not sell me an affordable policy. So... I do not know what to think.\n\nI worry about everything. It is in my personality. But this is one of those things I have come to push toward the back of my mind. There is nothing I can do... so the best I can do is live. The only thing less predictable than NF is life itself. They will not sell you an affordable policy??!! \nThat is BS. Have you tried more than one company?  Some say preexisting medical conditions do not apply. It has been a few yeas since I tried. A while back those that would advertise \"pre-existing conditions\" were welcome still excluded NF. OR, the company itself would still sell a policy, but not term \u2013 only whole life. As it stands right now, my most viable option is a whole life policy. At least I can cash that out when I am beyond the life stage where such insurance is necessary. Back in 95' and still to this day NF disqualified you from all military.  I could not join Yeah. I never seriously thought about the military, but have since worked for military recruiters and related entities... and learned that NF is one of those disqualifying conditions across the board. I have not heard that it can shorten your life expectancy, I would like to know whos saying this because the University of Utah which is one of The United States leading research and clinical studies along with other neurological things says that you can expect a normal life expectancy It is been said in some studies, unfortunately, I cannot name them. It was a while ago that I read it. Everything I have read says that people with NF1 have a normal life expectancy. Not sure where you are getting your info from. What is the life expectancy of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)?\n Here What is the life expectancy of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)?\n It is common for people to write what 'they feel' about life expectancy.  So I believe what you have written about what everyone 'says' but it is not scientific. Hey I just had a pretty big spinal surgery in March, pm if you have any questions! I am in my 30\u2019s and do not worry one bit. I hardly ever think about NF. I have had 27 brain surgeries during my lifetime but I always kept a positive attitude. NF is progressive so you never know what is going to happen. I play quite a bit of golf and go out every night. I feel that life is too short to worry. Life life to the fullest and do not let NF define who you are and deter you from enjoying your life. God bless you for being so strong and positive I did not write what I feel. I wrote what I have read. Barring serious complications, life expectancy is normal for people with NF1 according to many reputable websites. That would be awesome have a few questions to be honest What is the life expectancy of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)?\n I have had three major spinal surgeries. My last one was in 2008. Tumor removed from L4-L5.  It ruined my left leg basically.  I no longer have reflexes in my knee and have to wear an ankle and knee brace.  I regret the surgery.  But that is just my story, or at least part of it. No so much myself (31yrs old), but more what will happen to my brother if he out lives me. He too has NF1 but also has Autism. He cannot live on his own and needs assistance with daily things and that worries me a lot. We are super close to each other, and even though my husband and sisters reassured me that they would take care of him it still makes me nervous and worried. I am sorry to hear, and I know how scary something like that is.  You are scared to die more so for your brothers sake. I have a kid 4 years old diagnosed NF1. Seeing you talking about ages 30-40+ makes me feel better. And want to say my opinion is deal with that as much you can , stay healthy and you  never know. I believe that scientists will find a solution like a drug that doesnt allow tumors to grow. \nOur doctor says that the 1:3500 will be soon 1:2500 just some cases never revealed. \nHope u all the best. Happy that found on reddit a group like that Mobility is my biggest fears with the majority of my tumors being located high on the spinal column. I hope your surgery goes well. Type 2 will definitely shorten life span. But since it manifests differently in patients, you can always find exceptions.", "Can people with nf get high of weed Whenever i smoke up weed, i dont get high, is it related to neurifibromatosis ?", "Health Insurance Under Trump? Hey guys... question for my fellow Americans with NF1.... Do you foresee it becoming more difficult to find health insurance with NF1 under the Trump presidency? I will be graduating soon and am scared that having a preexisting condition will, in the future, make it hard for me to find quality insurance. I was horrified about being able to get it, as well. Turning 26 in April, so it was coming anyways, but now I was not sure I would be able to get it. Thankfully, I just got approved for BlueShield on Friday! Things will work out, do not worry. I am finding it much easier to get it thanks to trump.  Obama care actually really screwed me over and made shit even worse for me. I had to buy insurance I could not use.  My premiums were outrageous and I could no longer see my doctor. Thanks to Trump I was able to dump my forced plan,  got on state aid while I find new work and a plan that will actually be affordable and allow me to see my doctor. I do not have to worry about being forced to pay some outrageous fine because I could not afford to pay some useless insurance. \n\nDo not buy into the lib media anti trump propaganda being thrown at you right now.  It will depend on the state you live in.  For me, I did not have insurance before Obamacare.  I got lumped into pre-existing condition or \"high risk pool\" and the lowest quote I could get was $1500/mo. +  a really high deductible.  When Obamacare came along, I was finally able to get covered.  I am worried, but my state (probably) wants to keep Obamacare.. but I am still worried. Yeahhhhhhhh, so insurance companies are not fond of covering people who already have tumors (among many other things); troll another sub I am not trolling but go ahead with your pathetic circle jerk. I am better off without Obamacare as is anyone who has NF. As said I have not been able to see my doctor since 2013 because of it. I was forced into a plan where I was paying outrageous premiums and I couldnt even see my normal doctor. Thankfully our president revoked the outrageous fine you would face for not having insurance and I am now able to look for a plan that is affordable for me as well as one where I can see my actual doctor while being on state aid. I am far better off then where I was. But of course,  Trump is literally hitler and you faggots need to circle jerk some more to it.   Right, you are not trolling and that is why you called us \"faggots\" You are going to attack me anyway for supporting trump. Mind as well rustle some Jimmies in the process. Grow a spine. No one is attacking you; you are attacking us. You gave a story that was clearly BS - anyone with our condition could see that from a mile away - and attached a political aside to the end of your comment which bore no relevance to the conversation. I made a comment to draw attention to it, and you chose to call us 'circlejerking faggots.' You have come into a community of people who already have a life-altering condition and have shown no sympathy while unsuccessfully trying to make us feel bad. All this thread was about was discussing the very real possibility of drastic changes to the affordability of health insurance for our community or if we are able to get it at all.   And I have that same condition dick head. Schwanomatosis to be exact. How is my story clearly bs? Because I criticised King Obama and praised trump? You can look through posts here and see I have post here plenty of other times to prove that.\n\nAlso the original post was completly political to begin with. I figured I could try to post some positive and maybe have OP look on the bright side of things and not buy into the bullshit and see the good in the repeal but nope. I am a fake person and my story and disorder is fake. Yup. I decided to just troll a random sub of like a couple hundred users. Fuck you dude. Get real. Congratulations! That must be a big relief :) Can you tell me more about that? Ughh so do you think it might go back to the way it was before, price-wise? Obviously your disorder and your story are real, but insulting me by calling me a circlejerking faggot is not going to help me feel better. You are right, I do live in liberal circles, so please tell me how this is going to get better under the new administration. I did not post because I wanted to insult anyone, I just want to gain a better understanding. Check your PMs my dude.  I have free healthcare where i am from so i cant really help you but I really hope you will find a good health insurance that can help you with your nf1,  Love from denmark  I really do not know.  I hope not. :I Right, my concern is getting a really high quote and struggling to find employment that will support me in terms of health insurance. I am graduating soon and looking for jobs, but I feel like this will be a major deciding factor in future employment. He hasnt changed anything yet... correct?  I didnt miss something, right? Coverage has not changed yet, but he did issue an executive order to start rolling back on Obamacare coverage. I have neurofibromatosis and I have no concerns what so ever. Trump is going to mak sure all Americans have health insurence, even those with preexisting conditions.   $1500? What state do you live in? I have nf and high blood pressure and before my new plane, my old plan was like $400 a month with Blue Cross.  West Virginia. I wonder why it was $1500 for you and only like $400 for me a month.  Could be a lot of things.  I may be older than you. I have had multiple surgeries, I have a large neurofibroma on the back of my skull that has to be monitored with MRI.  Also, I am female which probably does not help.  And this was 10 years ago. I am a female, I have high blood pressure, I had surgeries too one of my spine that was pressing against my spinal cord. But my insurance only cost like $400-450 through Blue Cross from when I was like 21- until I was like 29, before then I was covered under my parents insurence. Then when I was 29 is when we were able to get me on disability which then put me on Medicaid. We had tried a few years before but they kept denying me, so then we were suggested to get a lawyer and that helped us. When we go to the court hearing to see the judge she could not believe that we had to go through all of this trouble, especially when I had a whole book full of medical files from all my test and surgeries and stuff. ", "I have an infant son and we are waiting on test results to confirm nf. Multiple signs point to him having nf. parents with children with nf what can you pass on that you have experienced that could help my situation.  It is great that you are getting a diagnosis so quickly. It is really hard to give advice because of the varying nature of NF. The best advice I can think of is be vigilant when it comes to tumors. Get regular eye tests for your son as tumors can grow on the optic nerves. My son has an annual MRI scan because he has a growth in his brain. My son has Nf 1and autism, and those two conditions together are a perfect storm of behavioral issues. Good luck, I really hope your diagnosis is negative. Thanks much My youngest was born with cafe-au-lait spots, so I suspected it was a possibility from Day 1 or 2. He started to show small fibromas by age 2 or so, and subsequent genetic testing confirmed it. Whereas his older brother was hitting development milestones very early at each stage, he was hitting milestones pretty late every time (crawling, sitting up, first steps, first words, etc). \n\nHe is about to turn 5 now, and doing fine. He does have optic pathway gliomas, which occur in about 20-25% of NF1 cases. He is had several MRIs to monitor growth and such. Overall he is a sweet, loving kid. His language is delayed compared to his peers and he trends maybe 6-12 month younger than he is as far as ability to control his emotions and such, but cognitively he is a smart little guy and will be starting kindergarten in the fall. \n\nFeel free to send me any questions. Do not fret too much, it is definitely an anxiety-generator as a parent but there is no need to worry until there is something to worry about, which there might never be. Look into any NF1 expertise that you have nearby; we are lucky enough to live close to a large metro children's hospital that has a good NF1 team.\n\nOh and one other thing that I guess I will mention; he was a champion sleeper until about 6 months old, and then basically the worst ever for the next 2 years. It was literal torture. Sleep disturbances are apparently common with NF1 kids and ignore all the parenting advice you get from non-NF1 parents cause their advice is worthless and will only make you angry. How is your son sleeping now? My son was diagnosed at 6 months. He has sphenoid wing dysplasia, optic glioma, and small neurofibromas on his back. However, you would never know it by interacting with him. He hit all milestones early, including walking, language, etc. He is a super smart, social kid! My son had sleep issues too. One of the (many) doctors said that a melatonin deficiency is fairly common in NF and he prescribed melatonin tablets, and since then that son has slept best of all three. He still wakes up early, and if anything disturbs him in the night he does not get back to sleep but bed time is so much easier. He sleeps like a champ Sleeps great thanks Thanks I always wanted to ask as well and I do not know if this will get noticed:\n\nParents who have had multiple children, how many of your children have and do not have NF. What was your severity of it compared to theirs?\n\nI am doing this for my own research My son has just about this same exact thing and he is turning 8. Just found 2 brain tumors getting checked on in August for treatment options..really really hoping for good things. He definitely has behavioral issues and has trouble at school focusing as hyperactivity is common with it. But he is the smartest in the class and has a photographic memory and can remember things from when he was 1. He is the best thing in my life ever!!! The most stress I have ever come across too but I would never trade for the world. Good luck to you. Wow almost everything you said is our situation. I really hope you get the best possible outcome. Thankfully my son does not need treatment for the growth in his brain anytime soon, I really hope it stays that way. Sending good thoughts your way! Thank you so much! We both definitely need it!!! \ud83d\udc93", "This dark shade just appeared on my hand all of the sudden, i do not remember hitting myself so i do not think it is a bruise, also it is not hurting. Is this how cafe au lait spots appear? It is the first time when I see a shade like this on my body.  I forgot to mention that i am diagnosed with NF and i do have a lot of spots on my body, but i never seen them in this form. So i do not know if it is a spot or not", "Hair Loss Pills and Neurofibromas Hello everyone,\n\nI am a 22 year old male who has been diagnosed with nf1 when i was young. Fortunately, I seem to have a milder case as I maybe grew a few cutaneous neurofibromas on my stomach and legs throughout the years. My question is I began taking finasteride which is a medication used to help treat male pattern baldness \ud83e\udd72. The medication is known to cause some hormone changes but i am not too sure to what degree. Since I have not had neurofibromas grow during the time i went through puberty I thought maybe it could be the same. I guess im asking what do you guys think I should do. I know this is kind of a loaded question and one that is a personal choice but i am really at a crossroad. While I would really hate to lose my hair I would also hate for that too cause me to have more neurofibromas than I would have had. \n\nThanks for taking the time to read my post and look forward to what you guys have to say\ud83d\ude0a", "Who I am I have always had issues with nf. Even as a child. My youngest sibling is 12 years younger than me and when she was born I wished she had nf. Okay, rotten? Most likely but that is who I am a rotten person. \n\nWhen I was younger in the single digits I hated myself. I seriously hate myself because of the nf. When I was a teenager I remember like writing the word sad on paper of how I felt every day for a few months. So I would write the feeling every day on this paper. I stopped and I am not sure why I started in the first place. Every day was the feeling of being sad. Pathetic? I am more sad these days.\n\nHigh school was horrible. I felt like a freak. Changing in the bathroom in the locker room for gym or if the bathroom was utilized I had a technique I did which the girls would not see my birthmarks from the nf and bumps. College was okay but I struggled and I did not really think much about nf since I had a lot of stuff going on. \n\nNow I am in my late 20s and I want a family. Now the whole process starts over again. My older siblings have children and never had to worry about a single thing. I think it is okay for me to wish this upon someone else. I do not see anything wrong with it. I believe everyone should have the same odds. I have 50/50.. so everyone else should have it as well. I know it is a sad and morbid thing to say, but this is who I am. \n\nI have more to say but I need to get to the gym. It is the only thing I have control over the way my body is built and not control the effing marks and tumors.  I have hundreds of tumours all over my body. At school I had 4, plus the cafe au lait blotches. I do not love myself but I do not hate others. You can educate others and as you get older you will hopefully give less of a shit about it. \n The way medicine is progressing I still have hope for a cure (or at least drugs that help eliminate the tumours). \n Genetic research seems to have come far enough so that if you want to start a family you can reduce the risk of having a child with NF.\n  For me, having a supportive partner has been the biggest help with my own demons regarding my NF. \n Dark humour and seeking out new experiences also help ( try a wing walk for example x ). You really should not call yourself rotten and you really should not wish ill will onto others. That will not make you feel better at all, as you said you have been wishing that ever since you were a kid and has not helped you feel better at all. \n\nEnvy and jealousy are two of the worst feelings one can consume themselves with. All those feeling will cause is make you feel miserable, resentful and a unhappy person. It will affect your relationship and outlook on life and cause you nothing, but stress. And stress is horrible for anyone. Stress can actually cause many health problems within itself.\n\nI get that this condition sucks. I wish I did not have it, but I cannot wish it away. What I can do is enjoy the life I have and be grateful for the life I do have. And be thankful for the things I am able to do, because there are people who are in far worse situation than I am in. \n\nThere is this girl I used to know back when I was a kid, she was a few years younger than me, he grandmother used to babysit, me and my siblings. Anyways this girl and her older sister, were in the care of their grandmother, because their mom was a drug addict. Jump forward many years to when this girl in her 20s, she gotten pregnant twice, by two different guys. The first pregnancy went fine, but with the second one, she suffered a massive stroke. They were not even sure if she would survive, but she did and the baby was born. The baby ended up going to the fathers parents, as she never really recovered from the stroke. She is in a chair now, not able to walk or do anything really for herself. I guarantee you can do far more things than she can do, because she needs help with everything. This all happened several years ago. She is now in her early 30s. Her oldest daughter has grown up, not being able to have a normal relationship with her mother. She now a teenager and given her life experience of what she had been exposed to at very young age is far more mature than other kids her age. \n\nI really hope you talk to someone about your feelings, because if fear if you continue with these feelings you will never be happy in life and it will cause a rift with your family and friends.\n\nI know this condition blows and it can take a toll on you and your body, I get that, but do not throw in the towel and give up. Start looking at the bright things in your life, no matter how small they seem. There is a drug that is fda approved that shrinks tumors. And while it technically only been approved for children, it is possible with the help of your doctor/specialist to get it approved for an adult.\n\nI have been approved and late this month, I will be seeing my nf specialist to discuss the medication. \n\nIt probably is not to far out of the possibility that some day, they figure out a way to stop tumors completely. My plans are to get more tattoos to cover the marks so I am less self conscious about them. I had the same issues in high school where other girls pointed them out and asked or said mean shit so I just did not do gym and had a note to excuse me.\n\n However the kids standpoint for me is I am not going to risk it there is to much that can happen like the hormone imbalance can cause more visible marks and whatever (there was a woman in my local news paper about it) which may be selfish but I could not cope with more marks, everytime I look at any part of my body mainly my hands I see what could be lumps in a few years and it just makes me depressed all over again I have spoken to 5 therapists in the last few years. None of them helped. Sure, nf has not stopped me from achieving but it IS stopping me from growing a family. Everyone in my family knows my stance and they are tired of me complaining. What they do not KNOW is that my complaining is basically letting them know how DEPRESSED I am but they are not looking deeper than WHY I am complaining.\n\nSometimes I wish I were the only child. I think that would make things a lot better because my siblings could care less about my feelings. No one really like to hear someone constantly complain, especially about the same over and over. I have three younger siblings, they have achieved things that I never will and I have accepted that and I am okay with that. I do not go to them and complain how much better off they are compared to me. We should never compare ourselves to others. We should be grateful for the things we do have. \n\nYou can create a family, it just may not be in the way that you want it to be. There is more than one way to create a family. I have a cousin who is adopted. I have another cousin, who with her husband, they adopted a kid. Family is what we make of it, family does not have to be blood. \n\nMy guess is, your siblings love you very much and want the best for you. But your constant complaining can be very draining and stressful to them, just as your condition is to you. Only you can make yourself happy, other people cannot do that for you. \n\nThis is a great quote, \u201cGrant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.\u201d Yes I do understand about the complaining aspect. However, I am getting tired of them thinking what I have is NOT a big deal. It is a effing big deal. Everyone in my family is on cloud nine and I am stuck in an effing hole that I cannot climb out of. I do not want to be like this in 20 years but I have a feeling I will be negative because it is who I am. I get it, some people have better personalities and positive attitudes. Since I was younger, I had a negative outlook on life. It is not a flip on a switch kind of thing. NF can be difficult to deal with. I understand your frustration. Many people have never even heard of it before. I would not put yourself down if     I were you. Having low self-esteem is going to hurt during the course of your life. It would be best to speak to someone and see if they can help you. You have a lot of potential but you just need to look deep inside to find it. I never wished I did not have NF and never wished it on anyone else either. Best of luck to you in dealing with your situation. I am sorry to hear about your family, but I really hope you push out these negative feelings you have. Negative feelings will not do you or anyone any good and will just make you feel worse. I would look into doing something that makes you happy and get more involved in that whatever it may be. Such as if working with animals makes you happy, maybe help out at an animal shelter or even horses stables/barns. If you like working with kids, I am sure youth centers and programs are always looking for people to help out. Find things that make you happy. You have to want the therapy to help. If you believe it will not help, it will not. You have to put in the effort.  \n\nSeveral people that suffer from NF have it much worse than you.  \n\nMy daughter's case caused 3 vertebrae degeneration leading several surgical procedures that ended up rebuilding and bracing her spine. She has her degree and lives a full life. \n\nI have cancer that made it to my lungs because a nerve sheath tumor. I fight everyday because life is worth living. \n\nYou choose to be unhappy. You can choose to be happy. It takes work. Personally you should trying to look at what you do have and be thankful that it is not worse. I think you are putting your family in an unfair position. You are expecting them to read into your thoughts and needs based on your complaints. And these can lead to burnout. It is really not uncommon for family members to have a burnout from this.\n\nAnd maybe even if they did what yous say it might not be sufficient to you or even fix what you are dealing with. Depression is a cruel beast that is not just a singular weed that you can pluck and fix how you feel. \n\nTherapy is not a switch where you go in and they fix you in 1 or a few sessions. It is more like working with a personal trainer or a music teacher. It takes you putting in the effort and wanting results in order to improve. Therapy is not all that different. You usually get some kind of homework to work on and you have to try in order to make progress. \n\nA lot of this sounds like identity issues self loathing and dealing with jealousy. And those are things that can be worked on with a therapist. But you have to put the work in in order to improve. I believe the drug is also supposed to be for inoperable tumors. \n\nI am in the process of getting on Koselugo. And the restrictions are starting to loosen. Can I suggest that you see a   psychiatrist that can prescribe some antidepressants?  Truthfully explain to him or her that things are getting worse and how you are feeling.   People that have NF1 are known for depression.   You really do need to get on something for your depression.  Yes working out does do fantastic things for a person.   But it does not fix everything.   You really roll the dice by not passing that NF1 Gene onto your child.   Your child could not be a recessive carrier of that Gene.  That is totally ridiculous.", "Many caf\u00e9-au-lait spots in lumbar and genital area I was diagnosed with mild NF last year at the age of 18; so far the only visible symptoms I have are cafe au lair spots. I have several bigger ones (which do not disturb me) on different spots on my body and many many small ones (freckling) in my lumbar region. I always had it and did not realise that it was \"abnormal\" until a gynaecologist said that she had never seen something like this before when I was about 15 years old. Now at least I know where it comes from, but I am quite insecure that a possible future boyfriend might be disgusted by this... what are your experiences with freckling and a relationship? Anyone worth your time and your love will not care. They will not judge you, or make you feel bad about it.  \n\nYou are more than just cafe-au-lait spots or whatever other NF symptoms that may pop up. They are a small part of what make you who you are, but as a whole person, you have so much to offer.  \n\nFocus on all of your positive qualities and things that are within your control. Okay, so first off you need to find a new gynecologist. Their behavior was unprofessional. Next yup, freckles anywhere in your body due to nf is completely normal. I will give you a male's perspective and be as frank as I can without being lurid. When I was a teenager and in my 20s I do not think I would have noticed any freckles or of thought they were abnormal. I was just happy to be with someone in that intimate setting. I think my reaction would be more along the lines of, \"ooh neat\" if I took notice at all. If for some reason you date a guy and it is difficult for him to enjoy your company due to them, consider it like eye or hair color. Nothing personal, just preference.  I am married. This should answer your question. \n\nHahaha, no, but seriously, you will find someone who loves you for you. I have some bumps on my stomach and breast area, along with some more distinct markings on my arm. He does not care at all and is super loving and amazing in every way possible. \n\nYou are still very young, and have a lot of time to meet the one! I would not worry about it at all and just be yourself.  i have NF and also have the freckling and quite a few cafe ua lait spots. (a lot of which i have covered with tattoos over the years) now i hope i do not get a lot of backlash for this but i have slept with a decent amount of men and none of them have ever asked me about having a lot of spots or freckling.\n\nhowever my current boyfriend and my ex boyfriend, have asked me about bumps on my body being concerned for me and what they were.  i explained to both of them what they were and they did not care. if you meet th right person they will not care and they will love you for who you really are. :)  Eh the men I dated found it to be the cutest and most fascinating thing ever.  most do not even care or notice, and if he is your boyfriend the most he will worry about is you find him attractive too.\n", "DAE on gabapentin have horrible gas?

I have MediCal with Kaiser as my network and I have not had any luck finding a dr to help with my atypical version of NF1. Thank you! I have Kaiser. I messaged my assigned primary care dr through the app/website and asked for a referral to a geneticist. \n\nIn my case I had two risk factors and was looking to be formally diagnosed, but you should  be able to use the same process to get someone to work with your existing diagnosis. I meant more if there was a neurofibromatosis center in SoCal kaiser like there is in NorCal kaiser. I was diagnosed when I was 12, I just have not had any drs that helped. It would always be, \"get scans every three years,\" or, \"you have an atypical version, we do not know.\" I have over 100 tumors that have been growing faster recently and I have not found anyone to help. Sorry, I am not aware of any. I have heard people on this sub talking about there being Kaiser NF centers \u201cin California\u201d, but never anything more specific than that\u2014which is not super helpful. That is okay, thank you still, that is all I have found too unfortunately \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f There is a great NF doctor at CHLA.  That is the children's hospital but they know NF doctors and researchers around the country so they will probably be able to get you a referral. UCLA Medical Center and Kaiser work with each other. Their NF doctors are fantastic (they were 30 years ago anyway) when I went there for surgeries They are still fantastic.  I see Dr. Nghiemphu for my NF treatment there. When I was going there I had Dr. Kamoto and he was amazing", "Gen Variant of NF-1 Gene I got a results from a genetic blood testing. The results revealed a c.7907+5delG, p.? im NF1-Gen (ACMG Klasse 4) mutation. They stated it is probably pathogenic. It has never been documented in literature before. Can someone help me interpret it adequately? How would it look in a Gene. What kind of mutation is it?", "NF1 and Schizophrenia I have NF1 and had it since I was born, I had a brain scan when I was 12 and they found tumors on my brain they said they were too few and too small to cause any problems, then many months later, they did another scan to see nothing had changed, the specialist then said that he did not expect anything more to even happen with it and that it should not cause problems later in life, I am 17 now and experiencing almost every symptom of Schizophrenia and reading on google to see that it is \"rare\" with NF1 but am not too sure I have never had these symptoms before they just started and have been almost constant 24/7 for the past few months\nI have not told any of my family mainly in fear of this being a possibility, and just thought to ask this question here. I have not ever heard of that, but any changes in personality or mental health overall can indicate changes so I would definitely speak with your doctor about this for your own and other people\u2019s safety x You really should speak with your parents or your doctor about any changes you are experiencing. Unfortunately with Neurofibromatosis, things can change over time and develop. I was not diagnosed until I was 15, doctors suspected I had it, but results were always inconclusive. Things changed once I started going through puberty. I am 37 now and I have had many changes since then. \n\nI highly recommend to stop looking things up on the internet, that will just cause you to worry and stress yourself out. There can be several reasons to any symptoms you are feeling. It would be best to go see your doctor and maybe have some new scans done. It is not the best to self diagnose. If you have insurance use it. If not your state should have mental health services. So speaking as someone from the mental health field, however I am not a doctor!, late teens to early twenties is the most common onset age for schizophrenia. Obviously, brain scans have recently shown that the brains of schizophrenics look different than that of neuro typicals, but I am not sure how many of those scans included tumors, or any other variables. \n\nMy first encounter with someone who had just been diagnosed with schizophrenia was a 19yo male who, up until then, was living a completely \u201cnormal life\u201d. He had a job, a girlfriend, his own truck &amp; was fairly responsible. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, he began hearing voices. He did not tell anyone at first because he knew that was \u201ccrazy\u201d, but his mom overheard him talking to someone in his room when he was obviously in there by himself. \n\nAfter a lot of therapy &amp; med changes, I am happy to say he is stable &amp; learning to become more independent again. \n\nI tell you all of this just to give you some insight into a possibly similar situation so that maybe you will not feel as afraid to tell someone. You may find out you do in fact have schizophrenia, or you may find out there is a tumor pushing on some part of your brain causing auditory hallucinations, or maybe something completely different...either way, you have to talk to someone about how you are feeling in order to get answer. \n\nIf you need any advice or support, please let me know! My daughter has Nf1 &amp; is 3yo, so I am a beginner in that area lol. Good luck &amp; internet hugs\ud83d\udc9a\n\nETA: I agree with everyone else here when they say to stop self diagnosing with the internet...you can tell WebMD you have a hangnail &amp; they will be like \u201cnaw, pretty sure that is cancer\u201d &amp; you do not need that kind of stress in your life. I have mainly been worried as this has been going on since mid August, and has progressively been getting worse, it started off as hearing slight voices, then silhouettes of people, then progress on to hearing Whispers more and more often, also murmers and occasionally an audible voice, I would hear what sounds like a tap or peck on my window, or my door Opening/Closing despite that not actually happening, they started getting more and more persistent, and started seeing more than just silhouettes, it became multiples of them, Ill also see spiders, flys,gnats,cats, and dogs, sometimes even a snake, I will also see random light flashes or people's faces will suddenly turn oily looking or black spots will appear on their face, and it feels as if I cannot even talk about it to my family as every time I try something just stops me as it seems as if it is trying to \"warn\" me in some way not too. I am sorry you are dealing with this. And I am sorry you are doing it alone. That has to be hard on you, &amp; probably scary sometimes too. \n\nWhat you are describing is very similar to how others describe the initial onset of schizophrenia, but this is just speculation on my part. I strongly encourage you to speak to your pcp or a mental health professional about what you are experiencing. If you are not ready to get into details with your family, maybe just tell them you want to speak with someone about possibly being depressed. Once you see someone, you can tell them privately what you have been experiencing. Based on the outcome, they can help you tell your family what you have been experiencing while being there to answer questions &amp; give you support. \n\nI really hope you talk with someone about this as you should not have to carry this alone. Conditions like this, when properly diagnosed, are completely manageable. Well today I finally got to see someone, I was indeed diagnosed with Schizophrenia as well as Anxiety,\nGiven a low dose antipsychotic to take nightly, and anxiety medication to take as needed, thanks for your help and everyone else Dude I am so effing proud of you!! I know that had to be scary, it takes a lot of strength to take that initial step...especially with the added complication of paranoia &amp; hallucinations. \n\nI really hope the meds help...sometimes it can be a bitch trying to get the dosage right, but when you do, it is so worth it! \n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or ever need to talk, it would be my pleasure to help in any way. And do something special for yourself because you deserve it! \ud83d\udc9c So proud of you!", "Hello, 24M self diagnosed with explanation/questions I have had on and off tinnitus dominantly in my right ear since I was a teenager. It became permanent around 19, but only in my right ear. I have fatigue, and growths all along my throat and spine. I have not had a scan done on my brain or spine yet, but I am fairly certain I have NF2. \n\nI have for as long as I can remember had issues with night vision, I basically cannot assume spatial awareness and distance at night. My vision is bad but not horrible, mostly skewed by astigmatism. My spine is heavily curved in the upper part, and bent inwards heavily in the lower part.  I have issues with laying down flat as I am not actually flattened, and my right shoulder blade stabs into the muscle of my back so I experience nerve pain and at times tingling in my hands. \n\nMy brain feels the worst of the consequences of my possible NF2 condition. I have terrible memory, forgot attending my own mother/step father\u2019s wedding just 3 years ago, and I have noticeable issues with short term memory and empathy. I feel tired easily and sleep for either short periods, or extremely long periods, depending on my physical fatigue and likely hormonal imbalances. \n\nI feel manically depressed/elated and cannot seem to find middle ground. Through much of my college life, I self medicated with marijuana and my symptoms, especially digestive, seemed under control. But now that I have waned off marijuana, I am having no relief in memory or ambition and my digestion is unpredictable and can be very painful. \n\nThe scoliosis and tinnitus lead me to the NF2 self diagnosis, along with obvious growths both in the back/base of my head/behind my ears, and now it feels that I am developing these growths on my back and spine. \nThe sad truth of this disease is relieving to read about, surprisingly, because I originally discredited my life experiences as symptoms of laziness and \u201chaving it easy.\u201d I grew up privileged and although I was heavily emotionally abused by my alcoholic father, my mother has always looked out for me and tried her best to respect my feelings and intentions or lack thereof. They separated when I was in late middle school and divorced both legally and from each other\u2019s lives when I was in early high school. I now live with my stepdad, who appreciates and supports me (both mentally and with some expenses) and especially cares for my mother. \n\nThe unfortunate part of my life is that my mother can not accept that I probably have NF2. She now says I use this condition as an excuse/crutch to rationalize my lack of motivation at my job (I do daycare/boarding for dogs at a place called Bed and Biscuit) my job is largely physical and exhausting, even for people who do not have NF symptoms, so I am left burdened and frankly I feel alone. I also graduated college but with poor grades (not that surprising, I have always been an on and off student) and have not used my degree whatsoever. \n\nIt has been comforting to perceive a bigger picture for my physiology and I am really glad I do have proper logical truth for my condition. I have an appointment set up for a physical evaluation in January of 2020 and intend to explain thoroughly my condition as well as possible screening to determine the extent of my growths and other health concerns.\n\nAs of now, and as you can tell from my writing, my mental capacity is not terrible. the formation of my NF2 (possibly) seems to be related to my life experiences and the resulting consequences.\n\nWhen I was young, maybe 7 or 8,  I fell under a concrete swing that seated two benches and numerous people. I was trapped and my head was crushed/bruised/bleeding, as well as much of my chest, but there were little physical indications of skull fracturing or concussion. I even remember it and it was terrifying, but I avoided death by reacting quickly and flattening my body and turning my head as the large square concrete slab scraped back and forth like a pendulum. \nA man pulled me out after he stabilized it is movement and my mom only witnessed the resulting physical condition, fortunately.\n\nI also have had numerous concussions, 1  from clumsy kid activities like jumping off couches, another during a football practice when I was in middle school, another from slipping on soap spread at the entrance of the bathroom in high school and the last from falling directly on my forehead after blacking out smoking weed at a friend\u2019s place 4-5 times over the course of a few hours. I remember this last fall (probably the hardest I have hit my head) as gracefully/lightly losing consciousness and slowly losing control of my body as I fell, but my friend said I fell over as if I would been shot in the head. \n\nI think the past traumas influence my ability to function while smoking a fair amount of weed consecutively throughout a 4-6 hour time period, but because I normally only smoked 1-2, maybe 3 times a day about 3 hours apart each session (at my most dependent phases on the drug) it is hard to say. But for further info I was a chronic abuser of marijuana from age 19-24. I have recently in the past few months completely stopped because I was caught with weed by police twice and now have quarterly hair follicle tests. If I fail them I go to jail.\n\nAlas, I want to say my physical condition and it is mutative state seems in direct relation to much of my life experiences with trauma. Perhaps if I did not have all of these accidents, my possible relationship with NF2 would be far less apparent. \n\nLike I said I have had no proper diagnosis yet, but the scoliosis combined with the tingling and tinnitus, as well as the on and off muscle fatigue, (oh and I am only 5\u20195\u201d and about 105 pounds) makes me think I am likely effected. But I am not that afraid. I think it is because answers are more comforting than unexplained/apparent incomparable misfortune. I just hope I get more time to enjoy the things I love, like league of legends, poetry, reading, anime and movies/tv, and animals. And I hope as my condition worsens I can still find joy in this world. \n\nMy mentality is largely manic as I have stated, but the good times are really great. I consider myself confident and like-able, and I try to cover my shortcomings by being helpful where I can, especially at work. And it is noticed! Although many of my coworkers see me as aloof and unreliable mentally (I forget names of dogs and locations within our kennel, as well as coworker information and even names) I try my best and I noticeably care for the dogs and my team. \n\nI also want to say thank you for all the courageous people who speak about their condition and seek out company, without this sub I would have nowhere to share my story and experience. No one knows my truth the way I do, or ever will, but some of you may read this and find some relatability/comfort, as I do with your writings. NF is not really something you can self diagnose. You need to have the genetic marker or at least some tumors to get a diagnosis. You should not self diagnose yourself Please go to a doctor You say no one knows your truth, which is very true. You have obviously been through Stuff and have experienced trauma. If you are so sure you have NF, please go to a doctor to have it confirmed. People on this sub are diagnosed or have had family members diagnosed.  It is not something to be taken lightly or to self-diagnose. Go get the real truth. FFS. I can see why you would come to this conclusion, and if you are like most people, you know yourself better than you can possibly express. That being said, NF is a genetic disorder that progresses over time. It is not something that somebody develops in adulthood. While some people are diagnosed as an adult, it is exceedingly rare, because there are clinical markers that show early on. Like yourself stated, the symptoms that you have can also be connected to physical trauma, multiple concussions, and even from cannabis use (which can also trigger mania). The hormonal symptoms can also indicate multiple diagnoses, and even be an explanation for other symptoms that may seem unrelated. This is why it is really important to see a physician, or even be genetically tested. All forms of Neurofibromatosis have prognosis that have a wide variation, even among families that have the mutation, which is another reason to see a specialist in this rare disorder. I also do not want you to unnecessarily worry, even if you are confirmed to have NF. People with NF can live a normal life, if they are lucky to do so, and if they so choose. I think your knowledge of NF2 is limited to your condition with NF1, but fair enough I probably should be seeking psychological therapy. Also you do not need to type to be honest, I sense the honesty of your emotional response, it seems you validate your existence through your condition. I do not blame you but your hostility is as condescending as it is ignorant. well frankly you are unprofessional in exchange anonymously and you are literally not a professional, and after months of comparing my physical state with the symptoms of NF2 i am finding a ridiculous amount of overlap. Fortunately my findings do not change from your opinion so i will wait until my scheduled appointment and get the opinion of someone worth listening to!  ( You cannot self diagnose NF. Based on everything you have described, you have no qualifying conditions that would indicate you have any form of NF. Everything you have described is the total opposite of a diagnosis of NF. You cannot self diagnose yourself with NF. I would suggest having genetic testing done and seeing a psychologist. How is scoliosis, growths along the back of the head and behind the ears, and tinnitus randomly becoming permanent after puberty and getting steadily worse in my 20s, as well as muscle fatigue, swallowing issues, and a lacking night vision not symptoms of NF2? I think my choice to come here and bring a ton of information without a technical diagnosis bothers people, but it was not without months of research. I am not as simple as your statement, nor do I feel value in engaging you beyond this reply. NF2 is extremely hard to genetically test due to it half of the time coming from parents who show no symptoms but carry the gene in an autosomal dominant pattern, and the fact that the mutated dna is also irregular even within each individual, it becomes hard to pinpoint. To even maybe have a proper diagnosis, I will have to go to Massachusetts or a few other states that have highly educated and practices neurologists. Where I live, TX, there is not anyone qualified enough, and as I have said the genetic testing has to be extremely pinpoint. This is because in NF2 the mutations can occur without basis for reasoning, and the proteins (Merlin) produced are atypical. It is a 1/25000 disease and the conditions are met with my case. And when I have it diagnosed professionally, did I then self diagnose or did I have a professional do it? Either way, I sought out the result due to my condition in existence, so without my knowledge and application nothing is learned until it is too late or not an issue.  \"If no change in the NF2 gene is detected, this does not guarantee that you do not have NF2. If an experienced NF physician has already clinically diagnosed you, the results of a gene test will not change this diagnosis or tell you how severe the symptoms may be. Once you decide to have a gene test for NF2, your physician needs to arrange for a blood or tumor sample to be sent to one of the laboratories offering testing services, along with a detailed family medical history. The detection rate may be higher if a tumor sample is used.\"  \n\n\nsource:  ( Go to a professional doctor. Go to a professional doctor. Go to a professional doctor. Once you get it diagnosed professionally, a professional did it. When you go to a doctor to get something diagnosed you are advocating for yourself.\n\nYou are not a doctor so your diagnosis could be wrong. Advocating is a good thing but saying you have NF2 and getting it confirmed is no different than going to the doctor and confirming you have a cold and getting treatment.\n\nThe symptoms you describe you be associated with any number of conditions not just NF2.", "I am certain I have NF1, but do not know what to do Hello guys,\n\nI am a 21 yo male\n\nAfter randomly surfing the web months ago I have seen a nf1 awareness ad that shows common symptoms of a person with nf1. My whole life I grew up with freckles under my armpits, and a ton of caf\u00e9 au lait spots all over my body and waived it off to birthmarks. But after looking at it more, and during that past few months bumps growing on my back and chest I am becoming more convinced I have it. Issue is I do not currently have a family doctor, and due to how most doctors are not familiar with it I am afraid my concerns will be waived off by doctors and they will think I am crazy. I live in Canada, how do you guys suggest I should go about because if I do have this I want to get in front off it and better my chances.\n\nThanks in advance for any advice given ! You would want to speak with a neurologist to get tested. My son had a blood test after seeing a genetic doctor.  I am the carrier and have always had it not knowing birth marks and bumps were a thing.  Some can have issues and some not.  A blood test had to be approved by our insurance and took 6 weeks.  My son is fine too. does that mean i may have a mild case because other than the freckles and cafe au lait spots i feel fine other than the off day of pain which could be many thing. should i let them know my suspicions of having it. I feel like they will waive off my concerns and think im just googling things I have nf2 and I am a patient at the nf clinic down at Toronto General Hospital. You might be able to contact them and ask for advice on what to do and who to see.\n\nBut my process for diagnosis was seeing my family doctor who then referred me to a geneticist for the blood test. Maybe try and look up a geneticist in your area and contact them? Yes you can share your concerns, it might be best to discuss with your primary care doctor first they can then give you a referral. I was diagnosed when I was 15, though my pediatrician always suspected I had it, test results were always inconclusive. After I hit puberty things started taking off and she refereed me to see a specialist in Chicago (I previously was referred University of Michigan when I was 9). The doctor in Chicago ran some test, I even stayed a week in the hospital to have multiple test done, after which I was fully diagnosed with Neurofibromatosis. On,y a doctor can confirm whether you have Neurofibromatosis, as the things you mentioned can also mean other things as well and have nothing to do with Neurofibromatosis. You have many symptoms of it. I do not think they would waive you off. Most people are diagnosed just by observable symptoms anyway. See a family care doctor &amp; tell them your concerns. There is a list of criteria for Nf1 &amp; if you meet a certain number of symptoms or more, then the next step would be a referral to a neurologist &amp; genetic testing. \n\nIt can be difficult to self-refer to specialists for this kind of issue without a general practitioner signing off on it. \n\nGood luck! Ditto to what others are saying, particularly with US insurance nonsense. ctf.org and nfnetwork.org have good resources for finding a specialist, but it is a good idea to getting a primary care dr referral first.  \n\nI did not have a primary care dr for 10+ years after college, then finally got one bc I had a few sore lumps in my leg I wanted looked at.  One oncologist, a geneticist, and many other appointments and MRIs later and I had a confirmed NF diagnosis and referral to a specialist. Most primary care drs will not be as helpful with all that is needed for NF. I am also in Canada (BC) I was diagnosed when I was a toddler. Do not worry about your concerns being waved off I would go in. My perspective is from medicine in USA, but any primary care doctor should be able to recognize that NF1 is the main entity in the differential diagnosis when you lay out all the findings you have stated. You would likely be referred to a geneticist and/or neurologist. Based on your description, testing may not be necessary since you have cafe au lait spots, axillary freckling, and what sound like neurofibromas. Neurologists are often the best option for adult NF1 care, but finding an NF specialist is best. I am so lucky to have a neurologist specialized in NF in my home town. \ud83d\udc9c I recently found him \ud83d\ude0a I have NF , i have spots, that is all , i do not care for them.\nI do not know how it is in US or Canada, but you should get an appointment for a neurologist, do not freak out, it is nothing you can do about it anyways , just do not worry about it , it is not a big deal. Just go to a neurologist and she/he will recommend you to some doctor that is specialized in NF.\nGood luck and do not overthink it The vast majority of NF instances are fairly minor and do not result in major complications, some people only find out they have it after their child is diagnosed.  Always consult a physician if you have any concerns.  Neurofibromas tend to be benign, but can be malignant/turn malignant.

Hello All,\n\nI know the answer is \"talk to your doctor\", and I will at her next well visit but figured I would ask here, too.\n\nMy baby has around 7-8 CALs. They began appearing a month or so ago. One is quite big on her back, but the rest are fairly small (often just at the one centimeter mark). I know that anything over 6 starts to gesture toward NF1, however when she was born there was an investigation into a potential endocrinological issue. \n\nWe had a full genetic assay done where they were looking in-depth at her genes. Would it be possible that they would not have noticed an NF1 marker at all, or does that mean she probably came back negative for NF1 as well?\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this. It can be possible, I know doctors always thought I had it, but test results were always inconclusive even when I was tested at nine. When I was 15 then I was fully diagnosed, The testing for NF is a pretty complicated process from what I remember. I suppose it is possible they did not even check for it specifically. Some diagnostic tests destroy DNA samples, so they only test for conditions most relevant to the issues a patient is having. That makes sense! Thank you. Good to know. So it is ultimately a wait-and-see thing regardless. It really depends on if NF1 was in the previous genetic screening or not. I am not aware of any test that looks for every single possible genetic issue. They can look at a lot of them but the tests screen for a limited pool of issues. I had to go to a genetics specialist to be diagnosed at 23. One doctor suspected it when I was a baby but never got a test for it, and then my parents brushed it off saying I do not have it. \n \nThen at 23 my epilepsy specialist referred me to get a genetics test and then I had a confirmed diagnosis. \n\n\nI had cafe au lait marks on me from a young age, but not many.

My name is Calvin, and I am a transman. I am thinking about starting HRT. But before I do, I am debating donating some of my eggs. I am not going to use them, may as well let someone else, right? \nAnyways, I want to know if I can donate them because of my NF. Will there still be a 50/50 chance of a kid having NF with my eggs? If so, should I still donate them, or would they let me?  There is a 50/50 chance of passing on the disease. I would not recommend it. Most places will reject your attempt to donate.  That is what I have been thinking. Thank you for your answer &lt;3 Any time. Also ftm here :) let me know if you have found any info on hrt safety with NF.  I am probably doing it either way, but not long term, just enough for permanent effects then stopping I got to see a specialist in October, if I remember I will let you know what he says, because I do plan to ask about it. Yeah, I will eventually be seeing an endocrinologist who was previously in oncology at Orange County Children's, but my NF specialist wants to be sure we are caught up on ALL the tests first, to have something to compare effects to.  I have trouble even going to see a neurologist, let alone have an NF specialist. So I am running on the internet for my answers. No one in my family understands why I want to see an NF specialist and the closest one to me is like a 3 or 4 hour drive away. (I am a spontaneous case.) \n\nI never thought about being a case study. Maybe I should look into that too. Though, I am not sure how to go about it.  They will not let you donate. You also cannot donate blood. NF is one of the conditions that bars you from both. cannot they test the eggs to see if it carries the gene? i thought this could be done, like i want babies but do not want to pass it, cannot i have IVF to ensure the fertilized egg does not carry the mutation? You can donate blood with NF. I know plenty of people with NF who donate blood. My dad has NF (and has fibromas all over his skin) and he donates regularly. I have NF but unfortunately dont weigh enough to donate. You just cannot be an organ or bone marrow donor. how do you become a case study? i have never seen an NF specialist, at least not since i was little. i am a little afraid too, even though i know i need to.  At a massive additional cost, yes. Usually 10k a pop.  that is less than i thought, i was expecting like 20K. i would give up a wedding and put that money to having babies that would not have  NF.  That is per try. There is no guarantee that they will become viable.  Plus you still have the same chances for marriage as anyone else. What must women will not tell you is that they will miscarry several times prior to being past the first trimester.  Interesting. The last time I tried to donate was 2005 and it was on the list of conditions. Maybe it is changed since then. I just told the clinic that I would happily be a guinea pig for hrt and NF Research, and let them know I planned to keep close records to publish myself anyways Hmmm that is odd. Maybe it is a state thing? But it cannot be passed on via blood so you can donate. And you actually can donate organs unless they have tumors on them (obviously). It is just the bone marrow and donating eggs/sperm that seems to be a no. My dad donates regularly as well! He also has fibromas all over so I am pretty sure they would stop him if you were not supposed to donate. \n\nPretty sure you cannot donate eggs though. Not worth the risk tbh.  Of course! They would definitely screen out anyone with NF for donating eggs or sperm. Goes for anyone with health risks.  You most likely will not be accepted because you have a rare genetic condition that can be passed down. I have neurofibromatosis and there is no way I would have a kid and place this horrible condition onto them, especially one I would not even raise. ", "Loose joints? Just wondering if loose joints are a symptom of NF? I very very regularly need to crack most of my joints because I can feel a pressure in them. Not sure if they are slightly out of place or there really is a build of of fluid or something. Joints that never need cracking are just my shoulders and upper back which is fused. I crack the top joint of my neck/skull, my lower back, my pelvis, my hips, sometimes knees, ankles, toes, wrists, fingers (several joints of each finger), and sometimes my elbows. I started with just my fingers when I was 7. Occasionally people ask me to stop and all I can say is that I have been doing it for 25 years. There is no stopping. It is not just impulsive. I can actually feel when it needs to pop and when it does not. I crack my fingers the most though, probably a few dozen times a day. Is this just a weird me thing or is it related to NF? I never thought of it has a symptom of NF1, but it something I too have the ability to crack my joints and move different parts of my body. I would also love to know the answer to this question. I crack/pop *everything* (been trying to get my right hip all day!), but never even considered it was an NF1 thing. I feel like it is at least sort of common to get that need-to-pop pressure buildup, definitely have met other people who have it without NF, but who knows. It is definitely common but definitely not to the extent I do it. Hypermobility is common in NF. I have it and can crack some bones and I am double jointed Not Double Jointed but I will look into this Hyper mobility cause last thing I want is ligament issues. Yeah that and edhlers danlos syndrome. Worth mentioning to a doctor with some good knowledge \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe thanks I knew hypermobility is common. Do you think that causes my joint cracking tendencies? I am always cracking and clicking. It could be. But then again it is not rare in people without the condition. I would mention it to your doctor and look up hyper mobility or edlhers danlos syndrome symptoms and see what you think. I do not think I also have that. I do not have any of the skin stretchiness or anything like that. My elbows have a tendency to crack once in a while, but other than some hypermobility that is it.", "Scientists unveil the 'most clever CRISPR gadget' so far - article even mentions NF and how this could lead to a cure for it!

My dad has a little lesser than my grandpa and would I end up having lesser than my dad?\n\nIs there any cure for these NF? Or a way to stop the growth of these? My neurosurgeon has stated in the past it is possible for the tumors to change shape and size, both larger and smaller. However, there is no cure for NF1 or NF2. The best bet is treatment. You will need to speak with your doctors on whether that treatment would be gamma knife, cyber knife, surgery, or just keeping an eye on them.

And then when I ended up going to this college, there were a couple times I would be called names because of my eyes. All I could do was ignore it and move on, they were not worth getting into anything with. My dad (first in family to have it) had a much worse case than me. Much more visible, having to get surgeries earlier than I did at the same age. I have had a few removed, but mostly comfort of life types. But the options for removal are now soooo much more varied than his time. Really quite impressive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut my case is quite mild. It really is random. Perhaps with further study they will find exterior causes that exacerbate it, those studies may even exist and I am clueless. NF is extremely variable. Your offspring may have almost a very mild case with only cafe au lait marks and their offspring may have an extremely severe case with brain tumors, spinal cord tumors, eye tumors, etc. there is no way to predict what a person with the gene will experience. I have a very mild case but have chosen not to pass on the gene because I do not want to risk my child having a severe case.", "Multivitamins/pills and NF1 Is there any known correlation between vitamins, or supplements such as keratin or iron pills on the growth of NF bumps? My assumption would be these could potentially increase the size and number of them. No Why no? All of these are supposed to have an affect on the cells and tissues in our bodies. How do we know they are not favoring tumor growth? No. Because no one has done any research in that regards. You asked if there was known correlation. No, there is no known correlation because no studies have been done.  Musical_throat_punch does not seem like a helpful person.  There are numerous studies that have been done.  There is an NIH study that shows a correlation to neurofibroma growth with vitamin d levels, and a few other studies related to general nutrition levels.  I normally do not comment on things I am not qualified to discuss, but the previous commenter's reply irratated me enough that i thought I would try to be more helpful.  Good luck in your search. Let me know if you have trouble finding the studies.  To clarify, the correlation between neurofibroma growth and Vitamin D levels was a negative correlation (i.e. the lower your D levels, the bigger your bumps were) IIRC.\n\n Thank you! I appreciate the information. Thank you! If you look at the abstracts in the 2017 NF conference program book there is one talking about the supplement l-carnitine, an amino acid. The theory is that some of those with nf have trouble digesting long chain fatty acids which can lead to poor nutrition and strength. When nf-positive mice were given carnitine as a supplement, their strength was ~35% greater than their non supplemented litter mates.\n\nI know a few in the community that take curcumin supplements as well, for its anti inflammatory benefits. The idea is that neurofibromas contain excess amounts of mast cells, and curcumin is a natural mast cell inhibitor. ", "I have NF1 and found something out.. I am going to be a dad.

We were told that our son was showing two of the markers for NF1 and made an appointment with a genetic counselor. After her and the pediatric specialist examined him, they determined that he did not have NF1, but Mosaic NF1 and that he most likely would not have any issues until he was ready to start having his own kids. I am wondering if anyone here has any stories or insight as to how likely \"most likely\" is. What did the genetic counselor do? I mean did they just take a look at the patient, ask for disease history in the family and stuff like that? Or did they take a true genetic sequencing test? I have NF2 and was told i am very likely to be mosaic since i have 3 plexiforms and 4 tumors in my brain, but nothing in the spinal cord or in the eyes, which i should definitely have, given my age. Also i developed the disease myself, rather than inheriting it. But, still, the counselor said that, even if all the clues indicate a very high probability of mosaic, a proper genetic sequencing test, of which i am waiting the results, is the only way to have a definitive answer. Also they really had no interest into making me pay for the test since it is free here, therefore i assume they were telling the truth. My son is 8 and he is the first in our families with a mutated gene. He was diagnosed as Mosaic NF1 through visual exam and history . He has no tumors or any indicators other than a collection of freckles in his armpit and several of the cafe au lait spots.  The counselor and doctor determined that he did not need to do genetic testing since his symptoms were localized to the left side of his chest and only superficial. Well to be honest probably if he had full on nf, you would notice without having to take any test, so you do not need to worry right now. Still in 15 or 20 years time, when he starts thinking at having kids of his own, a test would determine wether the mutation is in such a way that it will not be inherited or if IVF is necessary", "Do multiple cafe au lait spots mean NF?

My question is: are these spots always a sign of a future NF diagnosis or are there instances where they exist on their own? \n\nThanks for any and all comments.\n\nEdit: no family history. The spots are one of the most telltale signs. If she has 6 or more, it is highly likely. But, to be sure, I would recommend visiting with a specialist. You might be able to even make an online appointment. Thanks. I feel awful. My daughter had 6 spots from birth. I have them too so thought nothing of it. She ended up having a cyst removed at 11 months old, a nurse noticed her spots and that is how we first learned about NF. We just had her monitored for a few years then when she was 5 with no other symptoms we got the genetic test. It ended up positive, but she is almost 7 and still nothing else has happened. After her diagnosis came mine, I was 33, I still would not know I had it if I never had kids. I know it is scary, I have shed so many tears worrying about her.

Having six or more of the spots with freckles under the arms or around the groin could be nf. I know the stress that comes with it, but try not to worry until you know. Even if you do find out she does have nf, it doesnt mean she will have a difficult case. I think finding out sooner is better. Its differnt for everyone. \n\nHugs and prayers for you. That is one sign, but not a guarantee. It would be best to speak with her doctor about it, they may refer you to a specialist to do some testing.

You say you are 99% sure the results of the genetics testing will come back positive based on conversations with doctors - are these conversations based primarily on the fact that your daughter has CALS or, are there other symptoms/factors that they are considering?  Also, have you and/or your partner considered genetic testing as well?

I do not know how to share it or if I want to share it with my friends.  Most people I share it with either do not care or do not understand.  Welcome! You and I have some similarities, my case of NF is very mild too, and I am 6'0 :P. Learning disabilities handicapped me for most of my life too, however after working hard I am proud to say that I am about to attend law school! So do not let your disability stop you. As for sharing, I would not share it with friends unless they are VERY good friends. Out of my friend, I have probably told only one of them; and at that, I did not even mention NF, just said I have an issue that gives me the spots. Welcome! I am fairly new as well. As I got it from my dad, people who have known me for years know I have it. But it is mildish so new people in my life either do not know or do not ask.  I am the first in my family to have it  I am the first in my family to have it  We have a few similarities: I am 22 (until the 24th), mild NF1, covered in cafe au lait spots, and a pectus excavatum. I am pretty short, though, and I do not have any learning disabilities. Out of curiosity, are your neurofibromas sub-cu or external? 90% of mine are sub-cu, one or two on my scalp being the exception.\n\nAs for telling other people, there is no shame in having NF. The knowledge that you have it will change nothing for them. If anything, you will grow closer and it may help them understand you as a person even better. They are sub, have a couple unnoticeable ones on my neck, had a very large one on my forearm that I had removed. And one that cause ever so lightly discomfort on my back. Is pectus excavatum common in NF?\n Bone deformities in general, as is my understanding. I cannot speak to a pectus excavatum specifically I feel so much with you.\n\nTbh not even my whole family knows. I got diagnosed only two years ago. My mother only knows because she took the call because I could not take it because I had a test in school. No one else knows.\n\nAm almost 21 now. I am a bit frustrated that I did not get diagnosed earlier, since I had some difficulties in school and now I wonder if it was because of my NF. \n\nDo not feel any pressure to tell anyone. It is your life, and if you do not feel comfortable you do not even have to tell your closest friends.  6'4, I am jealous, haha. I am only 5'7. I have a few tumours, one on my left forearm, that is sadly affecting my ability to play the guitar. And one next to my spine (T8-T10), that is rapidly grown in the last year. I am 19. I would say mine is pretty mild too, a few bone deformities, due to the formation of my hips, my left leg is functionally shorter than my right. Cafe au lait spots everywhere and heaps of tiny skin bumps on my arms that look like sweat pimples (now spreading on legs and face too, sadly). I am pretty new too.  My right leg used to be 4 inch longer than my left Also, I never new that this was due to my NF, I broke my femur as a kid and I was told that was a common side effect. Thanks.\n I uses to have to get all my shoes custom made with a huge lift on the bottom. But I had corrective surgery my senior year of HS I tell whoever when it comes up. No one has ever felt badly of me or anything. It is not a big deal. Like I also have genes that make me unable to metabolize folic acid. That is not a big deal either. What are you afraid will happen if you tell people? ", "I do not feel like anything I do now is even worth it anymore. I am not even 21 and am dreading the rest of my life. I feel terrified over having a progressive disorder that will turn me into something that people will be repulsed by. I have been so depressed since learning more about neurofibromatosis. I genuinely used to think that the few manifestations of nf I have now were all I am going to have. I guess the doctors I have seen through the years never made it clear that it was progressive, nor did my parents. I cannot help but look around at my peers and envy them so much. I feel doomed. I cannot fathom wanting to be alive if my nf becomes aggressive and disturbingly obvious. I feel as if this is inevitable. I have barely been able to function since learning more about nf and looking into it more and feel so sick with dread. I know I should feel lucky for not having experienced significant or lethal problems yet, but I just feel suffocated by what is going to happen. I hate having no control over my body and just want to scream and cry and be someone else or fucking anyone that does not have this bullshit disorder. I hate this so much and am so overwhelmed. ", "Anyone on here got NF3 aka schwannomatosis?  I have got schwannomatosis.  Formally diagnosed about 3 years ago.  I have had one schwannoma removed from my brachial plexus and one from L1-2 of my spinal cord.  My sister also has schwannomatosis, and had a tumor removed from her sciatic nerve. I had 7 removed from my lumbar spine and 5 removed from my leg. Still have more in my thoracic spine at t-4, but my largest is in my psoas muscle. Do you have bone deformities or kidney disease? I do not have any bone deformities or kidney disease.    \n\n\nYou have quite the number of tumors.  I only know of the 2 I have remaining in my spine, but I have not had a full body scan yet.  No obvious pain in other areas, though. I was told that those things are caused by the same gene that causes nf3 so that is good you do not have those problems  but they are really nothing compared to the nerve pain lol. (Raising hand) Me too!!! I am about 4 years into being officially diagnosed. Numerous surgeries at this point and every day is a bit of a battle with nerve pain. Not fun.", "Will I be able to get hrt? I was wanting to start transition ftm. I have not talk to to any doctor yet but I was wanting to take this big step in my live. You would have to talk with your doctor about that. I know hormones can unfortunately cause nf tumors to grow, such as when teens start going through puberty and with woman during pregnancy. \n\nFor some, not everyone the on switch for nf can turn once a teen hit puberty. That is what happened with me. When I was born doctors thought I had it, because of the birthmarks I had and a couple other things, but tests results were inconclusive. They tested me again when I was nine with the same results. I was not 100% diagnosed until I was 15, but we noticed things when I was 14, with large bumps and leg pain. You should be able to, I am on hrt and have nf1, though I am mtf so not sure if that makes a difference. I thought our tumors had progesterone receptors? I think they can, but progesterone is not always prescribed. SOME evidence suggests that various hormones can make tumors grow, but NF is always a crap shoot.  When I discussed a similar issue with my doctor, she was unconcerned... BUT.. I would definitely keep in touch with your NF doctor (or at least a geneticist) to keep an eye on things along with your other doctors and your transition doctor.  I do not think it will prevent you from using HRT but they probably want to keep an eye on things. I am mtf and my genetics clinic who moniter my NF said it is fine for my gender clinic to give me HRT, they just want me to have annual breast cancer screens a decade before cis women normally start. You should be fine. I have NF1 and I have been on T for over five years without any problems.", "Has anyone tried or is on Koselugo? I have a very very mild case thankfully, but everyday I still live in fear of it getting \u201cworse\u201d (more tumors. I only gave maybe 6-10 or so now).

I am just wondering if this is normal since my other three areas do not hurt as much. Thanks! It can vary depending on the location of the tumor and the type of tumor is was. I have had four surgeries related to my Neurofibromatosis.\n\n1. 2001 was to remove a couple tumors on my lower right arm. It was an out patient. This one was less than a week. \n\n2. 2006 my cervical spine, I was in the hospital about a week and then it took a good two weeks at home and about six months until the numbing around my head went away.\n\n3. 2014 a cancerous tumor in my upper right leg, almost a week in the hospital and about a week and a half until I was able to go back to work.\n\n4. 2018 a cancerous tumor in my upper right arm, went home that night and it was about two weeks of recovery.

Can anyone that has used one share their experience? I still feel pretty dry and am wondering if the fit is off or maybe there is a better lens filler? Thanks! I''m in the exact same situation, and have been using a scleral lens for 4 years. I love it! A few points:\n\n- It will take a while to get the hang of how to properly insert it and clean it. Try not to get too frustrated. I still mess up from time-to-time today.\n\n- Wash your hands! I figured my hands were \"clean enough\" for my first year. Then I started washing my hands with soap before cleaning at night and insertion in the morning. It made such a huge difference and my lens stays clear for much longer.\n\n- If your eyes still feel dry, you may want to try a more viscous solution to fill the lens. There are tons of thicker gel drops out there.\n\n- Check out  They have an amazing community, and good advice about products to buy. Thanks! I am wondering if I need to try another lens filler, so I will look at some thicker solutions.  The Purilens still makes me feel dry as much as if I did not have the lens in.  Interesting. Good luck with it! I also wonder if maybe there are issues with how you are inserting the lens and maybe too much solution is spilling out? I had to practice a lot at first, including  3-4 times at the eye doctor. \n\nThe other thing I did not mention before: I had to go through 6-7 iterations of lenses until we found the right fit. I do not think that is causing your issue, but maybe the lens is not fitting right.", "Really Struggling I really hope this post is not hurtful to anyone, I just do not know who else to ask. I am pregnant and just found out that the baby has inherited NF1 from my partner. My partner feels very strongly that we should not continue the pregnancy. Although he would be classified as a mild to moderate case he said it was very hard for him growing up and would not want a child to experience that if they did not have to. I have no real frame of reference as he is the only person I know with NF1. I have been reading forums and seeing that there are many struggles that people with NF1 face, but I really struggle with the unknown. Maybe this baby would have mild symptoms? I know there is no way to be fully settled on a decision. Our genetic councillor has been reminding me that there is no decision that could possibly feel 100% right in this scenario, but I guess I just wanted to know if anyone has been in this situation or has some advice? Termination is extreme. Its your body. If you want to continue the pregnancy, you should. I also have a mild case of NF1 and am 23 weeks pregnant. I denied genetic testing because it does not matter to me if she has it or not. I do have a fetal echo at the end of this month to look at her heart to indicate if she is also a carrier. You can live a normal and happy life with NF. Each case will vary person to person. Its not your partner's decision to terminate or not, its yours. We failed our second attempt at IVF using PGD, totally heart broken.\n\nIn terms of severity, I am fairly mild but this is not certain for any children we may have that gets NF1.\n\nLooking into the possibility of trying to conceive naturally with testing like yours.\n\nHow many weeks are you pregnant? \n\nWhatever you decide on, we wish you all the best. I could be in the same position as you any time, and I would keep my baby, no doubt, 100%. Imagine if someone felt the way about your partner that he feels? He would not exist.  And my partner are not mild by any stretch of the imagination. You cannot say someone should not have to go through life with NF because if you are dead, you are not going through anything at all. My partner would not be who he is without it, though much suffering has come with it. He teaches special needs children and he is a beautiful person with a heart of gold. He struggled mightily growing up. But he is here and he spreads a special sort of goodness that other people do not. I hope your partner can find peace with it. It will not happen overnight, but it can happen. I side with your husband on this but I bet my husband would not like my decision. It is hard to predict severity for most NF1 variants. But you know that ultimately it is your choice, and your choice is the right choice. Hugs, I cannot imagine how hard it is for you to go through this. Is your choice. Is hard to say that, but is the truth.\n\nI understand your partner. The name is  scary and shocking (and hard to pronounce ... neurofibromatosis ... von recklinghausen wow) and if you have the condition the anxiety increases and feel the Guilt. He is not guilty, of course, but probabily his brain say it... and if the kid suffer... well he feel guiltier and guiltier\n\nIs imposible to know if the person (remember, when he born is a baby, but babies grown and had their own opinions) will be \"mostly healthy\" \"mild case\" or \"hard\")\n\nAnd if your question is \" Do you wish you had never born? \" well I have an answer, another person has another answer etc. In my case... NF  it does not make me unhappy. I have depression, **but definitly not for my NF1**. Of course, I get frustrated at times and it really hurts when I cannot do things that I loved because my cyst. But it is not a reason to think \"I wish I had not been born.\" This is **MY truth** but not **THE truth**\n\nMaybe you have to think if you can handle with the worst scenary.  If you can, you can handle better (and bad) scenaries.\n\nAnd of course, is your body and is your choice, but  listens your partner and feelings. Explaine your feelings. And decide. And never regret because is there are not a good/bad choice.\n\nExcuse my english I am  almost 14 weeks. We had not planned on getting pregnant but as soon as we found out we wanted to know. I did chorionic villus sampling at just after 11 weeks. I had felt like I also agreed that ending the pregnancy if the test was positive was the best choice when I thought about it back when we found out we were expecting, but actually facing the prospect of it now makes it so much more real. I hope everything works out for your family and thank you so much for responding. I would say do not terminate the pregnancy. Life is filled with what if\u2019s. Your husband is leaning too heavy on his experiences. It is a tough decision but NF has not stopped me from anything. I have NF1 female and I would never want to bring a baby into this world with NF1. I have had a terrible time. And this my personal opinion. This as personal as anybody can ever give it. True to heart, and I have had lots of talk therapy.\nI would rather be born with down syndrome then NF1. I have nf1 and because of this i will be going through IVF to make sure any baby I have will not have it.\n\nI have a really really mild case of it, but that does not mean any future baby I have will be mild too.\n\nIn the end it is up to you and your partner. I am sure you will be both great parents no matter what. NF1 is not a bad thing as you are viewing it as. I have NF1 and I am a young adult and I am living a perfectly normal healthy life with none of the \u2018 lumps \u2018 Yeah, but not all NF1 has this experience. NF1 can be very hard... you cannot know or prevent for be low or mild case. You (We) are lucky, but a person with NF1 can have terrible sympthoms. Is not be negative, just realistic. Personal opinion\u00a0- this is not as simple as a \"should you\" or \"should not you\" choice, but something you must look inside yourself to see \"How well prepared am I to deal with this for the rest my life and my child's life\" if you decide to go forward.\u00a0 There is no right or wrong answer.\n\nHow will you handle this financially if they have serious medical issues? \nWhat if your child needs special care and tons of doctors visits?\nWill you be able to support your child emotionally with their issues from NF?\nWill you resent your child or partner? \nWill you and your partner be able get through this if he is not totally on board?\n\nI do not believe in glossing things over by saying \"children are a blessing\". It ignores the real issues at hand. Do not me wrong, children can be wonderful, but it is not always rainbows and butterflies even when your child is born perfectly healthy. \n\nI urge you to look inside yourself and your concerns. Write down your concerns and talk about them openly.\u00a0 What is important to you? \n\nAlso keep in mind anything can happen at anytime even if you do not know ahead of time that your child will be born with a lifelong illness. I feel that you should keep the baby. Of course, NF can be difficult and you do not know how it will be a severe case or not, but it is not worth aborting the baby. Since you already know about the inheritance, you can now prepare for severe scenarios. I know you are familiar with what NF can do so being prepared can help you down the road. I have a pretty mild case and was ok as a kid. Just speak with your friends and loved ones and see how they feel. I am assuming you have already sought their advice. It is your choice after all, but you should not make a decision without thinking everything through. No matter what you decide, I wish you the best of luck. I am almost 50 years old. I have  NF1,  none of the skin tumors, all plexiforms. I have dyscalculia, headaches, the digestive problems, and a few more issues related to it. I also have 2 wonderful sons, 18 and 13. Neither have presented with any signs to date, and if I had tested prenatally for it, I would still have continued the pregnancy. I had them later in life, after my husband and I were settled in our own lives. I did struggle with this, I believe anyone who has a genetic disorder would. In fact, even before I was diagnosed, I decided I did not want kids, until I met my husband. It was important to him to have kids, we looked in to adoption, but ultimately decided that we would first try to have our own. It turned out well for us, had my kids presented with signs, I would probably have some guilt and regret. No one in my family has NF, I am a spontaneous mutation, and the thought never crossed my mind to lay any blame on my parents because even at 13, I just accepted that it just was, getting mad, laying blame would not change anything but make us all miserable. I consciously made the decision to live my best life, and I feel like I have.  My parents did everything right, my mom did not drink or smoke, did not do drugs, took care of herself during pregnancy, their lifestyle or behavior did not cause it and I still was born with it. I guess what it really comes down to is your own emotional maturity. If you think you cannot handle the extra care that might come with a child with NF, then give the baby up for adoption, there are folks out there willing to adopt a child. My only regret in life is having an abortion when I was 18, not because of NF, but because I thought the father would not have been involved and I did not think I could do it alone. I was so young and dumb. I try to tell myself that I made the best decision I could with the info I had at the time, but it still hurts my heart. I was born with Neurofibromatosis, neither one of my parents had it, so mine was a mutation. And while yes it was difficult, I would not have wanted my parents to end my life, even if they were aware of me having this condition from the start. And I know they would not have, because they would love me no matter what, illness or no illness. Every life manners and happens for a reason. At the end of the day it is your decision, but if it were me, I would let this child live. Times are changing with this condition, there is a drug that has been approved by the fda that is for kids and adults can have access to it with the help of their doctors. I should be starting the medication sometime next month.\n\nI wish you and your family the best of luck. The choice is yours. Remember that just because ur partner has a mild case, does not mean your baby will too. I have nf1 and it is very mild. In fact I am a stripper and I am doing it to pay for students loans. (I am not advocating for this job. I am just trying to tell you that I look good enough to become a dancer) and none of the guys ever question my freckles or the little tumors I have. They are not noticeable. BUT, here is the big but. \n\nNF1 can potentially cause blindness. you will never know if your child could have an optic glioma. I know that if my NF1 caused me that, I would not personally be strong enough to live. Maybe your baby would not have that because your partner does not have it but the choice is yours. It is literally all yours. \n\nYou are the one who is pregnant. It is your body. Not his. I strongly disagree that NF is not life altering. This misses the point completely and diminishes the daily struggles of people with both minor and major cases of NF. Just because you cannot visibly see something does not mean it is not having far reaching consequences in other aspects of both health and wellness.  While I do agree some parents will go.overboard in treating their child more delicately than needed, this is not the point of my response.\n\nMy response was intended to give the OP some insight into some possible questions to ask herself before deciding whether or not to continue the pregnancy. These are real things that need considering. I want to cry =D\n\nI ever think my english is awful (and probabily is only poor) xD It is up to you. It is your body. NF is really not a death sentence. yes, it is scary. I have it and it has not stopped me from doing everything. Growing up with NF was hard on me as well. I hated it and I still have issues with having it and I will cry from time to time wishing I was not born. But does not everyone? I mean life sucks and it is not this perfectly crafted story book that you read or see in movies. Every child deserves to live. Think about how many people cannot have children due to miscarriages and not being able to conceive?  Your partner has NF so he will be able to navigate with your child the struggles and how to overcome feelings. He found love, you and that is all that matters in life... finding someone that you can be partners with and stick up for in bad times. This is not a bad time though, it is a happy time! At least you do not have to worry about getting tumors because you do not have it. I, if I get pregnant, would have that concern and for that, I am not risking pregnancy. The females on here who do not want to chance it.. may not want to get pregnant for that exact reason. I kind of wish my husband had NF and I did not because I would be okay with getting pregnant since it would not have an impact on me. \n\nGood luck. &lt;3 My vote is no, do not proceed. It was like hell growing up. They say it is 50/50. I have two sons now and both have NF1. Not going to say much about the old one, he has everything I have ..the young one. Sigh, neurofibroma on tongue, trouble speaking, epilepsy and scoliosis where he will have a major surgery on the 27th of this month. Can u imagine the pain as a parent..knowing your kid has to go through surgeries? I will be thinking of you and your family as your son has to have surgery. I hope everything goes well \u2665\ufe0f 1000000% Thanks. I just want to add..If you do choose to go through with it. It is worth it. Seeing you here, I know u will be an amazing parent. Know this...Every sweat, every tear you spend on your kids. It is worth it. It will hurts when u see them hurt - this is true even if they do not have NF1. Best of luck :)\n\nPlease pray for my son Evan. He is having surgery next Tuesday. When it comes down to yes or no question its hard to say. I personally do not want my kids to suffer as I do. If we are hopeful that there will be a cure in future, then have the babies. Harvest the stem cells and have it preserved.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit:  **umbilical cord** I dont have NF1 so I cannot really say if I would rather not exist at all, or exist with NF1.

Does anyone know if having NF can mess up your immune system/ability to produce antibodies?

I was just browsing the Inspire website, and one woman said she had just been recently diagnosed and because she was in her 40s, her doctors think she is \u201cmosaic\u201d. \nI tried to Google it, but the sites I found use a lot of medical jargon that I do not really understand. \nDoes anyone here know what it means? If so, can you explain it to me? And try to explain it like I am 5. Lol. \nTIA! Mosaic (segmental) neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) presents with the characteristic features of NF1 that are limited to one or more regions of the body I am not a scientist, but in general it is \"good news\" in comparison. Unlike other non-Mosaic NF2, the mutation is not present in certain places - like it may be in the tumors but not in the blood (or something like that)....it is still NF2, but as described below:\n\n\"Mosaic NF2\n\nAbout 1 in 3 people with NF2 have a form of the disease called mosaic NF2. The symptoms of mosaic NF2 are milder and often restricted to a certain area or side of the body.\n\nPeople with mosaic NF2 have lower than the usual 50% risk of having a child with NF2. However, if their child does have NF2, it will be the more common type and not mosaic NF2.\"\n\n\\-------------------\n\nThe risk of passing it on are one biggie. As far as restricted tumors, that is not as much the case with our family member, but still......it means perhaps life span can be longer. There are probably many sub-forms of Mosaic....all kinds of differences. But, in general, it means it is found in and.or affects a lesser amount of body systems. That is kind of what I figured, but I wanted to make sure I was understanding what I read correctly. I did not want to assume. \nThank you for the info! Thanks for the explanation! I get lost sometimes when reading medical articles and such. Makes me feel dumb sometimes, but oh well. All the special terminology and everything makes it hard sometimes and I guess I am just too lazy to look up every other word. Lol.\nThanks again! This has great and easily absorbed info regarding Segmental/mosaic NF: ( I have Mosaic NF1. It is exclusive to the right half of my torso. I consider myself to be very lucky. That is was super helpful and a lot easier to understand! Thanks so much!! One or more regions can be most of the body as it is in the case of our family member. I think the description relates more to the actually CELLS where it can be found and identified. \n\nThat is, someone with Mosaic may need to have the actual tumor tissue looked at to find certain markers which may not be in the blood or in sperm/eggs, etc. -\n\n\"**NF2** is present in some rather than all of the body's cells.\"\n\nSo it is some cells rather then some regions. This is not the case usually with NF2 which is a completely different disease. NF2 patients with Mosaic will generally have the head, spine, and even arm and hand tumors - but often not as aggressively growing and starting to show symptoms later in life.

Fair, just worried because of the continued spread of them, thank you! Understandable but you are good Personally I would seek out a neurologist. Think so? What is the reasoning It is a neurological condition. The tumors wrap themselves around the nerves. Here in the states I was diagnosed by a neurologist and his specialty is Neurofibromatosis. I have been seeing him for a little over 20 years. Reasoning taking, while I value the free healthcare here In the U.K. the waiting is wild, took me 4:5 times complaining to doctors to even get recommended for a specialist now I am still waiting. Would love to go private but funds are not there. having a genetic test done would be a more useful to move take.\n\nnf1 is much much more than a skin thing.\n\nand most definitely try to establish care with a neurologist Will look into a genetic test &amp; read much more about &amp; actual understanding NF1.\n\nWould absolutely love to take up the idea on the neurologist, unfortunately the funds are not there to support that so NHS waiting list will have to do. Man I have same condition as you. I am 29M and have same cafe au lait spots all over my body some are big and some are small and every now and then new ones keep on coming and unfortunately you cant do anything to stop them but as soon as you are perfectly fine and do not have any serious health issue you are okay. At last I would tell you to just embrace these spots I know 1 way to get rid of them, try anti fungal tablets!! I get them and they go away, but always come back. I have some on my face too do you think they would go away ? Yeah, try the cream first to see if it fades it then ask your doctor for tablets Could you lime suggest me which cream to use what are you currently using ? Cream - clotrimazole tablets - fluconazole. Any over the counter anti fungal cream should be great to start using and get back to me to see if it is fading or Okay thanks a tonne Anytime, get back to me &amp; let me know how to goes because I would be interested to hear, I have never heard of anti fungal cream/tablets being useful I do not know if you live anywhere near to London, but even if you do not it is worth giving the NF team at Guy\u2019s hospital a ring. Since they are NF specialists they can steer you in the right direction. I live in Scotland, and despite being outside their \u2018area\u2019 they were incredibly helpful and friendly.\n\n I am actually in Northern Ireland unfortunately, but I might actually try to give them a ring, I will phone the my actual doctor today and see if he will quicken things up. Yeah, it is definitely worth calling anyway. They know more than anyone in the UK about the condition and can put you in touch with the best people in your area for you to contact. They could probably also tell you what to say to the GP to get things moving. Remember, most GPs would know next to nothing about NF so even they might not know what to look for or who to refer you to. My daughter was misdiagnosed for almost a year. She came out with over 14 Caf\u00e9 su lait\u2019s. Her pediatrician dismissed me multiple times. They kept increasing and much more was going on but that was my biggest trigger. \nTry and see if you can find a research hospital near by. They sometime will pay for travel and stay. Some of the people in other groups I am in had to do that for themselves or children. \nI hope the best for you! \nDermatologist always told me they will not hurt her and we embrace them. And the neurofibromas are not worth removing because they come back and then some. At least that is what I hear and have seen. Yeah, the only way mine go is anti fungal tablets/cream but they keep coming back. Thag is my biggest worry they are now forming on my arms, wrist &amp; places they would not normally. Will look into it, thank you! I think that what you are describing fits a lot more tinea versicolor than Nf1. \n\nFirst of all, cafe au lait spots in NF1 are an early childhood manifestations and it would be very rare to start in adulthood. Usually the opposite happens, the spots fade. \n\nSecond, the pattern of diffusion you describe, going from torso to arms and legs at the speed you are describing resonates more with a skin disorder that a genetic one. \n\nThird and most importantly, they would not go away with an anti-fungal cream. \n\nThere is a subreddit with doctors here ( they might placate your concerns", "Foggy feeling like video game do you guys deal with this?\n\n( Not sure what you mean, by video game. I play video games everyday, but not sure what you mean it being foggy. Some days if I feel more tired than others I will feel foggy. i am doing some research and people say it is dissociation? or derealization. \n\n\nWhen this feeling gets really bad I can i can only explain it as if your seeing the world through a filter?  its auditory things look clear yet unfocused, everything sounds as if it is underwater\u2026 and when it is not that bad like 98% of the time i do not remember anything too clear from something i did just 10 seconds ago. or a day like today i got a crappy ocular migraine with made things worse.\n\n\nNTM: when i got surgery to remove a neurofibroma off my chest, (sept. of 2020) i would wake up completely paralyzed with my head moving side to side.  i tried to talk to my neurologist about it but that was not any help at all. i got a brain scan and everything was normal. \n\nso i am trying to ask you guys to see this is all part of  Nf1, hope i can get an answer. :) Sorry that happen to you. I have never had anything like that before. I have had four surgeries related to Neurofibromatosis type 1, the last two were to remove cancerous tumors. \n\nI do know that Neurofibromatosis can cause some ear issues. I know when I was little I would getting a ringing in my ear a lot, but that went away when I was a kid. I feel this...maybe not \"foggy\"\n\nbut detached...disassociation on the regular, though I do not think it has any direct link to NF.. \n\nthink its more of a anxiety byproduct My parents will not let me get checked for anything mental health related so i will just have to wait abit to see what is up. haha I am so sorry.\n\nfuck that...\n\nplease talk to your doctor about that...it is so unkind of your parents to not allow you access to support that I am sure you need.\n\nit is proven that individuals with NF experience mental health issues.\n\nI feel you though, when I was younger my mother would not let me take antidepressants. Yes i do 24/7.\nBut i do not think that nf1 caused this.\nI have been depressed and stressed so many years so i thinks that is why i have this feeling. There have been some split moments this year when i do not feel this and some days when it is not that bad. So maybe some day this will fade away The foggy feeling I have/had was, for me, was associated with depression (major depressive disorder). thank you :) I have the same feeling, I also talked to my neurologist and he said that I might be watching too much tv and/or playing video games. \"tv rots the brain\". So I cut down but still having the, yea I know I am here, but what is here? Is this real? What is real? It is like I am in a video game but not really doing anything just sitting and observing the \"world\" go by. I do not think it is exactly the tv/video games that does it for me because It gets horrible when i am in loud public places, or in a loud place in general. i want to talk to my neurologist again but he has not helped me at all in the past 6 years i have known him.", "Twitch Charity Stream for NF A couple friends of mine are streaming on twitch to raise money and awareness for NF.\n\nThey will be playing various board games and doing giveaways to raise money for the Children's Tumor Fund. Check it out, they will be streaming until 11PM Central Time.\n\n ( Fun!  I have a virtual thing I am working on for LA CTF volunteers that is in about 40 minutes, but I will tune in until then. I hope there is a lot more of these. Living with tumours that literally shock you at random times, causing constant anxiety due to the waiting and stress from the pain sucks.\n\nThey did not even shock me until I was like 20. It is only been a few years of it actually doing harm, but I have had it my whole life and have had to go be poked and prodded my life.\n\nI would do a stream on Twitch for this but:\n\n1. I would rather not get more popular on Twitch because of a charity stream; that feels wrong.\n2. I would feel selfish because I have NF1. But millions of people have NF, so maybe it is not that selfish.", "leg/knee pain ", "Does anyone know of any or is part of any clinical trials relating to NF.  Assuming you are in the US, (clinicaltrials.gov) lists everything currently taking place. You can search them by type, like NF1. Check out Plotkin's clinic at MGH and also look into NIH, they have a NF lab set up for many years. I have done ... 4 or 5? clinical trials now. I know one drug has been approved by the fda for children, but it is possible for adults to get approved for it with the help of their doctor. I  am also aware there is at least one trial going on for another drug, but I do not recall the name. I may be starting the one that has already been approved, all the tests I needed to have done checked out, now it is just a waiting period to see if my doctor is able get approval for me to go on the medication.  I have no idea", "Does anyone else have an optic glioma from NF? I have had one since I was born and as I have been told it has not grown. I know it is rare I just want to know other people\u2019s experiences.  My son has one, he was diagnosed several years ago with both a optic glioma and a tectal glioma. He had to have a VP shunt for the tectal glioma.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe dose very well in his life with minor issues. I have an optic glioma and underwent chemo in my childhood. Then everything was stable, but around puberty my vision became worse and worse and last year (exactly one year ago in Sep 23rd), I underwent decompression surgery on my optic nerve.\n\nI will probably need to do my right side as well, but for now it looks stable. Yea I just turned 23 and I know things can get worse over time. I have thankfully had a very minor case ( from what I know). I have two little pimple looking things and then a few smaller plexiform fibromas. \nI just get these random panic attacks about NF and tend to scare myself. I have one. Growing up (up to the age 18). I would get an MRI done every year to keep an eye on it but fortunately there been no changes so they have left it alone.) I still see an ophthalmologist every year to monitor my eyesight. I do as well but haven recently moved so I need a new doctor My nephew does. He had surgery at 6 months and it has not changed in the 2 years post surgery. My son is five and has an optic glioma from NF1. so far he has not needed treatment, I think I read that 20% of children with NF will have an object glioma, and of that 20%, only another 15% or so actually need treatment.\n\nThe good news is since you are past puberty the chances of your optic glioma changing or growing are very very very low. They tend to grow more in the first few years and then they settle down. I have one. I had treatment for it when I was younger and am now blind in my right eye because of the pressure it put on the nerve My son was diagnosed at 3 years old with bilateral optic gliomas. (One behind each eye.) Within 2 weeks of diagnosis he had lost vision completely and permanently in one eye.  Both gliomas were growing.  He had a year of chemo which got rid of the smaller glioma and stabilized the worst one.  He has also had surgeries on the blind eye to debulk that tumor and to remove some of the zygomatic bone which have preserved survival of the eyeball.  \nBut.....again, he was 3 when all this started. If you have not had any trouble all this time then you likely will not.  Many with NF1 have optic gliomas their whole life without any ill effects.  An MRI is a good idea.  Every couple of years will probably be recommended.  Not only does this ensure that the glioma is not causing a potential problem, it also allows routine measurements to confirm that there is no growth.  \nSounds like you are doing good.  Do not make yourself crazy with unnecessary worry! My husband's cousin did. (Its on his side of the family.) He had surgery due to it causing blindness. From what I have been told if theres no issues they wont remove because it could grow back. Hello I do not have NF1 but was diagnosed with an OG accidentally when I was 18 years old after a car accident. At first I was doing MRIs every 3 months then 6 months then 1 year and now every 3 years. I am 33 years old last time I had an MRI was 3 years ago with no changes. I have an eye floater but have not had anything else throughout the years. With that being said I have had major anxiety and depression ever since I was diagnosed. Wish you all well.", "What is your opinion on marriage and kids? Having NF1 for all these years, I have almost accepted that marriage for me is very difficult if not impossible. I often get chances to get into romantic relationships, but I back out fearing that they would eventually find out about my NF and ditch me anyway. Hence, as much as it hurts I avoid getting into a stable relationship.  \n\n\nLet us say I did find the \"One\" and plan on settling down with her. Now we are bound to have kids. Know that I know the chances of transmitting NF1 to your kids is 50/50, I do not want to take that risk. I do not want any of my future generations to go through the physical and mental trauma that I am going through.   \n\n\nWhat do I do in this case?  \nI will need to find a partner who accepts either to adopt a child or have none at all and I know that having no partner will cause more loneliness and depression later in life. Hello,\n\nI was thinking those same thoughts 10 years ago.  I ended up meeting a wonderful woman. When I told her about NF, she immediately went online to learn and understand as much as she could. She even watched the MTV True Life Episode about NF. \n\nI love the idea of marriage and being a supportive unit.  As far as kids go, my partner and I spoke about children and the risks of passing on NF to another and both decided it was best not to have kids. As there are plenty of kids looking for loving parents in foster care.  \n\nI hope you find that someone special. Thank you for sharing your experience. This offers me some comfort. I have NF but it has never hindered me. Mild bumps, freckles, no major learning disability. \nI had a son and passed it down to him. \nHe is 15 and has some learning delays, lots of auxiliary freckling (not really a concern) and some other mild issues. \nThat being said it is part of my decision why I only have one child. I have noticeable bumps and tumors that I am obviously self-conscious about. In my dating life, I was very cognizant of how people asked about them or commented on them. (Assumptions were always the worst and infuriating!)\n\nIn my younger days I was nervous about passing it on, but eventually decided\u2014for other reasons\u2014that I did not want kids of my own. \n\nI am now married to someone who is also child-free and asks questions and supports me and goes with me for some doc appointments and drives me when I have to take anxiety medicine for MRIs. \n\nLike someone else said, there are tons of kids who need love via adoption or foster care. I absolutely understand that is not the same, but it is an option. \n\nAs for telling people about it, like with other personal information, I feel like you know the right time to unpack it. It can be a big deal and be brought up early enough on,  but does not need to be a first date conversation. I am not having kids and I have never been in a relationship. Just never felt like having one. I do like kids and look forward to when my siblings start having kids (none of them have Neurofibromatosis). If you do find the one and you two want kids, you could always adopted/foster there are plenty of kids out there looking for good homes. There may even be kids out there who have Neurofibromatosis and need someone who understands what they are going through. I am married and have the most amazing loving husband I could ever imagine.\n\nWe started out trying naturally with the decision we would not pass NF on. So we tested the pregnancy and chose to end it. It was incredibly difficult despite it being the right choice. After that we immediately went into IVF and did genetic testing on the 5-day embryos before putting one back in. I am currently 13 weeks with our first transfer. I have never had a partner care about my NF, and I am about to turn 36.  I have been with the same guy for a decade and my NF bothers me much more than it does him (he does not care at all).  \n I feel the same way that you do in regards to having children.  I refuse to have kids though, because I feel that it would be very selfish of me to create a child with this disease. I have always been open and honest about my NF from the get go.  If they do not want to be with me because of it, screw \u2018them - it is better to find out sorry than later if I am compatible or not with some before I get too invested.\n\nI met a wonderful man 7 years ago and have been married for almost 2.  He accepts me for me and has non qualms about my bumps.  Since I have always known that I did not want to have kids (both because I just do not want kids and also because I do not want to potentially pass down the gene), one of my criteria  in searching for a partner.  But say you do want kids, there are ways to have kids.  Adoption/fostering is one, or even seeing a geneticist/obtaining a medical consultation/IVF I did PGD IVF. My insurance covered one round of medications. I had to complete two cycles of IVF to get two \u201cgood\u201d eggs. I have two healthy boys. After I became pregnant I started to grow some fibromas but they are not very big or noticeable. When you get in a serious relationship you just have to have a conversation about your options, what you are willing to do and what you can do. I found out that I had NF1 shortly before I got married (at 26). My husband did say it gave him some pause about family planning, but we ultimately decided to forge ahead since I have a very mild case. We went on to have 2 kids, neither of whom seem to have inherited the mutation (we do intend to have genetic testing done on each of them when they turn 10 so they can have that knowledge to make informed decisions about their lives).  But we did decide to stop at 2 largely because we knew we would just be rolling the dice too many times if we kept going. \n\nI think the answer will be different for everyone though, depending on their life experience, and how significantly they have been impacted by their NF. Is it bad that I do not want kids because I have NF1 Just wanted to comment to let you know that you are not alone.   \n\n\nMy reasoning around romance, marriage and children is the exact same as yours. I am not sure if I would be able to live with myself if I knew my children were suffering from NF because of me. I am not sure if I would be able to live myself knowing I ruined a healthy woman's dreams of having healthy children. Exactly man! My strategy has always been not to talk about my condition because ever since I was a child, I always wanted to be \"normal like everyone else\". I am still today extremely uncomfortable to talk - and even write - about it.\n\n*How early into the dating-process do you even bring something like this up? How do you do it?  Would anyone even keep dating upon hearing something like that?*\n\nI know that it is all in my head and that I am probably overthinking it. Or maybe I am not.   \n\n\nFrom a psychological point of view, I know that this is not exactly the most best thing one can do, but since I was a teenager I have rationalised my fear by convincing myself that \"girls do not like me anyways\". Adoption or you can always foster kids", "Has anyone ever attended a summer camp for kids with NF? I know that there are two camps in the US, there is one run by the Children's Tumor Foundation that is is out in Salt Lake. The other is run by NFINC and is out of Maryland.\n\nI used to go to the Salt Lake camp when I was a teen and am wondering if anyone else has attended them. ", "NF2 diagnosis from acoustic neuroma? I am preparing for my follow up after an MRI scan of a possible acoustic neuroma. I have had hearing problems since my twenties and things have gotten much worse in the last 4 or so years. I am curious as to what tests are done for NF2 diagnosis besides the MRI? They can also do genetic tests, to find out what type of mutation you have. NF2 can be caused by a handful of different mutations, or types of mutations. Thank you. I had just recently had the genesight test and was wondering if that would be a valid test but unfortunately that test is not always conclusive when detecting NF2. I do not know what that test is. You should go through a genetic counselor at a hospital. Usually the presence of AN on BOTH sides is the indication of nf2\nBut they can find the faulty gene in blood tests if they suspect nf2", "friends hello, would anyone here want to be friends so we can help each other with this type of stuff? im a 17f of course.

I have had NF all of my life and it is covers up the right side of my face. Also, I have had 14 surgeries since I was a kid and will more than likely have more at some point in my life.\n\nI recently contacted a doctor about possibly taking Koselugo since it has helped people younger than me so it gives me hope. Since insurance companies are a pain to deal with I was finally approved to start taking the medication at some point in the next week.\n\nI want to start doing a bi-weekly Youtube documentary as I go through this journey and I am not sure how to start. If anyone has any good ideas on how to go about doing this I would greatly appreciate it. I might start taking the medication, I just need to have another eye exam done that my nf specialist wants a doctor of his choosing to do it. I already one done here at home, there is some concern with my right eye. I was born with a lazy right eye, even had surgery as a baby, but it did not fix it. All my other tests were fine, I do have high blood pressure, family history of it, but I take medication for that. So my eyes are just the main concern. \n\nI am 37 and have tumors all throughout my body, but my right side seems to be the most effected. I have a large mass on my right leg, even had surgery on it in 2014 to remove some of the tumor that had turned cancerous. They removed all of the cancerous tumor, but could not take out the whole mass otherwise I would have had this empty space in my leg. I have also had three other surgeries. 2001 on y right lower arm, this was just done as a precaution. In 2006 removed tumors that were pressing against my cervical spine, 2018 to remove a cancerous tumor on my upper right arm. Right now we are keeping an eye on the one of my right leg, one on the right side of my neck and then I have tumors growing back by my cervical spine, they are not causing problems right now, so they do not want to do surgery unless they have to.\n\nI am not sure about the YouTube videos, I am never been good with public speaking. But maybe talk about any side effects you may experience and any changes you notice. I know my doctor said they generally do not start seeing any tumor shrinkage until about 4-6 months after taking the medication, but maybe you will notice other things right away. You could talk about that stuff. \n\nI hope the medication works out for you. Good luck. Does insurance cover the medication? From what I have seen online it does not and it is so expensive! I might start taking the mediation next week. I am very nervous and scared. I too have NF1. How old are you? I do not know yet, I have Medicare and the priority health Medicare/Medicaid advantage, so if this eye exam goes well, I guess I will find out after that. They do not. I had a doctor write a letter on my behalf to the makers of the drug letting me have it 37 I am only 9 years older and I understand I am nervous as well. The fact that people our age taking this medication and do not know what to expect is scary. I am interested and would like to know the name of your channel", "Fainting episodes So I started to faint this week, I am really worried because I blacked out in the shower on Tuesday. They attributed it to dehydration but I think it was something else because when I am dehydrated I get migraines if I was dehydrated enough to black out I would have likely had a pretty serious migraine. I hope if this is the curse of NF getting worse that it is quick and painless as possible. Make sure to stay hydrated by drinking water throughout the day and I would speak with your doctor they may want to do some X-ray/MRIs. It can maybe be your bloodpressure. My doctor told me that some people with NF have a low bloodpressure. I have it too and once I said that I saw some blackspots and felt very light headed. He said I could have almost fainted but because I sat on the chair on time it did not happen. So maybe that is a possibility? I had the same issue when I was little. I would faint at least once a week. It was bad. Doctors did a bunch of mri\u2019s and cat scan. They eventually found out I had pheochromocytoma. Get your self checked out. Go see a doctor. Have you had more fainting spells or was it just the one? I have had the same issue.  I mean I have passed out twice, well three times before.  But the times I have passed out have been around people.  I once have passed out twice a few minutes apart, but I consider that the second time.  The time I nearly passed out, everything turned a bright white and luckily I was able to shake it off.  I was told I had an irregular heart beat, but other than that my heart is fine.  I thought it might have been attributed to a high altitude but I doubt that because I have been up to the mountains plenty of times since passing out with no issues.  But, the doctors I have seen did not help much, they just did an EKG.  They really did not find anything abnormal, despite knowing that I have NF and brain tumors.  I do not know, I might have to see an NF specialist about this. Do you feel like you are going to black out when you stand up and start to walk somewhere?\n\nI have been getting this more frequently recently.\n\nPro tip I discovered tho. If this happens to you, squeeze your butt checks together tight and you will not black out. Or it will stop it as it starts happening! Could it be because of Vertigo ? I have NF1 and Vertigo run's in my family. I have to be extremely careful, be fully hydrated, eat well other wise as it helps my condition. It can be any number of things that are easily fixable, and not as worrisome. Very VERY rarely if your BP keeps fluctuating, you have a tendency toward hypertension, and you happen to have NF, a doctor might check for a pheochromocytoma. It is rare to be diagnosed with this. \n\nThe only reason why I mention it is in case you go to the doctor or a dear future Redditor visits finds this page because they googled multiple fainting spells and Neurofibromatosis, along with blood pressure all within the same search. I also wanted to mention it because if you or any future person here is worried that they might be diagnosed with this, I wanted to add a positive IT'SNOTATUMA story here. My BP kept fluctuating along with my heart rate. I felt faint, and I eventually had a doctor check for this (another long story). It turned out I was just under a lot of stress, not eating right, and my thyroid was off. During my search, I did find other NFers online who had this, and things turned out well for them even when they were actually diagnosed with pheochromocytoma. \n\nIf you are fainting, you should get checked out. It can be something as simple as stress, or something rare. I wrote this all out in case your doctor mentions it, or in case you wanted to check for it, and to reassure that it will most likely be okay. Either way when you worry, you suffer twice.

", "Half Baked Man Runs for Charity ", "EXCITED There is this study for a bio-chemotherapy drug and it is is its final stages. my doctors made it so I am their #1 candidate! my other doctor said it pretty much melts the tumors away, or at the very least stops the growth! lets hope I get on it.", "neurofibromatosis and eating disorders? Hi, quick little question since google does not seem to help much. Are eating disorders more prevalent with people with NF1? I do not know if this is a stupid question or not but I am really curious. Since most eating disorders are psychological I would say not, however, I have NF1 and have struggled with eating disorders. I was just thinking because people with Nf also have a higher chance of struggling with learning disabilities and other psychological issues like ADHD it could be possible? Yes, it is possible. But I think eating disorders are a product of diet culture and our (U.S.A.\u2019s) obsession with perfection that influence them. I also was raised with really strict parents who controlled what I ate so that is possibly what influenced my eating habits. Just my thoughts! I have an ED and I think a lot of it has to do with body dysmorphia and already hating our bodies because of fibromas, tumors etc. We cannot control our NF, but we can sure as heck control our weight. So yes, I think it could be common. I just started getting some neurofibromas this year and it plummeted my already terrible view of myself. but I am planning on talking to my doctor about it, and maybe seeking some help for my dumb brain :p I TOTALLY understand! And your brain is not dumb! It is  100% understandable to think the way you are. I am sorry to hear this. Yes, I have hated my tumors and have controlled what I ate to feel better about myself but the good news is that you can often get tumors removed. I finally did at age 31 and am so glad I did.\n\nAnd you are not dumb for feeling this way! I do not believe so. I never experienced a eating disorder and my Neurofibromatosis specialist never has brought about a connection or a possibility. If there is a link, it is more likely through another symptom than from nf itself. ADHD is common, and neurodivergent people often have troubles with knowing if they are hungry or full, which can lead to an ED if you are not careful. My, adult, daughter has problems eating because of the tumors peppering her intestine. She loves to eat but cannot because her intestine do not work well. Now she just makes 90% of her food and eats mostly vegetables and fruit but stays away from too much fiber. She has a tortuous colon. I have never heard of a link between the two. I personally have appetite issues, and I get accused of being anorexic all the time. It is like I tell people, I eat until I feel full. And then I look at my plate and realize I have not eaten much, so then I end up forcing myself to overeat to the point where I feel sick. But that is only because I do not want to hear the anorexia accusations again. I am not sure if it is linked but for sure i have NF1 and went through eating disorders and still", "Yes you can live a normal life with nf1 ", "Is this normal? My recent MRI showed a bunch of new fibromas on my lower spine that were not there at the time of the previous scans (6 months ago). I spoke to my specialist today and he has not offered me any options. He said the scans did not show whether the growths were causing pressure, but did not offer any tests to determine whether they are or not. To be honest I am worried about them considering they are new and are about 2cm each, so not huge but not small either. I am wondering if my specialists\u2019 reaction is normal or if I am overreacting? I think it is normal. Lots of nf people have tumors growing along the spine. Are the tumors causing any neurological problem? Pain? I would scan again in 6 months to see if it is growing. I have had tumors grow on my cervical spine, back in 2006, I needed to have surgery to remove them as they were pressing against it and I could have woken up one day and not be able to get out of bed. I also was having some back pain and warming/cooling sensation in my ankles.\n\nThe tumors have since grown back we noticed in 2018, as of now they are not pressing against my cervical spine like before, my nf doctor want to keep an eye on them and wait and hold off on doing surgery. Did all of them grow back or just a lot of them?\n\nHoping it does not get worse for you man, good to keep an eye on it and avoid surgery. I have many tumors all throughout my body. I have had some grow back over time. Thank you, hopeful all these tests work out and I can start the medication.

I am going to DM you Alochol. I dont. that is really interesting to read, since i also have nf2 and i used to make electronic music. i started because i knew i would not be able to one day (this was soon after i lost hearing in my left ear from surgery). then i had the tumor in my right ear removed a year and a half ago and it sucks to have something comforting like that taken away from me. i am almost 24 and still trying to find what it is i want to do with my life. i have tried. i have been in therapy for so long, seen several psychiatrists, been on like 7 different meds. nothing seems to help. i cannot get a job, i cannot keep friends, so i just spend most of my days doing things to give me some gratification like computer stuff or gaming. a lot of weed too. i really hope i have better days in my future. Wow almost exact same story. Started making my music prior to finding out but I soon was told what I had and then I really ramped up because yes told myself one day I most likely will not be able to.

NF sucks", "When NF is not mild. According to the Children's Tumor Foundation most cases of NF are mild- moderate. With most people having only a few of the possible complications. However, sometimes NF is not mild. My mother is one such case. \n\nShe was diagnosed at 3 years old in 1970's due to severe complications with her growth. She has had over 100 surgeries since then, and has lived over half her life in the hospital. Her NF caused severe scoliosis, severe pain, chiari malformation, emotional issues, facial deformities, hearing loss, stunted growth, migranes, hypotentsion, and congenital bone defects.  \nShe is missing bones, organs, parts of organs, and more because of NF. Recently they have had to remove a huge section of her intestine and one of her adrenal glands. She is barely 4'9\" tall, weighs maybe 90 lbs, and spends her days in constant pain. She has always been on a cocktail of medications, and even though she is in her 40's she has the health of someone in their 70's. She is absolutely covered in tumors and they are very visible on every inch of her body. She is disabled and has never really been able to work, and was unable to finish high school in the traditional way. \n\nThere are other severe cases. Young children get brain tumors and die, I met a young man who had lost all of his vision due to it, NF can causes seizures, and in some cases mental retardation. (\n\nNF is not always mild it can be very devastating, and it affects each person differently (even in families). I myself do not have it, although I had to undergo a lot of testing to make sure that I did not, and she constantly blamed herself the whole time. I think that most people are not aware of the severe cases, and I think the community focuses on the mild-moderate cases even though those people are not the ones who would benefit the most from the research. I did not make this to scare anyone, but just for you to remember that NF can change entire families, and that there is always someone out there who has it worse, and research has come a long way.

Is it crucial to treatment to know what kind of NF I have? I know this sounds kind of dumb but I do not know much about NF and the tumors do not really affect me. I am curious because I am thinking about family planning and stuff. Both are dominant traits.  NF 1 typically affects the peripheral nervous system while NF2 typically affects the central nervous system.  I beliwve both can cause tumors on the eyes.

Hey , just fed up of growing bumps really ...\n\nI have several established large lumps in my thighs and plenty of pea sized ones in each leg and arm, plus a big one in my back.\n\nLiterally, it is like I have lost count of how many I have, and I am never surprised if I am drying off after a shower and rub over a new  one with the towel. Just feels like I am a bump factory tbh.\nDoctors have said \"if they are not painful then great (now stop bugging us)\" and are not interested, I guess that is the NHS though.\n\nDefo feels like I am creating more often , the older I get .. anyone else feel like they are churning more out ? My torso and back are full of them. 100's upon 100's upon 100's. Everything between the size of a pimple to a nipple. It is hard to tell of I am making more, or if they are always were there and just now are starting to grow noticeable. \n\nIt is starting to get noticeable on my arms and most certainly on my face. I used to have a reasonably bump-free face. I could play of the occasional fibroma as a lipoma but now my face is growing very bumpy. I have a large mass on my right leg and many more all throughout my body, so I get it. It sucks, but unfortunately these tumors are very difficult to remove and unless they are causing you a lot of pain, become cancerous or are causing a problem that can put your health as risk, most surgeons will not want to preform surgery to remove them, because of the risk. My Neurofibromatosis specialist will not have me have surgery unless it becomes necessary, because of the risks of doing more harm than good.\n\nI would suggest seeing if your doctor can get you approved for Koselugo, I just started this medication on June 1st, so far I have been feeling good. It will not know for about 4-6 months if the medication is shrinking tumors, but I am hopeful. I could say I have had very little my whole life. A few on my back and 3-4 on my face that started appearing when I was 17. I just turned 40 and they seem to be growing like crazy. Special on my face and torso. The one I noticed on my face at 17 was like a little white spot and now is the size of a pea. I am planning to get it removed as soon as this covid thing ends up. Probably this thing is related to age and body changes. It is funny that as soon as I turned 40 they came to me. In my country there is little to no attention on this. I read they are finishing clinical trials in the US of a gel named nflection. It seems to shrink the small bumps. Take a look. Luckily you will find it available soon in the US. It would be great if you post an update when your treatment finishes I do not believe it is a treatment, I believe I will be on this medication for life. The 4-6 months is when they have noticed changes in tumor size during the trials. I did not know that. Then I hope it gets cheaper. I have heard it is very expensive if you try to buy it by yourself. Yeah, you need insurance otherwise is like the cost of a car. Right now I am receiving it for free through a drug program I was approved for. Otherwise I know with priority health it is $4, which I was approved for through them, but then the state switched me to another insurance short after I was approved and the new insurance denied me twice. Thankfully I recently was able to switch back to Priority Health.\n\nMy doctors nurses passed on the insurance info back the the pharmacy drug program, because they would know what to do with it, so I may end up then having my insurance cover the cost I just pay the $4. Ah, that one is not generally available in the UK at present hope it does something for you though! nflection just released their phase 2a results and they were very promising, but I am not getting my hopes up until the full trial completes. Thank you. Hopefully it will be available in the UK soon. I know it is been about a year since it was approved here in the US. I have noticed the appearance of growing ones, everytime I look at my hands I see the uneven skin and start of someone fibromas. It makes me feel gross and horrible at this point I am planning on getting a shit load of tattoos to try and mask them, they make me so self conscious that I just hate looking at any part of my body at all at this point I also try to be cautious. I do not want to get over excited but it is indeed very promising. I just hope it really works. It would make a change for a lot of people. Specially living with the anxiety that it can get worst, at least from the aesthetic side. I keep my fingers crossed it will work and then get the means to get it. I feel you\u2026 never had them on my hand\u2026 now I see some \u2026 just hate it\u2026 I hope this gel will work and will not be expensive and will come out quickly Same here\u2026 it is since like 2-3 years\u2026 before it was also visible but now I cannot say or it is from mosquitoes , they like me etc\u2026 can I ask how old you are and male or female? \n\nI also stopped drinking milk\u2026 could that also be a reason I get more fibromas?

Was diagnosed with NF2 in 5th grade by having a lump removed from the back of my head. (27M) I have had 7 tumor removal surgeries done in my life so far.\n\n1st one, 2000?, was not really a surgery as it was removed while I was awake, I was 15. This one was where I was diagnosed with NF2 shortly after.\n\n2009 I graduated high school and was starting college when a MRI showed a tumor pressing against my brain, an acoustic neuroma. Had to cut the year short at half semester. When removed lost my hearing in my left ear and was implanted with cochlear device in the brain stem.\n\n5 years later at the age of 23 another tumor was pressing against my brain, this time in the right acoustic nerve. This one made me completely deaf.\n\nSince then I have had 2 spinal surgeries with spinal shunt implant, 1 behind the eye pushing it outward. 6 months after had to go back again to see other surgeon to remove what the last one could not. Then start radiation treatments for the rest that was infused in the bone of the eye socket. \n\nI have various more throughout my body but one that is being closely monitored which is located in my frontal lobe. My mother and younger brother (25) also have NF2 and my older brother(30) shows no signs of it. Out of my mother and brother  and I, my tumors grow at a more rapid pace. Both my mom and I are deaf, with my brother only losing half his hearing. It is been a really long journey and I would like to hear your stories as well. Thanks for reading.  I am about to be 25. I was diagnosed right before turning 17 due to a tumor in my cervical spinal cord, which was removed not long after diagnosis. My hearing declined gradually until just over a year ago when I became completely deaf. I will be having my left acoustic neuroma partially removed next month while also receiving an ABI. I have a cochlear implant on my right side, but it does not really benefit me most likely due to the acoustic neuroma on that side. I was receiving Bevacizumab/Avastin chemotherapy via a cardiovascular access port for 6 years up until my hearing almost completely deteriorated. If it means anything, I have a mosaic case of NF2, which means only a fraction of my total cells carry the genetic mutation.\n\nI am gearing up for my first ever brain procedure. The surgeons are only removing part of the neuroma to, hopefully, prevent damage to facial nerves. I have had numerous small, superficial neurofibromas removed over the years also.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions. I am glad to answer as best as I can. Thank you for sharing! Thanks for sharing! Even though my mom and brother has it also, reading online about others situations makes me feel so not alone. I have had 2 craniotomies within months of each other and it really takes a toll. I have always wanted to experiment with CBD oil.\n\nDo you have any weakness in the legs and hands? \n\nI like going to the gym but my grip and legs have made it difficult to do certain workouts. Not to mention all the balance issues. I do have numbness in my right hand as a result of the cervical spine surgery, but it is not at all paralyzed and I can still use it for most things. I do not feel like I have too much weakness fortunately, but I do drop things from time to time. I do experience mild tingling in my arms and legs.\n\nI have not been to the gym in a couple of years. The last time I went, I failed at the squat rack due to bad form. I think my lack of balance was a factor as well. Whenever I return, I think machines may be better, and safer, for me. My balance is definitely worse than it used to be.\n\nMy case of NF2 is spontaneous. No one in my family has the mutation. I have never personally met anyone else with the condition, but I have great support outlets nonetheless.\n\nI have never tried CBD oil, but I have smoked. I have osteoarthritis in my neck due to the spine surgery and it really helps. I live in a non-legal state but I have access. I understand that it may be a personal choice though to experiment that way and that is totally fine. Just thought I would share.\n\nHow have you been faring post-neuroma removal? I do not think I will really know what things are like until after surgery. I think the odds are in my favor according to statistics, but I am also considering all factors.\n\nThanks for your response!

Because my tumors have been growing slowly and I am not looking forward to surgeries for now.  I was diagnosed when I was 15. No one in my family has it, neither of my parents, not even my grandparents, or younger siblings. I have had four surgeries so far in my life, in the two of them being in the last four years to remove cancerous tumors.\n\n2001 - this surgery I was awake for, it was to remove tumors in my lower right arm. This surgeon actually lied to my parents and I, saying he was familiar with Neurofibromatosis. But when he opened up my arm he saw just how difficult it was to remove. He did remove it, but said he would never do another surgery on me again. For a six month period my arm turned a shade of green and would go numb. After that all my other surgeries were done in Chicago by doctors recommender by the doctor who diagnosed me.\n\n2007 - I had surgery done on my spine to remove tumors that were pressing against it. They said I could have woken up one morning and not have been able to move my legs.\n\n2014 - I had surgery to remove a cancerous tumor mass that was causing extreme pain in my upper right leg. They classified it as a high grade cancerous tumor. \n\n2018 - I had surgery on my upper right arm to remove a cancerous tumor that was shooting extreme pain down to my lower arm. It was classified as a low grade cancerous tumor. But the doctor was unsure which nerve it was effecting, if it was my median nerve and they had to cut in it to remove the tumor I would lose some function to use my hand. Thankfuly it was just my sensory nerve, so I still have full use of my hand.\n\nI do have weakness in my right arm. My right leg has grown weaker over the years. It is gives out and I walk with a limp. I have to be careful going up and down stairs.\n\n Thanks for sharing. I have always felt kind of lucky or at least a sense of luck that I have someone guide me through this diagnosis, my mom, she is the first in our family line to ever have it. I always think back to how she must have felt with NF2 being so rare. You saying you were first makes me wonder how you handle that feeling? \n\nI am from the Midwest and my 2 major brain surgeries were done in California at St. Vincent\u2019s Medical Center in L.A. I am glad that research has gone so far since back when I was first diagnosed, with the advancement of technology. Thanks again for sharing. We have so many surgeries in our life time and it just gets exhausting. I share you sentiment on not looking forward to anymore. That being said I know there is another one within the year to dread. Just living my life to my fullest abilities while I can. Thank you so much for sharing.  It was tough when I was first diagnosed. My Neurofibromatosis Doctor suggested that my parents take me to a psychiatrist back home in Michigan. She was nice, but I did not like sharing, we would mostly just play board games, so after a few months I just stopped going. \n\nI have not had to have surgery on my brain, but my nf doctor does always ask about headaches. I do have tumors around my head and face, mostly small ones. I have a good sized one just below my right ear that is on the neck that we have been keeping an eye on. Otherwise the majority of my tumors have all been in my arms, legs and pelvis, but i still have others throughout my entire body. I tend to have yearly MRI scans.\n\nThere is a possibility that distant relatives on either side of my family did have it. A cousin of my moms it might be a second cousin or some distant cousin, anyways that cousin said they remembered their father having tumors removed from his neck all the time and they would grow back. And then my aunts, my dads sister remember, it was either their grandfather or their great grand father had these bumps on their body. \n\nBut as of right now I am the only one who was ever diagnosed. I guess once my sisters and brother start having families will find out if they are carriers, so far none of my cousins kids on either side of the family none of their kids have it. I would however not one any of my nieces and nephews to have this condition. It is no fun.\n\nI hope your family stays as healthy as you are able to be. Hopefully one day they will have a cure or something that will stop the tumors from growing, maybe even shrink them. \n\n\n You cannot try Avastin?  My surgeries have dropped to a five year window 2003,2008,2014 and both MRI I got six month ago and two weeks ago both show growth and now I have a new one growing behind my skull in a tight spot.  Based on that window and how they growing I would need surgery by 2019-2020 it sucks cuz for us the only sure thing we have is a scalpel. ", "upcoming MRI -- kind of scared! Hello all,\n\nI hope you are all doing well. I finally bit the bullet and signed up for Reddit just to join this community! I am a 21 year old female, and I have just very recently been definitively diagnosed with NF1. I am very luck that I have a (I think?) mild case of it. I am covered in CAL spots -- mostly around my groin and under the arms -- and have quite a few fibromas all over my body. They are tender and hyperpigmented -- just like any other fibroma, I suppose. I have bad anxiety, OCD, and very possibly could have ASD, which I have just learned are potential comorbidities with NF1. \n\nMy geneticist has put in orders for four MRIs to be done soon, on my head, neck, spine, and thorax (I believe). I am a very small person, and I weigh only about 115lbs at 5'4, so I would assume that internal plexiforms would be quite obvious, but I do not know... I heard that if you do not have any plexiforms after going through puberty, then you should be set. However, not knowing is absolute agony. I guess I am posting here for advice pertaining to MRIs, and some emotional support in general. What should I expect going in for the MRIs? What advice can any of you offer?\n\nApologies if this is a bit of a disjointed first post. I look forward to experiencing the camaraderie here -- it seems a very welcoming place.\n\nx Mel The MRI may not give you the news you want, but will give you the news you need. It is understandable to be afraid. Getting one will not change anything in your body, but it will change what you do going forward. It is information. The sooner you get it, the sooner you can act or be relieved. Oh, I absolutely know this. Tbh the idea of being in a loud tube freaks me out. Do you have any coping mechanisms for getting an MRI done? I have heard that some people take benzos, but I have very bad reactions to them and cannot go that route. I am just pretty chill to begin with so the tube is just a good place to relax for me. It is a bit noisy, but I can usually just zone out and think about a few things. It is hard to describe. You do not really need drugs if you trust everyone involved. Just remember you are in a safe space and you will be fine in a bit. I have been having MRIs since I was 15. I have many hours ranked up over the years. The best thing you can do is lie still, stay calm and relax. If you move around too much, it will take longer, because they will have to start the scan over. It will be pretty noisy, but they will give you ear plugs and in most cases you can have headphone on and they will have music for you. \n\nIf you have any other questions, let me know. Some places will allow you to wear your own clothes provided there is NO METAL! Try to show up wearing metal free clothing you are comfortable in (leggings without zippers, a soft long sleeved shirt, a sports bra, and socks) and see if they will let you avoid putting on the uncomfortable gown. The room the MRI is in will be COLD so wear something that will keep you warm. You can also ask your Dr to prescribe a light sedative if you think you need one. Good luck, scanxiety is real and sadly does not go away. You will be in my thoughts.\n\nEdit: typos...wrote before coffee \ud83d\ude0b I am tinier than you at 4\u201910 and 110 lbs....I have had more MRIs than I can count on brain, spine, and neck. They honestly are not horrible. The noise and not being able to move is the worst part...but they give you earplugs and a blanket to keep you warm...I usually just daydream during them and then before I know it they are over. \n\nIt sounds more terrifying than it actually is...but mostly everyone I have dealt with during my dozens of MRIs have been total stars. \n\nAs others have said they do not want you wearing any metals. So go in that morning with no jewelry, a sports bra, and comfy gym clothes. I usually try to wear plain clothes because I made the mistake of wearing something bedazzled when I was a kid and had to have a weighted cover on. \n\nAfter a while you just become dulled to the noises...but they do give you something to squeeze if you need the techs for any reason. \n\nIf you need anything at all...or someone just to talk to going into it do not hesitate to DM me. I have taken mri's before. My first was when i was 6, i am now 25.  I am able to lock out the sound a bit by relaxing. Maybe they will find a plexiform. They found mine just last year. It depends on the place, sometimes they find them in young adulthood If it is not too intrusive to ask... did you have any symptoms before they discovered it? I think I can cope with the idea of plexiforms in any organ other than my brain. *That* is what terrifies me. I had some pain and the pigmentspot above it changed a bit. I also had a little lump above it ( looked fatty) and stretchy skin. The first time ( 6 years prior) they looked into it they did not see it clearly because it was too small back then. It was kn my leg/buttons. That Is why it took so long before they found it. I think if you would have one in your brain you would had some symptoms by now Hello Mel, \n\nI am enrolled in clinical trials that involve MRIs and the noise is not that bad, I even nap during my very long Whole Boy MRI.\n\nThe only place I ever managed to meditate is inside the MRI machine, I guess because I cannot get up and deal with laundry or write down a grocery list or do any of the things that come to my mind every time I try to meditate at home. \n\nWhat I do is that I echo the noise as if it was a heartbeat. Silly, I know but it works for me. \n\nThe MRI will show any plexiform but also internal neurofibromas, often called atypical neurofibromas. \n\nI do not really care about clothing because I strip down to my undies, and they give you a gown  which you keep during the MRI. \n\nI take reassurance into having MRIs. It is the unknown  that is scary . Knowing what is and especially what is NOT there is empowering. You are lucky to have a geneticist who is proactive. The meditation suggestions are a good idea, or finding some way to keep your mind occupied during the longer ones. I have done things like trying to see how high I can count in my head in French learned in high school, mentally sing through the Hamilton soundtrack and see how far I get before it is done, etc. \n\nMRI techs are usually really great from what I have had.  You will be able to talk to them during the scan, and mine have always given updates on how much time is left or when a sequence is going to be longer. If you let them know you are nervous they will not judge you at all and I am sure they would do more check ins like that.  Hey there I am a lot younger than you and I have had 2 mri\u2019s I was scared but they are not as bad as you think I also have NF1 Counting in French in my head sounds like a good idea -- it is my second language, but I am getting a little rusty, and it sounds like a good way to preoccupy myself. My favourite musical is *Jesus Christ Superstar*, so I will also see if I have the presence of mind to mentally sing through that, lol.\n\nThank you so much for your advice! I really appreciate it. I just like to know what to expect before I go into something, so I feel more confident about it. I just hate loud noises... that is what I am most afraid of, even though I know that may sound kind of silly! No that is the same with me just ask for headphones they most likely will give them to you I hope your MRI went well. If you have not taken it please be aware that you lay on a hard service. If your tumors are on you back/spine you may want something to relax your body.", "It is a disorder NOT a disease. Please correct me if I am wrong about this.  A disease is something you get.  A disorder is something you are born with.  NF in all its forms is a disorder.  I have even had doctors call it a disease, and I have to correct them that it is a disorder.  When I do so, I do it with frustration in my voice. I was sorting by new and came across this and wanted to shed some light.\n\nIt is possible that your physician is referring to it as a disease because prior to the new terminology, the disorder was referred to as von Recklinghausen's disease.\n\nA short easy way to remember the difference is: A disorder means that your body is not functioning normally (for what constitutes as normal limits of functionality) \n\nA disease means that your body is not functioning normally, and science understands the specific process that led to that state. Everybody with the same disease undergoes the same basic process. There may be variations, but the underlying process is the same. Disease and disorder are synonyms They do not mean the same thing. Read the other comment. Disease - \"A disease is a particular abnormal condition that negatively affects the structure or function of part or all of an organism, and that is not due to any external injury. Diseases are often construed as medical conditions that are associated with specific symptoms and signs.\"\n\nDisorder - \"a disruption of normal physical or mental functions; a disease or abnormal condition.\"\n\nAnd I am aware it used to be called Von Recklinghausen's disease and that could definitely play a role in why your doctor calls it that but the words are synonyms. They are not. I would not get upset over something like this, I have it and I consider it to be a neurological disease. It can cause cancer, I have had cancerous tumors removed, a disease can also get worse over time, Neurofibromatosis can get worse over time, maybe not with everyone that is born with it, some are lucky, but for those of us that are not. It get progressively worse. This is spot on.\nThere is no universally mandated defenition of either, disorder or disease that everyone will agree on. That said virtually all defenitions of \"Disorder\" explicitly classify it as a disease, and I have never seen any non colloquial (\"personal\") defenition of disease that mandates it be something contagious or acquired or any other criteria that would exclude NF from being a disease .\n\nI see this \"do not call it a disease\" nonsense all the time, not just in the NF community but with other disorders /syndromes /diseases/whatever and it is honestly just tiring. I cannot help but wonder how it helps or makes any difference whatsoever. It is not stopping ignorance or educating anyone, it is not bringing better or more nuanced understanding of the disorder.\n\nCherry picking Google results to argue semantics for a personal vendetta while explicitly disagreeing with a dictionary definition is silly.", "Meeting with a Perinatal Genetic Counselor I will be meeting with a Perinatal Generic Counselor this week. I was referred to one by my PCP because my boyfriend and i are talking about having kids and want to go down the IVF route so we do not risk passing my NF onto our kids. has anyone met with one? what kinds of things should i ask? what can i expect out of this appointment? My wife and I are going to do the same thing soon so hearing your story will help us on our journey. My partner and I met with a genetic doctor after having our first. He talked through the process of selective embryo IVF, and various health considerations. Your counselor will no doubt talk you through the whole process, and you may just need to ask clarifying questions. i will definitely let you know how it goes! i am meeting with one friday morning :) oh awesome! thank you so much! My husband and I are going through IVF right now. The genetic counselor asked questions about my husband's medical history and had a blood test done just to confirm that has NF and then another test that identified his specific mutation. It lead of down a path of more tests since his specific mutation can also cause another syndrome that causes heart problems. \n\nAs far as IVF goes, you will have to have a probe made for you specifically to identify the affected embryos. It takes a while to make it. We had to send in spit samples and get samples from his parents too. Since it is a spontaneous mutation in his case, the genetic company had to use samples from our embryos too. This requires at least four embryos and it can be from arrested ones if you get a small number. It takes about a month to get the results back. We had 10 embryos from 22 eggs retrieved.  8/10 were affected by NF and 1 had trisomy 21 (they run the regular genetic testing concurrently). We just transferred our unaffected embryo and will have to start over again if it does not work. Insurance has paid for nothing in the fertility area since we do not have any known issues. We are lucky because I saved up for several years and also managed to qualify for a fertility loan. We are also blessed to live with driving distance to one of the top clinics and they have dealt with a few other couples in our situation. We initially tried a clinic that was local and it was a complete disaster when trying to just set up an initial consultation. I would definitely research the clinics near you to see their frozen embryo success rate (you will have to do a frozen transfer due to the testing) and their overall treatment of patients. \n\nI am sorry for writing a book. I just started out thinking that this would be an easy process, but there is no guarantees even if you have no history of fertility issues. It is also very time consuming, expensive, and emotionally draining as the medication can really throw you for a loop. thank you so much for all the information! it sucks that insurance does not cover it, i know that IVF can get expensive. i have a friend that went through it for fertility issues and hers covered a good portion. i am hopeful i am one of the lucky ones that can get it covered. i wish you the best of luck that your transfer was successful \ud83d\udc95 \n\nmy appointment actually got pushed back, they are calling me to reschedule because they want me to meet with the doctor after speaking with a counselor. i am hoping i do not have to wait too long You are welcome! I hope you will have better luck with insurance. It did actually help us in a way because my husband was able to get Koselugo for free after insurance denied it by providing them with all of our fertility bills as proof of financial hardship. We definitely could not afford it otherwise. \n\nWe started with the genetic counselor back in December 2019 and did not get to do our retrieval until October 2020. I am not sure how much Covid slowed the process down, if any. that is awesome!! has Koselogo helped your husband with tumor growth? \n\nand that is honestly the perfect timeline! even if it is a little longer because of covid, i am just trying to get all my ducks in a row for when we are married and ready. hoping that is in the next year \u263a\ufe0f He has a large fibroma in his neck that is slowly eating away at his jawbone and we can tell that it is definitely shrinking some from the monthly selfies he takes to document. He also said that he can feel part of his lower teeth that he was not able to in years. It is only been about six months since he started it so he has to wait three more months for an MRI  to know what is going on inside. \n\nI hope everything goes well for your wedding and family plans!", "The pain, please help So I have been diagnosed with NF1 for about 4/5 years. (I am 21F). I have had two surgeries to remove the tumors. I have never had too much of an issue with pain. I would occasionally get a sharp, shooting pain where my tumors are/where I had surgery. But it would only last for maybe 30 seconds and stop. \nIt is starting to become so much more frequent now and tonight is the worst it has ever been. It is  *debilitating*. I cannot sleep and it will not stop. It is horrible rapid burst of the sharp, shooting, stabbing pain. It is making it hard to breath. I do not currently have a specialist, but I am definitely going to try harder to find one now.\n\nI am afraid of the medications tho. Can anyone give me any insight into this? \n\nSorry for the rambling. I have NF2 and I currently take Gabapentin/Neurontin for nerve-related pain. I do not know if your doctor has mentioned it to you, but you should inquire about it if not and see if it would be fitting for you. I have nf2 and am on pregablin similar to gabapentin and have been on it 15 years, I only realise how much it helps if I run out!  \nIm  on amitriptyline and I think it works for nerve pain as well.  I am not sure about side effects in the long term, its been that long since I started them. I am supposed to be on gab for nerve pain (spinal nerve root tumor) but it seemed to stop working after awhile and the brain fog made me basically non functional. I could hardly hold a conversation because I would forget what I was saying or thinking from one moment to the next. I know that doses can be adjusted. I must be on a lower dose. If I go off of it for too long though, my nerve pain returns and I have to wait 3 weeks for the medication to take effect again. I have been taking pain medication since 2007 and it helps with the every day pain I have. Then a few years ago my doctor added a second pain medication to take along with the one I have been taking.\n\nWhat my pain medication did not work for was very intense sharp burning pain. In 2014 I was having pain that was no bad it was hard to drive, I could even sit and lay down and be comfortable. It turned out the tumor in my right leg had become cancerous and needed to be removed, once it was removed that type of pain went away. Then in 2018 of April I had a burning sharp pain in my right arm, a biopsy had to be done on that one as they could not tell if it was cancerous from the MRIs. It ended up being cancerous and as with the one that had been in my leg that pain went away.\n\nI do not mean to concern you, but it is possible that the tumors have turned. You should speak with your doctor about what is going on and get yourself checked out to be on the safe side. In my experience with NF1 it has always progressed to where I need surgery. I have had several and it has been the only thing that has worked for me. I have been on a few different medications, one of which had me so zonked that I lost my job because I just was not all there. Those shooting pains are the nerves firing off. What has worked for me has been excision of the tumors and in some cases severing the nerve at that specific location. Before you go on to getting a few scars  please see a neurologist and a good primary care provider. Ask your primary for a reference in your insurance network and ask for whatever referrals you need. A lot of what you will benefit from will be up to you in most cases. You will need to advocate for yourself. If you need support, please come back to this sub or DM me. I can give you as much support as I can. Thanks! I have had surgery a few times, but mine are plexiform so they stopped doing surgeries :/. \nIt is definitely becoming Inconvenient I would be taking it and still limping. Thank you! \nI am working on getting a specialist now", "Driving Manual? Do any of you guys drive a manual? I am slightly worried about my coordination because of my NF but wondering if it was doable. How good does my coordination have to be?", "how do you do dating? (online) ", "does anyone else get frequent \"zapping\" sounds in their head from movement? this might sound very weird and i have not talked to anyone about this before.\n\nwhenever i make sudden movements, usually with my eyes, i get these sounds that are like electrical zapping or metal scraping or something accompanied by a slight shocking sensation. it is usually most noticeable when i am sedentary like laying down with my computer or phone. it goes on for like weeks at a time i think and is less noticeable other times. it has been a thing for me for many years.\n\nit is quite similar to the sensations i would get using an ABI which is why i stopped using mine. it may also coincide with the stretches of time that i am not taking my SSRI medication (for anxiety/depression).\n\nfor context i have NF2 and have had acoustic neuromas removed from both sides leaving me completely deaf. You usually take SSRIs and it happens when you arent taking them? Sounds like classic brain zaps... I also get them after fevers... And sometimes with fast head movements. I do not have nf2. I think this is just a somewhat normal thing oh, strange, it is so disorienting. but you are probably right though, i have been back on my meds for a few days and they are gone. It is basically a normal reaction from inhibited reuptake from Serotonin. It is completely normal if you are off and then back one SSRI's. It is just your brain reacting to the meds cuz it is not constantly supplied with the same concentration. Please take your meds daily tho and try to stop having breaks from them.", "18 Month Old- pediatrician concerned about cafe au Lait spots. Hi everyone! My 18 month old son- very healthy and pretty typical, had his check up today, and our pediatrician noticed some light tan spots on his back and sides. I had noticed them before as well, but thought nothing of them.\n\nHe suggested we see a dermatologist first to confirm they are cafe au Lait spots, and rule out or diagnosis neurofibromatosis.\n\nI consulted Dr. Google, and I go from moments of terrified to strangely calm. My son also has a head size that is off the charts, but so is his height and weight. He is followed a normal growth pattern.\n\nAs far as hereditary, neither me or his dad have this diagnosis. However- in looking up cutaneous fibromas, I have realized that I have a textbook case on my scalp. I also have what I assumed were lipomas in both of my thighs. Maybe fibromas?\n\nI am not seeking a diagnosis or even reassurance, but wanted to reach out to those who may have been through this in one way or another, and seek input on what things might look like from here. We see a dermatologist tomorrow afternoon.\n\nThank you! When I was born my pediatrician and even my eye doctors all thought I had Neurofibromatosis, but test results back then were inconclusive, I was tested again at age nine at the university of Michigan with inconclusive results. It was not until 1999 when I was 15 that I was fully diagnosed at the university of Chicago. \n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask IF your baby has NF, stay positive. With NF there is an enormous variation in outcomes (like visual impairment varies - from those who need visual aids to those who have no vision whatsoever). Assume for now that there may be some related challenges but do not assume the more extreme cases will come to pass. NF1 is weird it is genetic  and random at the same time. If it is confirmed  for child down line they will have 50% to pass the gene .\n\nBest wishes , all I can says is keep being postuve for your child,  very slight chance home school (like those online k12 schools will be your friend), growing up I missed lots of school do to Dr's appointments thoughout the years,  do not be scared to get  checked for IEP early one , \n\nI would say get genetic  testing done if your insurance does it;    there is another disorder  called. Legius syndrome and in early stages in life person will get misdiagnosed  with NF1  ( some of big things cafe spots and big head are in both if them , so are other learning disabilities  such as add and adhd,, freckles in weird spots,  \n\nSeveral disorders have cafe spots.\n\nThey more then likely will confirm  a diagnosis  if child has 6 or more spits bigger then 5mm\n\nI was diagnosed  with NF1 around 5 years of age  ,I have a large head,  freckles all over , over 60 cafe spots, nerve tumor on my neck (benign ), two benign  brain tumors one covers both hemispheres  and one on left hand side , vision isdues, adhd , consistent  muscle pain \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSo in short , all I can say is best wishes  it may be too early to give a proper diagnosis  but it is something  that they will watch over next few years.\n\n\n\n\n Thank you so very much for your time and response. I wish you the best and may be back here with more questions.  Where do you live? The local NF organization in your area may be very helpful and willing to talk to you and send information. I have NF and work for the NF organization in my area and one of our missions is just that.  Thank you so much for your time and response! We will try to just take it one day at a time. We live in Northwest Arkansas! We do seem to have a neurofibromatosis clinic at our children\u2019s hospital. So, I am having hope that we can go there if need be for diagnosis and or treatment. Check out the Facebook group called NF Mom's ROCK!!! It is very supportive and has a ton of parents. :) \n\nMy son was diagnosed with NF1 around that age because of cage au lair spots and then a positive genetic test. He is now 3 and he had a small optic glioma that we watch with MRIs, so far it is not needing any treatment. He is more likely to have ADHD and struggle in school but that is okay. The scary parts of NF do freak me out, you just have to take it one step at a time. Best wishes!  Sure. That is great there is a clinic! And if you want any information about NF whether its before or after your diagnosis you can register with us at  There is no local organization in the Arkansas area so NF Midwest would be happy to help you out by sending a free packet of information or just talking to you. I wish you the best of luck!", "Bleeding Nerofibroma I have several neurofibromas on my scalp. During this pandemic I decided to cut my own hair. While doing so I hit one of the neurofibromas and it bleed profusely. Has anyone else had an issue with a neurofibroma bleeding? I once knicked on on my leg when I was shaving and it bleed for a bit and scabbed up bad. I have one on my abdomen that was scratched by my dog and it bled a lot for a long time. Once it stopped bleeding, probably an hour later, it was less puffy there. This was years ago and that spot is still less puffy. I think the bleeding has to do more with where you cut yourself, not the tumor I have had this...I have also had some some plexiform ones removed. The bleeding normally lasts for a little while, but then it will go away. The ones that I have had removed...as others have said, are less puffy....but just look like deflated plexiforms", "Introducing myself I knew nothing of NF1 until I met my wife,  she is 2nd generation and 1 of 3 of 6 siblings who have it. All 3 of our children inherited it.   It was passed on by her siblings to several of the grandkids, one who passed away thanks to an aggressive peripheral neural sheath tumor.   (cannot remember the exact medical term) \n\nOf my children,  all three have had plexiform tumors,  my oldest has constant pain thanks to growths that we have been unable to fully remove.   My second child has 2 large tumors that are inoperable (one in the should and one in the hip)  The one in her hip has caused a leg length discrepancy which has been corrected thanks to the great doctor's at Shriners.

", "Update: electrodesiccation and healing I made post in October inquiring about people\u2019s experiences with post surgical scarring of fibromas, and I figured to make an update regarding my own healing (hopefully that is allowed on this sub). I (26F) had electrodesiccation front-to-back to remove all of my visible fibromas (about 50 small bumps/skin tags) in early October. My NF is mild, but I wanted to get my bumps under control before they grew larger/more come in. So far, all but a few of my larger ones are completely flat and healing. The few larger ones that did not go away completely were under the skin and will be removed via scalpel at a later time. I have a fair complexion, so the areas that were desiccated are still red, but they are lightening everyday and should turn white after a few months.  My skin is so smooth now, and I have felt so much more hopeful about my future and the physical side effects of NF1. Even though I have noticed a few bumps around my body that the surgeon did not get to, it feels good knowing that I can always go back. This is grest news. My 12 yo daughter has nf1 and just recently noticed 2 fibromas coming in. Letting her know that others are dealing with this and that there is a treatment for the bumps will surely help her feel better. Thanks for sharing You do not happen to have before and after pictures (i mean, if they are not risque)? Where were they located? I have a LOT on my chest and they annoy me and it is unsightly (M) so I am quiet interested in this process. \nI have asked my dermatologist in the past about laser removal but he was not much for it back then (+10ys ago) because it meant lots of scaring (i think, my memory is bad).  \nHow long did it take? In one sitting or multiple times?  What is the aftercare like? Could you explain how the process goes? I do not have pictures, but my bumps on my chest looked like small skin tags. I had about 20 tiny ones on my chests/ribs, and now they are all flat/smooth. It is the same case for the various ones he treated on my back, shoulders, arms, face, and legs. I still have red scarring, but it should fade to white once it is fully healed in a couple months. My surgeon was able to remove all visible bumps in one 1 hour session. He did not get every tiny bump on my body because the procedure works best on lesions above the skin. I want to go back in a year to get whatever ones he missed/new growths. The aftercare is pretty simple. You are covered in black scabs afterward, and you need to keep the skin moisturized to help the healing process. I have been using aquaphore, cera ve lotion, and silicone scar sheets to excellerate the healing. I had no pain, but a little itchiness. I really would appreciate an update around 6 months from now, if possible. I am interested in the long term results from electo-desiccation! this is an amazing update! i am going next tuesday to get a bunch of tiny ones on my face that just look like acne removed. i am so excited to have smooth skin again! Will do! I hope everything goes well :) thank you so much for the information. I will have to talk about it with by dermatologist when I see him in two weeks. (I Actually had 2 cut away the day you posted this :D) Hopefully this is something he can do. thank you! \u263a\ufe0f You might also have luck asking a plastic surgeon. There are more and more in the US (I am not sure about other countries) who have experience removing hundreds of fibromas at once. If coded correctly, insurance companies are more likely to cover the procedure too. There are a few surgeons around here. I will ak around. thanks for the tip.", "Chiropractor with NF Has anyone in here seen a chiropractor? My neurosurgeons who knows nf really well suggested seeing a chiropractor. Curious your thoughts. Admittedly I do not have a sever case of NF, I have a few fibromas on my brachial plexus that result in some tingly numbness in my arm and then lots of small bumps on my skin spread throughout my body. My stepfather is also a chiropractor. I am not the biggest proponent of chiropractors in general. I think they can promise to be able to do more than they really can. I do not think there is any harm is seeing one though. They can be really good at releasing tension and helping with soreness.\n\nI would also be careful, there are a lot of quack chiropractors out there that are not so great. Also plenty of good ones. In short do your research on the practice and do not expect it to have the biggest impact, but it may be nice to get adjusted every so often because you do feel better after. I go to a chiropractor weekly. My NF is really mild but he is not like some previous chiropractors that told me he could cure my NF with 3x weekly visits. Both parents are chiros, NF is a big topic of study due to the range of bone deformity. I get adjusted regularly Went to chiro but it did absolutely nothing. I also have fibromyalgia so that may have been a part of it Years ago back when I was first diagnosed, my dad ask my specialist about taking me to a chiropractor and we were told that a chiropractor would not know what to do with me and it would be a nightmare to them. But this likely had to do where my tumors are, Neurofibromatosis does effect us all differently.", "Presumed Mosaic/Segmental NF1 Hi all,\n\nBeen going through a year-long medical roller coaster (delayed a bit by COVID) that is leading the neurologists/genetic counselor to believe we are dealing with a segmental/mosaic version of NF1. The interesting part is the clinical presentation. At first they thought it was NF2 or schwannomatosis because there were multiple presumed schwannomas in just one leg. Brain and spine MRI came up clean. Now, after surgery to remove a few of these masses, the pathologists confirmed there were 2 neurofibromas and 1 plexiform neurofibroma along the nerves in one calf. Now they are thinking it is a mosaic/segmental version of NF1 because there is also one CAL on the foot on the same side. The weird part is there are no skin issues like you commonly see when Googling NF1. Presuming the genetic testing of the tumors comes back with NF1, what should be expected for tumor management? Has anyone else had to deal with these tumors over a long period of time and can share some personal stories? I am grateful that it is more than likely a mosaic form of the condition, but know it still needs monitoring and may need future surgeries. Heyo! Fellow mosaic NF1 patient here.\n\nI was just diagnosed a couple of months ago, at 37. I have had these nodules growing around my left ear for over a decade - they are small, a large pea at most, but I keep getting more and more. After so many years of asking doctors what they are and getting disinterested shrugs, I finally found a doc with some curiosity, and ended up having three of them removed and sent off for pathology testing. The hospital lab could not figure them out, so they were sent to the Mayo Clinic pathology department who confirmed they were all neurofibromas with plexiform features. (So, as I understand it, not a true plexiform neurofibroma, but with similar histopathological characteristics.)\n\nMy regular neurologist was stunned, because I have almost no clinical features of NF. No CAL spots, no Lisch nodules, no freckling, no bone deformities, no optic gliomas. I do have autism, so that counts as a developmental disability, but there is no way to know if it is connected.\n\nAnyway, she referred me for genetic testing, which is ongoing. They started with a blood test and I am awaiting the results now. The presumption is that it will be negative, because it is a segmental case, and we will proceed to taking a skin biopsy in my affected area to send to the University of Alabama for specialized gene testing.\n\nIn the meantime, I happen to have accidentally seen a world-class neurosurgeon in another state with several years' experience in neurofibromatosis. I mean, I saw the surgeon on purpose, the part about him being an NF expert was a total luck bomb. I have trigeminal and glossopharyngeal neuralgia, which are severe nerve pain conditions caused (in my case) by arteries inside my head rubbing against some cranial nerves. The nerves get rubbed raw over time and the oversensitization causes excruciating, random shocks of nerve pain constantly throughout the day. I am having brain surgery in November to move those arteries away from the nerves. (It is unconnected to my NF, though they affect the same area. The NF probably makes my pain worse, because it changes the way the nerves work a bit, but it is not causing the pain.)\n\nAnyway, this doctor I sought out happened to be an NF expert as well as a fabulous neurosurgeon, and when I described my (lack of) NF signs to him and he saw the pathology report, he immediately said that I had mosaic NF1. He said I should still get tested, but that he had no doubt and I should begin managing my health accordingly (monitoring, imaging, etc.) My case appears to just affect the left side of my head and neck.\n\nSo that is where I am at now. I got a lot of information from the genetics people, who asked me a billion questions and then later, prior to testing, counseled me about NF1 for about an hour. I hope you have or are going to talk to some genetic counselors: they were incredibly helpful. I cannot recommend it more highly.\n\nHope things go well for you! Wo Thanks for such a detailed response. It is crazy how two different types of mosaic NF1 can present very differently. We are seeing a genetic counselor who has been a lifesaver for really explaining the meaning of everything we have been learning. I am excited for results from the genetic testing. We are in the process of family planning and are being referred to a different genetic counselor who focuses on that. I wish you luck! Hopefully the NF1 does not affect your reproductive region! Fingers crossed for you, and best of luck with growing your family.", "Neurofibromas are more visible when I am at \u201chealthier weight\u201d i.e. less visible when I am \u201coverweight\u201d. Although when I am less active \u201coverweight\u201d my cognitive &amp; neurological impairments seem to be more severe. Although my memory seems worse every day. Anyone else notice a correlation of the two? Forgive me as I am tired and not entirely coherent so I may ramble. I was not diagnosed with NF1 until my late 30s when I was in the midst of a year long running streak. I would noticed some bumps on my upper torso and arms when I would get really hot or in the right light and thought maybe those were just fat. I would always been pretty active and ran a lot but this particular summer I would lost a lot of weight. I was stressing some but running non stop. I could not always get my mind right. Foggy or clouded thoughts. Short term memory issues. Just strange. Concerned I finally went to a doctor about a large cyst I would developed on my face. The doctor referred me to a dermatologist who was very concerned about a couple of the bumps. The largest one which had between my lip and chin had been somewhat concealed by my beard even though it was short at the time. I attributed it to an ingrown hair that would not go away. Anyway. He decided to remove it and biopsy it.  Oh my God the terror of waiting on the results. The longest 3 day weekend of my life. Having Shown no other signs of NF the first thought was of course cancer, some sort of leukemia or skin cancer considering i was always out in the sun.  He checked me and found some cafe au laits on the lower portion of my back and legs. It was odd because at nearly 40 I would be a strange case for late diagnosis. Anyways. It was good news to get the NF1 diagnosis especially considering my age and the other possibilities. But then the fear of did I pass the gene on. After multiple trips to a geneticist and neurologist it does not appear any of my children inherited and apparently none of my older family members have signs of it. So strange. Other than about two years ago my teenage daughter started having seizures which ended up being attributed to epilepsy. Multiple MRIs and Cat scans later it appears she does not have any tumors causing them. So another complex late onset health issue. Further complicating my issues. No clue what kicked started it other than a few trips to a testosterone therapy clinic by the gym. Excess hormones or something? Who knows.  Anyhow. Back to the point. I am sorry. I used to be a great writer I have like a super processor miss firing and I cannot construct this properly.  \nWhen I was very active for the first two years it seemed my spots were very noticeable. Especially when I got hot and sweaty. The more weight I lost the more bumps I had. Just all over my upper torso and arms. None below the waist at all though which baffled the dermatologist and the geneticist. Over the last year work and kids busy activities have prevented me from being as active as I would like. I put on probably 30 pounds. I am now at 240. The heaviest I have ever been but my neurofibromas do not show up much at all. A few on my arms in the right light if I am hot and some on my neck. I am concerned though with my health. My BP and Heart Rate have both been the highest they have ever been the last two doctor visits.  Granted BP was just 142/81 and HR was 88 but that is much higher than I have typically had. Also being lest active my cognitive abilities are wrecked. I can forget something when I walk into the next room. Recalling certain information can be painstaking. Normal functions and such seem to be fine but it is just harder to concentrate I suppose. When I was at a healthier weight and active these issues were not as severe. So long jumbled story short. God I hope if you suffer mentally as I do from this you were able to follow.    Anyway I am starting my run streak back and plan on running everyday for the next 425 days or so to break my last streak. I want to lose 30-40 pounds by summer. I am hoping my BP and HR return to normal. And my cognitive abilities improve. But I know with weight loss my \u201cspots\u201d are going to really show. It is just miserable. \n\nSide note. Do any of you relate excess stress to the NF1.  Not related to stress about the NF1 and it is side effects but just stupid stuff and strange stress over little things. Pettiness I suppose. And impatience. I am reaching now. Sorry. Thanks for you time.  I think the Etch A Sketch Brain is the worst part of NF1.   I want to remember my wife. My children. Enjoy experiences with them. Recall things. Tell stories. I cannot stop. Must post now.  Sorry again folks.  Have you spoken to a neurologist about these concerns with cognitive function? Speaking from a personal perspective as someone with NF1, Some side effects of NF include ADD/ADHD (which affects memory and impulsivity) or other learning disorders. Along with that depression and anxiety can occur (ADD/ADHD, anxiety, and depression are what I call \"The Magic Trifecta\", since they often occur together.) \n\nKeep in mind that NF is a neurological disorder, so often it will affect more than you may initially realize. I have to go to the eye doctor annually to check up on my lisch nodules (caused by NF) and to keep an eye on my vision, I take medicine and see a therapist for ADD, depression, and anxiety (which I assume is caused by the NF based on my own research, but it is possible that it is an unrelated issue \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f). I have had two tumors removed from bones in order to prevent fractures. It turns out those were not NF tumors, but it is hard for me to consider that unrelated. (Anyone else deal with Browns Tumors?)\n\nI have also noticed that my motor skills are not as sharp anymore. I drop things a lot, I trip a lot... I am generally less graceful than I used to be. I am way more easily confused and not quite as sharp-minded. I also recently discovered that those with NF are a little more succeptable to to cancers, so a healthy lifestyle is important. But, if I am honest, I am not at all healthy, so I cannot really tell you what to do there. But stress does not help!\n\nAnd I would not worry too much about a late diagnosis. NF can be passed on, or it can be a random genetic defect. It is likely that you have had this all of your life, but the symptoms were not noticeable or they were at least manageable. And now the diagnosis has come about because NF is progressive, so maybe now you are noticing symptoms that were not there earlier. That is what happened with my father, they did not even know he had NF until he was in his late 20s or 30s. \n\nAll things considered, I have a pretty happy life. I am 27 and I am slowly beginning to lose function in my right leg, and eventually it will become useless and I will have to get it amputated...so I worry about finding someone who would be willing to be with someone like that. I worry about the neurofibromas developing on the skin; my aunt and grandmother have them pretty severely. But you know, I am still luckier than some. And that is all I can really do to get by on the day's I feel down about NF.\n\nMy advice is this: find a neurologist who has experience working with patients with NF (not just from a book). They will be able to help you understand and maybe even manage your symptoms. This site has a list you can check out: \n\nAs much as this failed as a pep-talk, I wanted to reassure you that you are NOT alone in these symptoms or feelings! There is a whole community here ready to support and help you!  Thank you very much for your time and your reply. \nDo you have NF1 or NF2?   Curious as to the issues with your leg and possible amputation. What is the cause there? I have NF1. For the most part, my tumors have isolated themselves to my right leg. I think they said I have hundreds of small neurofibromas in my calf alone. And as time goes on, the tumors grow larger and spread out more. As they grow bigger, they block more nerves, eventually weakening the muscles surrounding it. So, some have started spreading into my ankle and foot, which has caused me to lose minor movement in my toes (I cannot bend them anymore). Eventually I will lose movement in my ankle, which would cause me to drag my foot and prevent me from walking correctly (and healthily!). Since the tumors have also spread behind my knee, the amputation would have to be a full leg amputation in order to get rid of the tumors, hopefully preventing them from spreading more in the future.  I (42F) have NF, I am a very strange case, being that my Neurofibroma tumour was most likely a result of a bully/childhood injury. That is what the biopsy came back as. Twice.  Anyway... I can totally relate to the Brian fog and when I am heavier (now) the pain is worse and the brain fog is worse. I came on here to find like minded (ha ha not funny huh) people with advice. I do not have a good dr, she is not very knowledgeable at all. My cancer dr spends very little time with me. Sends me for scans every three months to \u201cmake sure it does not spread into bone or blood\u201d anyway I tried to run again, used to love it, but my balance is off to the point I fall and or throw up. But my memory has diminished drastically in the last year. But bad for 6 to 7 yrs. I am beginning to be very self conscience over it. \n\nI am seeking treatment in another country in the next month. Good luck.  What country are you in now? I am in the US and still struggled to find a doctor that would spend adequate time to figure out what was going on. Finally found a good primary care guy that really cares. He sent me to a dermatologist that just so happened to have studied under a guy that specializes in NF. So he did a biopsy to confirm and to rule out leukemia.  Thankfully \u201cit was just NF\u201d as if it had been the later it would have been really bad. I would had a dermatologist do a biopsy before claiming it was probably a bad mole and bluntly told me it was most likely melanoma that I would ignored and we would be lucky to fight it but when the biopsy came back benign he did not say anything or offer up anything other than you got lucky. I never went to see that guy again. \n\nI am starting back tomorrow on the Keto diet as in the past it is helped me with weight and brain functions. \nI see a geneticist and a dermatologist. My primary care physician may send me to a neurologist later. I have not seen any cancer doctors thought I have had a couple of the neurofibromas checked to make sure all is clear. \n That is the better of the two diagnoses for sure! I live in the land of \u2018free\u2019 health care, Canada, Ontario. However that does not mean it is great care lol. The system is severely lacking and needs an over haul. There is a clinic in Mexico that I am in contact with. My tumour weaves under my skin down to my skull thru all my tissue and muscles. It is caused Bell\u2019s palsy type effects on my face and I was dismissed for so long because the mass had been there since I was 11 years old. It was a plastic surgeon that finally did a biopsy to appease me. And that took a year since our wait times in Canada are extensive for non-emergent care. I currently receive approximately 57 injections (botox) from my eyebrows to the bottom of the back of my skull. It costs me $750 every two months. Positive... my forehead has less wrinkles \ud83d\ude09. But for me it is very painful. Is it painful for you?  Certain ones can be. Have a small issue at the base of my skull that is bothersome at times. Another in my knee I believe but I cannot see it. There is a doctor In New York. Andre Panossian That has done some pretty amazing stuff. Check him on Facebook and see some of the work he is done.  Thanks for the info! I will look into him. \nHope you get feeling better! \nIt is a somewhat comforting feeling I am not alone. ", "Sensitivity to touch? Hey you all I am 23 and I was diagnosed back in 1997. I have a lot of tumors and being touched is overwhelming at times. This has made physical intimacy difficult because my partners think im delicate (very short and thin because of precocious puberty) how do yall deal with this? Hi! I am 38 (f) and was diagnosed with NF1 in 2011 but noticed the first tumor when I hit puberty around 1992-93. It was in the palm of my hand so it kept me from gripping things or catching things without extreme pain. Honestly I was a tough stubborn little shit and refused to let it hold me back except for playing baseball and high fiveing. I got used to the day to day pain and learned not to grimace and could hold back the tears when my hand would get grabbed or bumped. Over the years, 13 more tumors developed in my hand and arm. Honestly I have just gritted my teeth and suffered through the pain. Gloves help if I need to work with tools. For some reason if my hands are cold the pain is double. So I make sure to keep warm. \n\nI have had 13 tumors removed. Now I have 16 more tumors extending from my hand up into my elbow, sternum and also in my thigh. Throughout all of this I have stayed very physically active and I am into weightlifting. It seems like the more active I am and the more I push myself through the pain the less extreme it seems to be. \n\nEven though I have 13 tumors on the bottom side of my hand, wrist and in my elbow and bicep I can do push-ups and pull ups. If I quit doing those exercises for a couple months and then I try again the pain is really really bad until I push through it and then it seems to be a lot less and sometimes I do not even notice the pain. \n\nIf a tumor is causing me constant stabbing pain for no reason I softly rub the skin over it until it kind of becomes numb. Maybe this is bad and I am causing nerve damage but my physique is strong and I have minimal nerve damage which doctors say is from surgery anyway. For me this has made the pain something that I can work through. \n\nMy husband knows where my tumors are and makes an effort not to grab or put pressure on those areas. He forgets from time to time which sends my pain level from like a tolerable daily 2-4 to like an unbearable 10+. But I just try really hard to make sure my reaction is not as extreme as the pain I am feeling and kindly remind him.", "Cafe Au Lait marks disappearing? I used to have quite alot of cafe au lait marks across my body but now I only have one on each forearm and two bearly visible ones on my hips, I do not know why that is happened if its a good thing or a bad thing, has it happened to anyone else? I have mentioned it during Dr's visits and they have just just not to worry about it but I do not trust them in the slightest, if anyone knows why it is happened that would be great. My theory is as I have grown the skin has stretched and the colours in the marks faded/blended into my natural skin tone but idk how plausible that is. My spots have gotten lighter as I aged. I do not think any disappeared though. Totally normal and expected. \n\nThe cafe au lait macule (CALM)  will fade as we get older. \n\n\u201cTypical CALMs have a variable color, homogenous tone, and a smooth, regular border (Figs. 5.1 and 5.2). They also considerably vary in size, from a few millimeters to several centimeters. Their size increases in proportion with the growth of the child, and they take on a darker tone during childhood, before lightening again during adulthood. \u201d  \nExcerpt From: Gianluca Tadini. \u201cMultidisciplinary Approach to Neurofibromatosis Type 1.\u201d Apple Books.

Daaaaaamn!!", "Are antidepressant/mood stabilizers safe for people with NF?  Commenting because genuinely curious. Have a few issues that need looking into I read somewhere that they are likely to cause seizures \ud83d\ude2b Would it cause seizures in someone who has not has seizures before? Or does it have a tendency to cause seizures in people who have already had episodes? I do not remember, I just remember reading that people with NF should be cautious with antidepressant/mood stabilizers. One of my friends took antidepressants and she did not get seizures...I guess it is a coin toss with it. I apologize I could not be more help to you I take Lexapro and Trazadone.  (Also take the latter for sleep.)\n\nLexapro at 30mg (was at 10, then 20 for a long time but was recently bumped up) and Trazadone at 150mg. Depends on which one.  I know when I started them my phycologist gave me ones with low to no chance of seizures. I have been on desvlenlafaxine (SNRI Antidepressant) for several months now and have not had any NF related issues.  Not sure if you mean NF 1 or 2, but I have NF2 and have been taking antidepressants for years. Originally I started on Celexa/Citalopram when I was having panic attacks and was on that for a few years. \n\nThen I tried a few others (but ended up having allergic reactions). Currently I am on Wellbutrin. \n\nOther than the aforementioned allergies I have not had any adverse effects. Allergic reactions, you just stop and try something else.  I take trileptal, Seroquel and effexor.\n\nPreviously been on several other antidepressants.  No issues at all :) I am not sure if it makes a difference which type of NF that you are referring to but I have type 3 or Schwannomatosis and I have been on antidepressants and anxiety medication since before I was diagnosed in 2011 and have had no problems. I have had 6 schwannomas removed since 2011 including one in my head. My doctor switched me to Cymbalta as it is suppose to help with pain relief as well as being an antidepressant.   I used Latuda and prozac.....both were great and did not give me any issues. "]
